5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
60|$|LUCREZIA. And {{the white}} legs. I remember: <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> bathing.|$|E
60|$|STREPHON. <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{when you}} barged into {{us as we}} were dancing. She is four.|$|E
60|$|Warn. Sir, {{you forget}} yourself; <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{in your life}} before.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't want it," [...] he moaned; [...] "what's {{my little}} girl to <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>you</b> never will see her in your life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Crush it!" [...] she said. [...] "Here, where <b>you</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> crush it! Don't shrink {{under it}} like a woman. Tear it out; trample it under foot like a man!" ...|$|R
60|$|Hip. Since {{you will}} know, {{her name is}} Julia, sir, And that young gentleman <b>you</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>her</b> brother, Don Manuel de Torres.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would say}} so if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> at a lecture; and she is also gaining power of expressing and reproducing," [...] said Gillian.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aye! <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{when she}} was not happy,' said Martin, gazing at the fire again. 'If you had seen her in the old times, indeed--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Co-Tan," [...] he said, [...] "unstring your bow--these are my friends, and yours." [...] And to the Englishmen: [...] "This is Co-Tan. <b>You</b> who <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> save me from Schwartz know {{a part of}} what I owe her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Dolly!--I {{do think}} she passed quite half her time {{up at the}} beech-tree, where <b>you</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> looking if brother was not coming home. It is a cruel thing to a wife to have a truant husband!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too {{soon after}} dinner, my good fellow, for me. Play the first rubber, {{and then give}} me another chance. By-the-way," [...] he added [...] "Miss Silvester has been traced to Kirkandrew. How is it that <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> go by?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{as often}} as I do you would know. She hates you {{almost as much as}} me,--though she cannot show it so easily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We {{must come}} back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> return by the kitchen door, I presume?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, the Signora," [...] said Rushbrook, with {{undisturbed}} directness; [...] "well, <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> at Los Osos last summer. Likely she DID {{think you}} were me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't call it dissimulation. But {{of course}} a girl ought to hide her feelings. Don't {{you think it would}} have been better for her not to have looked so {{obviously}} out of humour when <b>you</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> the other night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's an actress: it's her profession. Don't you {{remember}} her {{that day at}} Peter's in Paris? She's already a celebrity; she has great talent; she's engaged at a theatre here and is making a sensation. As I tell <b>you,</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{is not of}} the {{slightest}} consequence; she will be very happy to have the honour of knowing <b>you.</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> in the dancing-room, but it is not worth while waiting to speak to her now. You shall receive an invitation the moment you are awake.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hip. Now, I {{suspect that}} love's the very thing, [...] That I feel too!--Pray tell me truly, sir, [...] Are you not grown unquiet since <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tired and miserable, poor heart. Years {{and years}} older than when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> last. Quite a staid, worn woman now. 'Tis the man--she can't stomach un, even now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, and {{you never}} will know enough of her to say such savage things as I do,' said Elizabeth, 'but at any rate <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> when she came in.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No,” said Tony with {{a visible}} effort. “Still, I think, Bernard—if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> much of <b>her</b> she would. You have both {{done a good}} deal for me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not." [...] Her pride {{rushed up}} in her. How could she ask this girl anything? She choked back that feeling, and said stonily: [...] "Do you {{remember}} my baby? No, of course; <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> HE and Count Rosek have just taken {{her away from}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a desperately {{inquisitive}} set," [...] cried Tom Collins, laughing. [...] "Could you not {{suppose that}} I {{wanted to give}} you a surprise, by shewing you how curiously she has been surrounded by houses since <b>you</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> You'll think nothing of it, now that I have told you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, as you {{did show}} it me," [...] pursued the Carrier, not minding him; [...] "and as <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> my wife, my wife that I love"--his voice, and eye, and hand grew steadier and firmer as he {{repeated}} these words: evidently in pursuance of a steadfast purpose--"as <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> at this disadvantage, it is right and just that you should also see with my eyes, and look into my breast, and know what my mind is upon the subject. For it's settled," [...] said the Carrier, regarding him attentively. [...] "And nothing can shake it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> petticoat, {{six inches}} deep in mud, I am {{absolutely}} certain; and the gown {{which had been}} let down to hide it not doing its office." ...|$|E
60|$|Ludlow {{escaped from}} it, {{and made his}} way to Mrs. Westley, in that remoter and quieter corner, which she seemed to find {{everywhere}} when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> out of her own house; there she was necessarily prominent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell <b>you</b> that I <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> do it. She {{stabbed him}} twice with a knife. She first {{helped me to}} rob him, and then she murdered him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Similarly, it {{was through}} Mr Lightwood that <b>you</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again, for <b>you</b> were {{with him on the}} night when my father was found, and so I found you with her on the next day. Since then, you have seen my sister often. You have seen my sister oftener and oftener. And I want to know why?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was here}} yesterday, with her ladyship; and I lunched there to-day. The letter came, you know, {{in time to}} stop the Merediths. They don't go till to-morrow, so you will meet them after all. Sir George is wild about it, but Lady Lufton would have <b>her</b> way. <b>You</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{in such a state}} as she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] {{answered}} her father, [...] "though her new duties {{do not leave}} Lucy as much her own mistress as I could wish. <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> and her brother, Miles, I take it for granted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ida {{would have}} come along if I'd let her," [...] he explained. [...] "I felt, however, I'd better make things clear to you before <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> We'll go {{straight}} to Wannop's office and have a little talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{lady of the}} {{brigantine}} forgot not her charge! <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> bright eye--her {{dark and}} meaning face! Light shone on that mysterious countenance--my words are true, Ludlow, thy tongue is silent, but that honest countenance confesses all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It wouldn't {{matter if}} he were as old as Adam. The thing {{is out of the}} question, and you must drop it.' Then the look on his brow became a little heavier. 'You hear what I say. She is going to marry Lord Nidderdale. She was engaged to him before <b>you</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> What do <b>you</b> expect to get by it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{some moments}} of silence {{he looked up}} and said, [...] "Richard, you admired and loved that {{beautiful}} girl when <b>you</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> Listen, if <b>you</b> wish it you shall have her for a wife. She is simple-minded, ignorant of the world, affectionate, and where she is told to love she will love. Batata's people will obey my wishes in everything." ...|$|R
60|$|My dear Mother Bunch was {{an entire}} {{contrast}} to Blot. Such a fat, cosey old mamma <b>you</b> never <b>saw,</b> and <b>her</b> first appearance was so funny, I {{never think of}} her without laughing.|$|R
