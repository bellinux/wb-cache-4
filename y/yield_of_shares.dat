The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the stocks that are formed in the optimal portfolio and the proportion of funds invested. The population in this study are all listed banking stocks and was active in Indonesia Stock Exchange, amounted to 28 shares. The method used in this study is the single index model. The result of calculation of the optimal stock portfolio using the single index model in banking shares the period March 2008 -December 2009, the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> that form an optimal stock portfolio is: BKSW, MAYA, BSWD, and BAEK with the proportion of funds amounting to 0, 1917239, 0, 8947158, 0, 259704, 0, 0086454. Return expectations of 0, 007528159 and the level of portfolio risk by 0, 0000456975. Thus, the purpose and formulation of the problem has been missed. From the research, then the conclusion can be drawn as follows: membentk optimal portfolio shares are shares that have ERBi value greater than the cut of rates (Ci). Banking stocks the period March 2008 - December 2009 which entered the optimal portfolio of 4 stocks that BKSW, MAYA, Baek and BSWD. The level of risk and return given the highest optimal portfolio shares owned by MAYA whereas the lowest level of risk and return of shares owned by Baek. Invesor should make decisions for selecting investments in shares of banking stocks included in the optimal stock portfolio, so as to maximize return with a certain risk level. From the conclusion above, it can be implied for the Banking Companies should improve the performance of its management so that investors interested to invest in his company. For further research should take stock of banking research at the same time period, so that later to compare the formation of an optimal portfolio is formed Keywords: Optimal Portfolios, Single Index Model, Banking Stocks...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether Australian firms use on-market share buybacks to deter unwanted takeover risk from the stock market. We found {{a statistically significant}} and positive relation between a firm’s ex-ante takeover probability and its on-market share buyback activities. The result is robust to alternative modelling techniques, namely TOBIT and Censored Quantile Regressions. This could be partly explained by Brown and O’day (2007) hypothesis on dividend payout, that in a non-classical taxation system like Australia, <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> buyback is positively related to dividend payments. However on-market share buyback activity {{is closely related to}} temporary cash flows rather than permanent operating cash flows.

40|$|Predators {{commonly}} share prey {{with human}} exploiters, intuitively {{suggesting that there}} is an inherent human-predator conflict through competition for prey. Here we studied the effects of fishing and predation mortality on biomass distributions and <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> prey using a size-structured model of competing populations, describing the life histories of Baltic Sea sprat and herring. Whereas both species responded in a similar fashion to increased fishing mortality, with decreasing juvenile and adult biomasses, we found that responses to predation mortality differed between species. Sprat only display weak compensatory responses with increasing predation mortality, while over a substantial range of mortalities there was a strong increase in adult (and total) herring biomass, i. e. overcompensation. The observed biomass overcompensation results from relaxed intraspecific competition as predation mortality increased, allowing for faster individual growth rates that in turn lead to a change in population composition (juvenile:adult biomass ratio). Our results suggest that the potential for biomass overcompensation is higher for species exhibiting substantial growth after maturation. Differences in size-selectivity of predators and fishing mortality resulted in a positive effect of predation mortality on fisheries yields, which can be explained by an overcompensatory response in adult herring biomass. Thus, somewhat counter intuitive, our results suggest that fishermen, depending on prey life history, may actually benefit from allowing for a higher abundance of predators, despite competing for shared prey...|$|R

The resulting data consists of log fluorescence ratios {{as a function of}} the genomic DNA location and provides a cytogenetic representation of the relative DNA copy number variation.

40|$|Samples of kukersite {{oil shale}} and pine wood and their {{mixtures}} were liquefied with water in supercritical state in an autoclave. Chosen conditions (380 ºC, 4 h) give synergy to desired direction in all feed compositions: <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> solid residue and gas with pyrogenetic water were lower 1. 7 – 2. 0 and 1. 4 – 2. 0 times, respectively, while the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> the most expected component of oil – benzene solubles was – 1. 5 – 1. 9 {{times higher than}} additive yields. Rise in co-liquefaction oil yields (y) resulted completely from {{the rise in the}} <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> the polar components and depended on the <b>share</b> <b>of</b> wood in feed (x) according to equation y = – 0. 0089 x 2 + 0. 6626 x + 34. 846 (R 2 0. 97) ...|$|R
