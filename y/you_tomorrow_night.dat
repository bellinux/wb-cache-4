40|$|Transcription begins]:STEWART FIELDNEWBURGH, NEW YORK Thursday 2030 Dearest Dottie, What a night. It’s about 20 below outside, {{the wind}} is a mild gale, too; gosh it’s cold. What a {{beautiful}} night to {{sit in front of}} a nice warm fire. The wind blows through these barracks like a seive [sic]. We had a fire going {{in the middle of the}} floor a while ago, but for some strange reason, Major Troop (commandant) didn’t appreciate its warmth. Odd fellow that. I just got back from a gruesome hour in the Link Trainer. I had a different teacher this time. This one was blonde, but engaged, so we had a lot to talk about. She’s getting married in March too. All we talked about was you and her husband-to-be. I didn’t get much Link Time in I guess. Well honey, I got paid today at last. Right after I’d smoked my last cigarette and spent my last dime, in fact I had had to borrow a nickel to do that; fine thing. I didn’t have the Cross-Country today,—the weather was bad. If it’s clear tomorrow I might have it then, but I’ll tell you all that tonight of [sic] the phone. Steve seems to be quite interested in Woody, he’s sorry he won’t be able to see her this weekend. Maybe she can come up for the air show on the 9 th. He’d like her to. Do you think you could come up, darling? I think Bobby 2 ̆ 6 Mom are, so you two could come up with them. We’re not going to fly in it, but there’s going to be about 70 B- 17 ’s, 2 ̆ 6 a mess of 24 ’s. In fact every ship the army has including the A- 26 2 ̆ 6 the J. P. ’s (Jet Propulsion). I want you to see the A- 26, honey. It’s the sweetest ship we have, in my opinion. Gosh if I could only fly one of those—oh well. I’m going to the P. X. to call you now, angel. See you later—I love you. It’s 9 : 30 now. Just got back from the P. X. Gosh it was swell to hear your voice darling, even if you did have a sore throat, and a sprained ankle. Everything happens to me. Steve is very aggravated now, he wants to know what the story is with Woody. I’ll find out for him this weekend. (I hope you don’t get this until Monday). Oh darling, I love you so much. It’s too good to be true, we’re going to have one whole day together, for a change. I’ll see <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night.</b> It seems good to think that this time tomorrow I’ll be with you. I love you, darling, with all my heart. As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins]STEWART FIELDNEWBURGH, NEW YORK 21 st Nov. 1100 Dearest Dottie, How do {{you like}} this G. D. weather? I’m getting mighty sick of sitting around, now. Two days in a row without flying is enough for me. We’re getting snow up here now, more slush than anything. If it ever freezes we won’t fly this week. It’s sort of hard to land a plane on ice, I hear. Darling, I’ll be seeing <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night.</b> It seems too good to be true. Gosh I’ve missed you these past two days, even more than usual. I think of you all the time, how sweet and lovely you are, how happy we’ll be after this thing is over, when we can be together, always. Gosh if only this war could end tomorrow, now, immediately. Well, the harder the struggle, the greater the victory. But I’m not {{fighting}} very hard. I feel so helpless and unimportant in this war. That’s one reason why I’ve got to go over, and do what little I can. I’m getting damned sick of sitting around, training 2 ̆ 6 training. It seems so unfair to the others, the ones in the stinking fox holes in Europe, the jungles and bomb rotted islands of the Pacific, the terrible cold of the Aleutians 2 ̆ 6 Russia. Well maybe I won’t have to wait too much longer, and I can go over and win the war, for us. I called Mom last night. She sounded quite happy. I think she’s beginning to see it our way. I know she will, darling. She’s not really selfish, she just thinks I’m too young, but that will be fixed quick, don’t worry. If God is willing, I’m going to marry you in March (of course, if you’re willing, too). Steve and I were talking about Gini, and marraige [sic]. He doesn’t want to marry her, not yet anyhow. She’s too childish. He’s counting on her growing up while he’s in the Army, but I’m afraid he’s going to be disappointed. There’s only one thing that can make a childish girl grow up, and that’s a boy. And if I know Gini, there won’t be many boys in her life while Steve is gone. She sure is a kid though, I even think she believes that the stork brought her. No kiddin’ from what Steve says it sounds pretty pitiful. Oh, by the way, Steve is coming down Saturday, for a date with Woody. I doubt if we can go to New York, however. He’s got 11 2 ̆ 6 I have about 12, so we’ll have to take it easy. This money situation is really bad. I’ll see you Wednsday [sic] darling, tomorrow, that is, it sounds closer that way. Give my best to your family. I love you darling, with all my heart.

A/C Judson ClarkSqdrn. 5, Class 45 -ACadet DetachmentStewart Field, New York Thursday Dearest Judson— Honey, I’m {{so sorry}} {{that the last}} letter was so short. I was so tired last night. What a dream I had. All about Jackie 2 ̆ 6 the fellow {{she was married to}} {{and the rest of the}} models. There was so much {{confusion}} about getting to that wedding. Jackie really looked lovely she was so happy. It was a queer wedding though—Jackie was so nonchant [sicsic] 2 ̆ 6 laughing. That’s something I don’t think I’ll do. Golly, honey, I kept wishing you were there. Wonder what our wedding will be like, hon. Golly, March seems so far away. It’s awful. March is so far or have I said that a few thousand times. It seems even farther because there isn’t any definite date—I can’t count the weeks or day—just months. Tonight the fellow’s going to take the pictures again. Hope they’re better this time. Golly, honey, it seems as though everyone should know by now that we’re getting engaged. Corinne is saying how wonderful Dick is. She thinks he’s a perfect husband 2 ̆ 6 I think you’ll be much better than he. We have long discussions on how good a husband our various friend[s] would be. You’ll be better than any of them. I hope that I’ll be home when you call tonight. It’s going to be very confusing because I’m not sure what time he’ll be through taking those pictures. Well, honey, please call me Friday if you get home, don’t forget. That would be wonderful. Well, honey, time out for lunch now. I’ll write more when I get home—I mean back here from lunch—I love you…. Hi, honey, well, I’m back from lunch. What an hour that was. Just after I had finished my shopping 2 ̆ 6 was going back to work I passed some perfume in Macy’s that mother loves. Well, I got her a large bottle of the stuff, personally I think it’s awful but she likes it. Just as I was leaving the counter the bag broke or something and the bottle of perfume crashed to the floor. I thought that maybe it hadn’t broken but when I picked it up, it poured out of the box. What a mess. Anyway, I couldn’t find any wastebasket to throw it in so it got all over my clothes 2 ̆ 6 umbrella and my boots 2 ̆ 6 hands. Now I can still smell the stuff 2 ̆ 6 it’s awful. No one will come near me. I washed 2 ̆ 6 washed but the water just makes the perfume come out more. Well, honey, maybe I’ll see <b>you</b> <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night.</b> It would be so nice to have you come home for a whole day for a change. I love you so, darling. You’re so sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful all the time. Golly, honey, I miss you so. Well, honey, I can’t write any more now. I’ll try to write when I get home but I don’t know if I’ll be able to. I have a sore throat now 2 ̆ 6 a terrific headache from that blasted perfume. Please write soon, darling. I love you so. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E

5000|$|Swedish {{literary}} critic Victor Malm (Sydsvenskan) wrote of See <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and Attack From All Sides: “Renberg's novels are of international excellence ... See <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is a wild, compassionate, first-rate thriller ... The second volume, Attack From All Sides, {{has also been}} published in Norwegian, {{and it is just}} as good ... The penmanship, the personification and the abundantly idiomatic dialogue make See <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> and Attack From All Sides brilliantly realistic prose, not just within Scandinavia, but among the international elite.” Expressen (Sweden) wrote “Tore Renberg is one of this year's most brightly shining stars ... It is an incredibly good novel … See <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is an achievement of technical power. In vital, maximalist prose, the characters' perspectives change in a weaving movement, slowly taking us to an amazing crescendo. The tone feels new, fresh and heartfelt.” Stephanie Boland (The Quietus) wrote of See You Tomorrow: “aspects of the novel seem utterly ordinary, but taken in its behemoth whole, it dazzles ... See <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> is as boundary crossing as its author: defying easy genre designations, it centres around a crime story, but tempers its grit with romance, humour and a generous dose of pop culture.” In Denmark, Kristeligt Dagblad called See <b>You</b> <b>tomorrow</b> a “wonderful novel” - and you devour it in huge, greedy gulps.”, and The Danish Information wrote “It is wild, but also wildly funny... It is fantastic! ... Realistic? Probably not, but insanely fun, and insanely well executed”. Jyllands-Posten awarded the novel five out of six stars and wrote “Renberg takes charge on the continent with See <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> A book that involves both bursts of laughter and compassion… a joyful display of literary expression.” ...|$|R

A couple of years later it became the start of what became See <b>You</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> Sandra is a Christian, she is upper middle-class, and she has never in her life told a lie or dared to break any rules, let alone laws.
