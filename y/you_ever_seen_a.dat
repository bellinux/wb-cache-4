The New York Times noted Merman sang [...] "with dash, authority, good voice {{and just the}} right knowing style", while The New Yorker called her [...] "imitative of no one."

2500|$|As {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for animal rights, Linda lent her support to many organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the Council for the Protection of Rural England, and Friends of the Earth. She was also a patron of the League Against Cruel Sports. She narrated a TV advertisement for PETA, in which she said: [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> fish gasping for breath when you {{take it out of}} the water? They’re saying, ‘Thanks a lot for killing me. It feels great, you know.’ No! It hurts!" [...] After her death, PETA created the Linda McCartney Memorial Award.|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 1995, {{while she}} was a student of {{aeronautics}} at the Technion {{as part of the}} academic reserve, Alice Miller appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court after being turned down for the pilot selection phase in the Israeli Air Force flight academy. Following her appeal, Israeli president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, made chauvinistic comments that ridiculed the idea of women as fighter pilots: [...] "Listen maideleh, have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> man knitting socks? Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> female surgeon or a female being a conductor of an orchestra? Women are not able to withstand the pressures required for fighter pilots." [...] The Israeli Supreme Court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller did not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in the IDF. Following the petition, formerly all-male military units began accepting women, including the Israeli Air Force flight academy, the Israeli navy officers' course, various artillery courses, the Israeli air defense [...] and the Israeli Border Police. The Equality Amendment to the Military Service law, enacted in January 2000, completed the Supreme Court ruling as it defined the right of female soldiers to volunteer for combat professions. This law stated that [...] "The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men." [...] The amendment drafted by female lawmakers granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was [...] "suitable" [...] was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
