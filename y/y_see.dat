2500|$|A {{form of the}} epsilon–delta {{definition}} of continuity was first given by Bernard Bolzano in 1817. Augustin-Louis Cauchy defined continuity of [...] as follows: an infinitely small increment [...] of the independent variable x always produces an infinitely small change [...] of the dependent variable <b>y</b> (<b>see</b> e.g., Cours d'Analyse, p.34). Cauchy defined infinitely small quantities in terms of variable quantities, and his {{definition of}} continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today (see microcontinuity). The formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and uniform continuity were first given by Bolzano in the 1830s but the work wasn't published until the 1930s. Like Bolzano, Karl Weierstrass denied continuity of a function at a point c unless it was defined at and {{on both sides of}} c, but Édouard Goursat allowed the function to be defined only at and on one side of c, and Camille Jordan allowed it even if the function was defined only at c. All three of those nonequivalent definitions of pointwise continuity are still in use. Eduard Heine provided the first published definition of uniform continuity in 1872, but based these ideas on lectures given by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in 1854.|$|E

2500|$|There are exceptions, however. For example, the platypus {{relies on}} an XY sex-determination {{system based on}} five pairs of {{chromosomes}}. Platypus sex chromosomes in fact appear to bear a much stronger homology (similarity) with the avian Z chromosome, and the SRY gene so central to sex-determination in most other mammals is apparently not involved in platypus sex-determination. Among humans, some men have two Xs and a <b>Y</b> ("XXY", <b>see</b> Klinefelter syndrome), or one X and two <b>Ys</b> (<b>see</b> XYY syndrome), and some women have three Xs or a single X instead of a double X ("X0", see Turner syndrome). [...] There are other exceptions in which SRY is damaged (leading to an XY female), or copied to the X (leading to an XX male). For related phenomena, see Androgen insensitivity syndrome and Intersex.|$|R
