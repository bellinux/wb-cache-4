Under his leadership, the AFL-CIO lobbied vigorously for its goals. He backed the two party system, and believed in [...] "supporting <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> punishing your enemies." [...] A cultural conservative, Meany ridiculed a 1972 proposal for same-sex marriage.|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} about the {{changing}} face of comedy, The Atlantic Monthly said that it [...] "may be the funniest film in a decade". Michael Medved gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "...simultaneously hilarious and cringe-inducing, full of ingenious bits that you'll want to describe to <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> then laugh all over again when you do." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{continued}} Lynette's cancer storyline, which Cherry {{intended to}} be both emotional and comical. He notes, [...] "we established from very early on that she's suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, so we never once let the audience think she's going to die. It's more about examining how <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family react to you when you're sick." [...] "We don't want to do some ridiculous she-might-die thing. That's not our point {{in dealing with the}} disease. It was mostly to see what being sick does to you and the people around you." ...|$|E

500|$|Around this time, Bubbles and Jackson were {{photographed by}} Kenny Rogers for his book, <b>Your</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>and</b> Mine. The photo shows Bubbles held on Jackson's hip, {{and has been}} cited {{as one of the}} best taken of Jackson. In the black and white photograph, Bubbles is dressed casually in a long sleeved shirt and overalls. Jackson is also dressed casually; he wears jeans and a simple shirt. Rogers said: [...] "Bubbles was so human it was almost frightening. He would take Christopher [...] by the hand, walk over to the refrigerator, open it, take out a banana and hand it to him. Christopher was amazed... we all were." ...|$|E
500|$|For his stylistic {{influences}} {{for playing}} drums, Mark references Stewart Copeland of The Police who he [...] "always thought ... {{had a really}} good style", Neil Peart of Rush, John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, and Keith Moon of The Who. Following the release of The Fiction We Live, then screaming vocalist Perri explained that the lyrics he was writing for the forthcoming album (Abandon Your Friends) would feature lyrics that were inspired by Billy Joel, stating that they were [...] "billyjoelesque" [...] because [...] "they’re more straightforward, not what I’m thinking, what I’m feeling, instead of poetry and shit". However, it is unclear whether the lyrics were used on the album, as was revealed by Mark in 2007, that Perri had not contributed to Abandon <b>Your</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>and</b> it was Mark who had ghostwritten the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|During the {{pregnancy}} storyline, Martha was also {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E
500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with <b>your</b> <b>friends,</b> <b>and</b> even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers can, you know, relate to it. And it's basically because you just {{want to go out and}} have fun with <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> sometimes, you know, go out dancing and let loose once in a while." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2007, Reznor made a {{post on the}} {{official}} Nine Inch Nails website skeptical of Universal Music Group (parent company of Nine Inch Nails' record label, Interscope Records) for their pricing and distribution plans for Year Zero. He labeled the company's retail pricing of Year Zero in Australia as [...] "ABSURD", concluding that [...] "as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off". Reznor {{went on to say}} that he hated Interscope, and in later years the [...] "climate" [...] of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent impact on consumers who buy music. Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention. In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on UMG at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to [...] "steal" [...] his music online instead of purchasing it legally. Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to [...] "steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> keep on stealing".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9.5/10, writing [...] "This wasn't {{just a good}} episode – it was great. It {{capitalized}} on absolutely every scrap of promise the show has had in its first nine episodes. Tell <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> neighbors, they're probably {{going to want to}} tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] could have been used as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have to do is keep it up".|$|E

500|$|On 3 July 1986, {{just before}} the start of the {{recording}} sessions for The Joshua Tree, Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident while on a courier run. A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly. The event shocked the entire band; drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "his death really rocked us – it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed." [...] Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it all the more difficult to deal with." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton described it as [...] "a very sobering moment", saying, [...] "it inspired the awareness that there are more important things than rock 'n' roll. That your family, <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> indeed the other members of the band – you don't know how much time you've got left with them." [...] Bono said, [...] "it was a devastating blow. He was doing me a favour. He was taking my bike home." [...] He later commented, [...] "it brought gravitas to the recording of The Joshua Tree. We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much." [...] Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the traditional Māori manner at Kai-iwi Marae near Whanganui, Carroll's hometown. Bono sang [...] "Let It Be" [...] and [...] "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" [...] for him at the funeral.|$|E
