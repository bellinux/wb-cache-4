[...] Jesse Fairfax of HipHopDX said, [...] "Neither timeless nor immediately disposable, Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me</b> is an above average outing that displays why he's steadily remained within the public eye without having a long line of record-breaking hits." [...] Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReviews.com said, [...] "Rick Ross' Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me</b> is fun to listen to." [...] Paul A.

6000|$|This morning, my dear Augusta, I {{received}} your affectionate letter, [...] and {{it reached}} me {{at a time}} when I wanted consolation, not however of [...] your kind for I am not yet old enough or Goose enough to be in love; [...] no, my sorrows are of a different nature, though more calculated to [...] provoke risibility than excite compassion. You must know, Sister of [...] mine, that I am the most unlucky wight in Harrow, perhaps in [...] Christendom, and am no sooner out of one scrape than into another. And [...] to day, this very morning, I had a thundering Jobation from our Good [...] Doctor, [1] which deranged my nervous system, for at least five [...] minutes. But notwithstanding He and I now and then disagree, yet upon [...] the whole we are very good friends, for there is so much of the [...] Gentleman, so much mildness, and nothing of pedantry in his character, [...] that I cannot help liking him, and will remember his instructions with [...] gratitude as long as I live. He leaves Harrow soon, apropos, so do [...] I. This quitting will be a considerable loss to the school. He is the [...] best master we ever had, {{and at the same time}} respected and feared; [...] greatly will he be regretted by all who know him. You tell me you [...] don't know my friend L'd Delawarr; he is considerably <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> [...] but the most good tempered, amiable, clever fellow in the universe. To [...] all which he adds the quality (a good one in the eyes of women) of [...] being remarkably handsome, almost too much so for a boy. He is at [...] present very low in the school, not owing to his want of ability, but [...] to his years. I am nearly at the top of it; by the rules of our [...] Seminary he is under my power, but he is too goodnatured ever to [...] offend me, and I like him too well ever to exert my authority over [...] him.

When {{you read this}} I shall have passed away, so [...] that I need not be {{hampered}} now by that reserve which I feel has [...] grown upon me through a long and self-contained life. Your mother [...] was very dear to me.

[...] You knew her sweetness and high quality, so I need say nothing of [...] these; but I should like you to understand that she was very dear to [...] me. When she and your father came to know and love each other I was [...] far away, opening up a new branch of business in the interior of [...] China, and it was not for several months that I got home news. When [...] I first heard of him they had already been married. I was delighted [...] to find that they were very happy. They needed nothing that I could [...] give. When he died so suddenly I tried to comfort her, and all I had [...] was at her disposal, did she want it. She was a proud woman--though [...] not with me. She had come to understand that, though I seemed cold [...] and hard (and perhaps was so generally), I was not so to her. But [...] she would not have help of any kind. When I pressed her, she told me [...] that she had enough for your keep and education and her own [...] sustenance for the time she must still live; that your father and she [...] had agreed that you should be brought up to a healthy and strenuous [...] life rather than to one of luxury; and she thought that it would be [...] better for the development of your character that you should learn to [...] be self-reliant and to be content with what your dear father had left [...] you. She had always been a wise and thoughtful girl, and now all her [...] wisdom and thought were for you, your father's and her child. When [...] she spoke of you and your future, she said many things which I [...] thought memorable. One of them I remember to this day. It was [...] apropos of my saying that there is a danger of its own kind in [...] extreme poverty. A young man might know too much want. She answered [...] me: [...] "True! That is so!
