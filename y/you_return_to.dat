25|$|The {{story was}} recounted in Ibn Ishaq's Sīrah. On {{his way to}} murder Muhammad, Umar met his best friend Nua'im bin Abdullah who had {{secretly}} converted to Islam but had not told Umar. When Umar informed {{him that he had}} set out to kill Muhammad, Nua'im said, “By God, you have deceived yourself, O Umar! Do you think that Banu Abd Manaf would let you run around alive once you had killed their son Muhammad? Why don't <b>you</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> your own house and at least set it straight?”.|$|E

500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can {{put you in a}} different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If <b>you</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> that same square, the die may be in a different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} mild {{but generally}} positive reviews during its initial release in North America. GamePro magazine praised the game's originality and overall design but found fault with the visual {{presentation of the}} title, stating [...] "although this game has an interesting concept, the sluggish game play and average graphics may make <b>you</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the caves." [...] The publication also found the background music lacking, stating the game's compositions ranged from [...] "soothing" [...] to [...] "annoying". Nintendo Power {{called attention to the}} game's ingenuity and theme, remarking that [...] "he idea of this game is great and the weird creatures you can evolve can be both bizarre and hilarious." [...] However, the magazine felt the game's representation of the concept of evolution was too fanciful, also stating the process of obtaining power-up items being [...] "tedious". Nintendo Power would later give the game an honorable mention during its [...] "Top Titles of 1993" [...] awards segment {{as one of the most}} innovative games of the year.|$|E

2500|$|Zeshin later studied {{under other}} great {{artists of the}} Kyoto school, {{including}} Maruyama Ōkyo, Okamoto Toyohiko, and Goshin. Though he would later be known primarily for his work with lacquers, Zeshin excelled at traditional ink painting, and produced many works of traditional subjects such as tigers and waterfalls. Though Japanese masters (sensei) are often quite egotistical and arrogant before their students, one of Zeshin's teachers is reputed to have made the comment that [...] "just as you cannot appreciate the size of Mt. Fuji while standing upon it, so you cannot truly appreciate my skill and reputation while in Kyoto; when <b>you</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Edo you will realize my incredible import and your great fortune in having studied under me."

He told Yu Fan {{that he heard}} that many ministers in the Han imperial court in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) {{had the impression that}} Jiangdong had no talents, so he wanted to send Yu Fan there to meet them and prove them wrong. He also considered sending Zhang Hong, but he still preferred Yu Fan. Yu Fan refused and said, [...] "I'm like one of your treasured possessions. You might lose me if you show me to others and they want me. That's why I don't want to go there."

2500|$|In 1941, Eppley was {{activated}} {{from the}} Army Reserve at {{the rank of}} colonel, and {{was assigned to the}} office of the Army Chief of Staff. After the conclusion of the Second World War, university president Harry C. Byrd urgently requested Eppley's return as dean in 1945, saying, [...] "You are absolutely essential to the successful operation of the university and if the university is an essential unit in our state and national existence, then it is certainly essential that <b>you</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> us." [...] The school was experiencing a large influx in students as discharged veterans pursued their education under the G.I. Bill, and it strained the university's logistics. The enrollment of many wounded veterans increased the need for handicapped access, and the sheer number of students meant dining facilities required waits of up to an hour. Also, the disproportionate number of male students to females created disciplinary problems. In 1947, Eppley wrote to the assistant dean of women in the defense of some fraternity brothers who had broken into a sorority, but conceded that [...] "the drinking problem on the university campus is a little worse than usual due to the aftermath of the war." ...|$|E
