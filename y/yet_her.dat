5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Scully is hopeful about reuniting with her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) when a complete stranger offers new information about what drove him into hiding. <b>Yet</b> <b>her</b> trust in the stranger may place Mulder in even more danger, for the man {{turns out to be}} a super soldier.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{finding the}} girl, the bishop summoned his council and it {{decided that the}} girl should be immured in {{the wall of the}} chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was starved to death. The {{builders}} left a cavity into the wall and the poor girl with a piece of bread and a mug of water was walled in. For some time her cries for help were heard. <b>Yet</b> <b>her</b> soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E

25|$|Brunson has {{attributed}} his cure to {{the prayers}} of friends {{of his wife and}} their correspondence with Kathryn Kuhlman, a self-proclaimed Christian faith healer. Louise developed a tumor shortly afterwards and, when she went for surgery, her tumor was also found to have disappeared. In 1975, their daughter Doyla was diagnosed with scoliosis, <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> spine straightened completely within three months.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the winning}} time of Egerszegi (2:07.83) {{and time of}} the runner-up Whitney Hedgepeth (2:11.98), the margin of victory was 4.15 seconds, which is the {{greatest}} in any women's 200 m event in the swimming history. In 1996, Egerszegi did not enter the 100 m backstroke, <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> leadoff backstroke time in the medley relay, 1:01.15, was faster than the winning time in the 100 m backstroke final.|$|E
25|$|Erika is very {{demanding}} towards Hilde in wanting answers; Hilde is her daughter's only tie to personal history. Erika can not discover her heritage {{without the aid}} of her mother, <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> mother wants to forget her painful past and move on to a better future. Erika seems fascinated with the past and the liberation of the female voice while Hilde is engrossed with silencing herself and moving forward.|$|E

25|$|The last {{eleven years}} of Pound's life accentuated his eccentricities, {{including}} a self-imposed vow of near-silence, with which Rudge coped while completely arranging {{his life and}} acting as his secretary. Many scholars and students sought Pound out and would arrive at the small house. Rudge devised a test to distinguish the genuine from the merely curious. She would ask the prospective visitor to recite a line from one of Pound's works; those who could gained admittance, {{those who could not}} were shown out. For Rudge, life with Pound was not easy; <b>yet,</b> <b>her</b> belief in him was absolute.|$|E
25|$|Captain Ralph Crewe, {{a wealthy}} English widower, enrolls his young {{daughter}} Sara, {{who had been}} living in India, at Miss Minchin's boarding school for girls in London, to prepare her for a life in high society. Crewe dotes on his daughter so much that he orders and pays the headmistress for special treatment and exceptional luxuries for Sara, such as a private room for her with a personal maid and a separate sitting room (see Parlour boarder), along with Sara's own private carriage and a pony. Miss Minchin openly fawns over Sara for her money, but secretly and jealously despises her for her wealth. Miss Minchin's younger sister, Amelia, is kindhearted <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> will is weak.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is about}} {{survival}} at all costs against a seemingly invincible foe. Shade's increasing lack of humanity is a constant threat to the reader and characters in the book. Ninde and Gold-Eye's growing relationship throughout the story is a touching account of love against adversity. In contrast to this, Drum and Ella are more serious about the situation they are in. However, they are constantly supporting each other and provide comfort {{at the end of}} the novel. Ella is a strong leader, <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> respect for her teammates, especially Ninde, grows considerably during the book's events. One interesting literary device are the interludes between the chapters. They add to the book's depth, provide the readers with extra information and sometimes reveal events elsewhere. For instance, when the Sub is attacked by creatures, the interlude is part of the training session for creature attacks. All interludes are taken from Shade's computer archive.|$|E

500|$|In {{developing}} Martha Logan's character, the show's writers drew {{upon the}} historic {{example of a}} prominent whistleblower in the Watergate scandal, Martha Beall Mitchell. [...] Similar to the real-life model, Martha Logan becomes contemptuous of her husband's conduct in office and decides to go public and end his career. [...] Martha Logan takes part in a plot to get her husband to confess that he conspired with terrorists. <b>Yet</b> <b>her</b> mental health problems undermine her credibility and raise the possibility that she may be forced into treatment at an inpatient facility. After {{the events of the}} fifth season she was committed to a mental health facility.|$|E
500|$|Memling {{left out}} the rays of light, as did Dieric Bouts in his Getty Annunciation, yet the room is bright, filled with sunlight, a fenestra incarnationis, {{which would have been}} an {{adequate}} symbol for the contemporary viewer. By the mid-15th century the Virgin is found depicted in a room or chamber near an open window to permit the passage of light. Memling's room, with its window through which light streams, is a most [...] "decorous sign of Mary's chastity", according to Blum. There are no word scrolls or banderoles to indicate the Virgin's acceptance, <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> consent is obvious through her pose, which seems, according to Sterling, both submissive and active.|$|E
500|$|A women's lodge {{existed in}} Boston {{during the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century. Hannah Mather Crocker, in an apology for Freemasonry written in 1815, claims to have presided over such a lodge, <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> description, [...] "founded on the {{original}} principles of true ancient masonry, as far as was consistent with the female character" [...] leaves the actual constitution open to question. It is also clear that St. Anne's lodge was extinct at the time of her writing about it. Crocker’s leadership of this exclusively female Masonic lodge stands as an alternative to historical frameworks that emphasize the formal political exclusion and public silencing of women in the development of republican, liberal political practice in the West.|$|E

500|$|Walter Scott noted Austen's [...] "resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much {{of modern}} fiction – 'the ephemeral {{productions}} which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries'". <b>Yet</b> <b>her</b> rejection of these genres is complex, as evidenced by Northanger Abbey and Emma. Similar to William Wordsworth, who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the [...] "Preface" [...] to his Lyrical Ballads (1800), Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his, and she shows [...] "that rhetorically less is artistically more." [...] She eschewed popular Gothic fiction, stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location, a castle or abbey (32 novels between 1784 and 1818 contain the word [...] "abbey" [...] in their title). Yet in Northanger Abbey she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody, Austen transforms the genre, juxtaposing reality, with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts, against the heroine's [...] "novel-fueled" [...] desires. Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction: instead she transforms settings and situations, such that the heroine is still imprisoned, <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> imprisonment is mundane and real – regulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom. In Sense and Sensibility Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction, according to critic Keymer, who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction, [...] "Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress." ...|$|E
500|$|Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, {{together}} under the stage name Stargate, wrote and produced the song with additional writing by Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench and Makeba Riddick. The song was written in Bangladesh, Patchwerk and Silent Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in 2008. Knowles worked with Amanda Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] after having co-written [...] "Disappear" [...] in London. She stated that the song {{was one of the}} most personal on the album. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that Knowles' references to rapper Jay-Z are usually unclear and open to interpretation, <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> music, including [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "is the one place she can be incredibly expressive". Knowles and Ghost both liked Schubert's song and walked down the aisle to the song during their respective weddings. The marriages of the artists inspired them to write their own version of the recording. She further discussed the lyrics and inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|When Jenny is {{introduced}} on-screen she arrives in Los Angeles {{to stay with}} her boyfriend Tim Haspel (Eric Mabius). Tim is described as the person who makes Jenny [...] "feel the safest in the world". She soon becomes aware her neighbors Tina Kennard (Laurel Holloman) and Bette Porter (Jennifer Beals) are lesbians. Kirshner said that Jenny becomes intrigued by lesbians and attends their party. They introduce her to Marina Ferrer (Karina Lombard), she senses that Jenny wants some danger in her life. When Marina kisses her, Jenny sees her life going into a tailspin and forces her to reckon with herself. Jenny acknowledges her passion for Marina, but realizes that being unfaithful will ruin [...] "the one stable relationship she's ever had". However, they begin an affair. In the show's companion book [...] "The L Word: Welcome to our planet", they describe Jenny's confusion as leaving her [...] "unmoored". She was alone in battling the heartache, along with facing [...] "an overwhelming identity crisis" [...] in a place that was not <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> home.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{retrospective}} of both Rachel and of Baxendale's performance when the series ended. In the New Statesman, Andrew Billen wrote that Rachel [...] "was as near to a sex symbol as this comedy drama about six cold-footed yuppies produced. She was also materialistic, unfaithful, self-absorbed, tricky {{and had not}} the first clue about men [...] <b>Yet</b> <b>her</b> death, caused by a moment of carelessness behind the wheel, was powerful and shocking, {{a tribute to the}} extent to which we have invested and believed in her." [...] Observer critic Kathryn Flett noted that Baxendale's high-profile role in Friends made her the [...] "star" [...] of Cold Feet in the first series, but both she and Rachel had been [...] "eclipsed" [...] by the other actors and characters by the time of the final series. Spectator critic Simon Hoggart wrote, [...] "I wasn't as sorry about poor old Rachel as I should have been. It was one of those deaths which makes you think, 'Oh, her poor baby boy,' rather than 'Goodness, how we'll miss her.'" [...] Hoggart attributed his ambivalence to Baxendale's portrayal of the character as a [...] "fraught, snippy" [...] woman. Matt Greenhalgh, who co-wrote the episode featuring Rachel's death, called killing off the character [...] "a privilege".|$|E
500|$|Ruby Buckton is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Rebecca Breeds. She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 20 June 2008. Ruby {{was created by}} executive producer Cameron Welsh. When she was first introduced she appeared to hide her problems and pretends to be strong. She was characterised as a free spirited and independent girl. Her storylines have consistently followed themes such as romance, unrequited love and rejection. In what {{has been described as}} a [...] "shock storyline" [...] Ruby discovered her sister Charlie Buckton was in fact her mother. This had subsequent effects in her character development. She became out of place and confused about her life. It destroyed her trust in Charlie and their relationship never recovered. Ruby went on a journey of self-discovery and used men to redefine herself. Her relationship with Xavier Austin was characterised through their mutual friendship, which ended through lack of passion. She controversially fell in love with her music teacher Liam Murphy, the pair shared an emotional and creative connection through music. <b>Yet,</b> <b>her</b> advances were unrequited and it created problems with her state of mind and began binge drinking. Breeds felt the storyline differed to her romance with Xavier, as it showed Ruby [...] "headstrong and unconfined". Breeds felt they were ill-suited to one another.|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} the D.Gray-mans cast, Sandra Scholes referred to Lenalee as the [...] "rational one" [...] and commented on her varied personality. In {{one of the}} anime's original episodes not featured in the manga, Scholes found her favorite was the one where Lenalee is apparently on a date <b>yet</b> <b>her</b> companion {{turns out to be}} an Akuma who considers her to be attractive which results in a funny episode. Kimberly Morales of Animation Insider commented on Lenalee's tragic backstory noting she was forced to join the Black Order organization, but her reunion with her brother Komui became [...] "paramount to her character". Morales also praised how Lenalee and Allen work together on a mission to help Miranda Lotto, who has a poor life, but thanks to the duo becomes a better person. Luci Christian's work as Lenalee's English voice actress was also complimented by Morales. Lenalee's new type of Innocence was well received by Chris Zimmerman of the Comic Book Bin who liked how how she accepted the powers she previously hated in order to assist Allen Walker in his fight against the 4th Level Akuma who was attacking the Black Order. This led to an appealing fight sequence which Zimmerman felt was a satisfactory end to the story arc. Manga News was more critical stating that the reason the Level 4 Akuma was defeated {{was the result of a}} power up in Lenalee.|$|E
