500|$|Patton chose Steve Henry, {{a surgeon}} and county {{commissioner}} from Louisville, {{as his running}} mate. His major opposition in the Democratic primary came from secretary of state Bob Babbage and President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate John [...] "Eck" [...] Rose. Although sitting governor Brereton Jones did not officially endorse Patton, Rose referred to Jones as Patton's [...] "mentor". Rose charged that, like Jones, Patton would not take a hard stand on the issues; referring to a nickname given to Jones in the 1991 campaign, Rose remarked [...] "If you have liked Jell-O Jones, then <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in a position to}} love Puddin' Paul Patton." [...] Particularly odious to Rose was that Patton had publicly supported collective wage bargaining for public employees, but had declared that he would not fight for it in the upcoming 1996 legislative session. Though Babbage and Rose were political veterans and solid campaigners, Patton won 152,203votes in the primary, well over the 40percent needed to avoid a runoff. Babbage ran second with 81,352votes and Rose was third with 71,740votes. Two other candidates split the remaining 33,344votes.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, good-girl Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone {{for the rest of your}} life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E

At {{the very end of the}} [...] "hunger winter" [...] in April 1945, Seyss-Inquart was with difficulty persuaded by the Allies to allow airplanes to drop food for the hungry people of the occupied north-west of the country.

2500|$|Art Miller dismisses {{concerns}} that the perp walk prejudices the jury pool: [...] "This is not Napoleonic justice where the judge is the fact finder, prosecutor and jury.

And {{no matter who you}} are, if you have been arrested for something, it is understood <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subject to all the scrutiny the press is going to give you." [...] Israeli researcher Boudana admits that, on a purely informational level, the perp walk itself is harmless. [...] "Indeed, from the moment when the press releases the names of suspects and the motive for their arrest, the persons are identifiable and their presumption of innocence seems to be already compromised," [...] she observes. In a Slate on public shaming as punishment, Emily Bazelon wrote that Americans have become too accustomed to perp walks for them to have any stigmatizing effect. [...] " [...] become part of the wallpaper of the American criminal justice system," [...] she wrote.|$|E

The Baltimore Sun states that Angelou [...] "uses remembered meals and dishes as a prism through which to view her own life, its turning points and its intersections with the lives of others". The essays focus on events, paired with food, that occurred throughout Angelou's life, from Angelou's childhood in Stamps, Arkansas, to her adolescence and young adulthood spent with her mother Vivian Baxter, to her career, which brought her fame. She impresses a prospective employer with Southern food; he tells her, [...] "If you can write half as good as you can cook, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> famous". As her fame grows, [...] "the food world widens (tamales, pâté, minestrone, chachouka)" [...] and her dining companions are also among the famous (Oprah Winfrey, Jessica Mitford, Rosa Guy).

2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast.

Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them.

[...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
