500|$|Rivera {{exhibited}} a reserved demeanor {{on the field}} that contrasted with the emotional, demonstrative temperament {{of many of his}} peers. Hall of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera's composure under stress gave him the appearance of having [...] "ice water in his veins". Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, [...] "When you start thinking, a lot of things will happen... If you don't control <b>your</b> <b>emotions,</b> <b>your</b> <b>emotions</b> will control your acts, and that's not good." [...] His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, [...] "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run." [...] Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying [...] "the game that you're going to play tomorrow {{is not going to be}} the same game that you just played." [...] Derek Jeter called him the [...] "most mentally tough" [...] teammate with whom he had ever played.|$|E
500|$|Lewis {{released}} her third studio album Glassheart on 12 October 2012, {{almost a year}} after the original release date of November 2011. The album had been conceptualised in July 2010, following Lewis' completion of her first tour, The Labyrinth. The album title Glassheart was inspired from a conversation that Lewis had with Ryan Tedder. During the conversation, Tedder asked Lewis about her past experiences with love and life in general. Lewis' response led him to the word [...] "Glassheart." [...] During an interview with Clyde 1 radio, Lewis said [...] "Glassheart represents protecting your heart, yourself and protecting <b>your</b> <b>emotions,</b> its very poignant". On 8 October 2012, a week before the album's UK release, Lewis announced her supporting tour of the same name. The tour is named after the album, and although Lewis said she is not American hip hop artist and music producer Kanye West's [...] "biggest fan", she was inspired by his tour performances where he appeared on stage alone and just [...] "did his thing".|$|E
500|$|... "Glassheart" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a dubstep, dance, house and grime song that runs for 3:56 (three minutes, 56 seconds). According to Jenna Hally Rubenstein for MTV Buzzworthy, the song consists of a [...] "grimy, hazy beat", which she compared to [...] "Too Close" [...] (The Lateness of the Hour, 2011), a song performed by Alex Clare. Lyrically, the song is about Lewis' fear that her lover will break her heart. According to Lewis, the song is about protecting yourself, your heart, as well as <b>your</b> <b>emotions.</b> She continued to describe the song as [...] "poignant". The singer went on to reveal that she decided to name the album after the song. Lewis' [...] "crisp" [...] vocals can be heard above the instrumentation as she [...] "croons about the fragility of her heart" [...] as she performs the chorus lines [...] "So baby if you love me/ Let me know/ 'Cause everything hurts just like before/ You're about to tear this heart apart/ I love you like a glass heart." [...] The chorus is built on a [...] "transcendent house beat" [...] as Lewis delicately sings the lines [...] "Promise that we'll never fall apart/ And I'll love you with my Glassheart". The chorus is then followed by a [...] "euphoric instrumentation [...] collapses into a grimy dubstep break." [...] Rubenstein likened the lyrics to those performed by Blondie on her song [...] "Heart of Glass" [...] (Parallel Lines, 1978).|$|E

500|$|Although Congregation did not chart, it {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics. Michael Azerrad called it [...] "superb" [...] in Rolling Stone, while Daniel Fidler from Spin viewed the record as [...] "a clean move toward musical excellence", showing the Afghan Whigs [...] "bursting its Sub Pop chains with catchy, heavy guitar riffs, downright lovable song arrangements, melodies that jerk <b>your</b> <b>emotions</b> back and forth, and yes, endearing, raspy vocals that wail, moan, scream, and shout". Brad Webber of the Chicago Tribune found the album {{more accessible to}} listeners than contemporary Seattle or Minneapolis-based, guitar-oriented grunge bands, writing that the Afghan Whigs were [...] "on rock's cutting edge" [...] while stirring [...] "a torrent of emotions on neatly paced songs". In Musician magazine, J. D. Considine said the band was [...] "clever enough to find hooks {{in the sort of}} gnarled riffs and guitar noise Fugazi plays for atmosphere", as well as [...] "canny enough to avoid most of the mannerisms that make much Amerindie rock seem so cliched." [...] Considine concluded in his review, [...] "The best reason to join this Congregation is that the songs are catchy enough to hold their own against the best work of bands like Dinosaur Jr. or the Replacements." [...] Option was less impressed, appreciating the record's [...] "sheer listenability", [...] "clear recording and dynamic performances", but criticizing Dulli's lyrics and the band's cover of [...] "The Temple". Melody Maker ranked Congregation at number 25 on its year-end best albums for 1992.|$|E

2500|$|A.O. Scott {{writing in}} The New York Times came to believe, [...] "The {{relentless}} {{attention to the}} sheer awfulness of war, which is the film's great strength, is also something of a shortcoming. Mr. Gitai reproduces the numb horror of wading through fields of gore almost too well: the self-protective response is to shut down <b>your</b> <b>emotions,</b> as the characters do. Kippur immerses you in violence and agony, but it may leave you with a curious feeling of detachment." [...] Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, felt Kippur was [...] "almost abstract in its portrait of confusion. Long, numbing scenes of soldiers rushing through the war zone with the wounded and returning for more are accompanied by an overwhelming soundtrack of tanks, helicopters and explosions." [...] He also reserved praise for director Gitai, saying he [...] "captures a chaotic portrait of the war with no glory, only the confusion, fear, and fatigue of a tour under fire." [...] Author G.A. of Time Out called the film [...] "impressive" [...] while remarking [...] "Gitai's autobiographically inspired account of the harrowing experiences of a first-aid team {{in the aftermath of}} Syria and Egypt's surprise attack on Israel in October 1973 typically features long, sinuous takes to chart the way in which patriotic enthusiasm is steadily eroded and replaced by fatigue and disillusionment." [...] In a mixed review, Fred Camper writing for the Chicago Reader felt director [...] "Gitai plunges the viewer into the reality of modern warfare, in which the enemy is often invisible – we never see the Syrians in Kippur – and battle lines are often unclear." [...] Jack Mathews writing for the NY Daily News, believed that instead of [...] "heightening our sense of empathy, we become numbed by the repetition" [...] of the film.|$|E
