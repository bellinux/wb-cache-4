5000|$|On May 14, {{the band}} {{were forced to}} cancel their {{headlining}} slot at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast as Kiedis {{was rushed to the}} hospital prior to the band appearing on stage due to severe stomach pain. Flea alongside, Smith and Klinghoffer made an announcement on the stage as they were due to appear. It is unknown whether upcoming shows would be affected as a result Kiedis' mother Peggy posted the following morning on Facebook that [...] "Anthony will be OK. No surgery is needed. I will keep <b>you</b> <b>updated,</b> I promise" [...] It was confirmed that Kiedis was suffering from intestinal flu and was expected to make a full recovery soon however the band was forced to postpone their iHeartRadio album preview show on May 17, 2016 and has rescheduled it for May 26, 2016. The band returned to the stage on May 22, 2016 in Columbus, OH. According to Chad Smith, Kiedis had suffered from the stomach flu a few weeks earlier as well. In a May 20, 2016 interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada, his first since being released from the hospital, Kiedis said that his illness was brought on by an [...] "inflammation in my guts" [...] which he said was complicated by a recent stomach virus and existing scar tissue from previous hernia operations which required his stomach being pumped at the hospital due to his food not being able to properly digest. [...] "That becomes an incredibly painful situation where you get a fever and pass out... Lo an behold, I'm on the mend" [...] He went on to say [...] "so it turned out to be a good thing, albeit painful and very sad to have to cancel a show. We don't really do that. I'd rather play deathly ill than not play at all, but in this particular instance, I was starting to go down, as in to the ground, so I got rushed to the hospital, got some help, and now I get to figure things out." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{important}} news as such {{to start}} with- we'll split the band. And it's damn {{hard to put}} this into words. Agathodaimon has been my steady companion during the past years, since its foundation in 1995. Looking back, many things changed since then, others stayed the same- we always kept our core principles and our band philosophy in focus. And one of its main aspects was to always strive to deliver the best result possible. But this means that dedication and {{a good amount of}} time is needed, and that's what I currently can't deliver. Having a family (2 kids) meanwhile, I can either choose between them or the music. Or go for a half-hearted compromise. This may sound trivial at first, and I did my best to check all available options and possibilities. But in the end it became obvious that I can't continue with the band on a level that it deserves, that can still aim to [...] "deliver the best result possible". So, after thinking about it for quite a while and discussing this with the other boys, we agreed it's best to lay the band to rest. (It should be noted that also some other members partially face similar obstacles that would prevent bigger activities at least for next year) It is a hard decision for me, but it would be foolish to pretend I could give both band and family proper attention the way things are currently. And working on the next album half-heartedly... that's not an option and in the end, it would not be fair to the fans or our philosophy. Yet, this might not mean the band is gone forever. Things and circumstances change... It's not sure the band might continue at a later date, but yes, we wish for it, so there's a chance we'll come together again, some day. And continue where we left off, with new strength and energy. (I also doubt I am able to stay away from making music anyway...) Speaking of it, some of us will start/announce new projects sooner or later, we'll keep <b>you</b> <b>updated</b> about it. Thanks to all those who supported us over the years.

Mobile Applications {{have brought a}} new revolution. The widespread adoption and use of mobile technologies is opening new and innovative ways to improve health and health care delivery.

These tools are being adopted almost {{as quickly as they}} can be developed. According to industry estimates, 500 million smartphone users worldwide will be using a health care application by 2015, and by 2018, 50 percent of the more than 3. 4 billion smartphone and tablet users will have downloaded mobile health applications[4]. “Doctor App ” is a mobile application that is basically built on the idea that an app can keep <b>you</b> <b>updated</b> with all the health related news that has currently occurred in a particular region and helps you find the affordable, suitable medical services for you nearby.

40|$|When {{you have}} this {{newsletter}} in your hands it would already be 2013. To begin with let me wish you and your families a very happy and prosperous 2013. This quarter was extremely busy with several national and international conferences that are typically organized during {{this part of the}} year. Our Institute was heavily represented in all these conferences and our scientists have made presentations showcasing our science and technology. In addition, we had several visitors who gave interesting colloquia on specific topics of interest to our scientists. The XII Five Year Plan which got officially kicked off in April, 2012, has now led to formulation and finalization of several projects within the Chemical Cluster laboratories of CSIR which CSIR-IIP would lead. I am happy to inform that most of these projects have taken off with the finances released by the CSIR. The next one year will be crucial with a view to see these projects taking route, which would be the starting point through high-ended research within the next four years. I shall keep <b>you</b> <b>updated</b> on these in the forthcoming newsletters. Our scientists have continued to file patents as well as published papers in peer review journals. Several project proposals have been submitted to various agencies which are expected to get funded in the near future. Our congratulations to Dr Y K Sharma for being awarded the DSc Degree by the B R Ambedkar University, Agra and to Dr T Bhaskar for receiving the Fellowship (FBRS) of the Biotech Research Society of India (BRSI) as well as for being selected as a Distinguished Researcher by the AIST, Japan.

40|$|European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) Working {{group for}} preanalytical phase (WG-PRE) has {{recently}} launched {{a series of}} conferences on preanalytical phase. First such meeting was held in Parma (Italy) {{in the spring of}} 2011 and the second one took place in Zagreb (Croatia) during 1 - 2 March 2013. The Zagreb audience had the opportunity to enjoy a focused and challenging scientific program as well as to participate actively in interactive e-voting sessions. Speakers of the conference have kindly accepted the invitation to submit their review articles covering topics presented during the meeting. This Journal issue comprises a number of high quality review articles providing an updated overview of the current evidence on the various preanalytical issues. The first article in this series is presented by prof. Walter G. Guder who has prepared a historical overview of the milestones {{in the development of the}} key concepts in the field of preanalytical phase (1). Bowen and Remaley in their article provide an excellent update on the most important blood collection tube additives and their components which may affect laboratory test results (2). De Carli and her colleagues have compiled the existing evidence of healthcare workers risk of sharps injuries and subsequent infections and review respective prevention strategies (3). Several subsequent articles are dedicated to some preanalytical sources of interferences such as lipemia (4), physical activity (5) and medical contrast media (6). Delanghe and Speeckaert have reviewed current preanalytical problems and requirements for the most common urinary analytes, with a special highlight of the importance of the preanalytical phase in urine toxicology and metabolomics (7). Last, but not the least, this article series also covers the recent advances in the harmonization of preanalytical quality indicators (8) and External Quality Assessment Schemes for the pre-analytical phase (9). We hope that this series shall contribute to the better understanding and recognition of various important preanalytical phase variables. As this body of evidence grows, we will keep <b>you</b> <b>updated</b> by providing high quality reviews and original research addressing the current and future preanalytical challenges...|$|E
