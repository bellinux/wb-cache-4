According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You're a miserly coward," [...] she declared. [...] "I'm not robbing you; {{you will}} have an {{abundance}} for your needs. Why do you quarrel with Dame Fortune? Don't <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> can pay your rent now and eat three square meals a day, {{and not have to}} work and slave for them? You can smoke a good cigar after your dinner, instead of that eternal pipe, and go to a picture show whenever the mood strikes you. Why, man, you're independent {{for the first time in}} your life, and the finances are as sure as shooting for a good seven years to come." ...|$|E

But I was six months in France. I've seen the ruined villages, thousands of refugees--and I've met the Huns at the front. I know I've seen the realities. In regard to this war I can only feel. You've got to go over there and see for yourself before <b>you</b> <b>realize.</b> <b>You</b> can understand this--that but for you and your power over me I'd be a worn-out, emotionally burnt out man. But through you I seem to be reborn. Still, I shall hate Germans all my life, and in the after-life, what ever that may be. I could give you a thousand reasons. One ought to suffice. You've read, of course, about the regiment of Frenchmen called Blue Devils. I met some of them--got friendly with them. They are great--beyond words to tell! One of them told me that when his regiment drove the Huns out of his own village he had found his mother disemboweled, his wife violated and murdered, his sister left a maimed thing to become the mother of a Hun, his daughter carried off, and his little son crippled for life! ... These are cold facts. As long as I live I will never forget the face of that Frenchman when he told me. Had he cause to hate the Huns? Have I?... I saw all that in the faces of those Huns who would have killed me if they could." ...|$|E

5000|$|After Sotloff's passing, the Steven Joel Sotloff Memorial 2LIVES Foundation was created. It {{is named}} after his most {{compelling}} line in the letter he smuggled out to his family during captivity, [...] "Everyone has two lives; the 2nd one begins when <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> have only one." [...] Its vision is to equip journalists with the knowledge and tools they need to tell the important stories {{of the world in}} the safest possible way, honoring freedom of speech and freedom of the press, ending impunity, and bringing them home safely under all circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{explained}} {{about the}} song, [...] "It's {{a feeling that}} anyone who's been through heartbreak will recognize. 'Chin Up Kid' {{can be a very}} relatable song to most. We wrote this song about keeping your head up through heartbreak and trying times. Young love can come and go before <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> even had it. We hope this song motivates the listener to find inner strength to keep moving on and pressing forward." [...] Rico Garcia, the band's touring lead guitarist, contributed to writing the song with the band.|$|E
5000|$|The memorial, {{filled with}} metaphor and symbolism, {{contains}} in its layers some {{excerpts from the}} letter that Sotloff smuggled out to his family while held in captivity, when he realized he may not make it out alive. Some of those words are: [...] "Do what makes you happy. Be where you are happy. Love and respect each other. Don't fight over nonsense. Hug each other every day. Eat dinner together. Live your life to the fullest and pray to be happy. Stay positive and patient. Everyone has two lives; the 2nd one begins when <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> have only one." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{her first}} book of poems, The Reservoir, Donna Stonecipher records her own {{displacement}} as the survivor of a world that exists only in reflection. It is a world Stonecipher is “anxious to tell” her “version of,” but “must be careful how many times” she asks “to be rescued” from it. Fear of dissolution—the kind that presages self-disclosure—often results in the revelation that “you can talk for hours before <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> won’t say it.” Drawing upon {{the image of the}} reservoir as a vessel of containment, Stonecipher attempts to record the seepage and evaporation of her world, as well as the function of memory to act as a catch basin for such loss.|$|E

Oh, it's not perfect. The repeated use of the same transforming sequences, especially Optimus Prime's, gets old after about a half dozen episodes, and <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> still have 46 to go! Also, there are no extras of any kind in the seven-disc set. No commentaries, no deleted scenes, nothing. Hasbro and Takara HAVE to do more to appeal to collectors and adult fans. All in all, the best Transformers show since Beast Wars." ...|$|E
50|$|Power of 2 is one {{of several}} books - along with bestsellers Now, Discover Your Strengths and StrengthsFinder 2.0 - based on Gallup’s {{evidence}} that people flourish best when using their inherent talents. After summarizing studies indicating people generally overestimate their abilities where they are weak and underestimate them when they are strong, the authors advise: “So admit it: You stink at some things. You have blind spots, weaknesses, areas in which others seem to perform effortlessly while you struggle just to be average. You are also overly modest about your strengths. What seems to be no big deal to you is difficult for others. Your strengths are stronger and your weaknesses weaker than <b>you</b> <b>realize.</b> <b>You</b> need help. You are also precisely the help someone else needs.” This incompleteness of the individual, they argue, {{is one of}} the primary reasons for partnerships.|$|E

5000|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{gave the}} album 4/5 stars, using a {{comparison}} to praise; [...] "You went digging {{around in your}} parents closet of old vinyl LPs from the 80s, found one with candy-coated colors on the cover, played it on their old turntable and discovered it really wasnt bad. Then {{a few days later}} after listening to it for the 15th time <b>you</b> <b>realized</b> <b>you</b> {{had fallen in love with}} the goofy, fun, sarcastic music.

She graduated from the university with a bachelor's degree in art and a fifth-year teaching certificate. Lovely admits to having bulimia in college, [...] "Nobody really knew what eating disorders were back then; there was no communication about it. I think there's a lot of pressure when you're maturing, {{and all of a sudden}} <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> look different from everyone else."

5000|$|Regarding its lyrics, Sheldon Pearce of Complex {{found it}} to be [...] "sincere", while Amy Davidson of Digital Spy thought the opposite, {{considering}} it an unapologetic song. Meanwhile, Jamieson Cox of The Verge wondered, [...] "Is he singing to an ex or to listeners around the world?" [...] Julia Michaels, one of its songwriters, claimed that, [...] "We were just trying to capture that moment in a relationship or a particular moment in your life where <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> made a mistake and you're finally ready to admit it and apologize." [...] Later, Bieber admitted that the song was not an apology for his past transgressions, explaining: [...] "People ran with that—that I was like, apologizing with that song and stuff.

5000|$|However, Philip Cosores of Paste {{rated the}} album a 6.0 out of 10, {{and found that}} the album [...] "is easy to excuse, only to the effect that the more you excuse its deficiencies, the more <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> are making excuses for it. Little is bad, but little is memorable or {{exciting}} or even interesting." [...] At The Observer, Kitty Empire called the album a [...] "classy, occasionally experimental set informed by breezy 80s sounds and vintage synths", which [...] "it could have suited any number of other, cooler Coachellists in situ", and that it is [...] "perhaps, a textbook post-success album." [...] Kevin Korber of PopMatters rated the release a 6 out of 10, and evoked how the album is [...] "ultimately underwhelming" [...] because the effort does not have anything [...] "going on", but the project [...] "still works as a solid effort from a band getting used to being big. They’re just doing what they do." [...] Slant Magazines Mark Collett found that the [...] "lightness of touch, however, is otherwise missing", which makes the album [...] "cool and pleasant, but easy to forget." [...] At Mojo, Stephen Worthy said [...] "the French quartet can be forgiven for not messing with the formula here." ...|$|E
50|$|After Flood’s lawsuit lost, many {{consequences}} followed. One of {{the worst}} things that happened to Flood was being blackballed from baseball following his lawsuit. There were questions similar to “Do <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> won’t be able to play in the MLB ever again?” or “You realize you are going to lose your job?” Everyone Flood consulted was convinced he would be blackballed from baseball. Flood soon came to realization that his career was over as he later said,It would be difficult to come back. And besides, I don’t think I’ll be getting the opportunity to play again. As big as it is, baseball is a closely-knit unit. I doubt even one of the 24 men controlling the game would touch me with a 10-foot pole. You can’t buck the Establishment.Another outcome of Curt Flood’s lawsuit, albeit 26 years later, was the Curt Flood Act of 1998. Gary R. Roberts, a graduate and author in the Marquette Law Scholarly Journal, explains the Act as:The conduct, acts, practices, or agreements of persons' in the business of organized professional major league baseball directly relating to or affecting employment of major league baseball players to play baseball at the major league level are subject to the antitrust laws to the same extent such conduct, acts, practices, or agreements would be subject to the antitrust laws if engaged in by persons in other professional sports business affecting interstate commerce.This act did exactly what Flood wanted; it stopped owners from controlling the players’ contracts and careers. Strangely enough, the Curt Flood Act did not eliminate the Reserve Clause and it still fully exists in baseball today.|$|E
5000|$|On Metacritic, a site which {{aggregates}} normalized review scores, Volume 1 has {{the highest}} average score of the trilogy with 73 out of 100. GameRankings also gave it 71.58%. GameSpot awarded the game a 7.1 out of 10, praising its atmosphere but calling its combat [...] "mediocre". Eurogamer also highlights the game's atmosphere but said this about the game's length:"Sadly, there is one big crux as far as Rustin Parr goes, and that's longevity. Like a film or book with a twist in the tail and an engrossing story-line, you can happily read it again and the odd bit here or there will make more sense, but you'll never get quite {{the same level of}} enjoyment out of it as you did before. Add to this the fact that Rustin Parr is over in what seems like an instant and you have cause for some alarm."ActionTrip was more critical of the game and awarded it a 5.9 out of 10. Cited are its [...] "bad controls", [...] "godawful camera angles" [...] and its re-purposing of a classic adventure game engine for a more action-oriented game. On the positive side of things, the author approved of the game's story and mood. AllGame described the game as [...] "one of the scariest games you're likely to experience on the PC in the year 2000" [...] but that the greatest drawback was the controls, stating that [...] "it takes what seems forever to re-center yourself after you turn around and also, when you look up or down, you can get disoriented before <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> aren't looking straight ahead anymore. This can be very frustrating, especially when you are trying to fight off the many undead creatures in the forest." [...] and that the game was short, taking only about 10 hours to finish.|$|E
