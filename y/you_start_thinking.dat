Hall of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera's composure under stress gave him the appearance of having [...] "ice water in his veins". Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking,</b> a lot of things will happen... If you don't control your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that's not good." [...] His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, [...] "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run." [...] Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying [...] "the game that you're going to play tomorrow {{is not going to be}} the same game that you just played."

[...] He also agreed with Fitzpatick regarding Curtis-Hall's presence as Ben Urich not being filled in the season. Despite this, Shepherd added that the season began to pick up by the fourth episode, {{with the introduction of}} Elektra, capping with episodes six and seven, which he called [...] "by far the season’s best, laying the foundation for an exciting story ahead", while also praising Cox, Henson, Woll, Bernthal and Yung for their performances. Daniel Fienberg, reviewing the first seven episodes for The Hollywood Reporter, expressed similar sentiments as Shepherd, feeling the episodes missed what Vincent D'Onofrio brought as Wilson Fisk in the first season, or at least [...] "the through-line threat that he presented...Fortunately, the [...] are vividly realized and the action is still visceral and brutal and maybe the big picture will emerge in the season's second half. Because of the portrayals of those two characters, he felt [...] "that there's a challenge to remain wholly invested in plotlines that don't involve them". Despite being [...] "right on the edge of desensitization" [...] regarding the fight scenes, Fienberg still praised them, highlighting the different styles Elektra and the Punisher used [...] "vary the dynamic enough".|$|E

She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. <b>You</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E

30|$|We {{found that}} the {{internal}} influencing factors are valid for all the types of innovations. An important internal factor with {{a negative impact on}} networking is the lack of human resources, including problems in terms of networking skills and a lack of entrepreneurial spirit of the growers: “The number of growers is diminishing in the ornamental plant sector, and so does the entrepreneurial spirit. Growers don’t see the need to attend network activities anymore […]. Your future is not made when attending a network activity, but the penny has to be dropped in order that <b>you</b> can <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> about your own operations” (farmer interview). The size and structure of the companies are also internal factors which influence the network activity of the growers. Not all the companies are structured {{in a way that the}} managers or employees are able to leave the farm to attend a network activity: “If I’m not here, the production can’t continue” (farmer interview). Furthermore, growers are not always open towards new ideas and change, nor willing to share information. Another observed internal factor with a negative impact on networking is related to a bad financial situation of the grower, resulting in fear to communicate with colleagues and the tendency to isolate themselves on the farm: “It doesn’t go well within the sector. In such situations, people feel less like leaving their farm” (focus group).|$|R

Evaluation from the gender perspective is the generic term for assessing a project or a programme from the point of view of gender equality. The evaluation itself can use different types of methods, such as gender analysis or mapping (diagnosis of the context), gender impact assessment (evaluation of the potential or real impact for women and men of a policy proposal) or gender proofing (formal verification of the gender impact assessment). If you are in the gender mainstreaming process, it is important to establish whether gender is relevant to the policy you are trying to influence or the programme or project you are working with. The following key questions might help you determin the gender relevance (European Commission, 1997) :- Does the proposal concern one or more target groups? Will it affect the daily life of parts of the population?- Are there differences between women and men in this policy field (with regard to rights, resources, participation, values and norms related to gender) ...|$|R
