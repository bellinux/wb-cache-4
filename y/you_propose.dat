25|$|We {{question}} ourselves {{how such}} a law can claim to guarantee human rights when it goes against the rights of association, expression, religion and conscience; when it puts in danger the right of minorities and maintains prejudices that are so incompatible {{with the concept of}} tolerance intrinsic to that of human rights. France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which <b>you</b> <b>propose.</b>|$|E
500|$|Cardus made {{a private}} visit to Australia from mid-January to mid-March 1938. When he joined The Herald in 1940, his initial brief was {{to cover a}} series of concerts {{conducted}} by Beecham for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). Daily contact {{between the two men}} during Beecham's time in Australia between June and October 1940 helped to consolidate their friendship. At the end of his tour Beecham tried to persuade Cardus to join him in sailing to America, asking, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>propose</b> to stay in this barbarous country all your life?" [...] Cardus insisted on remaining in Australia, but moved from Melbourne to Sydney. Concluding that he could not satisfactorily review concerts for an evening newspaper, he joined the staff of The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH).|$|E
2500|$|Himmler {{asked me}} on the occasion: 'How do <b>you</b> <b>propose</b> to settle the Jewish {{question}} in your country?' I replied: 'All we want from them is that they return to their countries of origin.' He (Himmler) replied: 'We shall never authorize their return to Germany.' ...|$|E
60|$|You needn't look indignant. You can't {{deny that}} <b>you</b> <b>proposed</b> to me.|$|R
60|$|Waterall stared. 'Are <b>you</b> <b>proposing</b> that {{we should}} hush this thing up, Mr Birdsey?' he said coldly.|$|R
3000|$|I {{support this}} project <b>you</b> <b>proposed</b> very much. (The degree adverb “very much” {{is far from}} the {{modified}} word “support”.) [...]...|$|R
2500|$|... "And I {{have simply}} sought to bear what share I {{could in the}} {{development}} of these resources. You gentlemen of Virginia and I have a common interest. I shall endeavor to deal fairly by you and I am sure <b>you</b> <b>propose</b> doing the same by me. Again I thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart for the honor you have conferred upon me." ...|$|E
2500|$|When it was proved Mantell {{was correct}} in 1825, the only {{question}} was what to call his new reptile. His original name was [...] "Iguana-saurus" [...] but he then {{received a letter from}} William Daniel Conybeare, [...] "Your discovery of the analogy between the Iguana and the fossil teeth is very interesting but the name <b>you</b> <b>propose</b> will hardly do, because it is equally applicable to the recent iguana. Iguanoides or Iguanodon would be better." [...] Mantell took this advice to heart and called his creature Iguanodon.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the county commissioners and the City Council of Chester, the townships of Aston, Upper Darby, Springfield and Tinicum adopted resolutions condemning Green's plan in no uncertain terms. The Anti-Annexation Committee of Southeastern Pennsylvania, consisting of the Republican chairmen of the four suburban counties, as well as Lancaster and Lehigh counties, was formed. The committee held strategy meetings with Bell, Milliken, county state representatives, county commissioners and War Board members. County Democrats, meanwhile, accused the Republican leadership of having no proposals of its own for redistricting. County chairman Connor posed a question to his GOP counterpart, Mayor Eyre: [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>propose</b> to give the voters of Delaware County equal representation without a jointure {{with one or more}} of the adjoining areas? I for one do not want Congressional redistricting to be handled in the same disproportionate manner that the Republican Party handled the redistricting of Delaware County for the State Legislature a short time ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|TANNER. Straker knew even that. He learnt {{it at the}} Polytechnic, probably. Well, {{what about}} Ann? Have <b>you</b> <b>proposed</b> to her? ...|$|R

2500|$|In this {{particular}} context, the expression [...] "Call of God" [...] (...) is a transparent, according to Christopher Buck, reference to Prophets of God and who give revelation. Scholars like Susan Maneck and William Collins have taken {{note of the}} strength of this quote. However the language is not specific. The Universal House of Justice notes that [...] "The Bahá’í Teachings do not explicitly confirm, nor do they rule out, the possibility that Messengers of God have appeared in the Americas. In the absence of a clear Text the Universal House of Justice has no basis for issuing the kind of statement <b>you</b> <b>propose</b> which would confirm, “in principle, that God sent Manifestations to the indigenous peoples of the Americas.”" [...] Nevertheless the figure of Deganawida, The Great Peacemaker, is mentioned as a leading example in scholarly research; others mentioned by individuals include Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha. David Ruhe, {{a former member of the}} Universal House of Justice, has written mentioning his own view of Deganawida as a Prophet. Since no individual or institution can add to Bahá'í scripture it is impossible to add a specific name to a list of accepted Manifestations of God that would be binding on all Bahá'ís and Bahá'í institutions. However individuals and institutions may accept for their own purposes that various cultural heroes may have been in fact a Manifestation of God and Bahá'ís and institutions of the religion can accept the fact that sacred Indian tradition has mentioned specific names for individuals acting in the role of a Prophet.|$|E
