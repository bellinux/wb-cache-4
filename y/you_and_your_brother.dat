2500|$|L: You have {{certainly}} done your duty. As I told you only this morning, I admire your courage and your great contributions to your country. No one can {{take away from}} you the credit for all you have done. Now I am worried about your physical safety. I have a report that those {{in charge of the}} current activity offer <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> safe conduct out of the country if you resign. Had you heard this? ...|$|E
2500|$|In 198, when Liu Bei was {{planning}} to break free of Cao Cao's control by leaving the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), he sent Sun Qian and Mi Zhu to secretly contact Cao's rivals Yuan Shao and Liu Biao and form alliances with them. After Yuan Shao's death in 202, Liu Biao once wrote to Yuan Shao's third son and successor, Yuan Shang, and mentioned the rivalry between Yuan Shang and his eldest brother Yuan Tan. Liu Biao wrote: [...] "Whenever I discussed this issue (the rivalry between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother)</b> with General Liu (Liu Bei) and Sun Gongyou, I feel very upset and heartbroken." [...] Both Liu Bei and Liu Biao highly regarded Sun Qian.|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Archie {{was very}} quiet but very mischievous - {{especially}} {{when he was with}} his brother Quentin; growing up, Archie and Quentin were very close. They rarely left each other's side and had very few fights. But as for the other siblings, Archie was not close to either Kermit or Ethel, because they would gang up on him. Ted would help beat up Kermit for him and would also tell their mother, Edith, about Ethel, who would often get in trouble. Alice was ten years older than Archie, and he barely remembered her being around, since she would often go places with other family members and friends. Archie was an avid reader and very good at putting puzzles together quickly. His father remarked to him, “Archie, my smart boy, never give up your smartness; that goes for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Quentin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Mulgar should live, like me, in the water, then he, too, {{would never}} know of cold. Whither do <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> wander, O Mulgar?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not yet, Junkie," [...] {{returned}} Barret; [...] "he {{has been}} faithful to his {{promise not to}} go on with that story till <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> are present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Said anything? Just {{guess he}} has. Why, {{the whole school}} is so upset nobody knows what he is doing. Do you know what {{happened}} after <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> ran away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it surely}} won't kill me," [...] she replied; [...] "and, {{if it makes}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> happy, I'm willing to take some chances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was here, was it not," [...] asked Biarne, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> saw {{the salmon}} leaping on the {{occasion}} of your first visit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Every one {{tells me}} he is quite able {{to make his way}} at school; I am only anxious to know which public school <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> would prefer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Rover, perhaps. And {{it will be}} {{instructive}} to all here, to watch <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> manipulate the biplane. But do not let {{the use of the}} machine interfere with your studies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you forget}} that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> are solely {{responsible}} for my present position? That but for you I would have married the Widow Stanhope and started {{one of the finest}} boys' school in New York State?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, fine! I made papa {{drive me}} over to see the game. It's going to be {{something}} grand, so I've heard," [...] went on Minnie, and then she added: [...] "Thought <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> were coming to see us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So this is Thomas Rover," [...] said Captain Victor Putnam, with {{something}} like {{a twinkle in his}} clear eyes. [...] "Rover, I have heard a rather serious report about <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Richard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} the {{servants}} in Lord Radclyffe's household have informed the police that in consequence of Mr. Philip de Mountford's advent in the house, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> and sister had to leave it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the male}} ahead," [...] Dias whispered. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> take aim. I {{will take the}} female, and José will hold his fire of {{buck-shot}} till she is within a length of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|And now, as to your reward, {{you shall}} in truth take your sister home with <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> I will restore to life; but idle and unfaithful {{as they are}} their lot is to wander for ever. And so farewell, and may wisdom be with you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then the Water-midden looked {{long and}} gravely at {{him out of}} darkling eyes. She put out her hand and touched his. [...] "This shall be my sorrowful wish, little Mulgar: it is that when <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> come at last to the Kingdom of Assasimmon, and the Valleys of Tishnar, you will not forget me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} I did them, Dick--honestly I don't. Lots of times I knew <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> were right <b>and</b> I was wrong. But the Old Nick got in me <b>and</b> I--well, <b>you</b> know how I acted. Now I'm an outcast--nobody decent {{wants to have}} {{anything}} to do with me. Even my own father--" [...] Dan Baxter stopped short.|$|R
6000|$|Kate {{took the}} leaf, on which was written, in a firm, round, old-fashioned hand, these words: [...] "Your aunt is here, and asks that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> pay her debt. She is angry {{because it has}} not been done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be so fast, young man," [...] {{returned}} his father. [...] "Your Uncle Dick {{may be too}} lenient. I am rather {{of the opinion that}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother,</b> if not your cousins, have got to be taken in hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Grand Templar {{lifted his}} rugged, {{frowning}} face. [...] "A messenger from heaven, said you, king? To me he seems {{more like a}} messenger from Saladin. Tell us, Sir Godwin, were not <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> once the Sultan's guests at Damascus?" ...|$|E
5000|$|You, gentlemen, are Americans, {{much more}} {{completely}} than I am, for I wasn't born here. This is your native country. It was <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers,</b> black <b>and</b> white, who {{let me come}} here and live, and I hope you'll let me say, without getting maudlin, that I'm grateful to you for it.

6000|$|... "Pooh! I've {{heard about}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> two <b>brothers,</b> Dick Rover. They tell {{all sorts of}} stories about you, but I don't believe the half of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DUDGEON. Why {{else should}} she be here? D'ye think I've not had enough trouble and care put upon me {{bringing}} up my own girls, let alone <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> good-for-nothing <b>brother,</b> without having <b>your</b> uncle's bastards-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always meant}} to tell you, Guy," [...] his {{half-brother}} answered, {{in a sudden}} fit of penitence. [...] "I always meant in the end <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Cyril should come into your own at Tilgate as you ought. I was only waiting--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt He is the same," [...] Roger said; [...] "and I am glad, Amenche, that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> {{have already}} {{come to love}} Him. He is not Lord of all gods, for He is the only God. There are none others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Always," [...] was the answer, [...] "by day, {{and four}} nights out of five. We {{have not had}} so quiet a time as last night for a week. Now I will go and ask the chief to which {{garrison}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> are to be assigned." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then she said: 'My dearest Benjamin, {{your father}} has had these coffins made for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> eleven <b>brothers,</b> because if I bring a girl into the world you are all to be killed and buried in them.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Mister Sinister {{returns in}} the title X-Factor, leading the Nasty Boys and has allied himself with the mutant {{terrorist}} Stryfe. In the crossover storyline [...] "X-Cutioner's Song", the character impersonates Apocalypse and uses his Four Horsemen to capture Cyclops and Jean Grey. Sinister hands them over to Stryfe {{in exchange for a}} canister containing his genetic material, but finds it empty, unknowingly unleashing the Legacy Virus in the process. Afterwards, Sinister confronts Cyclops to reveal that the canister contained the deadly Legacy Virus. It was during this conversation, that Sinister said, [...] "I care enough to wish <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> to be protected from this illness", but he corrected himself in saying that he meant [...] "brother".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can rest}} assured, Mr. Rover, that my {{opposition}} to your plans in New York will be withdrawn," [...] {{he said to}} Dick. [...] "I am going to telegraph to my agents as soon as I get a chance. <b>And</b> I want <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> to understand that I appreciate thoroughly your goodness in coming to my rescue. It was a splendid thing to do. I {{am not going to}} insult you by offering you any reward--all I can say is that I thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart." [...] And that evening Chester Waltham and his sister had taken their departure, stating that the accident at the bridge had ended their idea of touring farther, and that they were going to take the first train they could get for the East.|$|R
6000|$|... "A while ago, O Prophet of the Child, I, the {{messenger}} {{of the god}} Jana, speaking through the mouth of Simba the King, gave to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Marût a certain warning to which you did not listen. Now Jana has Marût, and again I come to warn you, Harût." ...|$|E
60|$|When I saw you at home, it {{was agreed}} that I should write to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Madison.

6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter a bit to us," [...] Easton said, {{breaking}} the silence of surprise with which they had listened to the story. [...] "We like <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> for yourselves, and it {{does not matter}} a rap to us, nor as far as I can see to anyone else, who your fathers and mothers were." ...|$|E
5000|$|You {{have done}} well by coming here to enjoy my {{presence}} in person.

6000|$|... "Thank <b>you</b> so much, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother,</b> too, Miss Cynthia," [...] he said, {{without looking}} up. Then, adding, with a parting glance and smile, [...] "But don't tell Bob how stupid I was," [...] he swiftly departed.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{we leave}} here at daybreak, <b>you,</b> Jacques, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Roger had better wrap yourselves up in <b>your</b> cloaks, <b>and</b> {{lie down in}} the hall below. I would that we could, in the morning, procure clothes for <b>you,</b> older <b>and</b> more worn than those you have on. You are going as men who have {{formerly}} served; but have since {{been living in a}} village, tilling the land, just as you were when you first joined me." ...|$|R
