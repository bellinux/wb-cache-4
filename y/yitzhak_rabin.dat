5|$|Several {{countries}} {{offered to}} assist in both the rescue efforts and the investigation. France offered to send a special rescue unit, and Israeli prime minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise {{to help in the}} investigation. President Clinton declined Israel's offer, believing that accepting it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim-Americans.|$|E
5|$|Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, and <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> {{received}} the Peace Prize in 1994 {{for their efforts}} in making peace between Israel and Palestine. Immediately after the award was announced, {{one of the five}} Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned. Additional misgivings about Arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers.|$|E
5|$|David Elazar, {{encouraged}} by reports of IAF successes, decided to visit Israeli Southern Command. He {{was accompanied by}} his aide, Colonel Avner Shalev and the former Israeli Chief of Staff, <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin.</b> Elazar arrived at Gonen's advance command post at Gebel Umm Hashiba at 18:45; chief among those attending were Gonen, Adan and Mandler. Sharon only arrived after the meeting had been concluded.|$|E
5000|$|The Murder of Isaac (1999), A {{drama about}} the {{assassination}} of <b>Yitzhak</b> (Isaac) <b>Rabin,</b> Israel’s prime minister, following his peace negotiations with the Palestinians. The play explores the infrastructure of Israeli society {{in an attempt to}} present the internal ideological and religious conflicts that led to this tragic event. Originally produced by the Municipal Theatre of Heilbronn, Germany. Also produced by Center Stage Theatre in Baltimore, US, in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Meretz {{was formed}} in 1992 prior to the 1992 {{legislative}} elections by an alliance of three left-wing political parties; Ratz, Mapam and Shinui, and was initially led by Ratzs chairwoman and long-time Knesset member Shulamit Aloni. The name [...] "Meretz" [...] (...) was chosen as an acronym for Mapam (...) and Ratz (...) [...] The third party of the alliance wasnt reflected in its name, but was instead mentioned in the partys campaign slogan: [...] "" [...] (A government with vigor Meretz, the strength to make the change Shinui). Its first electoral test was a success, with the party winning twelve seats, making it the third largest in the Knesset. Meretz became the major coalition partner of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabins</b> Labor Party, helping {{pave the way for}} the Oslo Accords. The party also picked up several ministerial portfolios; Aloni was made Minister of Education, though disputes over {{the role of religion in}} education meant she was moved out of the education ministry to become Minister Without Portfolio in May 1993. In June she became Minister of Communications and Minister of Science and Technology, a role that was later renamed Minister of Science and the Arts. Amnon Rubinstein became Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Minister of Science and Technology and later Minister of Education, Culture, and Sport, whilst Yossi Sarid was named Minister of the Environment and Yair Tzaban named Minister of Immigrant Absorption.|$|R
5000|$|Several leading ultra-orthodox Rabbis, {{including}} Elazar Shach, {{called on}} their followers {{to vote for}} Netanyahu, whilst Leah <b>Rabin,</b> <b>Yitzhak's</b> widow, called on Israelis to vote for Peres so that her husband's death [...] "would not be in vain." [...] Netanyahu also warned that a Peres victory {{would lead to the}} division of Jerusalem in a final peace deal with the Palestinians.|$|R
5|$|Three awards have {{resulted}} in members withdrawing from the committee. Following the 1935 award to the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, Johan Ludwig Mowinckel and Halvdan Koht withdrew. Koht was later re-appointed to the committee. Following the 1973 award to Lê Đức Thọ and Henry Kissinger, Einar Hovdhaugen and Helge Rognlien withdrew. Following the 1994 award to Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> Kåre Kristiansen withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Until 1964 Arad {{had about}} 160 families, {{most of whom}} were natives. After 1971 Arad began {{absorbing}} olim (Jewish immigrants), mostly from the Soviet Union, but also from English speaking countries and Latin America, and its population increased from 4,000 in 1969 to 10,500 in 1974. During {{the first half of the}} 1990s, Arad absorbed 6,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> declared Arad a city on 29 June 1995.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{signing the}} accords, Arafat—as Chairman of the PLO and its {{official}} representative—signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel. In return, Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> {{on behalf of}} Israel, officially recognized the PLO. The following year, Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Shimon Peres. The Palestinian reaction was mixed. The Rejectionist Front of the PLO allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements. It was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan {{as well as by}} many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories. However, the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and Arafat's promise for peace and economic well-being.|$|E
50|$|As Time-Life's primary {{photographer}} for the region, Rubinger covered all of Israel's wars {{and was given}} unprecedented access to governmental leaders: {{he was the only}} photographer allowed in the Knesset cafeteria. With the sort of access and exposure that allows the subjects to disregard the photographer's presence, Rubinger was able to take memorable photos of Golda Meir feeding her granddaughter or quiet moments between <b>Yitzhak</b> and Leah <b>Rabin,</b> for example.|$|R
2500|$|Following the March 1977 {{meeting between}} Rabin and U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Rabin {{publicly}} {{announced that the}} U.S. supported the Israeli idea of defensible borders; Carter then issued a clarification. A [...] "fallout" [...] in U.S./Israeli relations ensued. It is thought that the fallout contributed to the Israeli Labor Party's defeat in the May 1977 elections. On 15 March 1977, Haaretz journalist Dan Margalit revealed that a joint dollar account {{in the names of}} <b>Yitzhak</b> and Leah <b>Rabin,</b> opened in a Washington, D.C., bank during Rabin's term of office as Israel ambassador (1968–73), was still open, in breach of Israeli law. According to Israeli currency regulations at the time, it was illegal for citizens to maintain foreign bank accounts without prior authorization. Rabin resigned on 8 April 1977, following the revelation by Maariv journalist S. Isaac Mekel that the Rabins held two accounts in Washington, not one, containing $10,000, and that a Finance Ministry administrative penalty committee fined them IL150,000. Rabin withdrew from the party leadership and candidacy for prime minister.|$|R

5|$|The {{interval}} between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and whether or not the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E

25|$|The {{funeral was}} held at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on September 30, 2016, with his burial place in the Great Leaders of the Nation section between former Israeli Prime Ministers <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> and Yitzhak Shamir.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, the Israeli {{government}} of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> officially accepted the Beta Israel as Jews, {{for the purpose}} of the Law of Return (an Israeli act that grants all the Jews in the world the right to immigrate to Israel).|$|E
25|$|In there, he held {{a number}} of senior {{positions}} while being on a relatively speedy promotion track. He became the Deputy Commander of the regimental school {{under the command of}} <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> later the brigade commander of the 17th Division and then Commander of the Golani Brigade.|$|E
25|$|After the {{assassination}} of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> in 1995, the peace process eventually ground to a halt. The settlements' population almost doubled in the West Bank. Later suicide bombing attacks from Palestinian militant groups and the subsequent retaliatory actions from the Israeli military made conditions for peace negotiations untenable.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of Israel announces in consternation, in great sadness, and in deep sorrow, {{the death of}} prime minister and minister of defense <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> who was murdered by an assassin, tonight in Tel Aviv. The government shall convene in one hour for a mourning session in Tel Aviv. Blessed be his memory.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Shimon Peres {{took the}} place of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> who had been assassinated by Yigal Amir, a Jewish extremist opposed to the Oslo peace agreement. In the 1996 elections, Israelis elected a right-wing {{coalition}} led by the Likud candidate, Benjamin Netanyahu who was followed in 1999 by the Labor Party leader Ehud Barak.|$|E
25|$|The {{assassination}} of Israeli Prime Minister and Defence Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> was {{the culmination of}} an anti-violence rally in support of the Oslo peace process. Rabin, despite his extensive service in the Israeli military, was disparaged personally by right-wing conservatives and Likud leaders who perceived the Oslo peace process as an attempt to forfeit the occupied territories.|$|E
25|$|After the Madrid Conference of 1991, Ze'evi {{withdrew from}} the Likud {{government}} of Yitzhak Shamir, remaining in the opposition for a decade. He disagreed strongly with the Labour governments of 1992–1996 (led by <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> and Shimon Peres) and 1999–2001 (Ehud Barak), however, he looked favourably on the Netanyahu government of 1996–1999 and supported it from the outside.|$|E
25|$|Although the Senate and House votes preceded {{visits by}} then Israeli Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> and Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert to Washington to {{celebrate}} the 3000th anniversary of King David's declaration of Jerusalem as {{the capital of the}} Jews, little to no progress has been achieved in the physical relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem to date.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, U.S. {{president}} Gerald Ford wrote {{a letter}} to Israeli Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> stating that the U.S. had not developed a final position on the borders but once it had, it would give great weight to Israel's position that a peace agreement with Syria must be predicated on Israel remaining on the Golan Heights.|$|E
25|$|Minutes before Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> {{was murdered}} at a {{political}} rally in November 1995, Israeli folk singer Miri Aloni sang the Israeli pop song Shir Lashalom (Song for Peace). This song, originally written in 1969 and performed extensively by the Lahaqot Tsvayiot at the time, {{has become one}} of the anthems of the Israeli peace camp.|$|E
25|$|The {{assassination}} of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> {{took place on}} 4 November 1995 (12th of Marcheshvan, 5756 on the Hebrew calendar) at 21:30, {{at the end of}} a rally in support of the Oslo Accords at the Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv. The assassin, an Israeli ultranationalist named Yigal Amir, radically opposed Rabin's peace initiative and particularly the signing of the Oslo Accords.|$|E
25|$|In November 1995, owner Abe Pollin {{announced}} he was changing the team's nickname, because Bullets had acquired violent overtones that had made him increasingly uncomfortable over the years, particularly given the high homicide and crime rate in the early 1990s in Washington, D.C. It was widely believed to also {{be related to the}} assassination of Pollin's longtime friend, Israeli Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> his temporary successor Shimon Peres decided to call early elections {{in order to give}} the government a mandate to advance the peace process. Netanyahu was the Likud's candidate for Prime Minister in the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 26 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their Prime Minister directly. Netanyahu hired American Republican political operative Arthur Finkelstein to run his campaign, and although the American style of sound bites and sharp attacks elicited harsh criticism from inside Israel, it proved effective (the method was later copied by Ehud Barak during the 1999 election campaign in which Barak beat Netanyahu). When Netanyahu won the 1996 election, he became the youngest person {{in the history of the}} position and the first Israeli Prime Minister to be born in the State of Israel (<b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> was born in Jerusalem, under the British Mandate of Palestine, prior to the 1948 founding of the Israeli state).|$|E
25|$|From 1990 Peres led the {{opposition}} in the Knesset until, in early 1992, he was defeated in the first primary elections of the new Israeli Labor Party (which had been formed by the consolidation of the Alignment into a single unitary party) by <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> whom he had replaced fifteen years earlier. Peres remained active in politics, however, serving as Rabin's foreign minister from 1992.|$|E
25|$|The Mitla {{incident}} hindered Sharon's {{military career}} for several years. In the meantime, he occupied {{the position of}} an infantry brigade commander and received {{a law degree from}} Tel Aviv University. However, when <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> became Chief of Staff in 1964, Sharon again began to rise rapidly in the ranks, occupying the positions of Infantry School Commander and Head of Army Training Branch, eventually achieving the rank of Aluf (Major General).|$|E
25|$|The Palmach's last {{operation}} as {{an independent}} unit was against the Irgun, in the Altalena Affair. On 22 June 1948 the Irgun moored the Altalena, loaded with weapons, off Tel Aviv. Ben-Gurion ordered the Palmach to prevent the arms being landed. In an operation commanded by Yigal Allon, with <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin</b> as his deputy, a cannon was used to sink the ship. One member of the Palmach and fourteen members of the Irgun were killed.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Skaat {{performed}} in a musical play, He Who Dreamed (English translation), based on the last 10 years {{of the life of}} <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin.</b> The cast also included Gila Almagor and Oded Teomi in the title role. In early 2006, Skaat was featured in a unique series of three-minute reality-based segments produced by Cellcom, which was made available for download to its customers, among the first content of this kind in Israel's history.|$|E
25|$|Rehavam Ze'evi, Israel's tourism {{minister}}, {{was assassinated}} at shortly before 7:00am (GMT+2) on Wednesday, 17 October 2001, {{at the former}} Hyatt Hotel in Jerusalem by a squad of Palestinians assassins {{acting on behalf of}} the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine militant organization. Ze'evi was the first Israeli minister to be assassinated since the assassination of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Rabin,</b> and the most senior Israeli person to be killed by militants during the entire Arab–Israeli conflict.|$|E
