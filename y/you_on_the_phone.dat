5000|$|Little {{is known}} about Spirito's early life. As a front for his illegal {{activities}} he gave people {{the impression that he}} was a plumber or a hardware store owner. He came from the Italian community of Chambersburg, New Jersey which is now part of Trenton, New Jersey. At one time, Spirito, who was involved in loansharking and bookmaking, was considered a close associate of both Harry Riccobene and of Riccobene's half-brother, Mario. He worked in the Scarfo crime family during the 1980s, during Nicodemo Scarfo's reign. Pasquale (Pat the Cat) Spirito was an associate of made man Joseph (Joey Chang) Ciangalini who introduced Spirito into the life of organized crime. Pat earned the nickname amongst his fellow associates as 'The Cat' because of con artist charm and demeanour. He was an associate until he was the getaway driver in the murder of John Calabrese, a long-time drug dealer who served under Angelo Bruno and then became a 'made man' under Phil Testa with Francis (Faffy) Iannarella and Andrew Thomas DelGiorno at a secret induction ceremony at the home of mob associate Robert (Toro) Locicero in Vineland, New Jersey. He was married but was a constant womanizer. John Calabrese was murdered on October 6, 1981 in Southwest Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pat recruited Nicholas Caramandi, Charles Iannece, and Ralph Staino Jr. as his associates, eventually elevating them all to 'proposed members' to Nicholas Scarfo. Nicholas Caramandi said, [...] "He was greedy and ambitious, attributes that (Nicholas) Scarfo could appreciate, but he lacked the killer instinct… Spirito was a moneymaker but he was also a whiner and complainer." [...] He used to hang out at a bar, Paco's in Pennsport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Nick Caramandi would later say, [...] "If he had problems with his wife (he would send Charles Iannece or Nick Caramandi) to talk to his wife. Then we had to stay with him from eleven o'clock in the morning til one or two the next morning. Then he used to call <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and have <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> for two or three hours." ...|$|E
5000|$|Blues arranger/songwriter Willie Dixon wrote [...] "Talk to Me Baby (I Can't Hold Out)" [...] in late 1958 or 1959 in Los Angeles {{while he}} was on tour with Memphis Slim. [...] According to Dixon, he was {{inspired}} to write the song after a telephone conversation with his wife Marie. I just talked to my baby, on the telephoneShe said 'Stop what you're doin', and come on home'I can't hold out, I can't hold out too longI get a real good feelin', talkin' to <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> When Dixon returned to Chicago, Elmore James had a recording session for Chess Records and invited Dixon to participate. Together, they [...] "made that 'Talk to Me Baby (I Can't Hold Out Too Long)'", although Dixon does not perform on the song. For the recording session, James, who sang and played slide guitar, was accompanied by his long-time backing band the Broomdusters: J. T. Brown on saxophone, Johnny Jones on piano, Odie Payne on drums, and Homesick James on guitar.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} verse of the song, {{a man is}} about to go to work after waiting by the phone for a call from a girl. Before leaving, he takes his guitar and records himself playing and singing a {{greeting}} on his answering machine (the song's chorus) to tell her that no matter what, he loves her, and she can still come back. At the end of the recording, he sings, [...] "I can't hug <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> so hurry home." [...] In the second verse, the man gets a message from an old friend, who has just found out about the missing girl. The friend says that if he sees her, he will [...] "remind her that her daddy's worried", revealing that the girl is the first man's daughter. In the song's bridge, many days have flown by since the father has heard from his daughter, and people are starting to doubt that she will ever come back. When they tell the father that he should remove the recording, he says he will leave it on the machine, just in case. In the third verse, the song shifts to the daughter, who has been abandoned by [...] "her so-called friends" [...] outside a bar in New York City. She is scared her father will reject her as well, but having nowhere else to turn, finally calls and gets the recording asking her to [...] "hurry home." [...] The last chorus is followed by, [...] "He walked in just in time to hear her say, 'Dad, I'm on my way.'" ...|$|E

40|$|Email and e-communications The project {{commenced}} as {{a review}} of the use of email with my student groups following an experience of a student who had sent over 100 emails during 6 months of an online course, sometimes up to four emails in a day. In one of the exchanges I noted a comment embedded in the text which said, “It was good to talk with <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> today …”. This made me realise that perhaps there is merit in considering breaking out of a routine method of correspondence, and to vary the teaching and support methods. The project therefore evolved into an examination of e-communications in general, and then the use of so called Web 2. 0 technologies (O’Reilly, 2004) as a tool to support my students. Making the technology fit the pedagogy This led me to question whether technology was influencing, perhaps even determining my teaching style, or whether in fact the underlying pedagogy was the same but maybe I was adapting the technology to suit the circumstances I encountered. This led to a number of joint exercises with other COLMSCT Fellows on this theme where we explored and promoted different views on the subject. I will report on this later in this document...|$|E

In advance of your visit, the Global Alliance Against Industrial Aquaculture (GAAIA) would like to proffer an alternative perspective to the NSC’s shameless ‘press kit ’ and argue that Norwegian farmed salmon is a hazard to the environment, wild fish and public health. I would be {{only too happy to}} speak to <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> or meet in person in Norway and I would encourage you to reach out to scientists like Dr. David Carpenter and Dr. Claudette Bethune who have personal insight into this issue.

It was really {{wonderful}} to hear your {{voice on the phone}} New Year’s Eve. Golly, it’s been such a long time since we talked with you. We were both so sorry to hear that you were all alone— Remember we mentioned going to the movin’ pitchers. That’s as close as we got. We were both so tired from moving we just waited for 12 o’clock 2 ̆ 6 after a weak “Happy New Year” fell asleep. Judd was really beat cause he’d had to do most of the real work. We had dinner at the Post on New Year’s Day and were so disappointed cause they didn’t have turkey. Are you 2 ̆ 6 Bobby both recȯȯperated? Sure hope so. Take care of yourself. There’s so much flu going around. Down here too— Did you manage to get any sheets? We’ve tried 2 ̆ 6 tried to get some down here but there [sic] impossible to find. We need them so badly 2 ̆ 6 will certainly appreciate your getting them. Is Don home for good or was he just on leave? It was nice that he could get home. We sent him a Christmas card but he probably won’t receive it for years cause we sent it overseas. My hospitalization isn’t any good. A family contract has to be in effect for 10 months before you can use it for a baby. Mother 2 ̆ 6 Daddy sent us a money order, though, and that surely will help a lot. Judd’s going to take the course in Radio probably as soon as he completes the history course. He can really use it! As Bobby will probably remember. This one will be a pleasure though 2 ̆ 6 not like the history course. Judd doesn’t do much flying as he told <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> He just gets his 4 hours a month in so we get the flying pay. Did the pictures of the babies around the tree turn out? We can hardly wait to see them. Golly, Ace really does a marvelous job with a box camera. Hope he has a job now. It really must be rough. The jobs just don’t pay anything. How is Nannie? Is she going to have a baby? We’re praying for her? What did the Dr. say? Let us know as soon as you hear anything. Well, it’s supposed to be about 4 more days now. We’re going crazy with the suspense. Hope W. J. comes on time or early. He’s supposed to be born on the 11 th but the Dr. said that he’d come anytime from the 10 th to the 20 th. Golly, sure hope it’s close to the 10 th. All the good shows are coming to the Field 2 ̆ 6 we’re trying to see them all. Probably won’t {{be able to see the}} ones we want to. Golly, babies are so indefinite— Haven’t any idea how to take care of a baby 2 ̆ 6 it’s awful. Don’t know what we need or anything. The only thing I know is you need millions of diapers but gee, don’t even know how to put one on. Hope it’s something that just comes easily. We’ve been having quite a bit of rain lately 2 ̆ 6 the Alabama River is really high. It’s supposed to reach 41 feet by Thursday. Normally it’s about 20 feet, I think. What weather.

40|$|Translation begins] Sunday My Darling- Can’t {{remember}} {{whether or}} not I wrote to you Friday night- If I did, don’t know where the letter is. Anyway it probably wasn’t anything interesting- Couldn’t have been very long because Woody and I went to the movies. Saw “Can’t Help Singing” and “The Jade Mask”. Oh, you sounded so far away today when you called. Golly, this morning seems so long ago. It seems {{at least a day}} away. It seems hours. This has been the longest day. Gee, honey, it was wonderful to hear your voice again. I love you so much, darling. Just a month from today and we’ll be married. Gee. Oh, honey, I’m glad that you’re going to get the wedding rings. How much is yours going to be? What kind are you getting- be sure that mine will go with my engagement ring, honey. I’ll either send you the money or give it to you when I come down- whichever is best for you- so let me know. Golly, honey, you’re so organized and you’ve got everything so organized and all arranged and everything. You’re just wonderful. I’ve got millions of things to do but just can’t seem to get started. Well, I did the most important thing anyhow- Bought my wedding dress. Hope that you’ll like it, darling. It’s more or less ivory satin but not the kind of ivory that looks dirty. Wish I could draw then I could give you an idea. Oh, well- it will be better if you’re completely surprised. I hope pleasantly. I think the dress is beautiful- of course I’m probably prejudiced. It has a train- not too long. Charlotte’s definitely coming down. Don’t get two double rooms if you can possibly advoid [sic] it, darling because we can have more fun all together. If they can’t bring in an extra bed, three of us can sleep together. Oh, honey, is the graduation dance going to be on Friday? Can you get Charlotte a date? I hope that all the fellows don’t have their girls down. Do you think that you can? Let’s see. What else was there to talk about. Honestly, honey, my mind is a complete blank I just can’t concentrate on anything. Must be love- I’ve been trying to get Mom all day. Maybe she’s in Brooklyn or something. Wanted to tell her that you called. Gee, honey, when you called I was completely surprised. Couldn’t remember a darned thing that I wanted to ask you and still can’t. Besides that my voice is or was going away. It was very helpful for a good intelligent conversation- since I’ll half asleep now this will be a great letter. Oh, I was looking for a sweater today and came across some pictures that we took a year ago thanksgiving. A girl I used to work with is the one with mother and I. She was from Cleveland and wall all alone so I invited her up for dinner. They’re horrible pictures but what can you expect with me in front of the camera. That was when I used to eat bullets- my hair shot out in bangs. Honey, do you ¾ length coats? I’m trying to decide whether I do. Saw a cute one last Saturday and maybe I’ll get it next weekend. Oh, honey, guess what. Mother gave me a can opener. Now we can eat! It’s the kind that I can use, too! Well, at least we won’t starve now- I hope. Oh, golly, my darling, I miss you so much. Every day I miss you more and more. Well, honey, things don’t look too good for around the 10 th or 11 th. Honestly, everything happens to us- I’m almost positive but until the 10 th or maybe the 11 th can’t be sure. I told <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> that I got my dress. Oh, I guess I wrote you that in the letter, too. See what I mean- I’m really in a hopeless condition. It really was an accident about my buying the dress. Charlotte and I were looking for a dress for her to wear to the wedding and I happened to see this store where they advertised bridal dresses all the time. We went in just to look and their dresses were all right. Nothing to rave about but they were nice. They didn’t fit me too well. Then she brought out a dress that they used as a window sample. That’s smaller than a size 10 + fitted perfectly. So now I’m all happy and all I have to do is pay for it and leave an arm and leg and the dress will be mine. Oh honey, how hot will it be down there in March? Golly, that dress {{is probably going to be}} so hot. It’s all satin- Golly, I’ll probably die of the heat. What else did I want to ask you? Something happened to this pen and its scratching and writing funny. Fine thing. Gee, honey, what a wreck I am. There are a million and one things to be done yet but something always happens. You’re really wonderful to be getting everything done so quickly. Guess I’m not the efficient type. Gee, honey I hope these next few weeks go fast. I love you so and it’s been so long since we were together. That Flight Officer Exam sounds quite odd to say the least. How they can grade anything like that is really amazing. Wonder what the right answers were supposed to be. By the way, did you find the purple flag yet? What kind of morons are Flight Officers anyway. That must have been some test. When do you find out? Do they give you an exam for Lieutenant, too? Hope that’s on a higher plane- Isn’t it strange that I’ve always called you Judson- Don’t know why. Alway did like your name though. Now I call you Judd almost all the time when I talk about you which is always. Well, if the paper said it was all right to get married when you can’t cook, guess it’s all right. But, honey, will they send someone from the paper down to cook for you when you’re hungry? It would be such a waste of time to get married at home. Everything is really much more complicated this way. If you only knew how much more. Of course we really haven’t any argument because it’s costing more to come down than any wedding and reception ever would and besides- oh, heck, I’m not on that side- I like this way better. Gee, honey, do you think that we’ll have enough money for me to ride all day? When you’re flying I’d like to ride. As often + as much as possible- we can worry about that later, though. Gee, honey, I wish I were flying so that the time would pass quickly. It just drags so slowly. I’m so glad that you have 40 hours in. You’ll have to be doing a lot of flying from now on to get those last thirty hours in. You flew this afternoon, too. Have you started instruments and night flying, honey? Tomorrow I probably won’t write because Daddy and I are going to see “Winged Victory” I hope. How did you like shooting skeet? Was it fun- I’d love to learn how to shoot. Maybe I can find a cowboy in Texas- on second thought, maybe you could teach me. How’s my little grounded goose tonight? I can just see you feeling like one when you don’t fly. Every day that we’re apart just seems wasted. I hope March hurries. Darling, I’ll never be able to tell you how much I love you. There are so many different ways but I guess the only one I ever can think of is I love you and that’s not very expressive. Gee, honey, I’m so glad that you sent me those pictures. I just sit and look at them for hours. That’s one reason it takes me so long to write a letter to you. They’re wonderful just like you. I love you so, my darling- wish I could tell you how much. Heard “If You Are But a Dream” today- I miss you so whenever I hear any of the song that we heard together. Oh, saw “Together, Again” Morra was very good. Well, hun, it’s late again. I love you so. Hope we won’t be apart much longer. I love you and miss you more every day. You’ll have all my love. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
