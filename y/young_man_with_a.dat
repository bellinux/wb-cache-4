David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss {{before going to bed}} together. The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family.

25|$|Constantine's youth {{had been}} a sad one due to his {{unpleasant}} appearance, his taciturn nature, and his relegation to the third level of succession, behind Christopher Lekapenos, the eldest son of RomanosI Lekapenos. Nevertheless, {{he was a very}} intelligent <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large range of interests, and he dedicated those years to studying the court's ceremonial.|$|E

25|$|Max Pirkis (Season 1 {{and early}} 2) and Simon Woods (Season 2) as Gaius Octavian – Portrayed as a shrewd, if {{somewhat}} cold, <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> limited {{understanding of the}} world, people, philosophy and politics. Despite this, he is very power hungry, a failure as a military strategist and uses the accomplishments of his relatives {{as a means to}} further his political career. The basis for this character is the early life of Augustus, the first Roman Emperor.|$|E
25|$|In The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), {{another of}} his three Oscar-nominated roles, Douglas plays a hard-nosed film {{producer}} who manipulates and uses his actors, writers, and directors. Bacall and Doris Day played two very different types of women in his life. In <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Horn (1950), he played a driven jazz musician, based on real-life horn player Bix Beiderbecke. Composer-pianist Hoagy Carmichael, playing the sidekick role, added realism to the film and gave Douglas insight into the role, being {{a friend of the}} real Beiderbecke.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{became an}} {{international}} star through positive reception for his leading {{role as an}} unscrupulous boxing hero in Champion (1949), which brought him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Other early films include <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Horn (1950), playing opposite Lauren Bacall and Doris Day; Ace in the Hole opposite Jan Sterling (1951); and Detective Story (1951). He received a second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), opposite Lana Turner, and his third nomination for portraying Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956).|$|E

25|$|During a {{visit to}} her {{maternal}} relatives at Jugenheim, in August 1868, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, then fifteen years old, met Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Alfred, Queen Victoria's second son, was a shy and handsome <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> career in the British navy. He was visiting his sister, Princess Alice, who was married to Maria Alexandrovna's first cousin. Alfred's voyage {{around the world with}} the Royal Navy kept him away, traveling for the next two years. Maria and Prince Alfred saw each other again in the summer 1871, when Alexander II and his wife visited relatives at Schloss Heiligenberg. The Tsar and his wife were accompanied by seventeen-year-old Maria and her two elder brothers. Alfred also happened to be there, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales. During that summer, Maria and Alfred felt attracted to each other, spending their days walking and talking together. They had a common love of music; Alfred was an enthusiastic amateur violinist, while Maria played the piano. Although they wished to marry, no engagement was announced, and Alfred returned to England.|$|E
25|$|A highly fictionalized {{version of}} Balian {{is the main}} {{character}} of the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven, played by Orlando Bloom as a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> questioning sensibility regarding religion and social attitudes. In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a blacksmith in France, and encourages {{him to come to}} the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with Sibylla (this is possibly derived from the Old French Continuation of William of Tyres claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and instead of working in close alliance with Patriarch Eraclius, Balian is depicted as his rival. In the film's coda, Balian returns to France (with Sibylla) where he meets Richard I of England, who rides up to Balian and says to him that he is looking for Balian, the defender of Jerusalem, to which Balian replies that he is a blacksmith. After some time passes Balian and Sibylla are seen to be riding up the crossroads his father had used when returning from Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Dorothy Baker {{borrowed}} {{the titles of}} her friend Otis Ferguson's two articles and published the novel <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Horn. Her story of the doomed trumpet player Rick Martin was inspired, she wrote, by [...] "the music, but not the life" [...] of Beiderbecke, but the image of Martin quickly became the image of Beiderbecke: His story is about [...] "the gap between the man's musical ability {{and his ability to}} fit it to his own life." [...] In 1950, Michael Curtiz directed the film <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Horn, starring Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, and Doris Day. In this version, in which Hoagy Carmichael also plays a role, the Rick Martin character lives.|$|E

500|$|Smalls Paradise was {{the subject}} of a 1945 film, It Happened in Harlem, {{produced}} by All American News. The plot revolves around Ed Smalls' singer drawing record crowds at Smalls Paradise until the singer receives his draft notice. Smalls begins auditions to try to replace his star vocalist. [...] A little-known <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> following tries to audition for Smalls, but is turned away. [...] One of the young man's ardent fans then persuades Smalls to give him an audition. Actor George Wiltshire plays the role of Ed Smalls.|$|E
500|$|Described as a [...] "dapper <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{moustache}} waxed {{into long}} points", he {{made for a}} [...] "dynamic figure with a penetrating voice", and was noted for riding his Douglas motorcycle through the 1920s and 30s in his khaki overalls as he traveled between his professional practice, teaching duties and home life. On the home front, Louis Laybourne Smith married Frances Maude Davies, the daughter of Edward Davies to whom he had been articled, on 9 April 1903. They had three daughters and a son, Gordon Laybourne Smith, who ultimately followed his father into architecture.|$|E
500|$|Douglas adopted Boddy's [...] "Tricky Dick" [...] {{nickname}} for Nixon, and {{also referred to}} him as [...] "pee wee". Her name-calling {{had an effect on}} Nixon: when told she had called him [...] "a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dark shirt" [...] in an allusion to Nazism, he inquired, [...] "Did she say that? Why, I'll castrate her." [...] Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that {{it would be difficult to}} do, and Nixon replied that he would do it anyway. Nixon returned the attacks; at friendly gatherings and especially at all-male events, he stated that Douglas was [...] "pink right down to her underwear".|$|E

3000|$|The {{situation}} {{of lots of}} <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> immigration background is characterised by difficulties at school, conflicts between the expectations of parents inspired by their cultures of origin and the expectations of our society. In addition, the economic {{situation of}} their parents’ household is often very difficult. The criminality of lots of these <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> immigration background results from {{a failure of the}} integration process. Furthermore, the experiences show that their religious knowledge is often rudimentary and ‘erroneous’. This is an obstacle for integration. […] Spiritual Muslim care could help in two regards: prevention and promotion of integration. 25 [...]...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, McNairy portrayed {{colorful}} and individualistic <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rebellious edge. He had small parts in films, including Wonderland (2003), Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005), and Art School Confidential (2006).|$|R
500|$|When {{he finally}} decided to abandon Fountain City, Chabon recalls staring at his blank {{computer}} for hours, before suddenly picturing [...] "a 'straitlaced, troubled <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tendency toward melodrama' trying to end it all." [...] He began writing, and {{within a couple of}} days, had written 50 pages of what would become his second novel, Wonder Boys. Chabon drew on his experiences with Fountain City for the character of Grady Tripp, a frustrated novelist who has spent years working on an immense fourth novel. The author wrote Wonder Boys in a dizzy seven-month streak, without telling his agent or publisher he'd abandoned Fountain City. The book, published in 1995, was a commercial and critical success.|$|E
500|$|Amanda Tapping {{admitted}} {{that it had}} been easier to establish relationships with her co-stars {{at the beginning of the}} series, comparing Nemec's situation to [...] "being the new kid in school; we're still trying to make [...] comfortable, but it's not the same". Nevertheless, the StargateSG-1 actors and producers complimented Corin Nemec and the character. Richard Dean Anderson was impressed with Nemec's performance in [...] "Meridian", saying [...] "he really struck me as a bright guy, very respectful of the dynamic of the set, but with an awareness of what he wanted to bring." [...] Don S. Davis (General Hammond) noted during the filming of season6 that [...] "Corin is a wonderful [...] <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tremendous personality and he's had a great deal of experience in the business", agreeing with writer Robert C. Cooper that Nemec had done a [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "wonderful" [...] job.|$|E
