25|$|Biafra is {{an ardent}} {{collector}} of unusual vinyl records of all kinds, from 1950s and 1960s ethno-pop recordings {{by the likes}} of Les Baxter and Esquivel to vanity pressings that have circulated regionally, to German crooner Heino (for whom he would later participate in the documentary Heino: Made In Germany); he cites his always growing collection as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1993 he gave an interview to RE/Search Publications for their second Incredibly Strange Music book focusing primarily on these records, and later participated in a two-part episode of Fuse TV's program Crate Diggers on the same subject. His interest in such recordings, often categorized as outsider music, led to his discovery of the prolific (and schizophrenic) singer/songwriter/artist Wesley Willis, whom he signed to Alternative Tentacles in 1994, preceding Willis' major label deal with American Recordings. His collection grew so large that on October 1, 2005, Biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual <b>yard</b> <b>sale</b> co-promoted by Alternative Tentacles and held at their warehouse in Emeryville, California.|$|E

500|$|Lasseter's {{intention}} with {{a sequel}} was {{to respect the}} original film and create that world again.

500|$|Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed {{gave the}} episode a 3.5/5 rating and commented that [...] "perhaps {{it is not}} {{profound}} in its examination of jealousy causing people to behave irrationally, but it handles the topic in a serious manner while not compromising the show's humor. The side story with Bart stems from {{the era of the}} series when Bart was the big star, but it still has some funny bits." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "Mean Homer equals Funny Homer, so 'When Flanders Failed' presents an above average show. He seems unusually crude here, which makes him amusing. The subplot with Bart and his karate class also adds good material, especially when he threatens to turn the 'Touch of Death' on Lisa. Another sappy finish slightly mars this one, but it remains generally solid." [...] Kimberly Potts of AOL named it tenth best episode of the show and commented: [...] "Schadenfreude is the theme of this tight episode about Homer's joy at the failure of Flanders' Leftorium store. There are few times Homer is more shamelessly smug than he was while imitating Flanders and using Ned's <b>yard</b> <b>sale</b> grill, and we haven't even mentioned Bart's 'Touch of Death' subplot." [...] Winston-Salem Journals Tim Clodfelter called it an [...] "outstanding" [...] episode.|$|E
