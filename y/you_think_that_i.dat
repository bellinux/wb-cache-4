Foster commented: [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, [...] "You'll See", was really neat. Madonna had written a great lyric (<b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't live without your love / You'll see) and I thought my music was great." [...] "You'll See" [...] is a low bass track featuring wind chimes and a Spanish guitar. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. Lyrically, the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. Madonna was asked whether the track was about revenge to which she replied [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself." [...] Madonna later recorded the Spanish version of [...] "You'll See" [...] in Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. Titled [...] "Verás", the song was adapted into Spanish by Paz Martinez. The next original song, [...] "One More Chance", is an acoustic ballad, whose lyrics are about attempting to win a lost lover back. The song was inspired by Madonna's real life experience, but she wrote it from the opposite point of view. Its composition has an organic arrangement, devoid of any synths and sequencing, and only based on guitars with plenty of chord changes and subdued strings.|$|E

With both his inspiration and memory in decline, Madetoja {{does not appear to have}} taken seriously the idea of a reconstruction of the lost score, notwithstanding his (unsuccessful) 1941 application for a stipend to [...] "finish my fourth symphony that is underway". Indeed, when a student of his, , asked whether Madetoja could recreate the symphony, he replied cryptically, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could rewrite something that a thief has taken"? By January 1942, he was hospitalized for alcoholism. During his treatment, Madetoja occupied himself with old issues of Musiikkitieto magazine and, when he came across a story about his time in Runni, he did not recall having composed the Fourth, telling his doctor and friend, Jalmari Lydecken, [...] "I wonder if anything has been written at all"? ...|$|E
