500|$|The {{increase}} in royal intermarriage often meant that lands {{passed into the}} hands of foreign houses, when the nearest heir {{was the son of a}} native dynast and a foreign royal. The Habsburgs, for example, expanded their influence through arranged marriages and by gaining political privileges in what would become Switzerland, and in the 13th century the house aimed its marriage policy at families in Upper Alsace and Swabia. Given the success of the Habsburgs' territorial acquisition-via-inheritance policy, a motto came to be associated with their dynasty: Bella gerant alii, tu, felix Austria, nube! ("Let others wage war. <b>You,</b> <b>happy</b> Austria, marry!") ...|$|E

500|$|The {{installment}} {{has been}} very positively received by the show's cast and crew. Series creator Steve Franks was asked by iTunes in 2009 to select his twelve favorite episodes {{to be put on}} a special DVD release. The collection, titled Psych: Twelve Episodes That Will Make <b>You</b> <b>Happy,</b> contained four episodes from the first season, including [...] "Spellingg Bee". When describing the episode, Franks stated that [...] "The Spellingg Bee has my one of my favorite scenes in the run of the show when Shawn takes over for the spellmaster and has to investigate a murder while making up words for the contestants to spell". In 2013, iTunes asked stars James Roday and Dulé Hill to select their 20 favorite episodes from the show. The DVD collection was titled Psych: James and Dule's Top 20, with [...] "Spellingg Bee" [...] was selected as #14 on the collection, picked by Roday. Three other episodes from the first season were also selected.|$|E
500|$|During {{the height}} of the Daddies' popularity, Perry found the band's {{mainstream}} notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public. He would later recall, [...] "It's a total cliché, but [...] doesn't make <b>you</b> <b>happy.</b> There's a lot missing. Success has given people the right to yell at me on the street, but I don't really feel like it's given me any dignity". Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies' constant touring, Perry's frustration was only exacerbated by the media's persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act, though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations. When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase, the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting: in a 1999 interview, responding to their place in the swing scene, Perry retorted [...] " [...] unapologetically play ska right in the face {{of people who want to}} hear swing".|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{left for}} their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, Cynthia, {{he was nervous}} and upset {{that he had made}} people angry simply by expressing his opinion. The Beatles {{attended}} a press conference in Chicago, Illinois; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should. Lennon said that [...] "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it" [...] but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, [...] "not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us." [...] Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: [...] "if you want me to apologise, if that will make <b>you</b> <b>happy,</b> then OK, I'm sorry." [...] Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the Bible Belt were [...] "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".|$|E
500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} they {{returned}} home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. [...] "Christianity will go," [...] Lennon had said. [...] "It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me." [...] The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – {{on the eve of the}} group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American [...] "Bible Belt". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, [...] "If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it." [...] Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: [...] "If you want me to apologise, if that will make <b>you</b> <b>happy,</b> then okay, I'm sorry." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are <b>you</b> <b>happy</b> or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} an A-not-A {{question}} in English is in (1.a) [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>happy</b> or sad?". The {{response to this question}} must be an echo answer, stating either [...] "I am happy," [...] or the correct alternative, [...] "I am sad". In other words, this sentence is a leading question, where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. In contrast, (1.b) [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>happy</b> or not?" [...] is a neutral question where the answer to this can be yes or no in response to the first and more explicitly stated alternative.|$|E

2500|$|One {{example of}} German {{leaflets}} which appealed to American troops {{was one that}} depicted a passionate kiss {{between a man and}} woman. The leaflet read: [...] "FAREWELL Remember her last kiss... ? Gee were <b>you</b> <b>happy</b> then... ! Together, you spent marvelous times..., lounging on beaches..., dancing, enjoying parties galore ..., listening to the tunes of your favorite band...". The leaflets back side reminds the soldier that his loved one is longing for him and that most of the men he had come with are now dead.

In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet.

2500|$|Greene {{has stated}} that he sees science as {{incompatible}} with literalist interpretations of religion.

I don't {{see the need for}} that; others do." [...] He has also stated that there is much in the New Atheism movement which resonates with him because he personally does not feel the need for religious explanation.
