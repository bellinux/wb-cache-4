500|$|The glamorous {{world of}} Hollywood also {{reflected}} in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that [...] "in Hollywood <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>lose</b> your memory and your vision of the future. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>lose</b> everything because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>lose</b> yourself." [...] The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate {{on the things that}} did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track [...] "Mother and Father". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was [...] "a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on." [...] According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , another concept of American Life was about [...] "nothingness". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But [...] "Nothing Fails", along with tracks [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track [...] "Easy Ride," [...] which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.|$|E

Peat built up over centuries in the marsh can cause fires to burn deep scars in the soil. In 2007, Fred Sklar of the South Florida Water Management District said: [...] "An extreme drought can be viewed (as) almost as catastrophic as a volcano. It can reshape the entire landscape. It can take 1,000 years to produce two inches of peat, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>lose</b> those couple of inches in a week." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when you pay attention, {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; that can be very dangerous because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>lose</b> perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Southern California's {{population}} grew rapidly after World War II, {{there was a}} tremendous demand for church construction. [...] This in turn led to a boom in business for Judson Studios. [...] At the peak in the 1950s, Judson employed 30 craftsmen. [...] Walter W. Judson later recalled, “It got so it almost became counterproductive. [...] It was difficult to keep track of what was going on.” [...] As a result, Horace Judson established a rule that the studio would never again employ more than 15 craftsmen at once. [...] Walter Judson, who took over the business from Horace (his father) in the 1970s, continued that rule, noting, “If you go over 15, you’ll make more money.

As a wrestler, Ventura {{performed}} as a heel and often used the motto: [...] "Win if <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>lose</b> if you must, but always cheat!", even going so far as having himself a T-shirt made with the words printed on the front. Much of his flamboyant persona was adapted from Superstar Billy Graham, a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s. Years later, as a broadcaster, Ventura made a running joke out of it claiming that Graham stole all of his ring attire ideas from him.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{the first}} time that Siouxsie worked with {{producers}} who also physically played on the record, which made a [...] "huge difference". Instead of recording the album in one block session, she commuted from France to Bath to the producers' studio. She made several trips from the end of 2006 to May 2007, concentrating on two or three tracks at the time. This working method provided a useful overview, as she stated: [...] "Sometimes when you're so involved in a project day in day out, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>lose</b> sight of the goal or the object. It puts a different discipline to it". She used technology as a tool, listening to the recording process of the music from home.

2500|$|Gorgeous George {{was soon}} {{recruited}} to Los Angeles by promoter Johnny Doyle. [...] Known as the [...] "Human Orchid", his persona {{was created in}} part by growing his hair long, dyeing it platinum blonde, and putting gold-plated bobby pins in it (which he called [...] "Georgie Pins" [...] and distributed to the audience). Furthermore, he transformed his ring entrance into a bona-fide spectacle that would often take up more time than his actual matches. [...] He strolled nobly to the ring {{to the sounds of}} [...] "Pomp and Circumstance", followed by his valet and a purple spotlight. Wearing an elegant robe sporting an array of sequins, Gorgeous George was always escorted down a personal red carpet by his ring valet [...] "Jeffries", who would carry a silver mirror while spreading rose petals at his feet. While George removed his robe, Jeffries would spray the ring with disinfectant, ostensibly Chanel No. 5 perfume, which George referred to as [...] "Chanel #10" [...] ("Why be half-safe?" [...] he was famous for saying) before he would start wrestling. Moreover, George required that his valets spray the referee's hands before the official was allowed to check him for any illegal objects, which thus prompted his now-famous outcry [...] "Get your filthy hands off me!" [...] Once the match finally began, he would cheat in every way he could. Gorgeous George was the industry's first true cowardly villain, and he would cheat at every opportunity, which infuriated the crowd. His credo was [...] "Win if <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>lose</b> if you must, but always cheat!" [...] This flamboyant image and his showman's ability to work a crowd were so successful {{in the early days of}} television that he became the most famous wrestler of his time, drawing furious heel heat wherever he appeared.|$|E
