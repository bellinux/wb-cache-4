500|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{disclosure of}} the communications intercepted by the United States and Japan revealed {{a considerable amount of}} information about their intelligence systems and capabilities. National Security Agency director Lincoln D. Faurer commented: [...] "...as a result of the Korean Air Lines affair, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> heard more about my business {{in the past two weeks}} than I would desire... For the most part this has not been a matter of unwelcome leaks. It is the result of a conscious, responsible decision to address an otherwise unbelievable horror." [...] Changes that the Soviets subsequently made to their codes and frequencies reduced the effectiveness of this monitoring by 60%.|$|E
500|$|The {{complexity}} in Where are the Cows? includes self-reference, changing rules, and flow charts. It is also worded {{so as to}} provoke confusion between an object (such as red text), a reference to an object (such as the word [...] "red"), and even more subtle references (the word [...] "word"). The maze ends up being so complicated that it can even be difficult {{to work out the}} next move, let alone the end. In this maze, you have to use two hands, each starting at a different place. The instructions in one box might {{have to do with the}} box that the other hand is in, boxes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> left, or complex combinations of the two.|$|E

500|$|The same spring, on 12 May 1787, {{the still}} {{hesitant}} Wilberforce held {{a conversation with}} William Pitt and the future Prime Minister William Grenville as they sat under a large oak tree on Pitt's estate in Kent. Under {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Wilberforce Oak" [...] at Holwood, Pitt challenged his friend: [...] "Wilberforce, why don't you give notice of a motion on the subject of the Slave Trade? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> taken great pains to collect evidence, and are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will ensure you. Do not lose time, or the ground will be occupied by another." [...] Wilberforce's response is not recorded, but he later declared in old age that he could [...] "distinctly remember the very knoll on which I was sitting near Pitt and Grenville" [...] where he made his decision.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Wayne Thomas, in Intrinsic Motivation at Work, {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to Erhard and the est philosophy; Steve Jackson, writing in Westword, similarly included it among [...] "books sympathetic to Erhard, est and Landmark", written by an [...] "old friend of Erhard's". Stephen Goldstein, in a Washington Post review, said Bartley had made it [...] "obvious {{from the start that}} he cares about his subject and his own est experience" [...] and had told [...] "a rather simple, straightforward story that pretty much lets you draw your own conclusions [...] or keep the ones <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> reached." [...] A reviewer in [...] stated he was [...] "enthusiastic about this book", praising the [...] "personal quality [...] the narrative, which, though, sometimes becomes overly detailed." [...] He highly recommended the book for general and college libraries focused on the social sciences.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} heavily criticized for {{its lack of}} originality. Daniel Shannon of GameSpot remarked that [...] "If you have played a first-person shooter {{made in the last}} 10 years, then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> {{experienced}} most of what Alien Rage has to offer.", and continued that [...] "You've seen these weapons before, and you've shot these enemies before". Reviewers especially took issue with the lack of creativity in level design, which Destructoid's Jim Sterling called [...] "tedious corridors full of identical, monotonous, brainless combat encounters". Hardcore Gamers Nikola Suprak commented that several of the levels he played through were visually indistinct from one another, before saying that [...] "level after level of redundant action and repetitive encounters ultimately drag the game down". Critics also noted that the game had a number of technical issues. Sterling ran into two situations where glitches would not allow him to progress without restarting the level, while Sam Turner of The Digital Fix experienced dramatic drops in frame rate during gameplay, and crashed to desktop several times.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its depth. IGN's Doug Perry called GoldenEye 007 an immersive game which [...] "blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship". Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age {{remarked that}} players have [...] "a bit of freedom {{as to what}} they want to do in any given situation, and what order the directives are completed in". Reviewers also enjoyed the wide variety of weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they make the game stay [...] "fresh by never having you do the same thing twice". The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim's earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter [...] Game Revolution credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that GoldenEye 007 [...] "takes it for granted that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> seen the movie" [...] and that players may get stuck due to the game's lack of orientation. At the time, the multiplayer mode was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, [...] "edging Mario Kart 64 by a hair" [...] according to IGN. Edge called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice.|$|E

2500|$|After Pettyfer {{completed}} filming Stormbreaker, he did {{not discuss}} the film with anyone at his school, citing {{the advice of his}} Stormbreaker star Ewan McGregor, who told him to keep his personal and professional lives separate. Pettyfer subsequently decided to leave school and concentrate on his film career, while studying drama at college, saying that [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> experienced going out and working in the real world, and you come back to school, you just see it as a playground and you don't want to be there any more".|$|E

Why don't we just all move to Nazi Germany, where we don't have a justice system and a jury of one's peers?" [...] On June 22, 2006, she featured Sports Illustrated writer Lester Munson who opined, [...] "I think the state has probably a better case than most observers are describing.

2500|$|One day, Jonathan met two gulls {{who took}} him to a [...] "higher plane of existence" [...] in which there was no heaven but a better world found through {{perfection}} of knowledge. There he meets another seagull who loves to fly. He discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn make him [...] "pretty well a one-in-a-million bird." [...] In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous learning, teaching him how to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. The secret, Chiang says, is to [...] "begin by knowing that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> arrived." [...] Not satisfied with his new life, Jonathan returns to Earth to find others like him, to bring them his learning and to spread his love for flight. His mission is successful, gathering around him others who have been outlawed for not conforming. Ultimately, the very first of his students, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, becomes a teacher in his own right, and Jonathan leaves to teach other flocks.|$|E

2500|$|However, by January 1951, {{while the}} Chinese won major {{battles in the}} Korean War and public support at home began to rise, Mao became {{dissatisfied}} by {{the progress of the}} campaign. He argued that the power base of the former landlords and KMT officials had not been broken as a result of leniency, and that further executions are a necessary step. Mao stated, [...] "If we are irresolute and tolerant to this evil, we will ... alienate the people", proposing that further executions should be carried out in areas with large concentration of bandits, [...] "As long as we do not kill the wrong people". [...] On 21 January 1951, Mao sent a telegram to party members in Shanghai: [...] "In a big city like Shanghai, probably it will take one to two thousand executions during this year to solve the problem. In the spring, three to five hundred executions will be needed to suppress the enemy’s arrogance and enhance the people’s morale. In Nanjing, the East China Bureau should direct the party’s municipality committee ... and strive to execute one to two hundred of the most important reactionaries in the spring." [...] A day later, 22 January 1951, Mao told the communists in Guangdong: [...] "It is very good that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> killed more than 3,700. Another three to four thousand should be killed ... the target for this year’s executions may be eight or nine thousand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rock Band 4 {{ships with}} 65 songs on disc, {{spanning}} from the 1960s to the 2010s. The studio also worked {{to ensure that}} as much of its existing library of downloadable songs would be compatible with the game upon its release as possible; 1,500 songs were available at launch. Nearly all existing official Rock Band DLC [...] is compatible with Rock Band 4 within the same console family (i.e. PlayStation 4 can only import songs purchased on PlayStation 3, and Xbox One can only import songs purchased on Xbox 360). Previous disc exports from the previous disc-based games in the series (excluding [...] ), the [...] Track Packs, and from Rock Band Blitz will eventually be available for players, {{as long as they}} have previously performed the disc export; there will be no option to export these songs into Rock Band 4. Rock Band 3 on-disc songs are expected to be exportable into Rock Band 4 in December 2015. [...] "If you bought a Rock Band song, it should be yours in Rock Band 4," [...] said Sussman. [...] "Everything that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> exported will come over." [...] Harmonix has stated they will explore the logistics of bringing songs created by the Rock Band Network into Rock Band 4 after completing the transition of all official DLC, packs, and disc exports. In most cases, existing songs will be updated to use both Freestyle Guitar and Vocals within Rock Band 4.|$|E
