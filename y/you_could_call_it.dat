It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [...] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
2500|$|Gaahl is {{strongly}} opposed to Christianity. He {{has often been}} mistaken as a Satanist, but objects to being labeled as such. In a 1995 interview, he stated: [...] "I am my own God as I am my own Satan. So I'm not a Satanist judging by those terms". He jokingly added: [...] "Maybe <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Gaahlism". He reiterated this belief in the documentary True Norwegian Black Metal when he said: [...] "The god within yourself is the only true god". In an interview for the documentary —at which time he was Gorgoroth's vocalist—Gaahl was asked what inspired the band's music, to which his sole reply was [...] "Satan". When asked what Satan represented, he again answered with a single word: [...] "Freedom".|$|E

And Davidson was {{interested}}. He was interested {{not because the}} hints were exciting but because of that innate curiosity about our fellows which is a trait of human nature. Davidson's existence, too, running the Sissie along the Java Sea and back again, was distinctly monotonous and, in a sense, lonely. He never had any sort of company on board. Native deck-passengers in plenty, of course, but never a white man, so the presence of Heyst for two days {{must have been a}} godsend. Davidson was telling us all about it afterwards. Heyst said that his father had written a lot of books. He was a philosopher.|$|R
5000|$|After {{his release}} in December 1962, Duran {{remained}} active in anti-Castro circles {{and joined the}} Veteran's Association of Brigade 2506, serving as president {{two years in a}} row. During the late 1980s, Duran began to have private misgivings about the advisability of a military solution to obtaining regime change in Cuba. Duran did not go public with his doubts until the early 1990s, after the fall of Soviet Union. Duran's former comrades were outraged that {{a former president of the}} Veteran's Association of Brigade 2506 was advocating peaceful dialogue with the communist government of Cuba. Duran told Frontline: [...] "To the right wing or more conservative community here in Miami, a dialogado is the worst thing that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be <b>called.</b> <b>It</b> implies that you're a traitor." [...] The Veteran's Association of Brigade 2506 expelled Duran in a public rebuke in 1993.|$|R
6000|$|No {{one knows}} how the title of [...] "The Trade" [...] came {{to be applied to}} the Submarine Service.

6000|$|... "You're {{doing the}} humble {{dependent}} now," [...] he said: [...] "you do it beautifully, {{as you do}} everything." [...] She replied that she didn't make it humble enough--she couldn't; she was too proud, too insolent in her triumph. She liked that, the triumph, too much, and she didn't mind telling him she was perfectly happy. Of course as yet the triumph was very limited; but success was success, whatever its quantity; the dish was a small one but had the right taste. Her imagination had already bounded beyond the first phase unexpectedly great as this had been: her position struck her as modest compared with the probably future now vivid to her. Peter {{had never seen her}} so soft and sympathetic; she had insisted in Paris that her personal character was that of the good girl--she used the term in a fine loose way--and it was impossible to be a better girl than she showed herself this pleasant afternoon. She was full of gossip and anecdote and drollery; she had exactly the air he would have wished her to have--that of thinking of no end of things to tell him. It was as if she had just returned from a long journey and had had strange adventures and made wonderful discoveries. She began to speak of this and that, then broke off to speak of something else; she talked of the theatre, of the [...] "critics," [...] and above all of London, of the people she had met and the extraordinary things they said to her, of the parts she was going to take up, of lots of new ideas that had come to her about the art of comedy. She wanted to do comedy now--to do the comedy of London life. She was delighted to find that seeing more of the world suggested things to her; they came straight from the fact, from nature, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> nature; she was thus convinced more than ever that the artist ought to live so as to get on with his business, gathering ideas and lights from experience--ought to welcome any experience that would give him lights. But work of course was experience, and everything in one's life that was good was work. That was the jolly thing in the actor's trade--it made up for other elements that were odious: if you only kept your eyes open nothing could happen to you that wouldn't be food for observation and grist to your mill, showing you how people looked and moved and spoke, cried and grimaced, writhed and dissimulated, in given situations. She saw all round her things she wanted to [...] "do"--London bristled with them if you had eyes to see. She was fierce to know why people didn't take them up, put them into plays and parts, give one a chance with them; she expressed her sharp impatience of the general literary bétise. She had never been chary of this particular displeasure, and there were moments--it was an old story and a subject of frank raillery to Sherringham--when to hear her you might have thought there was no cleverness anywhere but in her own splendid impatience. She wanted tremendous things done that she might use them, but she didn't pretend to say exactly what they were to be, nor even approximately how they were to be handled: her ground was rather that if she only had a pen--it was exasperating to have to explain! She mainly contented herself with the view that nothing had really been touched: she felt that more and more as she saw more of people's goings-on.|$|E

To be sure, in the morning, when stooping backs begin to round the curtains out, and half-shod feet to thrust into the narrow gangway between them, the effect is of a familiarity, an intimacy; but so much trust, so much brotherly kindness goes with it all that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>call</b> <b>it</b> indecency, though certainly <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not claim it privacy. It only proves, as that friend of ours was saying, that money cannot buy everything, and that, if you expect the Pullman parlor-cars to be an improvement on the German first-class cars, you will be disappointed, probably. First-class cars vary much all over Europe; even second-class cars do. In Austria they are not nearly so good as in Germany, and in Italy--poor, dear Italy!--they are worse still. That is because, the enemies of socialism say, the roads are state roads, or because, the friends of socialism say, the expropriated companies have dumped their worn-out rolling-stock on the commonwealth, which must bear the shame of it with the stranger. Between these clashing claims we will not put our blade. All we say is that Italian railroad travel is as bad as heart could wish--the heart that loves Italy and holds dear the memory of the days when there were few railroads, if any, there, and one still went by diligence or vettura. The only absolutely good railroad travel is in England, where the corridor car imagined from the Pullman has realized the most exacting ideal of the traveller of any class. In the matter of dining-cars we have stood still (having attained perfection at a bound), while the English diner has shot ahead in simplicity and quality of refection. With us a dollar buys more dinner than you wish or like; with them three shillings pay for an elegant sufficiency, and a tip of sixpence purchases an explicit gratitude from the waiter which a quarter is often helpless to win from his dark antitype with us.
