500|$|... "Have <b>You</b> <b>Met</b> Miss Jones?" [...] is a ballad {{from the}} Broadway comedy I'd Rather Be Right, {{introduced}} on stage by Joy Hodges and Austin Marshall. The song was composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Lorenz Hart. Its bridge may {{have served as}} an inspiration to John Coltrane's 1959 composition [...] "Giant Steps". Female singers often sing it as [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Met</b> Sir Jones?".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics make {{reference}} to Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and have three parts to the vocal harmony. Andrzej Ciuk, one of {{the editors of the}} book Exploring Space noted that the proverbial status of the phrase [...] "opposites attract" [...] as a defining key ingredient of cultural concept of [...] "love" [...] and this was evident also in the song with the lyrics: [...] "You met your match when <b>you</b> <b>met</b> me, I know that you'll disagree its crazy, But opposites attract you'll see, And I won't let you get away so easy".|$|E

500|$|The Romantic poets {{were more}} profoundly {{affected}} by Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark than anyone, except perhaps Godwin. The poet Robert Southey, for example, {{wrote to his}} publisher: [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>met</b> with Mary Wollstonecraft's ? She has made me {{in love with a}} cold climate, and frost and snow, with a northern moonlight." [...] The book's combination of progressive social views with the advocacy of individual subjective experience influenced writers such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Wollstonecraft's [...] "incarnational theory of the creative imagination" [...] paved the way for Wordsworth's thorough treatment of the imagination and its relation to the self in BookV of The Prelude (1805; 1850). Her book also had a significant influence on Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1797–99) and Percy Shelley's Alastor (1815); their depictions of [...] "quest for a settled home" [...] strongly resemble Wollstonecraft's. The most striking homage to Wollstonecraft's work, however, is in Coleridge's famous poem [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] (1797; 1816). Not only does much of his style descend from the book, but at one point he alludes to Wollstonecraft as he is describing a cold wasteland: ...|$|E
500|$|During {{its first}} run, Bringing Up Baby made $715,000 in the U.S. and $394,000 in foreign markets {{for a total}} of $1,109,000; its reissue in 1940 and 1941 made an {{additional}} $95,000 in the US and $55,000 in foreign markets. Following its second run, the film made a profit of $163,000. Due to its perceived failure, Hawks was released early from his two-film contract with RKO and Gunga Din was eventually directed by George Stevens. Hawks later said the film [...] "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone <b>you</b> <b>met</b> was a screwball and since that time I learned my lesson and don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". The director went on to work with RKO on three films over the next decade. Long before Bringing Up Babys release, Hepburn had been branded [...] "box-office poison" [...] by Harry Brandt (president of the Independent Theatre Owners of America) and thus was allowed to buy out her RKO contract for $22,000. However, many critics marveled at her new skill at low comedy; Life magazine called her [...] "the surprise of the picture". Hepburn's former boyfriend Howard Hughes bought RKO in 1941, and sold it in 1959; when he sold the company, Hughes retained the copyright to six films (including Bringing Up Baby).|$|E
500|$|In 1987, Dominican {{musician}} Roberto del Castillo covered [...] "Hasta Que Te Conocí" [...] in merengue on his album Justo a Tiempo. His version {{peaked at}} number eleven on the Hot Latin Songs chart. Mexican singer Ana Gabriel performed a live {{cover of the}} song on her album En Vivo (1990). Her version peaked at number twenty-five on the Hot Latin Songs chart. In 1994, Argentine pianist Raúl di Blasio covered the song on his album Piano de America, Vol. 2. di Blasio's cover was released to radio stations on May 10, 1994. It features Gabriel performing the vocals which was omitted on the Anglo version of the song. di Blasio's version peaked at number thirty-six on the Hot Latin Songs. It has been featured on his compilation albums Entre Amigos y Exitos (2003) and La Historia del Piano de América... Los Éxitos (2006) and on Gabriel's album Mis Canciones, Mis Amigos (2009). A music video for the Anglo version was released by BMG and was included on the DVD set for La Historia del Piano de América... Los Éxitos (2006). Mexican singer Pilar Montenegro included {{a version of the}} track featuring rapper Voltio on her album South Beach in 2005. In 2009, Mexican recording artist Anahí sampled the record on her song [...] "Hasta Que Me Conociste" [...] ("Until <b>You</b> <b>Met</b> Me") from her album Mi Delirio, in which the song is written as a [...] "response" [...] to the original composition.|$|E

2500|$|..... no American {{orchestra}} {{matches the}} L.A. Philharmonic {{in its ability}} to assimilate a huge range of music on a moment's notice. [...] Adès, who first conducted his own music in L.A. [...] and has become an annual visitor, told me, [...] "They always seem to begin by finding exactly the right playing style for each piece of music—the kind of sound, the kind of phrasing, breathing, attacks, colors, the indefinable whole. That shouldn't be unusual, but it is." [...] John Adams calls the Philharmonic [...] "the most Amurrican [...] of orchestras. They don't hold back and they don't put on airs. If <b>you</b> <b>met</b> them in twos or threes, you'd have no idea they were playing in an orchestra, that they were classical-music people." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{evidence}} was often not just non-existent but absurd, with Hungarian George Paloczi-Horváth’s party interrogators delightedly exclaiming [...] "We {{knew all the}} time—we have it here in writing—that <b>you</b> <b>met</b> professor Szentgyörgyi not in Istanbul, but in Constantinople." [...] In another case, the Hungarian ÁVH secret police also condemned another party member as a Nazi accomplice with a document that had actually been previously displayed in glass cabinet of the Institute of the Working Class Movement {{as an example of}} a Gestapo forgery. The trials themselves were [...] "shows", with each participant having to learn a script and conduct repeated rehearsals before the performance. [...] In the Slánský trial, when the judge skipped one of the scripted questions, the better-rehearsed Slánský answered the one which should have been asked.|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiographical novel, Infants of the Spring, Thurman {{referred}} to the Harlem literati, whose pretensions he often considered to be spurious and whose achievements he often considered to be second-rate, as the Niggerati. [...] (In the novel, Sweetie May Carr, a character modelled on the real-life Hurston, christens the Harlem rooming house where Dr Parkes, modelled on the real life Alain Locke, establishes a salon of artists, Niggerati Manor, just as Thurman's own rooming house was in real life.) [...] Thurman himself was infamous amongst that literati, although popular amongst the younger, bohemian, crowd. [...] Thurman rejected what he called [...] "society Negroes". [...] He himself, as many others of the literati did, would hold parties on Saturday nights, which Langston Hughes described in The Big Sea by observing that [...] "at Wallace Thurman's <b>you</b> <b>met</b> the bohemians of both Harlem and the Village." [...] Recalling the days of Niggerati Manor, Theophilus Lewis wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|One such theory {{concerns}} Alf Boxall, who {{was reportedly}} involved in intelligence work during {{and immediately after}} World War II. In a 1978 television interview Stuart Littlemore asks: [...] "Mr Boxall, you had been working, hadn't you, in an intelligence unit, before <b>you</b> <b>met</b> this young woman [...] Did {{you talk to her}} about that at all?" [...] In reply, Boxall says [...] "no," [...] and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies [...] "not unless somebody else told her." [...] When Littlemore suggests in the interview {{that there may have been}} an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: [...] "It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?" [...] Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from Lance Corporal to Lieutenant within three months.|$|E
2500|$|Reiss {{studied at}} Harvard University. Reiss has stated that, as an institution, he hates Harvard, {{explaining}} that [...] "I had an epiphany on my third day there: This place {{would be just}} as good as a summer camp where <b>you</b> <b>met</b> other people, networked, and learned from them. I feel the education I got there was distant and useless and uncaring. I feel they sort of squandered my youth and my father’s savings." [...] Reiss studied English, but disliked the course and was rejected from a creative writing class. Reiss focused his attention on comedy, performing in talent shows and writing. In Holworthy Hall at Harvard, Reiss met fellow freshman Al Jean; they befriended one another and collaborated their writing efforts for the humor publication Harvard Lampoon. Reiss became co-president of the Harvard Lampoon, alongside Jon Vitti. Jeff Martin, another writer for the Lampoon, said Reiss and Jean [...] "definitely loomed large around the magazine. They were very funny guys and unusually polished comedy writers for that age. We were never surprised that they went on to success." [...] Jean has also stated that the duo spent most of their time at the Lampoon, adding that [...] "it was practically my second dorm room." ...|$|E

2500|$|When he {{appeared}} before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 15 July 2003, Kelly appeared to be under severe stress which was probably increased by the televising of the proceedings. He spoke with a voice so soft that the air-conditioning equipment had to be turned off {{even though it was}} one of the hottest days of the year. His evidence to the committee was that he had not said the things Gilligan had reported his source as saying, and members of the committee came to the conclusion that he had not been the source. Some of the questioning was very precise. The Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay, in particular, used a forceful tone in his cross-examination. For example, when asked to simply list the journalists that he met, Kelly declined to answer and requested that such a list be sought from the MoD, which triggered a response: [...] "...This is the high court of Parliament and I want you to tell the Committee who <b>you</b> <b>met...</b> You are under an obligation to reply". [...] The Chairman of the Committee (Donald Anderson) underscored the validity of MacKinlay's question telling Kelly: [...] "It is a proper question... If you have met journalists there is nothing sinister in itself about meeting journalists, save in an unauthorised way." [...] Mackinlay offered his opinion that Kelly had been used by Gilligan telling Kelly: [...] "I reckon you are chaff; you have been thrown up to divert our probing. Have you ever felt like a fall-guy? You have been set up, have you not?" ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{arrangement}} {{was made with}} Ronnie Storm (no connection to Rory Storm) to back him on the single release [...] "My Desire", and it was released under the pseudonym [...] "Fuzzy and The Barnets" [...] due to contractual difficulties encountered by Storm. At the same time Steve Rowland, of Family Dogg, heard the band playing live on Radio One Club and offered to sign them to his production company. He arranged for Albert Hammond, who was also in Family Dogg, to write a number for the band, which Hammond duly did. This track was entitled [...] "It Never Rains in Southern California", but {{before it could be}} released, he decided that he wanted to record it for himself. Kelly was later asked by Steve Rowland to play drums on it. Accordingly, Hammond wrote a few other songs for the band, and a single [...] "You Ring a Bell"/"Have <b>You</b> <b>Met</b> Angela" [...] was recorded and prepared for release, but due to various problems in Rowland's organisation, it was never released. In late 1971 the band's management was taken over by Dave Eager, the BBC Radio One DJ, and Norman suffered a serious infection that affected his vocal cords. After his recovery, his voice sounded much rougher, which the other group members considered an interesting addition to their sound. Eager introduced them to Decca, which resulted in recordings in February 1972, their first single being [...] "Oh Julie"/"I Love You Carolina". Shortly thereafter, their next single was released. [...] "Let the Good Times Roll" [...] was liked by the media and was selected as the show's opening theme for Emperor Rosko's BBC Radio One Saturday show, but this popularity did not translate into record sales. The last single on Decca was [...] "Make it Better"/"Lonely Long Lady", which flopped and led to Decca terminating their contracts.|$|E
