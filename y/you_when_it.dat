2500|$|Kierkegaard came to {{hope that}} no one would retain their sins even though they have been forgiven. And by the same token that no one who truly {{believed}} in the forgiveness of sin would live their own life as an objection against the existence of forgiveness. He made the point that Cato committed suicide before Caesar had a chance to forgive him. This fear of not finding forgiveness is devastating. Edna H. Hong quoted Kierkegaard in her 1984 book, Forgiveness is a Work As Well As a Grace and Kierkegaard wrote about forgiveness in 1847. [...] In 1954, Samuel Barber set to music Kierkegaard's prayer, [...] "Father in Heaven! Hold not our sins up against us but hold us up against our sins so that the thought of <b>You</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> wakens in our soul, and each time it wakens, should not remind us of what we have committed but of what You did forgive, not of how we went astray but of how You did save us!" ...|$|E

Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>it</b> gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it." [...] Bukowski was an atheist.|$|E
