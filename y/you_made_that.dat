60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. <b>You</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> {{promise to}} me once before and broke it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ed'ard Cuttle, my lad, {{you never}} shaped a better course in your life, than when <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> there little {{property}} over, jintly!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I cannot {{understand}} why," [...] she pursued, [...] "if you didn't {{know it was}} Sister Sarah, <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> {{sudden change}} in your story." ...|$|E
60|$|ANOTHER. What a fool <b>you</b> <b>made</b> of <b>that</b> monk in the market-place! He had {{not a word}} to say.|$|R
6000|$|I say to them, What {{else are}} <b>you</b> <b>made</b> for? It shuts them up. They haven't {{a word to}} answer. What else are <b>you</b> <b>made</b> for? <b>That</b> clinches it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's disappointing to {{find that}} at heart you are sentimental. I should have liked you better if <b>you</b> hadn't <b>made</b> <b>that</b> ingenuous appeal to my sympathies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes"--and Leland made {{a little}} gesture--"I think it would with you. Still, you see, the fact that <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> promise was in one way an {{astonishing}} thing to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They's {{three of}} 'em," [...] Shorty whispered. [...] "You oughta saw 'em. Say, when <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> bucket-dump noise they was fair quiverin'. They's {{one at the}} window now tryin' to peek in." ...|$|E
6000|$|What is your substance, whereof are <b>you</b> <b>made,</b> <b>That</b> {{millions}} of strange shadows on you tend? Since every one hath, every one, one shade, And you, but one, can every shadow lend - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You grazed on the bar. Just look astern {{and see if}} you didn't. Look at {{the track}} she left. You can see it plainly. Upon my soul, I thought <b>you</b> would! What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> do <b>that?</b> What on earth <b>made</b> <b>you</b> do <b>that?</b> I believe you are trying to scare me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you thought}} wrong," [...] I answered, [...] "and what is more, if <b>you</b> had <b>made</b> <b>that</b> visit I {{think it might}} have been one from which you would never have come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} man who {{answered}} <b>you</b> already <b>made</b> <b>that</b> clear. To prevent anybody's getting over. Once you recognize {{that it would be}} difficult to do it without our permission, we'll go a little further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Billie, are you still--crazy about me? Now, don't come so close. Can't you behave yourself? And don't {{break my}} fingers with you terrible {{baseball}} hands.... Well, when <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> hit I just collapsed and I said----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Talking of business,’ {{interposed}} Mr. Barton, {{from the}} centre of the table. ‘A gentleman whom you knew very well, Malderton, before <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> first lucky spec of yours, called at our shop the other day, and—’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It'll be good, all right," [...] assured Diana, {{who was a}} very {{comfortable}} sort of friend. [...] "I'm sure that piece of the one <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> we had for lunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, that's {{what the}} beaten {{have always said}} of great conquerors. But see, there's the {{sunshine}} falling on the board, to show you more clearly what a foolish move <b>you</b> <b>made</b> with <b>that</b> pawn. Come, shall I give you another chance?" ...|$|R
60|$|DEARTH. Oh, <b>you.</b> He <b>made</b> {{no bones}} about it; said there was {{something}} about <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him want uncommonly to have you down here.|$|R
6000|$|... "The matter is, sir, that I {{find that}} by your attentions <b>you</b> have <b>made</b> <b>that</b> poor girl, Miss Fregelius, {{while she was}} a guest in my house, the object of slander and scandal to every ill-natured gossip in the three parishes." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{professor}} paid {{no attention}} to these words. [...] "I came here," [...] he said, [...] "to demand of you why <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> absurd and malicious charge against me the other day. Such charges are not passed over in France, but I will {{give you a chance to}} explain yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not half so clever as you were, Asti, when <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> monkey {{come out}} of the vase," [...] {{answered}} Tua, laughing somewhat hysterically. [...] "Oh! do not look innocent, I know it was your magic, for I could feel it passing over my head. How did you do it, Asti?" ...|$|E
60|$|KATHERINE. Last night I was ready. You couldn't. If you couldn't then, {{you never}} can. You are very exalted, Stephen. I don't like living--I won't live, with one whose equal I am not. This {{has been coming}} ever since <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> speech. I told you that night what the end would be.|$|E
6000|$|SHE: [...] "Ask {{it across}} the table, then." [...] After a moment's reflection, [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>you</b> suffer--I <b>made</b> <b>you</b> suffer--so <b>that</b> {{you might have a}} realizing sense of what <b>you</b> had <b>made</b> ME suffer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't strange. I've had English ideas {{impressed}} on me pretty forcibly {{during the}} last few months. But <b>you</b> <b>made</b> a statement <b>that</b> surprised me. Does Colston trust me?" ...|$|R
30|$|What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> say <b>that</b> {{these are}} rubrics’ disadvantages? Cite {{specific}} examples if possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "I liked {{your speech}} so much, Mr. Paret," [...] she told me. [...] "It seemed so {{sensible}} and--controlled, {{compared to the}} others. I have never thought {{a great deal about}} these things, of course, and I never understood before why taking away the tariff caused so much misery. <b>You</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> quite plain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Made fast?" [...] {{the captain}} snarled back, {{for the benefit}} of the watch as it {{struggled}} to capture the flying sail before it tore to ribbons. [...] "You couldn't make your grandmother fast, you useless scullion. If <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> sheet fast with an extra turn, why didn't it stay fast? That's what I want to know. Why didn't it stay fast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate, Harry, if <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> resolution, it was {{not worth}} much, as you gave it up at the first opportunity. I was the first girl you met, when you arrived in England; and I doubt whether you had seen another, before we came down to stay at Netherly. I {{had not been there}} two days before you began to make love to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{get them}} if you're not careful," [...] was the threat, {{and the speaker}} jerked Black's feet from under him. [...] "I was told to remind <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>made</b> trouble <b>that</b> a sheriff {{on this side of}} the {{frontier}} had some papers describing you. There's one or two patrolmen yonder handy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; since <b>you</b> have <b>made</b> <b>that</b> promise,' said Guy; and for {{the first}} time she saw the full beauty of his smile--a sort of {{sweetness}} and radiance of which eye and brow partook almost as much as the lips. It alone would have gained her heart.|$|R
5000|$|... "Who Broke Your Heart and <b>Made</b> <b>You</b> Write <b>That</b> Song?" [...] (Michael Chain) - 3:23 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Made fast?" [...] the Captain snarled back, for {{the benefit}} of the watch as it {{struggled}} to capture the flying sail before it tore to ribbons. [...] "You couldn't make your grandmother fast, you useless hell's scullion. If <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> sheet fast with an extra turn, why in hell didn't it stay fast? That's what I want to know. Why in hell didn't it stay fast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{one of the}} Captain's chief delights is, that {{he knows}} the big watch, and the sugar-tongs, and tea-spoons, are on board: {{and again and again}} he murmurs to himself, 'Ed'ard Cuttle, my lad, you never shaped a better course in your life than when <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> there little {{property}} over jintly. You see how the land bore, Ed'ard,' says the Captain, 'and it does you credit, my lad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's enough! You'll do it," [...] {{said she}} enthusiastically. [...] "Lordy! Just you talk for ME as ye did for HIS old Ditch Company, and you'll fetch it--every time! Why, when <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> jury sit {{up the other}} day--when you got that off about the Merrikan flag waving equally over the rights of honest {{citizens}} banded together in peaceful commercial pursuits, as well as over the fortress of official proflig--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not altogether, said Robert. 'If <b>you</b> <b>made</b> any {{mistakes}} <b>that</b> {{led to a}} confusion of real and unreal in his mind, still, the real good you did to him is incalculable.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have many}} guests," [...] he said, [...] "who {{will be looking}} for you. Let me know why <b>you</b> <b>made</b> me treat <b>that</b> young man so badly, and then go away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Many {{years have}} gone by, Macumazahn, since <b>you</b> <b>made</b> use of <b>that</b> stool. They are cut in notches upon the leg you hold {{and you may}} count them if you will." ...|$|R
