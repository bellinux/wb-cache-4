[...] "Nothing is square and, although you can't put <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it, {{it just makes}} you feel like something is not right". [...] Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. [...] "In the real world, the colors are bright and rich," [...] Willet said. [...] "In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. [...] Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic".|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E
500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's my responsibility to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm going to wind up having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't put <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on,</b> can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the interval music works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to clarify her answer, she {{proposed}} a shell game [...] to illustrate: [...] "You look away, and I put a pea under one of three shells. Then I ask you to put <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> a shell. The odds that your choice contains a pea are , agreed? Then I simply lift up an empty shell from the remaining other two. As I can (and will) do this regardless of what you've chosen, we've learned nothing {{to allow us to}} revise the odds on the shell under your finger." [...] She also proposed a similar simulation with three playing cards.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{track on}} the album is [...] "Manos al Aire", an uptempo dance-influenced track, which Furtado says is about [...] "having a heated argument" [...] with her love interest. During the chorus, she puts up the [...] "white flag" [...] and [...] "surrenders" [...] to him. Another song from the album entitled, [...] "Bajo Otra Luz", Furtado proclaimed, is about [...] "when {{you are in a}} {{relationship}} and you are under a light. You feel like something is glowing on you and there is something different about the world. You can’t put <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] The seventh track, [...] "Suficiente Tiempo", is a description of the busy life of an overworked wife who is [...] "trying to make time for a date night". Furtado said that the album was [...] "purposefully collaboration-heavy" [...] because she [...] "want it to sound like a community effort. I wanted it to have all those layers of experience" [...] She also collaborated with Josh Groban on a song entitled, [...] "Silencio" [...] and called the collaboration a [...] "huge blessing." [...] She felt it was important to feature [...] "an artist that people know more for their English recordings" [...] because she wanted to demonstrate that [...] "language isn't a barrier when it comes to music." ...|$|E

Imagine, he proposes, placing <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> five separate objects in a scene. As those objects move about, <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> stay in respective contact with each of them, allowing you to continually track their whereabouts and positions relative to one another. While {{you may not be able}} to discern in this way any detailed information about the items themselves, the presence of <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> provides a reference via which you can access such information at any time, without having to relocate the objects within the scene. Furthermore, the objects' continuity over time is inherently maintained — you know the object referenced by <b>your</b> pinky <b>finger</b> at time t is the same object as that referenced by your pinky at t−1, regardless of any spatial transformations it has undergone, because <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> has remained in continuous contact with it.|$|R
