It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to keep that in mind.|$|E
500|$|Among Bedouins {{and most}} other Arabs {{throughout}} the region of Palestine, bitter coffee, known as qahwah sadah (Lit. plain coffee), {{was a symbol of}} hospitality. Pouring the drink was ceremonial; it would involve the host or his eldest son moving clockwise among guests—who were judged by age and status—pouring coffee into tiny cups from a brass pot. It was considered [...] "polite" [...] for guests to accept only three cups of coffee and then end their last cup by saying daymen, meaning [...] "always", but intending to mean [...] "may <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the means to serve coffee".|$|E
500|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, the company's {{growth has been}} fueled by an {{increase}} in broadband Internet access, which loads virtual catalogs faster than dial-up Internet access. When catalogs first appeared online in the late 1990s, the graphics took too long to load. After high-speed Internet access became more popular, virtual catalogs quickly grew to become a popular feature of online stores. In addition to faster Internet connectivity, a study in 2000 noted that an online presence for brick and mortar businesses increased offline sales by an average of 27%. Mack also pointed out that having more product information disseminated helps play a role in increasing sales: [...] "We have the ability to provide consistent information... One of the advantages of selling furniture online is the hyperscript; <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the original specifications on a product." ...|$|E

500|$|The UANC {{delegation}} was led, as expected, by Muzorewa {{and included}} Sithole representing ZANU, Nkomo for ZAPU and James Chikerema, the former ZAPU vice-president, {{for a third}} militant party, the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe. According to Rhodesian intelligence, the various nationalist factions had not patched up their differences, were not prepared to accept Muzorewa as their leader and, to this end, were hoping that the conference failed to produce an agreement. The Rhodesians relayed these concerns to Pretoria, which told them firmly that the UANC would surely not risk losing the support of Kaunda and the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere by deliberately sabotaging the peace process. When the Rhodesians persisted in their complaints, citing evidence of nationalist infighting in Lusaka, the South Africans were terser still, eventually wiring Salisbury: [...] "If you don't like what we are offering, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the alternative of going it alone!" ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|To help {{differentiate}} the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the [...] "tomboy", clothing her in earthy colours {{because of her}} love of the countryside. For the other sisters, Durran remarked, [...] "Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets have no money. One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee {{in a kind of}} teenage way. I tried to make it so that they'd be sort of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a visual asymmetry between the two." [...] In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable dresses that allowed the actors better moveability.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, Whorf {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the allophone, a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition. Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single phoneme in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even {{to the point that they}} are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: [...] " [...] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [...] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to keep the observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes like is like, and what it makes unlike is unlike".(Whorf, 1940) ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Zap2it wrote, [...] "Sure, Blair's (Leighton Meester) {{been dreaming}} of her fairytale wedding {{since she was}} just a little girl. But it's also true that producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming of this moment for a long time as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In {{what has come to be}} sort of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love <b>you,</b> <b>always</b> <b>have,</b> always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E
2500|$|Thirty {{years after}} the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte {{suggested}} in The Daily Beast that [...] "we owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer {{when it comes to}} showing the world how to recover when you’ve been unjustly shamed for being sexual. Williams could have slunk off into the shadows in shame, which no doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of." [...] In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight by stating that [...] "you can't give up ... <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay your progress for the moment, but <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to remember who you are, and that will give you the eyes on the prize." ...|$|E

2500|$|Parks {{chose to}} film {{in areas of}} the Deep South where Northup labored in slavery. The {{director}} sought to have a crew of mixed races, he said [...] "perhaps to show the Southerners how Blacks and Whites could work together". In his memoir, Parks recalled the mix: Japanese American cinematographer Hiro Narita, a black producer and assistant director, a mostly white crew, and a black costume lady who was assisted by a woman from Hong Kong. He filmed Solomon Northup's Odyssey in three weeks' time in Savannah, Georgia. Parks said of the final product, [...] "I can't say I don't like the film; I think it's a powerful film, {{but it could have been}} stronger. But you meet that sort of crisis on every film; there are some sort of compromises <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to make." ...|$|E
2500|$|Salman Ahmed {{while talking}} about his latest project at Asia Talk on BBC said, [...] "For almost a decade, Junaid has always asked me not to bring guitar or {{to ask him to}} sing. When you are friends with {{somebody}} <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to transcend differences and I respect Junaid's views. Junaid once told me that his biggest regret was not {{to be a part of}} Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with 'Naya Pakistan', I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all." [...] and further added [...] "it signifies the metaphor for unity as we have to compromise for unity in hope of Naya Pakistan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} album, which involved creating [...] "microloops" [...] that involved building up one-bar samples into multiple bars {{that would make}} up a full song, Palomo said that in composing this album, he recorded a riff from a sound he made and tried to [...] "keep that momentum up". On Era Extraña, {{in order to develop}} ideas he was having while recording the record, it was necessary for him to have more control of the effects and instruments he was using for the album. Making the album helped him learn how to create synth sounds and become a [...] "gear geek", instead of relying on presets as he did with his previous works. He said, [...] "The more tedious aspects of production do have the capacity to take the wind out of your sails, so <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to navigate through that as quickly as you can before you start feeling burnt on the song, before you forget that initial spark that made you even want to write it in the first place".|$|E

2500|$|Production on K.I.S.S. was {{primarily}} handled by local Cleveland native producer Young Yonny with additional contributions from Japanese musicians Jeff Miyahara and Daisuke Imai, Chuck Harmony and longtime collaborators Carvin & Ivan. As always {{and just as}} she did before with her last 3 independently—released projects, Mýa took full creative control of the album. Harrison lent {{a hand in the}} songwriting process; co-writing several of the album's tracks with many different artists and songwriters and served as executive producer to the project. Guest features included Miami rapper Trina, international recording artist Iyaz, reggae star Sean Paul and ex Immature frontman Marques Houston. The album is a representation of Mýa's life today. [...] "It's about being cool and drama-free. And everything I do reflects that," [...] she said in a recent interview. [...] "The people that I associate with, the circle that I keep is real simple and sometimes we think or we're trained to believe that <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to have more, more, more to make ourselves feel happy or beautiful, but it's the other way around for me.

2500|$|In an MTV News {{interview}} with Simpson on December 18, 2007, Simpson {{said that the}} album's title would be Bittersweet World, also {{the name of one}} of the album's songs; she said that she had also considered the title Color Outside the Lines, a line from the song [...] "Rule Breaker". She described the title Bittersweet World as reflecting how she [...] "feel about the world right now" [...] and later said that the song [...] "Bittersweet World" [...] is [...] "basically about how with the bad comes the good in pretty much every situation and vice versa. There are hard things, but <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to find the positive." [...] Simpson did the photoshoot for the album with photographer Ben Watts in Los Angeles. The photoshoot took place while Simpson still had blonde hair; she subsequently dyed it red in January 2008. Simpson described the style of the photoshoot as [...] "street-oriented" [...] and referred to the importance of having the photoshoot reflect herself, the album, and what she experienced while recording it. Some of the shots were done in a studio, while others were done outside at Venice Beach.|$|E
2500|$|Things That Happen Again: For a Here and a There (1986-1991) was {{installed}} at the Chinati Foundation by Donald Judd and Roni Horn in 1988. The work consists of two identical truncated cones that are 35 inches long, tapering from a diameter of 17 inches to 12 inches. [...] The pair {{is part of a}} 1986-1991 suite consisting of four sets of paired, solid copper forms, each hand-lathed to duplicate mechanical identity. The entire suite is titled Things That Happen Again, and also includes For Two Rooms, For a This and a That, and For Things that are Near. In describing the piece's intention, Horn states the importance of the two objects' apparent duplicity: The narrative involves the recognition of uniqueness through the sequential experience of things which are identical. Then the subsequent and irreversible loss of the unique identity. Obviously the notion of being identical is a purely ideal one since when you have two things, no matter how perfect the identity, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a this and a that, a here and a there. In both pieces we’re talking about the critical role of relation in defining the form.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The game {{ended with}} a final score of 79–10. North Texas's points came on a field goal {{in the third quarter}} and a 69-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza to Casey Fitzgerald {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter. The Mean Green finished with 15 yards rushing and 232 yards passing. All three of Oklahoma's quarterbacks saw gametime. Joey Halzle followed Bradford in the third quarter and completed four of his five pass attempts. Nichol finished the game, but did not attempt a pass. The Sooners had 668 yards of total offense against North Texas, the 11th-highest in school history to that point, and 403 passing yards, the fifth-highest in school history to that point. Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t really help either. They got on the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock. I’m not criticizing, I’m just saying that the style of play doesn’t help either.” Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer agreed: [...] "They had no game plan for losing… Because when you can't win a game, you need to run the clock, don't let it stop, don't throw passes incomplete… get the game over with, get on the bus and go home." [...] Stoops requested a running clock for the fourth quarter, but the request was not granted. North Texas's coach handled the loss well and held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win.
