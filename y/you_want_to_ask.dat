6000|$|Their {{eyes had}} to meet on it, and to meet long; Maggie's avoided at least the disgrace of looking away. [...] "What makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|That is Lady Why's concern, and not ours. Meanwhile {{he has a}} {{right to}} find out if he can. But what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him next? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is there {{nothing else}} that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me, Macumazahn?" [...] asked the old dwarf, tossing back {{his long hair}} and looking at--I had almost written through--me.|$|E
6000|$|... "What can I do, Fernando?--they are hungry, I suppose. I thought <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{my advice}} about these prisoners--poor fellows! {{and here you}} are with your hens." ...|$|R
6000|$|The tears {{started from}} Adeline's eyes; she fell weakly {{back in her}} chair and let them run silently down her worn face. After a while Putney said, gently, [...] "Was this all <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A novena wall {{painting}} in France, with tagline, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> my divine son?".|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, I knew {{we should}} have trouble over it. What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> such {{questions}} for? I dare say I am a fool to be so frank.' ...|$|E
60|$|But now I see <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a {{question}}. Let us have it out. I would sooner answer {{one question}} of yours than tell you ten things without your asking.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor {{crossed over}} to Horton, {{who sat in}} a corner. [...] "If there is {{anything}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him lose no time," [...] he said. [...] "The man can't last until the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I--er--no, thank <b>you.</b> I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question. What is your candid {{opinion of}} those verses Mr Wells was reading just now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been working}} here {{nearly two years}} now under <b>you.</b> I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> tell me frankly {{if you think it}} worth while for me to continue." ...|$|R
50|$|Do {{not begin}} to eat or drink until the oldest man at the table has been served and has begun. <b>You</b> may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your host when it is {{appropriate}} to begin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} that you came," [...] I said, [...] "but, of course, I will answer any {{question}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me. Don't hurry! You {{are out of}} breath. Let me give you some wine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite. You see a girl {{alone for}} about five minutes a day, and if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her to be your wife, you've got to charge into it as if you were trying to grab the gold ring on a merry-go-round." ...|$|E
6000|$|About {{that moving}} ice, which is Mrs. How's {{stronger}} spade, I {{will tell you}} some other time; and show you, too, the marks of it in every gravel pit about here. But now, I see, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a question; and what is it? ...|$|E
30|$|I {{think that}} itâ€™s good just to start {{yourself}} {{thinking about what}} you have been doing before you go into your doctor in case you remember a question you had or it jogs your memory about something <b>you</b> might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And {{then all}} the gilt came off Widgery. He {{answered}} quite rudely. [...] "Confound Dangle! Hasn't he messed us up enough? He must needs drive after them in a trap to tell them we're coming, and now <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. It is a stiff north-easterly gale, {{and if we}} {{were facing}} it, instead of running before it, <b>you</b> would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the question.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> old fellow," [...] Archie said to him; [...] "why I don't lead you {{at once to}} your master? Don't you be impatient, old fellow, and you shall see him ere long;" [...] and he patted the hound's head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's to {{your good}} health, Ned!" [...] quoth the Doctor, eying the pair intently, {{as he often}} did, when they were unconscious. [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me a question? As many as you please, my fine fellow; and I shall answer as many, and as much, and as truly, as may please myself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} don't. Had I thought you did, much as I love you,--valuable as your society is to me down in this desert,--I would never speak to you again. But remember,--if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any questions, and will ask them of me,--of me,--I will answer them, {{and will not be}} angry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jorgenson, utterly disregarded, {{looked down}} dreamily at the falling cards. [...] "Spy--I tell you," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know anything, <b>ask</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he won't. Just {{tell him}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> learn, and <b>ask</b> him if he'll let you drive around a few times. Tell him it won't cost him anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Blossom {{interrupted}} him, 'Here is {{the address}} of Dr. Maitland, I have written {{it on my own}} card; he can answer some questions <b>you</b> may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> Later I will answer anything. And now in the name of God,' said the girl reverently, with sudden emotion, 'you will keep your promise to the letter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Miss Floss, never! I'll {{tell you}} the whole story, Miss Mackenzie; and if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any one else, you can ask Mrs Perch." [...] Mrs Perch was the coachbuilder's wife. [...] "You've seen Miss Floss at Mrs Stumfold's, and must know {{yourself}} whether I ever noticed her any more than to be decently civil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for edification {{on these}} things of moment, there's a very earnest good man going to preach a charity-sermon to-day in the parish you are going to--Mr Clare of Emminster. I'm not of his persuasion now, but he's a good man, and he'll expound {{as well as any}} parson I know. 'Twas he began the work in me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said good-humouredly, [...] "don't {{look at me}} {{as though}} I were {{something}} uncanny. If you {{had not been so}} very absorbed you would have heard me call to you from the cliffs. I wanted to save myself the climb, but you were deaf, both of you. Am I the first man whose footsteps upon the sands have fallen lightly? Now, what is it <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me, Lord Wolfenden?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Constance, tell {{me about}} yourself. I've often <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> but I was always a little afraid to. You seem so {{reserved}} and--and, as if <b>you</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be <b>asked</b> about yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Red said, [...] "Hey. <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> see us. We're not {{supposed}} to be here. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> start <b>asking</b> questions and find out about our animals?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{said the}} painter {{with a kind}} of groan. He sat down in a tall, carven gothic chair,--the {{furniture}} of one of his pictures,--and rested his head against its high back and looked at the priest across the room. [...] "Excuse me," [...] he continued with a strong effort. [...] "I am ready to befriend you to the utmost of my power. What was it <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me? I have told you truly what I thought of your scheme of going to America; but I may very well be mistaken. Was it about that Miss Vervain desired you to consult me?" [...] His voice and manner hardened again in spite of him. [...] "Or did she wish me to advise you about the renunciation of your priesthood? You must have thought that carefully over for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can guess}} what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me," [...] he exclaimed, sternly and loudly; [...] "you {{want to ask}} me how I can be mad enough to believe in a doggerel prophecy uttered {{in an age of}} superstition to awe the most ignorant hearers. I answer" [...] (at those words his voice sank {{suddenly}} to a whisper), [...] "I answer, because Stephen Monkton himself stands there at this moment confirming me in my belief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, perhaps I am capricious," [...] she murmured. She {{suddenly}} approached him, {{and put a}} hand {{upon each}} of his arms. [...] "No, Angel, I am not really so--by nature, I mean!" [...] The more particularly to assure {{him that she was}} not, she placed herself close to him in the settle, and allowed her head to find a resting-place against Clare's shoulder. [...] "What did <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me--I am sure I will answer it," [...] she continued humbly.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any questions, {{and will}} ask them of me, I will answer them." [...] Such a promise {{would not have}} been volunteered unless there was {{something}} special to be told. It would be best, perhaps, to demand from Mrs. Askerton the fulfilment of this promise. But then in doing so she must own from whence her information had come. Mrs. Askerton had told her that the [...] "communication" [...] would be made by her cousin Will. Her cousin Will had gone away without a word of Mrs. Askerton, and now the [...] "communication" [...] had come from Captain Aylmer! ...|$|E
60|$|When {{people in}} our set are introduced, it is {{customary}} for them <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him; {{it was like an}} examination paper that asks grammar, when what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be <b>asked</b> is Kings of England.|$|R
6000|$|The girl nodded shortly. [...] "It's not my business," [...] she said. [...] "I am glad <b>you</b> came. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. Who is {{this man}} Rowan who killed my uncle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Clarke {{suddenly}} awoke {{from his}} musing and became aggressive. He resolutely changed the subject. [...] "Before <b>you</b> go I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you--do <b>you,</b> as a chemist, deny the immortality of the soul?" ...|$|R
