40|$|Curbing Australia’s {{electricity}} usage {{is a key}} {{challenge for}} society, both now and in years to come. With electricity an expensive, scarce and environmentally damaging commodity, targeted environmental social marketing campaigns are vital. Such campaigns are essential {{when it comes to}} influencing Generation Y - heavy users of electricity-reliant devices - to change their current usage behaviour and act in a more sustainable way. But are messages about electricity conservation getting through to this user group? This three phase DBA commences by employing regression analysis to identify the segment of the market that use the most electricity – Generation Y headed households. Phase 1 analysis reveals that Generation <b>Ys</b> <b>living</b> independently of their parents use more electricity than those Generation <b>Ys</b> <b>living</b> with their parents. Over 20 % of this group view appliances and lights being left on as causing high energy usage or waste and are also more likely than the general population to blame the frequent use of large electrical appliances. Yet, they are the least likely group to turn off appliances when not in use (36 %) or to choose energy efficient appliances (7 %). Phase 2 research explores the relationship Generation Ys have with electricity and possible factors that could influence them to reduce usage. Qualitative research established a high reliance on electricity, the prominent role of Facebook in daily routines, the presence of stress when electricity is restricted, and the degree of effort associated with being environmentally friendly. Also established is the role of parents in curbing electricity usage in the home, the higher importance Generation Ys place on cost/monetary savings than on environmental benefits and their need to be directly impacted by the environmental issue in order to elicit a suitable response. Phase 3 is an extensive literature review of social-psychological theories, frameworks and models of relevance - guiding practitioners attempting to encourage electricity usage behaviour change and to develop interventions targeting Generation Y. The review overviews behaviour change theory, highlighting to social marketers the importance of defining the target behaviour and the target audience, and assessing the determinants of behaviour. The review then discusses the criteria for selecting from the models and the theories of behaviour and behaviour change, outlining how best to employ behaviour change frameworks and evaluate behaviour change programs. The result is a theoretical review and insight that contributes to social marketers’ understanding of, and approach to, behaviour change, and assists them in developing their positioning statements, crafting their campaign strategies and communicating their desired behaviours to Generation Y...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{assessed}} which factors {{contribute to}} {{the high level of}} nutritional risk detected by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) test in institutionalized older women. To this end, we undertook a complete nutritional assessment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in 89 older women (age range, 72 – 98 <b>y)</b> <b>living</b> in two private nursing homes in Granada (Spain) was carried out. The MNA test was used as an assessment tool to detect nutritional risk. The nutritional assessment included anthropometric measurements (body mass index, triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses, and mid-arm and calf circumferences), quantification of dietary intake (7 -d weighed-food records), clinical and functional evaluations (number of drugs, Katz index, and Red Cross cognitive scale), and biological markers (albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, and lymphocyte counts). RESULTS: We found that 7. 9 % (n � 5) of the older women were malnourished (MNA score, 14. 5 � 1. 4), 61. 8 % (n � 56) were at risk of malnutrition (MNA score, 20. 6 � 2. 1), and 30. 3 % (n � 28) were well nourished (MNA score, 25. 0 � 1. 1) according to the MNA test.

Animal models and in vitro studies support a role for LRP 1 in adipocyte metabolism and leptin signaling, but genetic polymorphisms have not been evaluated for obesity in people. We examined whether dietary fats (eg., saturated, polyunsaturated) modulated the association of LRP 1 variants with anthropometric traits. We studied a population-based sample of Puerto Ricans (n= 920, aged 45 – 74 <b>y)</b> <b>living</b> in the Boston area. In multivariable linear regression models, we dichotomized saturated fat intake and found significant interaction terms between total saturated fatty acids and LRP 1 rs 1799986 genotype for BMI (P= 0. 006) and hip (P= 0. 002). High intake of saturated fat was associated with higher BMI (P= 0. 001), waist (P= 0. 008) and hip (P= 0. 003) in minor allele carriers (CT+TT) compared to CC participants. Further analysis of dichotomized individual saturated fatty acids revealed that interactions were strongest for two individual longer chain fatty acids. High intake of palmitic acid (C 16 : 0; P= 0. 0007) and high stearic acid intake (C 18 : 0; P= 0. 005) were associated with higher BMI in T carriers.

One {{of the reasons for}} this decline is the diagnosis or perception of lactose intolerance. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate average consumption of milk and dairy products in the Campania region of Italy, one of the main producers of dairy products in the country. Methods: Individuals aged 18 to 75 <b>y</b> and <b>living</b> in Campania were invited to answer an online questionnaire regarding their average consumption of milk and dairy products. The questionnaire was posted on the public access hospital site, as well as on several Facebook pages of friends and hospital personnel. Results: The study found that 22. 2 % (260 of 1173) of responders from Campania do not drink milk, and 18. 1 % (213 of 1173) drink lactose-free milk, mainly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. The vast majority of the sample population chose to avoid consuming milk without undergoing the breath test for lactose intolerance or consulting a doctor. Women and underweight people drink more lactose-free milk than milk containing lactose. The population sample does not avoid dairy products; rather, they seem to be consumed quite frequently.

The study was established as a double-blind, placebo-controlled oral administration of a single dose of iodized oil to schoolchildren (7 - 10 <b>y</b> old), <b>living</b> in an iodine-deficient area of Benin, with an observation period of 10 mo. However, 3 - 4 mo after supplementation, iodized salt became available in the area. The study population therefore comprised an iodized oil-supplemented group and a nonsupplemented group, both of which had variable, uncontrolled intakes of iodized salt during the last 6 mo of the study. Initial mean serum concentrations of TSH and FT 4 were within the normal range, whereas serum Tg concentration, urinary iodine concentration and thyroid volume were indicative of moderate-to-severe iodine deficiency. At the end of the study, all indicators had improved significantly, except thyroid volume, which had decreased only in the supplemented group. The supplemented group also still had significantly lower serum Tg and higher urinary iodine concentrations than the nonsupplemented group.

Objective: We investigated the relation between a measure of dietary acid-base load, potential renal acid load (PRAL), and calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) after adjustment for confounders and also compared the results with different estimates of acid-base load. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 14 563 men and women aged 42 - 82 <b>y</b> <b>living</b> in Norfolk, United Kingdom, in which measures of calcaneal BUA and dietary PRAL were estimated by using the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk) food-frequency questionnaire. Results: A more acidic dietary intake (high PRAL) was significantly associated with lower calcaneal BUA in women but not in men; there was a difference of 2 % in BUA between the highest and lowest quintiles of PRAL, independent of age, body mass index, smoking habit, physical activity, diagnosed osteoporosis, and history of fracture, and (in women) hormone replacement therapy. No relation was observed between history of fracture or incident fracture and PRAL. Those with the greatest PRAL had higher intakes of meat, fish, eggs, and cereal and cereal products and lower intakes of fruit and vegetables, tea, and coffee.

Low serum vitamin B- 12 (< 148 pmol/l) was present in 51. 1 % of men and 30. 9 % of women. Iron and copper deficiencies were infrequent. Conclusions: Anemia is not prevalent in free-living elderly subjects when iron intake is adequate. Inflammatory process is the main etiology of anemia in this age group. Vitamin A, folate and vitamin B- 12 deficiencies were found in a significant proportion of the study group...|$|R
40|$|High voltage {{pulses of}} peak {{voltages}} U= 5 - 75 kV and rise times tp= 500 - 1300 ns were applied with repetition frequency f=lHz {{in order to}} cause the irreversible electroporation of Gram negative bacteria Yersinia enterocolitica. The bacteria were suspended in NaCl solution of pH= 7. 2 and conductivity y ~ 0. 8 - 1. 3 S/m. The suspension was placed in glass tube immersed in the cylindrical electrode system gap filled with distilled water. Such an electrode system will protect the bacteria suspension from the chemical processes at the electrode-liquid interface due to conduction and pre-breakdown phenomena. The current chopping electrode system was connected in parallel to the sample {{in order to avoid}} heat generation from direct discharge of the pulse through the suspension. The dependence of the survival ratio s=N/No (the number of bacteria per cm 3 after pulse treatment, N, divided by the number of bacteria per cm 3 before treatment, NJ of Y. enterocolitica on peak voltage of the pulse, number of pulses applied and on various rise times of pulses have been measured. The reduction by 6 orders of magnitude of <b>Y.</b> enterocolitica <b>living</b> cells per cm 3 was achieved. The results show that considerable inactivation of microbes can be achieved by the application of short (tp 4000 ns) high voltage pulses for bacteria suspension without directly exposing the bacteria suspension to the electrodes. It is therefore possible to use the electrode system proposed as a means for sterilization of liquid foods...|$|R
40|$|Combinations of {{fatty acids}} may affect risk of {{metabolic}} syndrome. Puerto Ricans have {{a disproportionate number}} of chronic conditions compared with other Hispanic groups. We aimed to characterize fatty acid intake patterns of Puerto Rican adults aged 45 – 75 <b>y</b> and <b>living</b> in the Greater Boston area (n = 1207) and to examine associations between these patterns and metabolic syndrome. Dietary fatty acids, as a percentage of total fat, were entered into principle components analysis. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between fatty acid intake patterns, nutrients, and food groups. Associations with metabolic syndrome were analyzed by using logistic regression and general linear models with quintiles of principal component scores. Four principal components (factors) emerged: factor 1, short- and medium-chain SFA/dairy; factor 2, (n- 3) fatty acid/fish; factor 3, very long-chain (VLC) SFA and PUFA/oils; and factor 4, monounsaturated fatty acid/trans fat. The SFA/dairy factor was inversely associated with fasting serum glucose concentrations (P = 0. 02) and the VLC SFA/oils factor was negatively related to waist circumference (P = 0. 008). However, these associations were no longer significant after additional adjustment for BMI. The (n- 3) fatty acid/fish factor was associated with a lower likelihood of metabolic syndrome (Q 5 vs. Q 1 : odds ratio: 0. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 34, 0. 86). In summary, principal components analysis of fatty acid intakes revealed 4 dietary fatty acid patterns in this population. Identifying optimal combinations of fatty acids may be beneficial for understanding relationships with health outcomes given their diverse effects on metabolism...|$|R
40|$|In 2006, the AHA {{released}} {{diet and}} lifestyle recommendations (AHA-DLR) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. The effect of adherence to these recommendations on CVD risk is unknown. Our {{objective was to}} develop a unique diet and lifestyle score based on the AHA-DLR and to evaluate this score in relation to available CVD risk factors. In a cross-sectional study of Puerto Rican adults aged 45 – 75 <b>y</b> <b>living</b> in the greater Boston area, information was available for the following variables: diet (semiquantitative FFQ), blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), 10 -y risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (Framingham risk score), and fasting plasma lipids, serum glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. We developed a diet and lifestyle score (AHA-DLS) based on the AHA-DLR. The AHA-DLS had both internal consistency and content validity. It was associated with plasma HDL cholesterol (P = 0. 001), serum insulin (P = 0. 0003), and CRP concentrations (P = 0. 02), WC (P < 0. 0001), and 10 -y risk of CHD score (P = 0. 01 in women). The AHA-DLS was inversely associated with serum glucose among those with a BMI < 25 (P = 0. 01). Women and men in the highest quartile of the AHA-DLS had lower serum insulin (P-trend = 0. 0003) and CRP concentrations (P-trend = 0. 002), WC (P-trend = 0. 0003), and higher HDL cholesterol (P-trend = 0. 008). The AHA-DLS is a useful tool to measure adherence to the AHA-DLR and may be used to examine associations between diet and lifestyle behaviors and CVD risk...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{association}} between sleep patterns (sleep duration and insomnia symptoms) and total and regional bone mineral density (BMD) among older Boston Puerto Rican adults. We conducted a cross-sectional study including 750 Puerto Rican adults, aged 47 - 79 <b>y</b> <b>living</b> in Massachusetts. BMD at 3 hip sites and the lumbar spine were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Sleep duration (≤ 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 8 h, or ≥ 9 h/d) and insomnia symptoms (difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early-morning awaking, and non-restorative sleep) were assessed by a questionnaire. Multivariable regression {{was used to examine}} sex-specific associations between sleep duration, insomnia symptoms and BMD adjusting for standard confounders and covariates. Men who slept ≥ 9 h/d had significantly lower femoral neck BMD, relative to those reporting 8 h/d sleep, after adjusting for age, education level, smoking, physical activity, depressive symptomatology, comorbidity and serum vitamin D concentration. This association was attenuated and lost significance after further adjustment for urinary cortisol and serum inflammation biomarkers. In contrast, {{the association between}} sleep duration and BMD was not significant in women. Further, we did not find any significant associations between insomnia symptoms and BMD in men or women. Our study does not support the hypothesis that shorter sleep duration and insomnia symptoms are associated with lower BMD levels in older adults. However, our results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies with larger sample size, objective assessment of sleep pattern, and prospective design are needed before a conclusion regarding sleep and BMD can be reached...|$|E

Improvement of a {{questionnaire}} measuring activity limitations in rising and sitting down {{in patients with}} lower-extremity disorders living at home. OBJECTIVE: To improve a self-administered questionnaire that includes 42 dichotomous items and measures activity limitations in rising and sitting down (R&S) in patients with lower-extremity disorders who live at home. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Outpatient clinics of secondary and tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N= 759; 47 % men; mean age +/- standard deviation, 60. 7 +/- 15. 2 <b>y)</b> <b>living</b> at home, with lower-extremity disorders resulting from stroke, poliomyelitis, osteoarthritis, amputation, and complex regional pain syndrome type I. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Unidimensionality, indicating that items assess only a single construct; (2) fit with the one-parameter logistic model (OPLM), yielding information about patient and item location parameters; (3) intratest reliability, indicating consistency of patients' item scores; and (4) content validity, indicating completeness with which the items cover the {{important aspects of the}} construct that they are attempting to represent. RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 42 items: (1) loaded on 1 component (variance explained, 59 %; item component loadings, >/=. 51), (2) showed good fit with the OPLM (P=. 15), (3) had a good intratest reliability (Cronbach alpha=. 96), and (4) had a good content validity (all important aspects represented). CONCLUSIONS: A unidimensional scale that fits with the OPLM has been developed for measuring activity limitations in R&S in patients with lower-extremity disorders who live at hom...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{studies the}} travel {{patterns}} and motivations of Generation <b>Y</b> members <b>living</b> in Sweden and in Finland. The research {{is made from}} Generation Y members’ point of view. Earlier studies have discussed Generation Y’s travel behavior, but no research was found studying {{the differences between the}} age groups inside the Generation Y. As the Generation Y is a big generation group, it is important to notice the possible differences within this group. This research aims to find out the possible differences between the young and the older members of the generation. The purpose of the study is to contribute to the understanding of Generation Y’s travel behavior, which is important to understand for tourism planning, as the younger part of the generation will enter the tourism markets in the near future. The research is a quantitative study, testing a hypothesis that there are differences in the travel behavior between the younger and the older members of Generation Y. An electronic survey was sent to various persons, using social media as a tool for reaching the target group for data collection. The survey was done using a SoGo online survey tool. Collected data was moved into an SPSS for analyzing. The results indicated that there was no significant differences found between the two age groups. However the results show the Generation Y respondents’ motivation, values, expectations, experiences and attitudes towards travelling. The results will help in understanding Generation Y’s travel behavior, and help examine and define the potential differences in this generation group. For future work, the findings of this research could be compared with qualitative research, made by interviewing tourism professionals and Generation Y members. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{develop a}} walkability index {{specific}} to mixed rural/suburban areas, {{and to explore}} the relationship between walkability scores and leisure time physical activity. Methods. Respondents were geocoded with 500 m and 1, 000 m buffer zones around each address. A walkability index was derived from intersections, residential density, and land-use mix according to built environment measures. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between the index and physical activity levels. Analyses used cross-sectional data from the 2007 – 2008 Canadian Community Health Survey (n = 1158; ≥ 18 <b>y).</b> Results. Respondents <b>living</b> in highly walkable 500 m buffer zones (upper quartiles of the walkability index) {{were more likely to}} walk or cycle for leisure than those living in low-walkable buffer zones (quartile 1). When a 1, 000 m buffer zone was applied, respondents in more walkable neighbourhoods were more likely to walk or cycle for both leisure-time and transport-related purposes. Conclusion. Developing a walkability index can assist in exploring the associations between measures of the built environment and physical activity to prioritize neighborhood change...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Preschool {{children}} (aged 3 - 6 <b>y)</b> {{who were}} <b>living</b> {{in an informal}} settlement within metropolitan Durban, South Africa, were assessed for vitamin A status. The serum retinol concentration of 169 children tested was 0. 73 ± 0. 26 tmol/L (i ± SD). Nine children (5 %) had vitamin A deficiency (< 0. 35 jmol/L) and 75 children (44 %) had low vitamin A concentra-tions (< 0. 70 zmol/L). Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC) in 185 children revealed that 1 8 % had poor vitamin A status as defined by two abnormal conjunctival specimens. The CIC test was a feasible and reproducible method; however, it correlated poorly with the traditionally accepted serum retinol threshold ofdeficiency in this population where overt vitamin A deficiency is not prevalent. This survey demonstrated that regardless of the measurement tool, there is a prevalence of subclinical vitamin A deficiency in this typical periurban informal settlement and accordingly we suggest that these children should be targeted for vitamin A-intervention strategies.
