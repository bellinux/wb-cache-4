In the film, she played the comic role of Sanjana, a clumsy woman who travels from Paris to India in search of her philandering fiancé, however, falls for another man, played by Devgn. A review from Planet Bollywood noted, [...] "Kajol, like usual, is brilliant {{in her role as}} Sanjana. She makes <b>you</b> <b>cry,</b> laugh, get angry, and smile all within the two and a half hour movie. Her acting is on par with Meg Ryan in the English flick". The film emerged as a [...] "super-hit" [...] commercially and fetched Kajol a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare that year.|$|E

[...] Filmfare gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "Barfi! is that rare film that can make you smile and make <b>you</b> <b>cry</b> in the same scene. Its technical brilliance is only outdone by its emotional complexity and depth. Pritam's music adds a nice silent-era charm to this already fantastic story, making it an occasion when words simply aren’t enough."

500|$|During {{the main}} {{sessions}} for All Things Must Pass, Harrison taped or routined early versions of [...] "You", [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] and [...] "When Every Song Is Sung". Harrison offered these three songs to Ronnie Spector in February 1971 for her proposed (and soon abandoned) solo album on Apple Records. After releasing his own versions of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] and [...] "You" [...] between 1973 and 1975, he offered [...] "When Every Song Is Sung" [...] (since retitled [...] "I'll Still Love You") to former bandmate Ringo Starr for his 1976 album Ringo's Rotogravure. [...] "Woman Don't <b>You</b> <b>Cry</b> for Me", written in December 1969 {{as his first}} slide-guitar composition, was another song that Harrison revisited on Thirty Three & 1/3. Harrison included [...] "I Live for You" [...] as the only all-new bonus track on the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass. [...] "Down to the River" [...] remained unused until he reworked it as [...] "Rocking Chair in Hawaii" [...] for his final studio album, the posthumously released Brainwashed (2002).|$|E
500|$|Having {{attended}} the concerts six months before, Ed Kelleher of Circus magazine {{was relieved to}} discover that the live album didn't just do justice to the [...] "magic... the sheer joy" [...] of the event, but rather its music [...] "practically jumps right out into your life". After singling out as defining moments Dylan's [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] ("it's enough to make <b>you</b> <b>cry</b> and smile at once"), Russell's medley and Harrison's [...] "Here Comes the Sun", along with the talents of Shankar– [...] "the most masterful and accomplished of them all"– Kelleher admitted to the futility of trying to identify [...] "individual highlights" [...] on an album that was [...] "one consistent high". In fact, almost every selection on the three-record set was named as a highlight by one reviewer or another: Preston's [...] "That's the Way God Planned It" [...] coming as a [...] "sheer delight" [...] to Landau, Harrison's [...] "Something" [...] especially [...] "delicate and moving" [...] to Playboys album reviewer, Dylan's [...] "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" [...] resonating most with Nicholas Schaffner, while to Richard Williams, [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] was [...] "the masterpiece".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his single}} {{sentence}} discussing [...] "Māya Love" [...] in I, Me, Mine, his 1980 autobiography, George Harrison {{states that he}} wrote the song [...] "purely as a slide guitar tune with the words added later".

Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, likens [...] "Māya Love" [...] to [...] "Woman Don't <b>You</b> <b>Cry</b> for Me" [...] and the 1987 song [...] "Cloud 9", in that they all feature lyrics that were [...] "appended out of necessity" [...] rather than created through genuine inspiration.|$|E

2500|$|Three American {{scholars}} have researched Bunce Island. Anthropologist Joseph Opala's research linked {{the island to}} the Gullah people of the United States Low Country. He organised the Gullah [...] "homecomings" [...] portrayed in the documentary films: Family Across the Sea (1990), The Language <b>You</b> <b>Cry</b> In (1998), and the website, Priscilla’s Homecoming (2005). Historian David Hancock documented Bunce Island {{during the period of}} Grant, Oswald & Company in his study, Citizens of the World (1997). Archaeologist Christopher DeCorse and his team surveyed the island’s ruins for a report submitted to the Sierra Leone government (2006).|$|E
2500|$|The Gullah {{have also}} {{reached out to}} West Africa. Gullah groups made three celebrated [...] "homecomings" [...] to Sierra Leone in 1989, 1997, and 2005. Sierra Leone {{is at the heart}} of the {{traditional}} rice-growing region of West Africa where many of the Gullahs' ancestors originated. Bunce Island, the British slave castle in Sierra Leone, sent many African captives to Charleston and Savannah during the mid- and late 18th century. These dramatic homecomings were the subject of three documentary films—Family Across the Sea (1990), The Language <b>You</b> <b>Cry</b> In (1998), and Priscilla's Homecoming (in production).|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] "And the Lord said to Moses: ‘Why do <b>you</b> <b>cry</b> to Me? Speak to the {{children}} of Israel, that they go forward," [...] Rabbi Eliezer taught that God was telling Moses that there is a time to pray briefly and a time to pray at length. God was telling Moses that God's children were in trouble, the sea cut them off, the enemy pursued, and yet Moses stood and said a long prayer! God told Moses {{that it was time to}} cut short his prayer and act.|$|E

2500|$|Like [...] "Woman Don't <b>You</b> <b>Cry</b> for Me" [...] and [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues", [...] "I Dig Love" [...] {{originated}} from George Harrison's initial experimentation with slide-guitar playing, in open E tuning. His introduction to this technique occurred in December 1969, {{when he joined}} Eric Clapton as a guest on Delaney & Bonnie's European tour. In his autobiography, I Me Mine, Harrison recalls that Delaney Bramlett [...] "handed me a bottleneck slide {{and asked me to}} play a line which Dave Mason had played on the [...] record", since Mason had recently quit the tour.|$|E
2500|$|With {{this brief}} golden age lasting just two years, {{personnel}} changes quickly followed. Lover Patterson (now the Drifters' road manager) {{got into an}} argument with George Treadwell. Since Patterson had King under personal contract, he refused to let him tour with the group. Thus King was only able to record with the group for about a year. Johnny Lee Williams, who sang lead on [...] "(If <b>You</b> <b>Cry)</b> True Love, True Love", the flipside of [...] "Dance with Me", handled the vocals on tour along with Charlie Thomas. When the group passed through Williams' hometown of Mobile, Alabama, Williams left the group. (Williams died on December 19, 2004, {{at the age of}} 64.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{combines}} the downtuned riffs of nu metal/alternative metal with elements of New Jersey hardcore, hip hop, jazz and hard rock. Regarding the album's sound, rhythm guitarist Joey D'Amico remarked in September 2001 that [...] "the music is definitely emotional, but its hardcore in its roots". Songs such as [...] "Falling Down" [...] and [...] "Rejection" [...] feature a volatile brand of singing which frequently alternates between melodic crooning, rapping and more extreme vocal stylings. Jordan Plingos stated [...] "If somebody asks {{me what this}} band sounds like, I say 'go listen to 'Falling Down,' because it has everything. It starts off fast and heavy and brutal, and then, from the bridge and chorus to the end, it makes <b>you</b> <b>cry.</b> That song right there covers it all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harrison {{selected}} ten of {{the original}} twelve tracks for overdubbing. He later said that [...] "See Yourself", which he had started writing in 1967, was a song that he came to like {{more and more as}} further instruments were added onto the initial recording. [...] "Woman Don't <b>You</b> <b>Cry</b> for Me" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Girl" [...] were other compositions dating from the late 1960s that Harrison revisited for Thirty Three & ⅓; the first of these was a tune he wrote while on tour with Delaney & Bonnie, to showcase his then-recent adoption of slide guitar. Like [...] "See Yourself", [...] "Dear One" [...] was inspired by Paramhansa Yogananda, author of Autobiography of a Yogi and a profound influence on Harrison since his visit to India in September 1966.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of Nine, Yeston left his {{position}} as associate professor at Yale, although he continued to teach a course there every other semester on songwriting. [...] He turned to writing a musical version of Gaston Leroux's novel, The Phantom of the Opera. [...] He was approached with the idea by actor/director Geoffrey Holder, who held the American rights to the novel. [...] Initially, Yeston was skeptical of the project. [...] "I laughed and laughed.... That's the worst idea in the world! [...] Why {{would you want to}} write a musical based on a horror story?.... And then {{it occurred to me that}} the story could be somewhat changed.... would be a Quasimodo character, an Elephant Man. [...] Don't all of us feel, despite outward imperfections, that deep inside we're good? [...] And that is a character <b>you</b> <b>cry</b> for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Less impressed, Rolling Stone {{continued}} to regard Harrison in an unfavourable light after what Elliot Huntley terms its [...] "volte-face" [...] in 1974. The magazine's reviewer, Ken Tucker, noted {{the accessibility of}} [...] "fast, cheerful numbers" [...] such as [...] "Woman Don't <b>You</b> <b>Cry</b> for Me" [...] and [...] "This Song" [...] but lamented both [...] "George's persistent preaching" [...] elsewhere and that Scott's presence rendered the album as [...] "music with the feeling and sincerity of cellophane". NME critic Bob Woffinden admired Harrison's guitar playing but dismissed him as a lyric writer, before concluding: [...] "Harrison's general demeanour is more encouraging... While it is an album of no particular merit in itself, it is one which leads {{me to believe that}} his best work may not necessarily be behind him." [...] Four years later, however, Woffinden offered a more positive assessment, writing that [...] "His spiritual convictions no longer seemed to be cramping his style, but affording him a generous and open heart. An excellent production and frequently inspired guitar work were amongst the other positive qualities which the album could boast." ...|$|E
