I have a really hard time saying, {{if there were no}} violent games, people would stop shooting each other. I think that until they have no way of shooting each other, they won't stop." [...] says Khouri. [...] "We have a speed limit. Why can't we have a bullet limit? The idea that we don't need limits stricter than we have now on guns is absolutely insane. Because ultimately, people don't kill people — guns kill people, and people with guns kill people." [...] She also argued that America has lost its moral compass and that [...] "it's worse than it's its ever been!" [...] in the matters of gun control. She claimed that there is no quick route to end gun control because Hollywood actors such as Sylvester Stallone [...] "make a fortune from violence. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> types of movies will stop getting made? I don't," [...] says Khouri.|$|E

6000|$|... “Why, {{look what}} it says, up here!” cried Phil. “’Map of the Don Amorandos Treasure, buried in 1715.’ Say, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> Englishmen——” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>those</b> poor devils {{under the}} bridge—and then {{of her and}} them frittering away {{themselves}} and money in that idiocy——" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis futile to wait," [...] here {{interrupted}} Martin-Roget roughly, [...] "and {{you are a}} fool, citizen, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>those</b> Englishmen exist elsewhere than in your imagination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And pray," [...] said Colin, {{the more}} {{inwardly}} nettled {{because he knew}} that his elder brother enjoyed his annoyance, [...] "what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>those</b> seven slight encumbrances?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{position}} is embarrassment," [...] he said. [...] "Captain, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> illustrious traders burn my capital? My people {{will give them}} beer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> ladies {{could ever}} be my friends, sir?" [...] she asked, with an {{intonation}} that made him reply, with a sound of amusement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mean it? Small {{question}} of that, the cankered young slip! Nurse, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> {{he belongs to}} can do Charley any harm if he angers them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>those</b> days, Dick, {{just think}} of what great times are in store for our boys," [...] said Sam. [...] "I only trust they have as good times as we had." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{eyes widened}} just a line, {{but they did}} not waver. [...] "I should like to hear from you," [...] she said cordially. [...] "I'd like to know what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>those</b> pamphlets, which I'll surely send." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the way to}} do it," [...] he said, beaming through misty {{pince-nez}} over a long glass. [...] "That is {{the stuff}} to administer to 'em! At this rate we shall have the place in corking condition before bedtime. Quiet efficiency--that's the wheeze! What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>those</b> for coops, Beale?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm going out," [...] was Josie's inconsequent remark. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> are rain clouds, Mary Louise? I hate to drag {{around an}} {{umbrella}} if it's not needed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay,' I said. 'Probably he hasn't {{taken her}} in at all. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> French girls are such poor {{innocent}} things? I guess she's {{a great deal}} more downy than he.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Betsey, {{you are an}} angel!' {{and turning}} {{his back to the}} house, papa bolted the muffin with {{grateful}} rapidity, inquiring with a laugh, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> rogues will keep it up in this vigorous style all day?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Asbestos," [...] I said (I knew {{no other}} name to call him), as I {{turned on him}} in wrath, [...] "Asbestos, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>those</b> jelly-bag Equalities {{out on the street}} there, with their ash-barrel suits, can be {{compared}} for one moment with our unredeemed, unreformed, heaven-created, hobble-skirted women of the twentieth century?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were not}} gentlemen," [...] said Alice. [...] "You {{say that no}} one can tell by a person's {{appearance}} whether he is a gentleman or not; but surely <b>you</b> cannot <b>think</b> that <b>those</b> men are Lord Worthington's equals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ripping. Cut over to Donaldson's, young Renford. As {{a matter}} of fact," [...] he added, confidentially, when the {{emissary}} had vanished, [...] "I'm not half sure that the other dodge would have worked. They seem to think at the shop that I've had about enough things on tick lately. I haven't settled up for last term yet. I've spent all I've got on this study. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>those</b> photographs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but I do mind; most particularly. That's {{all very}} well for you, doctor; you've nothing to lose. You've no great stake in the matter. Why, now, what sum of money of mine do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> d---- doctors are handling?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> {{accounts}} we get of {{the conditions}} of the Belgians are very much exaggerated?" [...] said Irene. [...] "I'm sure they can't be actually starving you know, in the twentieth century. The newspapers always colour things so highly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, she {{was bent}} upon it. It was {{something}} about you. Oh! she wants {{to take you to}} stay with her in that horrible hole of hers in the City--very odd of her. What do you advise me to do, Miss Fennimore? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> foreign wines would bring me down a little, or that they would make me low and sinking?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> won't <b>think</b> <b>those</b> ugly {{thoughts}} again, will you, Katharine?" [...] {{at which}} words the ship which Katharine had been considering seemed {{to put into}} harbor and have done with its seafaring. Yet she was in great need, if not exactly of sympathy, of some form of advice, or, at least, of the opportunity of setting forth her problems before a third person so as to renew them in her own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Allan," [...] {{he replied}} solemnly, [...] "if you were {{dying in a}} cave far from help, would <b>you</b> <b>think</b> well of <b>those</b> who sent raw Kaffirs to succour you when they might have come themselves, Kaffirs who {{certainly}} would let you die and return with some false story?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How're {{you going}} to stop him? I swear, Persis, I don't know what's got over you! What is it? You didn't use to be so. But to hear <b>you</b> talk, you'd <b>think</b> <b>those</b> Coreys were too good for this world, and we wa'n't fit for 'em to walk on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed, I won't {{take them}} too seriously. Besides, I suppose lots {{of the people}} that go to Bohemian {{restaurants}} aren't really artists at all; they just go to see the artists; they're just as bromidic as can be----Don't you hate bromides? Of course I want to see some of that part of life, but I think----Oh, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> artists and all are dreadfully careless about morals?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poh--poh--you and I {{have no need}} of a {{dictionary}} to understand each other. I call a man who never trusts to a generous motive--who thinks it always necessary to bribe or cajole--who has no idea of any thing's being done without its direct quid pro quo, a scurvy blackguard, though he has the airs and graces of Phil. Stanhope, or Chesterfield, as he is now. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> chaps at the Board, talk of doing, by way of clinching my loyalty, at this blessed juncture?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm goin' to {{make you}} talk this time!" [...] cried Dryfoos, {{striking}} {{the arm of the}} chair he sat in with the side of his fist. A maddening thought of Christine came over him. [...] "As long as you eat my bread, you have got to do as I say. I won't have my children telling me what I shall do and sha'n't do, or take on airs of being holier than me. Now, you just speak up! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> loafers are right, or don't you? Come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you are my}} {{favourite}} pupil still. It {{is worth}} to teach you. Now that {{you are willing to}} understand, you have taken the first step to understand. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> then that <b>those</b> so small holes in the children's throats were made by the same that made the holes in Miss Lucy?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most famous}} quote of Urek is: “What fun {{would it be}} to become {{the king of the}} tower? Tell Jahad to keep his boring seat. I will get out of the Tower. Outside the Tower, there exists a vast world, rolling skies stretch endlessly, and countless stars {{illuminate}} the darkness. A place that is a thousand times—no, a billion times wider and freer than the tower. Once you imagine that such a world exists, don’t <b>you</b> <b>think</b> all <b>those</b> things <b>you</b> want are all so trivial?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No doubt, sir, no doubt; all the Lord's {{works are}} good: {{but it is}} a wonder why He should have made wasps, now, and blights, and vermin, and jack, and such evil-featured things, that carry spite and cruelty in their very faces--a great wonder. Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> sir, all <b>those</b> creatures were in the Garden of Eden?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I met Mrs. Delaporte {{the other}} day," [...] he said, [...] "down at Ranelagh. We chatted a little while. I couldn't feel any ill-will against the woman-- I'd enjoyed my evening so thoroughly. Then some people stopped {{and talked to}} me, and she found out who I was. Soon {{afterward}} she began to throw out hints of a willingness to marry again. Perhaps I wasn't very tactful. Anyway she seemed a little huffed when she left me--and here we are! Say, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> joshers can do anything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Professor Brice, I'd {{like to ask}} a question," [...] he said. [...] "Two of {{the cadets}} here overheard a talk between Brown, Martell and Stowell. Those three {{proposed}} to play a most outrageous trick on Colonel Colby, and then make it appear as if that trick had been played by some other cadets. In fact, {{they were going to}} make all the evidence point to those other cadets. Now, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> cadets ought to defend themselves by telling Colonel Colby all they know? They feel that they don't want to be tale bearers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> facts can be {{explained}} away," [...] interposed Mr. Kyrle. [...] "Let {{me tell you the}} result of my experience on that point. When an English jury has to choose between a plain fact ON the surface and a long explanation UNDER the surface, it always takes the fact in preference to the explanation. For example, Lady Glyde (I call the lady you represent by that name for argument's sake) declares she has slept at a certain house, and it is proved that she has not slept at that house. You explain this circumstance by entering into the state of her mind, and deducing from it a metaphysical conclusion. I don't say the conclusion is wrong--I only say that the jury will take the fact of her contradicting herself in preference to any reason for the contradiction that you can offer." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{draw the}} analogy of friends to explain why fit is so {{important}} in considering a college. You like your good friends for some reason. It {{may not be an}} objective reason. Its often subjective. Theres some sense of compatibility, a kind of intuition, a match, a common sense of values, what you like to do, how <b>you</b> <b>think</b> - <b>those</b> are the things that really bind people together. Its similar with college. You dont want to spend four years with a college who isnt really your friend. Jennifer Rickard, admissions dean at Bryn Mawr ...|$|R

Kulash had {{a great interest in}} using slow-motion for a video, {{and the rest of the}} band felt this would be a good fit. Kulash believed their song was [...] "meant to make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about <b>those</b> few moments in life that really matter", and slow-motion would capture that [...] "sense of majesty" [...] they associated with the song.|$|R
