60|$|Farther on {{down the}} road the searchers {{stumbled}} over Gaston Isbel. They picked him up and followed Jean and Gordon, who were supporting the wounded Colmor. Jean looked back to see Blue dragging himself along in the rear. It was {{too dark to see}} distinctly; nevertheless, Jean got the impression that Blue was more severely wounded than he had claimed to be. The distance to Meeker's cabin was not far, but it took what Jean felt to be a long and anxious time to get there. Colmor apparently rallied somewhat. When this procession entered Meeker's <b>yard,</b> <b>Blue</b> was lagging behind.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a pretty}} place, all painted dark blue with {{trimmings}} of lighter blue. There was a neat blue fence around the <b>yard</b> and several <b>blue</b> benches had been placed underneath the shady blue trees which marked the line between forest and plain. There was a blue lawn before the house, which was a good sized building. Ku-Klip lived in the front {{part of the house}} and had his work-shop in the back part, where he had also built a lean-to addition, in order to give him more room.|$|R
60|$|Besides {{the sticks}} and the drums, {{there are no}} other musical {{instruments}} among the Typees, except one which might appropriately be denominated a nasal flute. It is somewhat longer than an ordinary fife, is made of a beautiful scarlet-coloured reed, and has four or five stops, with a large hole near one end, which latter is held just beneath the left nostril. The other nostril being closed by a peculiar movement of the muscles about the nose, the breath is forced into the tube, and produces a soft dulcet sound, which is varied by the fingers running at random over the stops. This is a favourite recreation with the females, and one in which Fayaway greatly excelled. Awkward as such an instrument may appear, it was, in Fayaway’s delicate little hands, one of the most graceful I have ever seen. A young lady in the act of tormenting a guitar, strung about her neck by a couple of <b>yards</b> of <b>blue</b> ribbon, is not half so engaging.|$|R
