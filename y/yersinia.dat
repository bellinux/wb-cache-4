5|$|The Great Plague {{killed an}} {{estimated}} 100,000 people—almost {{a quarter of}} London's population—in 18 months. The plague {{was caused by the}} <b>Yersinia</b> pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected rat flea.|$|E
5|$|Uracil is {{not usually}} found in DNA, {{occurring}} only as a breakdown product of cytosine. However, in several bacteriophages, Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 and <b>Yersinia</b> bacteriophage piR1-37, thymine {{has been replaced by}} uracil. Another phage - Staphylococcal phage S6 - has been identified with a genome where thymine has been replaced by uracil.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{report issued}} {{jointly by the}} Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details five cases of bubonic plague in humans {{resulting}} from the ingestion of raw camel liver. Four of the five patients had severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis. <b>Yersinia</b> pestis was isolated from the camel's bone marrow, from the jird (Meriones libycus) and from fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel's corral.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium <b>Yersinia</b> pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with <b>Yersinia</b> pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as <b>Yersinia</b> pestis.|$|E
25|$|Y. pestis is a non-motile, stick-shaped, facultative {{anaerobic}} bacterium with bipolar staining (giving it a safety pin appearance) that produces an anti-phagocytic slime layer. Similar to other <b>Yersinia</b> species, it tests negative for urease, lactose fermentation, and indole. The closest relative is the gastrointestinal pathogen <b>Yersinia</b> pseudotuberculosis, and more distantly <b>Yersinia</b> enterocolitica.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yersinia</b> pestis is {{in effect}} a strain of <b>Yersinia</b> pseudotuberculosis, but with a {{pathogenicity}} island that confers a drastically different pathology (Black plague and tuberculosis-like symptoms respectively) which arose 15,000 to 20,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|YadA is {{a protein}} domain found in Gram-negative {{bacteria}} such as <b>Yersinia</b> enterocolitica, <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, and <b>Yersinia</b> pseudotuberculosis. YadA stands for <b>Yersinia</b> adhesin protein A. This protein domain {{is an example}} of Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins, {{and it was the first}} TAA to be discovered. Like other TAAs, YadA also undergoes homotrimerisation to form a stable collagen-binding protein. Homotrimerisation is a process whereby three of the same subunits, associate to make a complex of three identical YadA proteins. Furthermore, just like other TAAs, it has a head-stalk-anchor protein architecture. The majority of TAAs share strong similarity in the C-terminal membrane anchor region, the only member to differ across TAAs is the head, neck, and stalk regions. The head region of YadA is composed of beta-helices further folded to create a nine-coiled left-handed parallel beta-roll (LPBR).|$|E
25|$|Milk {{collected}} or {{stored in}} unsanitary conditions may harbor {{a host of}} disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), Listeria (Listeriosis), Salmonella (Salmonellosis), <b>Yersinia</b> (<b>Yersinia</b> enterocolitica), and Brucella (Brucellosis). Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their milk can have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} <b>Yersinia</b> enterocolitica bears structural similarity {{with the}} human thyrotropin receptor and was hypothesized {{to contribute to the}} development of thyroid autoimmunity arising for other reasons in genetically susceptible individuals.|$|E
25|$|At Kytmanovo in Russia between Mongolia and Kazakhstan, dated 1746–1626 BC, {{a strain}} of <b>Yersinia</b> pestis was {{extracted}} from a dead woman's tooth in a grave common to her and to two children. This strain's genes express flagellin, which triggers the human immune response. However, by contrast with other prehistoric <b>Yersinia</b> pestis bacteria, the strain does so weakly; later, historic plague does not express flagellin at all, accounting for its virulence. The Kytmanovo strain was therefore under selection toward becoming a plague (although {{it was not the}} plague). The three people in that grave all died at the same time, and the researcher believes that this para-plague is what killed them.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline is {{also used}} as a {{prophylactic}} treatment for infection by Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) and is effective against <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, the infectious agent of bubonic plague. It {{is also used}} for malaria treatment and prophylaxis, as well as treating elephantitis filariasis.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} and prophylaxis of anthrax and Leptospirosis. It is also effective against <b>Yersinia</b> pestis (the infectious agent of bubonic plague), and is prescribed for {{the treatment}} of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
25|$|The spf gene {{is highly}} conserved in Escherichia, Shigella, Klebsiella, Salmonella, <b>Yersinia</b> genera within the Enterobacteriaceae family. In E. coli the spf gene {{is flanked by}} polA (upstream) and yihA (downstream). A CRP binding {{sequence}} and -10 and -35 promoter sequences are found upstream of spf.|$|E
25|$|If {{the mixture}} {{produces}} bubbles or froth, the organism {{is said to}} be 'catalase-positive'. Staphylococci and Micrococci are catalase-positive. Other catalase-positive organisms include Listeria, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Burkholderia cepacia, Nocardia, the family Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter, E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Shigella, <b>Yersinia,</b> Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia), Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhodococcus equi.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yersinia</b> pestis circulates {{in animal}} reservoirs, {{particularly}} in rodents, {{in the natural}} foci of infection found on all continents except Australia. The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.|$|E
25|$|The TAAs {{can help}} prevent the {{bacteria}} from being destroyed by the host's immune system. In particular {{in the case of}} certain <b>Yersinia</b> spp., the TAA YadA has a role in autoagglutination, serum resistance, complement inactivation, and phagocytosis resistance. All of these methods prevent the bacteria from being eliminated by the host and ensure its survival.|$|E
25|$|Bubonic plague is one {{of three}} types of plague caused by {{bacterium}} <b>Yersinia</b> pestis. One to seven days after exposure to the bacteria, flu like symptoms develop. These include fever, headaches, and vomiting. Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin. Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open.|$|E
25|$|Plague is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} bacterium <b>Yersinia</b> pestis. Symptoms include fever, weakness, and headache. Usually this begins one to seven days after exposure. In the bubonic form there is also swelling of lymph nodes, while in the septicemic form tissues may turn black and die, and in the pneumonic form shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain may occur.|$|E
25|$|A type III {{secretion}} system {{means that}} a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of Salmonella, Shigella, <b>Yersinia)</b> can inject nutrients into protist cells. One such mechanism was first discovered in Y. pestis and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{is associated}} with the HLA-B27 gene on chromosome 6 and by the presence of enthesitis as the basic pathologic lesion and is triggered by a preceding infection. The most common triggering infection in the US is a genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Other bacteria known to cause reactive arthritis which are more common worldwide are Ureaplasma urealyticum, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., <b>Yersinia</b> spp., and Campylobacter spp.|$|E
25|$|Wild rodents, {{including}} rats, {{can carry}} many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter. The Black Death is traditionally {{believed to have}} been caused by the micro-organism <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is the foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
25|$|The third plague {{pandemic}} (1855–1859) {{started in}} China in the mid-19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 {{million people in}} India alone. Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia between 1900 and 1925 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led {{to the establishment of}} a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus <b>Yersinia</b> pestis.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 {{researchers}} found {{that the cause of}} the pandemic was <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, the bacterium responsible for bubonic plague. The plague's social and cultural impact during the period of Justinian has been compared to that of the similar Black Death that devastated Europe 600 years after the last outbreak of Justinian plague. The principal historian during the 6th century, Procopius, viewed the pandemic as worldwide in scope. Genetic studies point to China as having been the primary source of the contagion.|$|E
25|$|Black-footed ferrets are {{susceptible}} to numerous diseases. They are fatally susceptible to canine distemper virus, introduced by striped skunks, common raccoons, red foxes, coyotes, and American badgers. A short-term vaccine for canine distemper is available for captive black-footed ferrets, but no protection is available for young born in the wild. Black-footed ferrets are also susceptible to rabies, tularemia, and human influenza. They can directly contract sylvatic plague (<b>Yersinia</b> pestis), and epidemics in prairie dog towns may completely destroy the ferrets' prey base.|$|E
25|$|The French-Swiss {{bacteriologist}} Alexandre Yersin, discoverer of the <b>Yersinia</b> pestis bacterium {{lived in}} Nha Trang for 50 {{years and was}} affectionately known as Ông Năm. He established the Indochinese Pasteur Institute (now known as the Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang), devoted to researching the bubonic plague. Yersin died in Nha Trang on 1 March 1943. A street in the city is named after him, and a shrine has been built over his tomb. There is also a Yersin Museum dedicated to his achievements.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{explanation for}} the Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named <b>Yersinia</b> pestis. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas {{move on to other}} hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Samuel K. Cohn {{published}} the controversial article, “The Black Death: End of the Paradigm”. In the article Cohn {{argues that the}} medieval and modern plagues were two distinct diseases differing in their symptoms, signs, and epidemiologies. Cohn asserts that the agent causing the bubonic plague, <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, “was first cultured at Hong Kong in 1894.” In turn, the medieval plague that struck Europe, according to Cohn, was not the bubonic plague carried by fleas on rats as traditionally viewed by scientists and historians alike.|$|E
25|$|Agents {{considered}} for weaponization, or {{known to be}} weaponized, include bacteria such as Bacillus anthracis, Brucella spp., Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, some of the Rickettsiaceae (especially Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia rickettsii), Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae, and <b>Yersinia</b> pestis. Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, {{including some of the}} Bunyaviridae (especially Rift Valley fever virus), Ebolavirus, many of the Flaviviridae (especially Japanese encephalitis virus), Machupo virus, Marburg virus, Variola virus, and Yellow fever virus. Fungal agents that have been studied include Coccidioides spp..|$|E
25|$|The Black Death, {{caused by}} <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, is {{enzootic}} (commonly present) in populations of ground rodents in Central Asia. Morelli et al. (2010) reported {{the origin of}} the plague bacillus to be in China. An older theory places the first cases in the steppes of Central Asia, and others, such as the historian Michael W. Dols, argue that the historical evidence concerning epidemics in the Mediterranean and specifically the Plague of Justinian point to a probability that the Black Death originated in Central Asia (not Africa - Asia (http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206309.php) where it then became entrenched among the rodent population.|$|E
25|$|Infectious {{vulvovaginitis}} can {{be caused}} by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (7-20% of cases), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella, <b>Yersinia,</b> or common STI organisms (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus). Symptoms and treatment of infectious vulvovaginitis vary depending on the organism causing it. Shigella infections of the reproductive tract usually coexist with infectious of the gastrointestinal tract and cause mucous, purulent discharge. They are treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Streptococcus infections cause similar symptoms to nonspecific vulvovaginitis and are treated with amoxicillin. STI-associated vulvovaginitis may be caused by sexual abuse or vertical transmission, and are treated and diagnosed like adult infections.|$|E
25|$|Another way for {{bacteria}} {{to defend against}} phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication. The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in <b>Yersinia</b> pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yersinia</b> pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} coccobacillus, non mobile with no spores. It is a {{facultative anaerobic}} organism that can infect humans via the oriental rat flea. It causes the disease plague, which takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic plagues. All three forms {{were responsible for}} a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including: the 6th century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the Third Pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Modern Plague, which began in the late 19th century in China and spread by rats on steamboats claiming close to 10 million lives. These plagues probably originated in China and were transmitted west via trade routes.|$|E
25|$|Brown rats are {{sometimes}} mistakenly {{thought to be}} a major reservoir of bubonic plague, a possible cause of the Black Death. However, the bacterium responsible, <b>Yersinia</b> pestis, is commonly endemic in only a few rodent species and is usually transmitted zoonotically by rat fleas—common carrier rodents today include ground squirrels and wood rats. However, brown rats may suffer from plague, as can many nonrodent species, including dogs, cats, and humans. The original carrier for the plague-infected fleas thought to be responsible for the Black Death was the black rat, and it has been hypothesized that the displacement of black rats by brown rats led to the decline of bubonic plague. This theory has, however, been deprecated, as the dates of these displacements do not match the increases and decreases in plague outbreaks.|$|E
