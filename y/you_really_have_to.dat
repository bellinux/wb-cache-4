500|$|Cut {{into the}} western wall of the debating chamber are {{laminated}} glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a human dimension to the chamber. At night, light is shone through the glass panels and is projected onto the MSPs' desks to create {{the impression that the}} chamber is never unoccupied. Natural light diffuses into the chamber and is provided by [...] "glass fins" [...] which run down from light spaces in the ceiling. Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs' console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building. Such is the level of craftsmanship, a result of the union of Miralles' inventive designs, superb detailing by RMJM and excellent craftsmanship in execution, that Jencks was prompted to state that the [...] is [...] "an arts and crafts building, designed with high-tech flair. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to the Houses of Parliament in London to get interior design of such a high creative level—in fact, it is more creative".|$|E

500|$|Almost all of {{the players}} Brown signed were war veterans. Gatski hitchhiked to Bowling Green from West Virginia in a {{military}} uniform. Once at training camp, the players faced intense competition for spots on the final roster.

2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E

[...] In February 2015, Danny Elfman was revealed to have composed additional music for the score, ultimately receiving co-composer credit. On working with Elfman, Tyler said, [...] "The movie is such a large canvas that there were parts that really benefited from his kind of voice. But also, it needed to all fit together and hang together seamlessly, {{and that was something}} we worked really hard on doing." [...] Tyler and Elfman strove to orchestrate, record, and mix their music similarly. Tyler wrote much more quiet and emotional music for Age of Ultron [...] "than you would've thought ... you can go deeper in a second movie because in the first movie <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> set everyone up".

Strangely enough, it is very well worth doing, for, though it is even more factitiously Moorish than the Alcazar, it is of almost as great beauty and of greater dignity. Gardens, galleries, staircases, statues, paintings, all are interesting, with a mingled air of care and neglect which is peculiarly charming, though perhaps the keener sensibilities, the morbider nerves may suffer from the glare and hardness of the tiling which render the place so wonderful and so exquisite. One must complain of something, and I complain of the tiling; I do not mind the house being supposed like the house of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem.|$|E
