Two years after Selena's murder, Dreaming of You and Siempre Selena (1996) occupied {{the third and fourth}} slots respectively on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. Dreaming of You sold 420,500 copies between 1997 and 1999, and sold 190,000 units in 1997 alone. The biopic Selena (1997) contributed to a 65% increase of sales for Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> year. Dreaming of You sold half a million copies in Texas. Some Texas retailers criticized sale figures for the state because the album had sold poorly at their music stores. By December 1995, Dreaming of You had sold two million copies in the U.S. and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of two million copies. Within ten months of its release, the album was nearing triple-platinum status; it was eventually certified 35×platinum (Latin field) by the RIAA, denoting shipment of 3.5 million units. It remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S. with five million copies sold worldwide as of January 2015. A percentage of the proceeds from the album's sales was donated to the Selena Scholarship Fund.|$|E

500|$|The single's lyrics cover {{a variety}} of issues, ranging from [...] "body image, class division, an unhappy {{marriage}} and alcoholism". [...] "Ugly" [...] opens with Fantasia narrating a tragic story about {{a woman with a}} “picket fence, two-car garage and a man that she don’t love”. The narrative's rural setting is established through the lyrics, “Gimme that rusty old grain silo”. Fantasia advocates for female empowerment and explores expectations regarding beauty with lyrics like: [...] "With dirt on my hands and scrapes on my knees/Feeling like nothing can wash it off clean/Tell your girls it’s a beautiful thing/Just trust me/It’s far from ugly.” The lyrics also feature the importance of love, with Fantasia singing, “Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> good good man who loves me.” Alex Mcpherson interpreted Fantasia's delivery of the lyric “Give me good food that sticks to my bones” as incorporating gospel elements into the song. [...] "Ugly" [...] ends with Fantasia discussing her life immediately after winning the third season of American Idol.|$|E
