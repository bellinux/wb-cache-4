500|$|Offa died on 29 July 796, and may {{be buried}} in Bedford, {{though it is not}} clear that the [...] "Bedeford" [...] named in that charter was {{actually}} Bedford. He was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith of Mercia, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days. A letter written by Alcuin in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had gone to great lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin's opinion is that Ecgfrith [...] "has not died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son." [...] It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith's consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and Coenwulf, Ecgfrith's successor, was only distantly related to Offa's line.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Subtle Invitation" [...] {{to be one}} of the album's strongest songs {{because of}} its [...] "well executed" [...] jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote, [...] "it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice." [...] "Clown" [...] drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said [...] "Clown" [...] was [...] "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well we never even touched each other." [...] Critics compared [...] "I Only Wanted" [...] with [...] "My All"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, [...] "Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Eminem {{mentioned}} the singer twice on The Eminem Show, his fourth studio album, {{on the tracks}} [...] "Superman" [...] and [...] "When the Music Stops", {{both of which were}} revealed to have been inspired by their relationship in Eminem's 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am. The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that it was never a [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody." [...] Carey recorded a song called [...] "Clown" [...] for Charmbracelet which [...] "ambiguously addressed the relationship" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Should've left it at I like your music too" [...] and [...] "You should've never intimated we were lovers/ When <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well we never even touched each other." ...|$|E

500|$|From {{the year}} 2001 onwards, Eminem {{claimed to have}} dated Carey for six months {{throughout}} the gloomy times in her life. Carey denied ever having {{been involved with the}} rapper in a personal relationship, claiming that they had only met a handful of times, and it was professional. Subsequently, he referred to Carey in several of his songs in a negative light, claiming to have been angered by her not admitting to seeing him. On Charmbracelet, Carey included a song titled [...] "Clown", which critics suggested was aimed at Eminem. [...] "Clown"'s lyrics were described as [...] "languidly sinister" [...] by Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, and read: [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / When <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well we never even touched each other." [...] In 2005, during concerts on the rapper's Anger Management Tour, he began playing voice-mails and recordings that were reportedly left by Carey. One of the messages said: [...] "I heard you were getting back with your ex-wife. Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?". After playing the excerpt, Eminem would pretend to be sick before launching into his song [...] "Puke". On May 12, 2009, Eminem released his sixth studio album Relapse, which included the song [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". The song's lyrics suggested Eminem was still in love with Carey and [...] "wanted her back": [...] "I want another crack at ya" [...] and [...] "Nick Cannon better back the f**k up. I'm not playing, I want her back, you punk." [...] After the song's release, Cannon went on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at the rapper's comments: ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1934 Osip Mandelstam recited his [...] "Stalin Epigram" [...] to Pasternak. After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam: [...] "I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, because, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>very</b> {{strange and}} terrible things are {{happening}} now: they've begun to pick people up. I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here {{may be able to}} listen and tell tales. So let's make out that I heard nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel {{particularly}} envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who [...] "would be that incorrigible kid who could lie to your face, letting <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well that he's lying, and make you love him for it all the same." [...] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E
2500|$|From 1925 to 1928 he was passionately {{involved}} with Dalí. The friendship with Lorca {{had a strong}} element of mutual passion, but Dalí [...] rejected the erotic advances of the poet. With the success of [...] "Gypsy Ballads", came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of {{a love affair with}} sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could only acknowledge in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a [...] "gypsy poet". He wrote: [...] "The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I could just as well be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>very</b> well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast". Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when surrealists Dalí and Luis Buñuel collaborated on their 1929 film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself. At this time Dalí also met his future wife Gala. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca's family arranged for him to take a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.|$|E
