Since anyone can publish information instantly on the World Wide Web distinguishing quality information can be very difficult. Before {{the coming of the}} information age, {{there were only a few}} options for research – books, magazines, and scholarly journals. Scholarly journals (also called academic, peer-reviewed, or refereed journals) are the traditional method of communicating new scientific discoveries. Authors generally submit their articles to several other scientists for review and comment, and these reviewers must approve the article before it is published. Since the audience is other scientists, the language used is highly technical and specific to the field. Scholarly journals are one type of primary source for research. Primary sources are newly created or recorded knowledge by a scientist or researcher. These can be scholarly journal articles, scientific reports or even an in-person presentation. Secondary sources review, discuss, or analyze primary sources and are written later. Some examples of secondary sources are encyclopedia articles, science news reports, and most books. Both types of information sources may have citations, references to earlier research. Citations in a primary source are an acknowledgement of previous research and give a link between earlier knowledge and the current study. Citations in a secondary source indicate where the author got the information they used to write their review of the topic. For this lab, work in groups of two at each computer.

60|$|But {{now that}} we know that How and Why are two very {{different}} matters, and must not be confounded with each other, let us look for Madam How, and see her at work making this little glen; for, as I told you, it is not half made yet. One thing we shall see at once, and see it more and more clearly the older we grow; I mean her wonderful patience and diligence. Madam How is never idle for an instant. Nothing is too great or too small for her; and she keeps her work before her eye in the same moment, and makes every separate bit of it help every other bit. She will keep the sun and stars in order, while she looks after poor old Mrs. Daddy- long-legs there and her eggs. She will spend thousands of years in building up a mountain, and thousands of years in grinding it down again; and then carefully polish every grain of sand which falls from that mountain, and put it in its right place, where it will be wanted thousands of years hence; and she will take just as much trouble about that one grain of sand as she did about the whole mountain. She will settle the exact place where Mrs. Daddy-long-legs shall lay her eggs, at the very same time that she is settling what shall happen hundreds of years hence in a stair millions of miles away. And I really believe that Madam How knows her work so thoroughly, that the grain of sand which sticks now to your shoe, and the weight of Mrs. Daddy-long-legs' eggs at the bottom of her hole, will have an effect upon suns and stars ages after you and I are dead and gone. Most patient indeed is Madam How. She does not mind the least seeing her own work destroyed; she knows that it must be destroyed. There is a spell upon her, and a fate, that everything she makes she must unmake again: and yet, good and wise woman as she is, she never frets, nor tires, nor fudges her work, as we say at school. She takes just as much pains to make an acorn as to make a peach. She takes just as much pains about the acorn which the pig eats, as about the acorn which will grow into a tall oak, and help to build a great ship. She took just as much pains, again, about the acorn which you crushed under your foot just now, and which you fancy will never come to anything. Madam How is wiser than that. She knows that it will come to something. She will find some use for it, as she finds a use for everything. That acorn which you crushed will turn into mould, and that mould will go to feed the roots of some plant, perhaps next year, if it lies where it is; or perhaps it will be washed into the brook, and then into the river, and go down to the sea, and will feed the roots of some plant in some new continent ages and ages hence: and so Madam How will have her own again. You dropped your stick into the river yesterday, and it floated away. You were sorry, because it had cost you a great deal of trouble to cut it, and peel it, and carve a head and <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Madam How was not sorry, though she had taken a great deal more trouble with that stick than ever you had taken. She had been three years making that stick, out of many things, sunbeams among the rest. But when it fell into the river, Madam How knew that she should not lose her sunbeams nor anything else: the stick would float down the river, and on into the sea; and there, when it got heavy with the salt water, it would sink, and lodge, and be buried, and perhaps ages hence turn into coal; and ages after that some one would dig it up and burn it, and then out would come, as bright warm flame, all the sunbeams that were stored away in that stick: and so Madam How would have her own again. And if that should not be the fate of your stick, still something else will happen to it just as useful in the long run; for Madam How never loses anything, but uses up all her scraps and odds and ends somehow, somewhere, somewhen, as is fit and proper for the Housekeeper of the whole Universe. Indeed, Madam How is so patient that some people fancy her stupid, and think that, because she does not fall into a passion every time you steal her sweets, or break her crockery, or disarrange her furniture, therefore she does not care. But I advise you as a little boy, and still more when you {{grow up to be a}} man, not to get that fancy into your head; for you will find that, however good-natured and patient Madam How is in most matters, her keeping silence and not seeming to see you is no sign that she has forgotten. On the contrary, she bears a grudge (if one may so say, with all respect to her) longer than any one else does; because she will always have her own again. Indeed, I sometimes think that if it were not for Lady Why, her mistress, she might bear some of her grudges for ever and ever. I have seen men ere now damage some of Madam How's property when they were little boys, and be punished by her all their lives long, even though she had mended the broken pieces, or turned them to some other use. Therefore I say to you, beware of Madam How. She will teach you more kindly, patiently, and tenderly than any mother, if you want to learn her trade. But if, instead of learning her trade, you damage her materials and play with her tools, beware lest she has her own again out of you.|$|E

Indeed, as Oliver Jackson explained, Strayhorn seemed to exert a minimum of creative effort on the project.

60|$|MR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-SAVAGES,--I am {{very glad}} indeed {{to have that}} portrait. I {{think it is the}} best one that I have ever had, and there have been {{opportunities}} before to get a good photograph. I have sat to photographers twenty-two times to-day. Those sittings added to those that have preceded them since I have been in Europe--if we average at that rate--must have numbered one hundred to two hundred sittings. Out of all those there ought to be some good photographs. This is the best I have had, and I am glad to have <b>your</b> honored <b>names</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> I did not know Harold Frederic personally, but I have heard a great deal about him, and nothing that was not pleasant and nothing except such things as lead a man to honor another man and to love him. I consider that it is a misfortune of mine that I have never had the luck to meet him, and if any book of mine read to him in his last hours made those hours easier for him and more comfortable, I am very glad and proud of that. I call to mind such a case many years ago of an English authoress, well known in her day, who wrote such beautiful child tales, touching and lovely in every possible way. In a little biographical sketch of her I found that her last hours were spent partly in reading a book of mine, until she was no longer able to read. That has always remained in my mind, and I have always cherished it as one of the good things of my life. I had read what she had written, and had loved her for what she had done.|$|R
40|$|In Japanese {{both the}} finite {{form and the}} {{adnominal}} form of verbs are realized in the same way. The two finite forms, nonpast: -(r) u and past: -(i) ta, {{can also be used}} to express time in subordinate clauses. However in subordinate clauses these two forms do not exhibit tense based on the time of a utterance (absolute tense), but rather they show the temporal relationship of the subordinate clause relative to the main clause(relative tense).

PSTpaper=ACCtake-ADVFcome-ADVFplease “Please bring the piece of paper with <b>your</b> <b>name</b> written <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> ” ［Sentence as whole is future, adnominal clause is past］ As seen above, irrespective of the fact that the event occurredin the past, the -(r) u(nonpast) appears in the subordinate clause ((1) a). Also, irrespective of the fact that the event has yet to occur, we see the -(i) ta(past) appearing in the subordinate clause ((2) b). In Altaic languages, the participle has a wide range offunction: in addition to functioning both nominally and adnominally,it may also function as a sentence final predicate. When used nominally, participles take case(such as dative) directly and can be used to create adverbial phrases. Thus, in Altaic languages also, it may be possible to create expressions of relative tensesimilar to that of Japanese. So, what is the extent of similarity among Altaic-type languages (including Japanese) in this respect? Results of investigation are summarized in the following table. Table 1 ：Comparison of tense of subordinate clauses (R: Relative tense, A: Absolute tense, N: Neutralized) Aspect	Form	Jap. 	Turk. 	Khalkha	Nanai	ex. Temporal C. 	Momentary	nonpst in pst	R	R	N	R	[1] Durative	pst in pst	A	R	N	A / N	[2] Causal C. 	Durative	nonpst/pst in pst	A / N	A	A	A / N	[3] Adnominal C. 	pst in nonpst	R	(R) 	A	(R) 	[4] (In the following sentences, English is a kind of meta-language.) [1] When I go to Russia, I bought a hat. [2] When I read/was reading the newspaper, I found a picture of my friend. [3] X is/was sleeping during the lesson, so I woke him/her up. [4] Please bring the piece of paper with <b>your</b> <b>name</b> written <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> In this paper, I would like to maintain the following points: (A) 	The realization of the relative tense shows asymmetry. The nonpast (or imperfect or like that) verb form in the subordinate clause tends to occur in the past sentence more often, but the past form in the present or future sentence harder to occur. (B) The relative tense is realized differently by the kind of adverbial clauses; such as, “when” clause (temporal (simultaneous) clause), “because” clause (causal clause), “though” clause (adversative clause) and “if” clause (conditional clause). The relative tense is realized mostly in the simultaneous clause, because the temporal relationship (before or after) is important in this type of sentence. But the meaning of “after” clause and “when” clause are more often realized by converbs in the Altaic-type languages. On the other hand, the relative tense tend not to be realized in causal or adversative clause, because in these clauses state truths. (C) The relative tense is realized differently along the aspect of the verbs of the subordinate clause(and that of the main clause). The difference between momentary action and durative action influences the realization of the relative tense. The relative tense is realized more in the case of momentary verbs. On the other hand the tense opposition tends to be neutralized in the case of durative verbs. (D) The relative tense occurs more in the Altaic-type languages than the languages of other types. Because in the Altaic-type languages converbs (or adverbial forms or like that) are often used and the tense of the sentence-final predicates have the scope over the whole sentence. On the other hand the predicate in the middle of a sentence tends to express only the temporal (before or after) relationship to the tense of the sentense-final predicate. (E) Furthermore, the realization of the relative tense differs among the Altaic-type languages...|$|R

40|$|The online archive Murals of Northern Ireland, held in Claremont Colleges Digital Library and {{covering}} {{the period from}} the late 1970 s to the recent past, shows how the nature and function of murals in Northern Ireland have changed. In Derry and Belfast, they are {{the focal point of}} a tourist trail that has been established in the decade or so since the official end of the conflict following the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Now figured as 2 ̆ 7 heritage 2 ̆ 7 and commodified in various forms [...] postcards, posters, books and guided taxi tours (Fig. 1) [...] the murals have become a source of revenue and profit for a number of organizations: ex‑prisoners 2 ̆ 7 associations, artists 2 ̆ 7 collectives, local community groups, and traditional commercial projects. The impulse behind some of the tours appears to be genuinely educative; in others, crassly exploitative. One West Belfast tour, for example, exhorts its customers to 2 ̆ 7 touch the peace wall, or write <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> like millions of others, famous and otherwise, after all it is longer than the Berlin wall! 2 ̆ 7, while another offers a 2 ̆ 7 welcome to the biggest outdoor art gallery in the world 2 ̆ 7, and yet another promises to 2 ̆ 7 get {{into the heart of the}} areas that bore the brunt of the conflict 2 ̆ 7 while guaranteeing 2 ̆ 7 the opportunity to take photographs and a brief stop at the souvenir shop 2 ̆ 7.

Although this commodification is a long way from the directly war-related function of the earliest murals (Fig. 2), it is by no means the only change that deserves attention. Two others are: the attempt by the state to influence the development of murals in both republican and loyalist areas; and the shift in the nature of republican murals, particularly in Belfast, and the political difficulties that this poses for the republican movement — or at least that part of the republican movement that signed up to the peace process and is now involved in the political administration of Northern Ireland...|$|E

In Facebook's Dublin, Ireland headquarters, six individuals were determined to be [...] "high priority" [...] victims of the error, after the company concluded that their profiles were likely viewed by potential terrorists in groups such as ISIS, Hezbollah and the Kurdistan Workers' Party. The bug itself, discovered in November 2016 and fixed two weeks later, was active for one month, and had also been retroactively exposing censored personal accounts from August 2016. One affected worker had fled Ireland, gone into hiding, and only returned to Ireland after five months {{due to a lack}} of money. Suffering from psychological distress, he filed a legal claim against Facebook and CPL Resources, an outsourcing company, seeking compensation. A Facebook spokesperson stated that [...] "Our investigation found that only a small fraction of the names were likely viewed, and we never had evidence of any threat to the people impacted or their families as a result of this matter", and Craig D’Souza, Facebook's head of global investigations, said: [...] "Keep in mind that when the person sees <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the list, <b>it</b> was in their activity log, which contains a lot of information ... there is a good chance that they associate you with another admin of the group or a hacker". Facebook offered to install a home-alarm monitoring system, provide transport to and from work, and counseling through its employee assistance program. As a result of the data leak, Facebook is reportedly testing the use of alternative, administrative accounts for workers reviewing content, rather than requiring workers to sign in with their personal profiles.|$|R
