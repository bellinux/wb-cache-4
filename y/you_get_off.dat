5|$|Her {{choice to}} {{film in the}} Kingdom met some resistance. In discussion, Bigelow found that her cast and crew shared {{stereotypes}} of the region from American culture. “Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions,” she said. “But once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> the plane you realise it's like Manhattan without the trees,” she continued. As Iraq dominated discourse in America and across the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.|$|E

500|$|Then {{she asked}} a final question, {{on what was}} Brahman (world of the imperishable)? Yagnavalakya {{put an end to}} the debate by telling Gargi not to proceed further as other wise she would lose her mental balance. This riposte {{put an end to the}}ir further {{dialogue}} at the conference of the learned. However, at the end of the debate she conceded to the superior knowledge of Yajnavalkya by saying: [...] "venerable Brahmins, you may consider it a great thing if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> bowing before him. No one, I believe, will defeat him in any argument concerning Brahman." ...|$|E

500|$|Roswell met fellow voice actor Hal Rayle in 1986, {{and they}} married in 1987. He had done roles such as Predator in Predator 2, the ghoulies in Ghoulies II, and Marvin the Martian in Air Jordan commercials. They moved from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado, in June 1994 to raise their adopted {{daughter}} Spenser, {{who was born in}} 1993. Between March and November every year, when episodes of The Simpsons were being recorded, Roswell had to fly back to Los Angeles twice a week to attend the table reads and the recording sessions. In an article about her and her husband's move, Ricky Lopes of Rocky Mountain News wrote: [...] "When The Simpsons is taping, she goes to Los Angeles every Friday morning for the first reading, flies back that afternoon, flies back Sunday to tape the show Monday and flies back home that night." [...] Maggie Roswell said she [...] "got the idea for the way Helen Lovejoy says 'B-bye, b-bye, b-bye,' to everyone when they leave the church from the way the flight attendants say it when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> the plane." ...|$|E
500|$|The Rockstar team {{wanted to}} synergise the game world's {{depiction}} of California {{with the radio}} stations by licensing tracks that imparted an appropriate [...] "Cali feel". Pavlovich noted that Los Angeles' cultural saturation of pop music necessitated the Non-Stop-Pop FM station; he said that [...] "the first time <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out...We wanted that. It really connects you to the world". He felt that greater discernment was required for licensed music choices than in Grand Theft Auto IV because Grand Theft Auto Vs music plays {{a pivotal role in}} generating Californian atmosphere. Music [...] "reflects the environment in which the game is set", he said. Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio but they refined the number to 241. The tracks are shared between fifteen stations, with an additional two talk-back stations and a radio station for custom audio files on the PC version. Some tracks were written specifically for the game, such as rapper and producer Flying Lotus' original work composed for the FlyLo FM station he hosts. Pavlovich noted how the team would first develop an idea of what each station would sound like, and then select a DJ to match the station’s genre, such as Kenny Loggins who hosts the classic rock station Los Santos Rock Radio. He felt that {{to strike a balance between}} the radio and the score was a meticulous process, and cited a scenario where players would drive to a mission objective while listening to the radio, with the score taking over once players left the vehicle and proceeded to the mission's next stage.|$|E
2500|$|Heybeliada (meaning [...] "Saddlebag Island"; [...] Chalki) is {{the second}} largest of the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara. It is a {{neighbourhood}} in the Adalar district of Istanbul. The large Naval Cadet School overlooks the jetty to the left as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> the ferry. There are two interesting pieces of architecture {{on the grounds of}} the school. One is Kamariotissa, the only remaining Byzantine church on the island, and more importantly the last church to be built before the conquest of Constantinople. The other is the grave of the second English Ambassador to be sent to Constantinople by Elizabeth I of England, Edward Barton, who chose to live on Heybeli to escape the bustle of the city.|$|E

2500|$|Porch was a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman. He did {{not appear}} in first-class cricket for Oxford University, but when Somerset played the university side in 1895, he played for the county team, scoring 11 and 42. At {{the end of the}} university term, he became a fairly regular player for Somerset {{in the second half of}} the 1895 season. In his third first-class match, against Essex at Taunton, he scored an unbeaten 85, and this was to be the highest score of his cricket career; he was upstaged in the match, however, by the Essex total of 692, which was the highest total for the county for 95 years until beaten in 1990. Even that Essex record was upstaged in Porch's next match for Somerset at Taunton, though, when Lancashire made 801, with Archie MacLaren setting a world record for the highest first-class score by making 424. In his obituary published in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1964, Porch was quoted, apparently without irony, as [...] "a great believer in the importance of fielding". The obituary says that his maxim was: [...] "Save six fours when the other side is batting, and you have 24 to your name before <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> the mark, though it's not in the score-book." ...|$|E
