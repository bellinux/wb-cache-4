One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house.

I wanted to dispel that {{and get rid of}} that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{has drawn}} {{influence}} {{from a number}} of musical genres. As a teenager, he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music, including the Christian singer-songwriter Larry Norman. For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given Leon Russell's 1970 debut album, which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered punk music (Black Flag), along with bands from other genres, such as the new wave band The Cars and the obscure Angst. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade, The Spotlight Kid by Captain Beefheart, and I'm Sick of <b>You,</b> <b>an</b> Iggy Pop bootleg. Thompson was also greatly influenced by the Beatles self-titled 1968 release (known as White Album) with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions (especially those featured in Doolittle).|$|E

25|$|Downtown Makati {{is the one}} of {{the most}} easily {{accessed}} business districts in the Philippines. Public transportation within the city is facilitated mostly using inexpensive jeepneys and buses for commuters working in the district. Most of the buses and jeepneys come from EDSA, the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila. Buses plying the avenue from Parañaque to Caloocan pass through the central business/financial district daily. EDSA Carpark Building in Ayala Center is the main public transport terminal inside the district. It is accessible for shoppers going to SM Makati and Glorietta. This can also accommodate the vehicles of passengers riding the MRT. There are also available intercity bus in downtown that plies routes from Ayala Center to Fort Bonifacio via McKinley Road operated only by Bonifacio Transport Corporation. The city will open the new transport hub of Makati called the McKinley Exchange, which is also along EDSA outside downtown. It gives <b>you</b> <b>an</b> efficient and convenient transport experience for both commuters and tourists. People enter and leave the city through this new central transport hub.|$|E
