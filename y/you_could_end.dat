The programme, titled [...] "Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate", included recent footage of fans chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners. The documentary recorded antisemitism and monkey noise taunts of black players in Poland. In Ukraine, the documentary recorded Nazi salutes and FC Metalist Kharkiv fans violently assaulting a group of Asian students at the Metalist Oblast Sports Complex, one of the stadiums hosting matches in Ukraine. Panorama filmed former England defender Sol Campbell watching these clips, and then asked him whether he would recommend families go to the Championship.

In the following chapter we will provide a definition and explanation of food quality {{in the context of}} local and regional food. The quality concept is divided in production quality, the way the food has been produced, and product quality, the quality of the produce itself. Most effort will be put on the latter, based on an illustration of four important product quality traits.

40|$|The article {{provides}} a typology or map of ethical behavior. The map is detailed {{in the table}} in the article. In the table a wide range of behaviors that {{can be found in the}} public service are listed. These behaviors are grouped into three categories: "Value-Based Ethics": Behaviors that serve the public good and maximize the values of life, health, and freedom, values that can be seen as being reflected in the Preamble to the U. S. Constitution; "Value Neutral or Relative Ethics": Behaviors that reflect an indifference to Value-Based Ethics, " and "No Values": Behaviors that reflect values that are at odds with the public good. While the map has primary applicability to those who serve in the public sector, it can also be seen as having applicability to those in the private sector. This is particularly the case among those in the private sector who strive to balance the goals of making a profit with contributing to the public good. While individuals in the private sector are not obliged to act in ways that give high priority to serving the public good, those in the public sector are so obligated. A major purpose of the map is to compare and contrast behaviors across the three categories and to 1 awaken understanding and insight that might serve as an impetus for nurturing and strengthening value-based behavior among those who serve in government. ________________________________________________________________ There is an old adage, "If you don't know where you're going, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>end</b> up anywhere. " It has been seen by some as having great relevance to the field of public administration. A luminary in the field, Dwight Waldo, had made a similar observation over thirty years ago in his article entitled "Public Administration and Change: Terra Paene Incognita " (Waldo, 1969). He asserted that the field was bereft of a philosophy of change or sense of direction. Indeed, his work influenced my selection of a dissertation topic that addressed thi...|$|E

5000|$|Landay viewed Defending Jacob as a {{deviation}} from his usual style of writing, explaining: [...] "My first two books {{were easy to}} categorize as “crime novels.” I {{have no problem with}} that label, but the fact is a lot of mainstream readers simply won’t even consider them. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> call Defending Jacob a crime novel, too, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> just as easily call it a family drama". In an interview with The Huffington Post, Landay said that while he tried to avoid using real-life cases for his books, [...] "there were many cases that inspired various aspects of Defending Jacob, most of them of only local interest in the Boston area, where I live". In a separate interview, he revealed that [...] "the first manuscript of Defending Jacob that I submitted actually had a different ending. What followed was a very long discussion about how the story <b>could</b> <b>end</b> in a way that was both big enough to be dramatically satisfying yet small enough to be credible for the ordinary people who populate the book".|$|R

[...] If by any happy chance she throws a lace wrap about her, then it clings; and if she lifts her gown--as she is apt to--it shows, not what I should have expected, but a jupon, and even that clings. What a jupon is I don't know. With my gown, I never wear one. These people I have described, The Man and The Woman--The Snoopopaths--are, of course, not husband and wife, or brother and sister, or anything so simple and old-fashioned as that. She is some one else's wife. She is The Wife of the Other Man. Just what there is, for the reader, about other men's wives, I don't understand. I know tons of them that I wouldn't walk round a block for. But the reading public goes wild over them. The old-fashioned heroine was unmarried. That spoiled the whole story. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> see the <b>end</b> from the beginning. But with Another Man's Wife, the way is blocked.

5000|$|During {{the late}} Middle Ages and Renaissance, weapon imports from Europe {{influenced}} Gaelic weapon design. Take {{for example the}} German Zweihänder sword, a long double-handed weapon used for quick, powerful cuts and thrusts. Irish swords were copied from these models, which had unique furnishings. Many, for example, often featured open rings on the pommel. On any locally designed Irish sword in the Middle Ages, this meant <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see the <b>end</b> of the tang go through the pommel and cap the end. These swords were often of very fine construction and quality. Scottish swords continued to use the more traditional [...] "V" [...] cross-guards {{that had been on}} pre-Norse Gaelic swords, culminating in such pieces as the now famous [...] "claymore" [...] design. This was an outgrowth of numerous earlier designs, and has become a symbol of Scotland. The claymore was used together with the typical axes of the Gallowglasses until the 18th century, but began to be replaced by pistols and muskets. Also increasingly common at that time were basket-hilted swords, shorter versions of the claymore which were used with one hand in conjunction with a shield. These basket-hilted broadswords are still a symbol of Scotland to this day, as is the typical shield known as a [...] "targe." ...|$|R
