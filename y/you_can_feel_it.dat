2500|$|Perkins {{learned more}} about the guitar from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties. [...] "Uncle John", as Perkins called him, played blues and gospel music on an old {{acoustic}} guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to [...] "Get down close to it. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> Let it vib-a-rate." [...] Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of blue note.|$|E

There are bits which are {{definitely}} Wagnerian: the use of dotted rhythms, always in 4/4 time â€“ you get the whiff of Meistersinger or Lohengrin, I think. There is, also, for example, a remarkable duet at the end of act 2, I would say Verdian in its sweep. [...] There are, of course, the stand-up arias, never a full ensemble until right at the end. [...] Rebecca's aria is a very interesting piece. [...] Whenever she is singing he uses the cor anglais to stress the sort of Eastern quality, and Sullivan claimed that this theme was one he had heard as a student in Leipzig, when he had attended a service at the Synagogue there. You can tell, and he quickly establishes it in the music, that he was not writing an operetta! [...] Look at this, very early on, some virtuoso stuff. [...] It needs a really accomplished orchestra. [...] He had always been cramped by the small orchestra, only ever one oboe, that he had to make do with at the Savoy. [...] Here he was really able to expand, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> in the music." ...|$|E

But it is all the world to me. You can {{understand}} that I should think you might learn to love even me, if you loved no one else.' The tone of his voice was manly, {{and at the same time}} full of entreaty. His eyes as he looked at her were bright with love and anxiety. She not only believed him as to the tale which he now told her; but she believed in him altogether. She knew that he was a staff on which a woman might safely lean, trusting to it for comfort and protection in life. In that moment she all but yielded to him. Had he seized her in his arms and kissed her then, I think she would have yielded. She did all but love him. She so regarded him that had it been some other woman that he craved, she would have used every art she knew to have backed his suit, and would have been ready to swear that any woman was a fool who refused him. She almost hated herself because she was unkind to one who so thoroughly deserved kindness. As it was, she made him no answer, but continued to walk beside him trembling. 'I thought I would tell it you all, because I wish you to know exactly the state of my mind. I would show you if I could all my heart and all my thoughts about yourself as in a glass case. Do not coy your love for me if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> When you know, dear, that a man's heart is set upon a woman as mine is set on you, so that it is for you to make his life bright or dark, for you to open or to shut the gates of his earthly Paradise, I think you will be above keeping him in darkness for the sake of a girlish scruple.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} be summer, [...] In the forenoon of the day; and the master's diligent pencil [...] Laid its last light touches on Eve driven forth out of Eden, [...] Otherwise Violante, and while his pupils about him [...] Wrought and chattered, in silence ran {{the thought of the}} painter: [...] "She, and forever she! Is it come to be my perdition? [...] Shall I, then, never more make the face of a {{beautiful}} woman [...] But it must take her divine, accursÃ¨d beauty upon it, [...] And, when I finish my work, stand forth her visible presence? [...] Ah! I could take this sword and strike it into her bosom! [...] Though I believe my own heart's blood would stream from the [...] painting, [...] So much I love her! Yes, that look is marvellous like you, [...] Wandering, tender--such as I'd give my salvation to win you [...] Once to bend upon me! But I knew myself better than make you, [...] Lest I should play the fool about you here before people, [...] Helpless to turn away from your violet eyes, Violante, [...] That have turned all my life to a vision of madness." [...] The painter [...] Here unto speech betraying the thoughts he had silently pondered, [...] "Visions, visions, my son?" [...] said a gray old friar who listened, [...] Seated there in the sun, with his eye on the work of the painter [...] Fishily fixed, while the master blasphemed behind his mustaches. [...] "Much have I envied your Art, who vouchsafeth to those who adore [...] her [...] Visions of heavenly splendor denied to fastings and vigils. [...] I have spent days and nights of faint and painful devotion, [...] Scourged myself almost to death, without one glimpse of the glory [...] Which your touch has revealed in the face of that heavenly maiden. [...] Pleasure me to repeat what it was you were saying of visions: [...] Fain would I know how they come to you, though I never see them, [...] And in my thickness of hearing I fear some words have escaped me." [...] Then, while the painter glared on the lifted face of the friar, [...] Baleful, breathless, bewildered, fiercer than noon in the dog-days, [...] Round the circle of pupils there ran a tittering murmur; [...] From the lips to the ears of those nameless Beppis and Gigis [...] Buzzed the stinging whisper: [...] "Let's hear Pordenone's confession." [...] Well they knew the master's luckless love, and whose portrait [...] He had unconsciously painted there, and guessed that his visions [...] Scarcely were those conceived by the friar, who constantly [...] blundered [...] Round the painter at work, mistaking every subject-- [...] Noah's drunken Debauch for the Stoning of Stephen the Martyr, [...] And the Conversion of Paul for the Flight into Egypt; forever [...] Putting his hand to his ear and shouting, [...] "Speak louder, I pray [...] you!" [...] So they waited now, in silent, amused expectation, [...] Till Pordenone's angry scorn should gather to bursting. [...] Long the painter gazed in furious silence, then slowly [...] Uttered a kind of moan, and turned again to his labor. [...] Tears gathered into his eyes, of mortification and pathos, [...] And when the dull old monk, who forgot, while he waited the answer, [...] Visions and painter, and all, had maundered away in his error, [...] Pordenone half envied the imbecile peace of his bosom; [...] "For in my own," [...] he mused, [...] "is such a combat of devils, [...] That I believe torpid age or stupid youth would be better [...] Than this manhood of mine that has climbed aloft to discover [...] Heights which I never can reach, and bright on the pinnacle [...] standing [...] In the unfading light, my rival crowned victor above me. [...] If I could hint what I feel, what forever escapes from my pencil, [...] All after-time should know my will was not less than my failure, [...] Nor should any one dare remember me merely in pity. [...] All should read my sorrows and do my discomfiture homage, [...] Saying: 'Not meanly at any time this painter meant or endeavored; [...] His was the anguish of one who falls short of the highest [...] achievement, [...] Conscious of doing his utmost, and knowing how vast his defeat is. [...] Life, if he would, might have had some second guerdon to give him, [...] But he would only the first; and behold! Let us honor [...] Grief such as his must have been; no other sorrow can match it! [...] There are certainly some things here that are nobly imagined: [...] Look! here is masterly power in this play of light, and these [...] shadows [...] Boldly are massed; and what color! One can well understand [...] Buonarotti [...] Saying the sight of his Curtius was worth the whole journey from [...] Florence. [...] Here is a man at least never less than his work; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> [...] As you can feel in Titian's the painter's inferior spirit. [...] He and this Pordenone, you know, were rivals; and Titian [...] Knew how to paint to the popular humor, and spared not [...] Foul means or fair (his way with rivals) to crush Pordenone, [...] Who with an equal chance'-- [...] "Alas, if the whole world should tell me [...] I was his equal in art, and the lie could save me from torment, [...] So must I be lost, for my soul could never believe it! [...] Nay, let my envy snarl as fierce as it will at his glory, [...] Still, when I look on his work, my soul makes obeisance within me, [...] Humbling itself before the touch that shall never be equalled." ...|$|E
