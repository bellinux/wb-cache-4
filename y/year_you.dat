25|$|The {{amount of}} {{redundancy}} {{is based on}} a length of service calculation and age. For each <b>year</b> <b>you</b> have worked while you were under 21 years old, you get half a week's pay. For each year between ages 21 and 40, one week's pay. For each year over 40, one and a half week's pay (s.162). However, there is an upper limit set on what can be considered a week's pay, which is approximately the same as a week on the minimum wage (if you were made redundant on or before 31 January 2011, it was £380 per week - from 1 February 2011 to 31 January 2012, it was £400 - currently it is £450, before tax).|$|E

500|$|Fifth-year senior Turner {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} uncontested starter at quarterback {{for the first time}} in his career. He was backed-up by sophomore Jamarr Robinson and true freshmen C. J. Brown and Danny O'Brien. Turner's {{seniority}} was called critical for the performance of the team's relatively youthful offensive line. Head coach Friedgen said, [...] "If I had to choose between a veteran offensive line and an inexperienced quarterback, or an inexperienced line with a veteran quarterback, I think I'd go with the veteran quarterback." [...] Upon the conclusion of preseason camp, the coaching staff praised his progress, particularly his game-planning, for which he had been criticized in the past. Turner said, [...] "Mentally, I am way further ahead than where I was last year." [...] Physically, he dropped 16 pounds by adding muscle and losing body fat, and weighed 220 pounds before the start of the season. Offensive coordinator Franklin said, [...] "You look at him, he was kind of mushy last <b>year.</b> <b>You</b> look at him now and he's muscular and shaped. He looks more athletic." ...|$|E

Youkilis was named the club's Rookie of the Year by the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. For the season, in 44 games, he saw an average of 4.67 pitches per plate appearance, first among major leaguers with at least 90 plate appearances. As Youkilis observed, [...] "Fighting off pitches, fouling off pitches, laying off pitches, making it so the opposing pitcher can't breathe; that's my job." [...] He was on the roster for the Red Sox for the 2004 American League Division Series (ALDS), making his sole appearance in Game 2 against the Anaheim Angels. [...] "It's been an unbelievable ride", Youkilis said. [...] "It's a great first year, a <b>year</b> <b>you</b> probably can't top. Hopefully, it ends like a Cinderella story."

[...] Later on, when still leading up to the airing of [...] "August" [...] in another interview, Roberto Orci elaborated that [...] "Individuality {{will be one of the}} things that they will be fanatically struggling with, actually. That was a fun one, because that one was one where you're finally getting to pay off things you've been setting up for a <b>year.</b> <b>You</b> finally get to open the toy box and really play with those toys". Actor Michael Cerveris, who plays September, commented in an interview that as a result of the episode, viewers would learn that the Observers [...] "are not completely devoid of feelings, and are not incapable of being attached to people they're observing". He also expressed relief that his character was no longer the sole Observer on the show, joking that [...] "it was nice to feel like I'm not the only freak in town for once".|$|E
500|$|This {{long period}} of wall-building {{burdened}} the populace and provoked controversy. Sometime between 1190 and 1196, during Zhangzong's reign, the high official Zhang Wangong (張萬公) and the Censorate recommended that work on the wall be indefinitely suspended due to a recent drought, noting: [...] "What has been begun is already being flattened by sandstorms, and bullying the people into defence works will simply exhaust them." [...] However, Chancellor Wanyan Xiang (完顏襄) convinced the emperor of the walls' merits based on an optimistic cost estimate – [...] "Although the initial outlay for the walls will be one million strings of cash, when the work is done the frontier will be secure with only half the present number of soldiers needed to defend it, which means that every <b>year</b> <b>you</b> will save three million strings of cash... The benefits will be everlasting" [...] – and so construction continued unabated. All this work created an extensive systems of walls, which consisted of a [...] "outer wall" [...] from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a [...] network of [...] "inner walls" [...] north and northeast of Beijing. Together, they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications [...] in length and [...] in diameter.
