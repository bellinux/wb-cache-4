6000|$|Upon {{proceeding}} as directed, {{but with}} as little noise as possible, they descried a man, whom of course they concluded must be Harrison, walking to and fro beneath the King's oak, as a sentinel under arms, but with more wildness of demeanour. The tramp of the horses did not escape his ear; and they heard him call out, as if {{at the head of}} the brigade-- [...] "Lower pikes against cavalry!--Here comes Prince Rupert--Stand fast, and you shall turn them aside, as a bull would toss a cur-dog. Lower your pikes still, my hearts, the end secured against your foot--down on <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee,</b> front rank--spare not for the spoiling of your blue aprons.--Ha--Zerobabel--ay, that is the word!" ...|$|E
60|$|There are {{few things}} more {{worrying}} than sitting up for somebody, especially if that somebody be at a party. You cannot help thinking {{how quickly the}} time passes with them, which drags so heavily with you; {{and the more you}} think of this, the more your hopes of their speedy arrival decline. Clocks tick so loud, too, when you are sitting up alone, and you seem as if you had an under-garment of cobwebs on. First, something tickles <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee,</b> and then the same sensation irritates your left. You have no sooner changed your position, than it comes again in the arms; when you have fidgeted your limbs into all sorts of queer shapes, you have a sudden relapse in the nose, which you rub as if to rub it off--as there is no doubt you would, if you could. Eyes, too, are mere personal inconveniences; and the wick of one candle gets {{an inch and a half}} long, while you are snuffing the other. These, and various other little nervous annoyances, render sitting up for a length of time after everybody else has gone to bed, anything but a cheerful amusement.|$|E

The movement should be vigorous and strongly accented like the 2nd count of the Jerk.|$|R

This asana is always done in the same way for men and women, different from those that have polarity like Padmasana, Siddhasana and others.|$|R
