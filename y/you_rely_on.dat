500|$|Within a month Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, and Admiral Gaspard de Coligny {{had raised}} {{an army of}} 1,800. They formed an {{alliance}} with England and seized town after town in France. Catherine met Coligny, {{but he refused to}} back down. She therefore told him: [...] "Since <b>you</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> your forces, we will show you ours". The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held Rouen. Catherine visited the deathbed of Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, after he was fatally wounded by an arquebus shot. Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, [...] "My courage is as great as yours". The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived. On 18 February 1563, a spy called Poltrot de Méré fired an arquebus {{into the back of the}} Duke of Guise, at the siege of Orléans. The murder triggered an aristocratic blood feud that complicated the French civil wars for years to come. Catherine, however, was delighted with the death of her ally. [...] "If Monsieur de Guise had perished sooner", she told the Venetian ambassador, [...] "peace would have been achieved more quickly". On 19 March 1563, the Edict of Amboise, also known as the Edict of Pacification, ended the war. Catherine now rallied both Huguenot and Catholic forces to retake Le Havre from the English.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Turrentine of The Washington Post {{praised the}} book, writing [...] "though The Accidental {{is not a}} {{conventionally}} funny novel, readers may find themselves laughing – in surprise and delight – at the way Smith takes a literary trope and riffs on it until she's turned it inside out, the way a great jazz musician might." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club praised the book, commenting that [...] "though The Accidental is more spectacularly messy than brilliant, it has a strong perspective on {{what it means to}} be alive in the early '00s, and constantly tugged at by the disturbingly similar feelings of guilt and self-righteousness." [...] In a positive review by The Guardian, Steven Poole notes that [...] "The Accidental has an infectious sense of fun and invention. The story goes through some surprising reversals and arrives at a satisfying conclusion, which is also a beginning." [...] Kirkus Reviews called the book [...] "Dazzling wordplay and abundant imagination invigorate a tale of lives interrupted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor wrote [...] "the writing brims with wit, humor, and energy." [...] In a mixed review by 'Bookslut,' Eoin Cunningham wrote [...] "The Accidental ends up more an exercise in cleverness than a story. Equally, the reader’s enjoyment of The Accidental will be inextricably linked to their appetite for such an exercise. If you aren’t swept away by Smith’s undoubted way with words, and <b>you</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> the bones of the story itself, you will be disappointed." ...|$|E

60|$|But this pleasantry is not {{the essence}} of the play. Over this essence I have no control. You propound a certain social substance, sexual {{attraction}} to wit, for dramatic distillation; and I distil it for you. I do not adulterate the product with aphrodisiacs nor dilute it with romance and water; for I am merely executing your commission, not producing a popular play for the market. You must therefore (unless, like most wise men, you read the play first and the preface afterwards) prepare yourself to face a trumpery story of modern London life, a life in which, as you know, the ordinary man's main business is to get means to keep up the position and habits of a gentleman, and the ordinary woman's business is to get married. In 9,999 cases out of 10,000, you can count on their doing nothing, whether noble or base, that conflicts with these ends; and that assurance is what <b>you</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> as their religion, their morality, their principles, their patriotism, their reputation, their honor and so forth.|$|E
60|$|I {{am not an}} {{accomplished}} lawyer. I find quite as much material for a lecture in those points wherein I have failed, as in those wherein I have been moderately successful. The leading rule for a lawyer, as for the man of every other calling, is diligence. Leave nothing for to-morrow which can be done to-day. Never let your correspondence fall behind. Whatever piece of business you have in hand, before stopping, do all the labour pertaining to it which can then be done. When you bring a common law-suit, {{if you have the}} facts for doing so, write the declaration at once. If a law point be involved, examine the books, and note the authority <b>you</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> upon the declaration itself, where you are sure to find it when wanted. The same of defences and pleas. In business not likely to be litigated,--ordinary collection cases, foreclosures, partitions, and the like,--make all examinations of titles, and note them and even draft orders and decrees in advance. The course has a triple advantage; it avoids omissions and neglect, saves your labour when once done, performs the labour out of court when you have leisure, rather than in court when you have not.|$|E
