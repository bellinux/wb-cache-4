5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|The Roma form {{a sizable}} {{minority}} in contemporary Romania, {{and a small}} but visible presence in Cluj-Napoca: self-identifying Roma in the city comprise only 1 percent of the population; <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a familiar presence {{in and around the}} central market, selling flowers, used clothes and tinware. They are an important object of public discourse and media representation at the national level; however, Cluj-Napoca, with its small Roma population, has not been a major focus of Roma ethno-political activity.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic {{literature}} reveres various goddesses, but {{far less}} frequently than gods Indra, Agni and Soma. <b>Yet,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> declared equivalent aspects of gender neutral Brahman, of Prajapati and Purusha. The goddesses often {{mentioned in the}} Vedic layers of text include the Ushas (dawn), Vac (speech, wisdom), Sarasvati (as river), Prithivi (earth), Nirriti (annihilator), Shraddha (faith, confidence). Goddesses such as Uma appear in the Upanishads as another aspect of Brahman and the knower of ultimate knowledge, such as in section 3 and 4 of the ancient Kena Upanishad.|$|E

5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only {{at the very end}} of the film.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} Rainbow Program's deactivation, {{there is a}} {{resurgence}} of terrorist activities, with the White Mask being the most prominent. The terrorists' goals are unknown, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> causing chaos across the world. To counter this rising threat, the program is reactivated by a new leader who is simply known as Six (voiced by Angela Bassett). Six assembles a group of special forces operatives from different countries to face and combat the White Masks. Recruits go through multiple exercises {{to prepare them for}} future encounters with the White Masks, training to perform hostage rescue and bomb disposal. Eventually, the White Masks launch a chemical attack on a university (called Bartlett University), and the recruits are sent to disarm the bombs and eliminate the enemy presence. The operation is a massive success, though there are casualties. The story ends with Six affirming that the reactivation of Team Rainbow is the best and only choice in a time filled with risks and uncertainties. Team Rainbow is ready for their next mission – to hunt down the leader of their enemy – and they stand prepared to protect and defend their nation from terrorists.|$|E
25|$|These may {{constitute}} {{contradictions in}} his character. <b>Yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> also contradictions {{of the unique}} position he occupied, {{in a time of}} social upheaval, when the usual parameters and paradigms of society {{are in a state of}} flux.|$|E

25|$|Members of Eurypterus {{existed for}} a {{relatively}} short time, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the most abundant eurypterids found today. They flourished between the Late Llandovery epoch (around 432 million years ago) to sometime during the Přídolí epoch (418.1 million years ago) of the Silurian period. A span of only around 10 to 14 million years.|$|E
25|$|The Lazic {{wars are}} {{intertwined}} with Khosrow's war with Justinian insomuch {{as there were}} many battles which overlapped each other, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> generally considered different wars. Whereas Khosrow's wars with Justinian were fought at the sake of fighting Romans, the Lazic wars were often fought on behalf of Lazic and Armenian citizens, or in defense of Sasanian outposts in Lazica.|$|E
25|$|False positives are {{routinely}} found {{every day in}} airport security screening, which are ultimately visual inspection systems. The installed security alarms are intended to prevent weapons being brought onto aircraft; <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often set to such high sensitivity that they alarm many times a day for minor items, such as keys, belt buckles, loose change, mobile phones, and tacks in shoes.|$|E

25|$|By {{the modern}} definition, the term binary star is {{generally}} restricted to pairs of stars which revolve around a common center of mass. Binary stars {{which can be}} resolved with a telescope or interferometric methods are known as visual binaries. For most of the known visual binary stars one whole revolution has not been observed <b>yet,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> observed to have travelled along a curved path or a partial arc.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a Cohen–Macaulay ring is a {{commutative}} {{ring with}} some of the algebro-geometric properties of a smooth variety, such as local equidimensionality. Under mild assumptions, a local ring is Cohen–Macaulay exactly when it is a finitely generated free module over a regular local subring. Cohen–Macaulay rings {{play a central role in}} commutative algebra: they form a very broad class, and <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> well understood in many ways.|$|E
25|$|There {{are certain}} {{ways in which}} Plautus {{expressed}} himself in his plays, and these individual means of expression give a certain flair to his style of writing. The means of expression are not always specific to the writer, i.e., idiosyncratic, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> characteristic of the writer. Two examples of these characteristic means of expression are the use of proverbs {{and the use of}} Greek language in the plays of Plautus.|$|E

5000|$|They {{presented}} {{an appearance of}} being 'clean' (self-restrained, not involved in carnal matters), <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dirty inside: <b>they</b> seethed with hidden worldly desires, carnality. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> full of greed and self-indulgence. (...) ...|$|R
25|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} preserved on heritage railways, where perforce they run on their diesel engines: no preserved line has third rail electrification. They are particularly popular {{because they have}} a small diesel engine and hence are efficient with speeds normally limited to 25mph, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> big mainline locomotives and thus more attractive than diesel shunters with similar-sized engines. Of note are the first built locomotive, No. 73001 (an ex-Merseyrail Class 73/9), and the former Pullman locomotive, No. 73101.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{workers are}} those who perform a variety of tasks for and in other peoples' homes. For example, they may cook / clean the house and look after children. <b>Yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often {{the ones with the}} least consideration, {{excluded}} from labour and social protection. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} women have traditionally carried out the tasks without pay. For the rights and decent work of domestic workers including migrant domestic workers, ILO has adopted Convention on domestic workers on 16 June 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{illusion}} of spatial extension through paint, the grandiose theme and {{the skill of}} execution could only astonish and impress the visitor. However, Cortona's panegyric trompe-l'œil extravaganzas may be less popular in a world familiar with minimalism and such like, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> precursors of the sunny figures and cherubim infested with rococo excesses. They contrast markedly with the darker naturalism prominent in Caravaggisti works and with the classicising compositions by painters such as Domenichino and Andrea Sacchi, and remind us that Baroque painting could be grand in an epic manner and exuberant in spirit.|$|E

25|$|The copper patinas {{are very}} thin: just 0.05080–0.07620millimeters in thickness. <b>Yet,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> highly {{adherent}} to the underlying copper metal. The initial and intermediate oxide and sulfide patina films are not particularly corrosion resistant. The final sulfate patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to all forms of atmospheric corrosion and protects the underlying metal against further weathering. As patination progresses and the durable sulfate layer forms, the rate of corrosion decreases, averaging between 0.0001–0.0003millimeters per year. For a 0.6millimeter-thick sheet, this equates to less than 5% corrosion {{over a period of}} 100 years. Further information is available on copper patination.|$|E
25|$|Autonomous public {{utilities}} are typically affiliated {{to the local}} corporation in their governorate. They are cost centers within the LC. For example, the autonomous utility in Bait al-Faqih reports to the local corporation in Hodeidah, and the autonomous utility in Rada'a, where the reform process had been piloted, reports to the local corporation in Al/Bayda'. Two of the 15 autonomous utilities are still affiliated to NWSA. These two utilities—in Ataq, the capital of Shabwah Governorate, and in Al Mahwit—are located in governorates {{where there is no}} local corporation <b>yet.</b> <b>They</b> <b>are</b> in an intermediate state before becoming LCs. The Rada’a Principles apply to all autonomous {{public utilities}}.|$|E
25|$|The {{background}} forms a semi-urban {{landscape that}} possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, consistent with Courbevoie of the 1910s (except {{perhaps for the}} rock-like outcrops), a village or town with delicate smokestacks or factory chimneys billowing smoke that blends into the cloudy sky. Evidence that factories were already located on the Seine (billowing smoke) {{can be seen in}} Gleizes' Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie of 1908. The statuesque nudes themselves are highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves, <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> graceful, balletic and elegant. The source of light, rather than beaming down from one particular direction, appears to emanate from within the canvas itself, with an intensification {{in the vicinity of the}} bathers.|$|E
