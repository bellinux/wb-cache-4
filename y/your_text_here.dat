Copy and paste <b>your</b> <b>text</b> content <b>here,</b> adjusting the font size to fit Background Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is present in plasma of individuals with advanced cancers. 1 ctDNA is a prognostic marker for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and {{it might also be}} used for predicting the response to targeted therapy. For example, mutations in KRAS indicate which patients will fail to respond to specific therapies (cetuximab, panitunimab). 2 Although ctDNA is characterized by the presence of a somatic mutation, direct quantitative detection through a simple workflow of such mutant DNA is not feasible by current technologies because the ratio of ctDNA to wildtype DNA can be as low as 1 / 10, 000. This study describes the use of droplet-based digital PCR for detection and quantitation of one of the seven most frequent KRAS mutations in ctDNA from plasm...|$|R

40|$|At University {{you will}} be {{expected}} to write well thought out texts (or written assignments). The goal of writing is to communicate ideas clearly and concisely. Right from the beginning, the reader should have a good understanding of what <b>your</b> <b>text</b> is about and why you are writing it. They should {{be able to see the}} central idea (or argument) of <b>your</b> <b>text</b> (assignment) and be able to identify the main ideas or points in your argument. Therefore, <b>your</b> <b>text</b> needs to have a clear structure from the beginning to the end with a strong introduction, a well-structured body (with paragraphs) and a clear conclusion. The ideas in your assignment should flow logically from one to the next and support your central argument. At university you will also be expected to integrate the thoughts and ideas of other authors in <b>your</b> <b>texts</b> (assignments). It is therefore important to know how to select, read and understand different kinds of academic texts (e. g. journal articles and textbooks). It is also important to know how to integrate the ideas of other authors in <b>your</b> <b>text.</b> The first two chapters of this workbook look at these key issues. The chapters that follow look at how to achieve clarity in your writing and begin by looking at how to plan your assignments (chapter 3) and how to develop a strong argument (chapter 4). Following this, chapter 5 discusses how to write strong introductions and conclusions, while chapter 6 looks at how to structure the body of your assignments and improve the flow of ideas within <b>your</b> <b>text.</b> The final chapter in this workbook (chapter 7) looks at how you can make your thoughts (or opinions) clear to the reader as you write texts...|$|R

40|$|Guidelines for manuscripts Length Contributions {{should be}} between 10 and 20 pages long (one page {{comprising}} about 3. 200 characters incl. blanks); exceptions are, however, possible. It is {{the advantage of}} an online-journal {{not to have to}} be too restrictive regarding the length of articles. Language Contributions can be published in German or in English. Abstract Every article should start with an abstract of about 10 lines. It should contain the most important key words of the article, so that internet search engines can find your article easily. Handing in Please send <b>your</b> <b>text</b> as MS Word document via E-Mail to martin. rothgangel@univie. ac. at or to the editor with whom you are in corresponding contact.
