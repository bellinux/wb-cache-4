25|$|While all wasp stings are unpleasant, {{the sting}} of R. romandi is known for being very painful. Additionally, because R. romandi is a paper wasp, it {{has the ability to}} {{repeatedly}} sting without dying. R. romandi is most aggressive if they are swarming, if their nests are disturbed or if the wasps feel their nest is threatened. If wasps feel threatened, they may swarm out of the nest, and pursue the aggressor. If you ever get swarmed by wasps, it is recommended that <b>you</b> <b>remain</b> as still as possible and move away slowly. Sudden movements will be regarded as aggressive acts and will result in more stings.|$|E
25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city.

I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground.

I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E

500|$|A few {{songs are}} also {{influenced}} by dance-based genres; the [...] "feisty" [...] "Rules" [...] is laced with new wave and [...] "Ready for the Good Times" [...] is inspired by disco music. The power ballad [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] has Shakira delivering [...] "racked" [...] vocals and features brass instrumentation influenced by English rock band The Beatles. It contains a melody {{similar to the one}} in [...] "Eternal Flame", a 1989 song by American all-female band The Bangles. Similarly, the tune of [...] "The One", another power ballad on the album, {{is similar to that of}} [...] "Michelle", a 1965 song by The Beatles. [...] "Fool" [...] and [...] "Poem to a Horse" [...] are more directly influenced by rock music. The former received comparisons to the work of Alanis Morissette while the latter also displays indie elements and contains instrumentation from a soul music-styled horn section and guitar riffs similar to the one present in songs by American grunge band Nirvana. Laundry Service also contains four Spanish tracks: [...] "Que Me Quedes Tú" [...] ("That <b>You</b> <b>Remain</b> With Me"), [...] "Te Dejo Madrid" [...] ("I Leave You Madrid"), [...] "Suerte" [...] ("Luck") and [...] "Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)" [...] ("I'm Warning You, I'm Announcing to You"); the latter two are Spanish translations of [...] "Whenever, Wherever" [...] and [...] "Objection (Tango)", respectively.|$|E

[...] Bishop Ruiz, profoundly affected by the massacre, told those at the funeral: [...] "We want to say to you we are keeping you company on this Christmas Day, the saddest Christmas Day of our lives...

2500|$|On August 23, 1939, Adolf Hitler's Germany and Joseph Stalin's USSR {{signed a}} non-aggression agreement, {{known as the}} Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which {{contained}} a secret addendum (revealed only in 1945), dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Latvia was thereby assigned to the Soviet sphere. Following a Soviet ultimatum in October 1939, Ulmanis had to sign the Soviet–Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty and allow Soviet military bases in Latvia. In June 17, 1940, Latvia was completely occupied by the Soviet Union. Ulmanis ordered Latvians to show no resistance to the Soviet Army, saying in his radio speech [...] "I will remain in my place and <b>you</b> <b>remain</b> in yours".|$|E
2500|$|Rosecrans's predecessor, Buell, {{had been}} {{relieved}} {{because of his}} desultory pursuit of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg following the Battle of Perryville. And yet, Rosecrans displayed similar caution, remaining in Nashville while he reprovisioned his army and improved the training of his cavalry forces. By early December 1862, General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck had lost his patience. He wrote to Rosecrans, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>remain</b> one more week in Nashville, I cannot prevent your removal." [...] Rosecrans replied, [...] "I need no other stimulus to make me do my duty than the knowledge of what it is. To threats of removal or the like I must be permitted to say that I am insensible." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of around the new year 904, Emperor Zhaozong had been assassinated, and his son and {{successor}} Emperor Ai was under the physical control of the powerful warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), and Zhang Jun had retired to his vacation estate at Changshui (長水, in modern Luoyang, Henan). [...] Zhu was preparing to seize the throne and was apprehensive that Zhang Jun might encourage the other warlords into a coordinated resistance movement against him. [...] He ordered his ally Zhang Quanyi, who controlled the Luoyang region, to act against Zhang Jun. [...] Zhang Quanyi sent his officer Yang Lin (楊麟) to Changshui dressed as bandits, ready to slaughter Zhang Jun and his household and blame the incident on banditry. [...] A deputy sheriff at Yongning County (永寧, in modern Luoyang as well), Ye Yan (葉彥), whom Zhang Jun had treated well before, found out about this, and went to meet Zhang Ge, stating, [...] "The Lord Chancellor cannot escape this disaster, but you, master, should make a different plan!" [...] Zhang Jun then stated to Zhang Ge, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>remain</b> here, you will just die with us. [...] If you flee, the family seeds can continue." [...] Zhang Ge, after a tearful farewell, left with Ye, who took 30 men sworn to protect Zhang Ge, and escorted him {{as far as the}} Han River, and Zhang Ge subsequently fled to Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). [...] Meanwhile, Yang's men arrived, surrounded Zhang Jun's vacation estate, and slaughtered the entire household. [...] (Zhang Ge's younger brother Zhang Bo, whom Emperor Zhaozong had earlier granted the imperial family name of Li and given a new name of Yan, was serving as Emperor Zhaozong's emissary to Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and therefore also escaped this fate.) ...|$|E
