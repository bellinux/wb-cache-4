2500|$|While most Wufuxu {{methods for}} {{expelling}} the Three Worms involve anthelmintic herbs, a few do not. For instance, a recipe {{attributed to the}} Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長 (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "Pluck peach leaves {{on the third day}} of the third month; crush them to extract seven pints of juice. Then mix in liquor and heat it five or six times. Take it before meals and the three worms will be driven out." [...] One anomalous Wufuxu method does not mention either medicinal herbs or diet. [...] "The Recipe of Master Redpine" [...] (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> nails of your hands and feet on the sixteenth day of the seventh month, you can drive out the three worms from your intestines." [...] Arthur (2013: 88) reasons that [...] cutting one's nails for cleanliness might help a person to avoid future parasite infestations but not existing ones, perhaps Master Redpine was referring to the Ghost Festival that is held on the full moon of the seventh lunar month.|$|E
2500|$|According to editor John D. Dunning, {{the first}} {{cut of the}} film was four and {{one-half}} hours long (although a mass media report in March 1959 indicated the running time was closer to five hours). A total of [...] was shot for the film. William Wyler said {{his goal was to}} bring the running time down to three and a half hours. Editors Dunning and Winters saw their job as condensing the picture without losing any information or emotional impact. Dunning later said that he felt some of the leper colony sequence could have been cut. The most difficult editing decisions, he also said, came during scenes which involved Jesus Christ, as these contained almost no dialogue and most of the footage was purely reaction shots by actors. Editing was also complicated by the 70mm footage being printed. [...] Because no editing equipment (such as the Moviola) existed which could handle the 70mm print, the 70mm footage would be reduced to 35mm and then cut. This caused much of the image to be lost, and according to Dunning [...] "you didn't even know what you had until <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> negative. We'd print up the 70 now and then, and project it to see what we were getting against what we were seeing in the 35. We really did it blind." [...] When the film was edited into its final form, it ran 213 minutes and included just [...] of film. It was the third-longest motion picture ever made at the time, behind Gone With The Wind and The Ten Commandments.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{not all of}} Dorgon's {{policies}} were equally popular nor easily implemented. The controversial July 1645 edict (the [...] "haircutting order") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: [...] "To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> hair." [...] To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that [...] "a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, {{are not to be}} damaged." [...] Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it {{in the form of a}} top-knot. [...] The order triggered strong resistance to Qing rule in Jiangnan and massive killing of Han Chinese. It was Han Chinese defectors who carried out massacres against people refusing to wear the queue. Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but surrendered to the Qing, ordered his Han troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. At the end of the third massacre, there was hardly a living person left in this city. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Han Chinese Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Han Chinese Qing army led by the Han Chinese Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐), who had been ordered to [...] "fill the city with corpses before you sheathe your swords," [...] massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. The queue was the only aspect of Manchu culture which the Qing forced on the common Han population. The Qing required people serving as officials to wear Manchu clothing, but allowed non-official Han civilians to continue wearing Hanfu (Han clothing).|$|E
