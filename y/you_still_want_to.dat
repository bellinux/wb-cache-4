First released to developers at the 2000 Professional Developers Conference in Orlando, Florida, then {{made available for}} download, version 5.5 focused on improved print preview capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with Windows Me. Version 5.5 also includes support for 128-bit encryption. Although {{it is no longer}} available for download from Microsoft directly it can also be installed with MSN Explorer 6.0 as msnsetup_full.exe. The full version of MSN Explorer can be downloaded only if you use Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 if Internet Explorer 5.5 has not yet been installed. The full version will work on also Windows ME and Windows XP but you will need to download it on Windows 2000 or earlier and transfer the setup file to the newer operating system. If <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> download it on a newer operating system the only way is to use an outdated web browser such as Netscape 4.8.|$|E

Stewart criticized Comedy Central's decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from [...] "possible harmful repercussions". Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, said the threats against [...] "201" [...] demonstrated {{the importance of the}} First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, [...] "When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn't just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It's better." [...] He added jokingly, [...] "If you don't get that, and <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> kill someone over a stupid cartoon, please make it Garfield." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin [...] "his Lost in Translation." ...|$|E

50|$|Drummer Pete Clarke {{managed to}} record a fine {{instrumental}} solo single in 1968. For a while that same year he became the in-house session drummer for Apple Music and is notable {{on a couple of}} songs on Jackie Lomax's album, Is This What <b>You</b> <b>Want.</b> <b>Still</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> be in a group, in 1969 he joined the strange poetry band, The Liverpool Scene, and still working for Apple he did sessions for Kiki Dee and Billy Preston, and then did a brief stint in Badfinger.

50|$|What Southport {{is famous}} for is the shit and the piss throwing. Because the inmates {{have no access to}} each other, what they do is fill cups up with shit and piss and throw it at each other. You get caught doing it once, they keep your hands handcuffed behind your back so you can't throw anything. So if <b>you</b> really <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get your {{neighbor}} with shit, guess what you do? You put it in your mouth and {{when you get to the}} yard, you spit it on someone.|$|R

5000|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Let's Go Higher" [...] was premiered on E! Online on April 21, 2011 and was uploaded on YouTube on April 23. The video features Jordan Knight dazzled by disco lights, {{singing and dancing}} in a night club being surrounded by ladies on the dance floor, along with the infectious beats and grooves, guiding the song with his dreamy voice. This is Jordan Knight's first solo music video in almost 12 years, the last one being for [...] "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man" [...] (1999). Of the music video he said, [...] "It {{was a lot of}} work because the song is happy and upbeat, but sometimes it's harder to translate that into video. I'm not 14.

5000|$|The lyrics {{speak of}} a young, {{hesitant}} romance that is ultimately more self-centered and defensive than caring, capturing the subtle insecurities of teenage love. Billboard felt that the lyrical content of [...] "Let's Not Fall in Love" [...] encompasses [...] "the scary moments that accompany {{the start of a}} relationship", depicting [...] "the pressures and worries of starting a new relationship and committing to a person, and the potential pain that accompanies the risk of opening up to someone." [...] The magazine concluded that the song gives a message [...] "that if you like someone <b>you</b> <b>still</b> will <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> stay despite the fears." ...|$|R
50|$|He was {{considered}} a most honorable man. In that conjunction, it is storied that when Rav Papa was to marry off his son, to the daughter of his father in-law - Abba of Sura, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> come to his in-laws house {{in order to discuss}} an agreed upon amount of Dowry that Abba of Sura would give his daughter, he met Judah b. Meremar. Rav Papa invited him to come in, but Judah b. Meremar refused, explaining {{that he did not want}} Abba of Sura to be ashamed because of him, and therefore would give his daughter more than he truly wishes. Rav Papa had pressed him further to enter the house, and then he accompanied him to the house of Abba of Sura. When Abba of Sura stated the Dowry's amount, and saw that Judah b. Meremar says nothing, he thought the reason for his silence is because Judah b. Meremar believes that the money he offered for the dowry of his daughter is too little, and he is angry, so he added more and more until he was practically handing most of his assets to his daughter. When he saw that he was still silent, he said to Judah b. Meremar: I left myself nothing, and <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> give more? and Judah b. Meremar replied: What you gave is already against my opinion, in my opinion you did not have so much to give, but since you already gave - you need not to retract.|$|R

[...] "I tell you, Leonard Tavernake, our city men here are out for the dollars. Over on your side, a man makes a million or so and he's had enough.

40|$|This is {{the most}} {{important}} chapter of this book. In this chapter, we cover all the nuances the programmer should know when porting an existing CGI script to work under mod_perl, or when writing one from scratch. This chapter’s main goal is to teach the reader how to think in mod_perl. It involves showing most of the mod_perl peculiarities and possible traps the programmer might fall into. It also shows you {{some of the things that}} are impossible with vanilla CGI but easily done with mod_perl. Before You Start to Code There are three important things you need to know before you start your journey in a mod_perl world: how to access mod_perl and related documentation, and how to develop your Perl code when the strict and warnings modes are enabled. Accessing Documentation mod_perl doesn’t tolerate sloppy programming. Although we’re confident that you’re a talented, meticulously careful programmer whose programs run perfectly every time, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tighten up some of your Perl programming practices. In this chapter, we include discussions that rely on prior knowledge of some areas of Perl, and we provide short refreshers where necessary. We assume that you can already program in Perl and that you are comfortable with finding Perl-related infor-mation in books and Perl documentation. There are many Perl books that you may find helpful. We list some of these in the reference sections at the end of each chapter. If you prefer the documentation that comes with Perl, you can use either its online version (start a...|$|R
60|$|But, {{if there}} are any of my hearers who have been {{impressed}} with this sense of inventive duty, may I ask them first, whether their plan is that every inventive architect among us shall invent a new style for himself, and have a county set aside for his conceptions, or a province for his practice? Or, must every architect invent a little piece of the new style, and all put it together at last like a dissected map? And if so, when the new style is invented, {{what is to be done}} next? I will grant you this Eldorado of imagination--but can you have more than one Columbus? Or, if you sail in company, and divide the prize of your discovery and the honour thereof, who is to come after you clustered Columbuses? to what fortunate islands of style are your architectural descendants to sail, avaricious of new lands? When our desired style is invented, will not the best we can all do be simply--to build in it?-- and cannot you now do that in styles that are known? Observe, I grant, for the sake of your argument, what perhaps many of you know that I would not grant otherwise--that a new style can be invented. I grant you not only this, but that it shall be wholly different from any that was ever practised before. We will suppose that capitals are to be at the bottom of pillars instead of the top; and that buttresses shall be on the tops of pinnacles instead of at the bottom; that you roof your apertures with stones which shall neither be arched nor horizontal; and that you compose your decoration of lines which shall neither be crooked nor straight. The furnace and the forge shall be at your service: you shall draw out your plates of glass and beat out your bars of iron till you have encompassed us all,--if your style is of the practical kind,--with endless perspective of black skeleton and blinding square,--or if your style is to be of the ideal kind--you shall wreathe your streets with ductile leafage, and roof them with variegated crystal--you shall put, if you will, all London under one blazing dome of many colours that shall light the clouds round it with its flashing, as far as to the sea. And <b>still,</b> I ask <b>you,</b> What after this? Do you suppose those imaginations of yours will ever lie down there asleep beneath the shade of your iron leafage, or within the coloured light of your enchanted dome? Not so. Those souls, and fancies, and ambitions of yours, are wholly infinite; and, whatever may be done by others, <b>you</b> will <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do something for yourselves; if you cannot rest content with Palladio, neither will you with Paxton: all the metal and glass that ever were melted have not so much weight in them as will clog the wings of one human spirit's aspiration.|$|R

I couldn't see my dear little heart-broken mother, who {{had been such a}} slave all her life, turned out of her home. Of course, I could have earned enough for us to live on. But mother COULDN'T leave her home. She had come there as a bride--and she had loved father so--and all her {{memories}} were there. Even yet, Anne, when I think that I made her last year happy I'm not sorry for what I did. As for Dick--I didn't hate him when I married him--I just felt for him the indifferent, friendly feeling I had for most of my schoolmates. I knew he drank some--but I had never heard the story of the girl down at the fishing cove. If I had, I COULDN'T have married him, even for mother's sake. Afterwards--I DID hate him--but mother never knew. She died--and then I was alone. I was only seventeen and I was alone. Dick had gone off in the Four Sisters. I hoped he wouldn't be home very much more. The sea had always been in his blood. I had no other hope. Well, Captain Jim brought him home, as you know--and that's all there is to say. You know me now, Anne--the worst of me--the barriers are all down. And <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be my friend?" ...|$|E
