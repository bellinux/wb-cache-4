Johanneson had just come off his second defeat to Armenian Leva Kirakosyan, whom Gomez had knocked out in October 2004. Before the fight, Gomez was confident, stating [...] "You can't outbox me. I'll jab <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>off.</b> If he comes to have a fight with me {{it is going to}} be early Christmas for {{everyone}} because I don't know who's going to go but someone's going to go and it's not going to be me." [...] At the pre-fight press conference in Doncaster both fighters squared up to each other and promised to knock each other out; during the highly charged face off both fighters had to be kept apart by their promoter and trainers.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, Kemper has {{continued}} to display potentially threatening behavior. [...] On one occasion, when Douglas' colleague Robert Ressler was in a cell alone with Kemper, Kemper—who at the time weighed —noticed the apprehension in Ressler after he had pressed a hidden button repeatedly to call a guard to open the cell yet not received a response and told him [...] "Relax. They're changing the shift," [...] but remarked: [...] "If I went apeshit in here, you'd be {{in a lot of}} trouble, wouldn't you? I could screw <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>off</b> and place it on the table to greet the guard." [...] Ressler verbally sparred with Kemper until the guard arrived, ultimately leaving unharmed with Kemper displaying no physical aggression. Kemper also stated afterwards that he was joking, but Ressler never entered a cell alone again with Kemper and it became FBI policy to interview serial killers in pairs.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{were pleased}} with the game's premise and setting, {{variously}} describing it as [...] "weird", [...] "wacky" [...] and [...] "silly". [...] Hope Falls, especially the area of Creepy Hollow, was compared {{to the work of}} Tim Burton. [...] Dead Head Fred's graphics were warmly received, with GameSpy noting [...] "The game looks simply phenomenal on the PSP screen." [...] Pocket Gamer UK said [...] "graphically the game won't blow <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>off</b> but it is undeniably stylish." [...] Pocket Gamer also felt that the game's level design, with its emphasis on changing heads to solve environmental puzzles, made up for the [...] "mediocre combat system". [...] The character design was praised; GameSpy said [...] "Fred {{is one of the most}} interesting and entertaining characters to ever hit gaming," [...] and GameZone said [...] "Fred’s freakish form is like looking at a car crash … you really don’t want to stare but you just can’t help it." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 26, 2003, she {{released}} her concept album Enchant, which spanned multiple musical styles: [...] "new-age, pop and trip hop chamber music". Written during her late teenage years, Enchant {{revolved around the}} supernatural realm {{and its effect on}} the modern-day world. Autumn labeled it as [...] "fantasy rock", which dealt with [...] "dreams and stories and ghosts and faeries who'll bite <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>off</b> if you dare to touch them". The faery-themed [...] "Enchant Puzzle" [...] appeared on the artwork of the album; her reward for the person who would solve it consisted of faery-related items. Her bandmates consisted of cellist Joey Harvey, drummer Heath Jansen, guitarist Ben Lehl, and bassist Jimmy Vanaria, who also worked on the electronics. At the same time of Enchants release, Autumn had several side projects: Convent, a musical group for which she recorded all four voices; Ravensong, [...] "a classical baroque ensemble" [...] that she formed with friends in California; and The Jane Brooks Project, which she dedicated to the real-life, 16th-century Jane Brooks—a woman executed for witchcraft.|$|E
500|$|... Yesterday, {{the woman}} {{went to the}} ala’s house with her child, the ala’s godchild. Upon {{entering}} the first room, she saw a poker and a broom fighting; in the second room, she saw human legs; in the fourth– human flesh; in the fifth– blood; in the sixth– {{she saw that the}} ala had taken off her head and was delousing it, while wearing a horse’s head in its place. After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. Those are my maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and third}} rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, eat. That is my food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, eat. That is the wine that I drink.” “How can I eat after I saw that you had taken <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>off</b> and were delousing it, having fixed a horse’s head on yourself?” The ala, after hearing that, ate both the woman and her child.|$|E
500|$|Azaria played Gargamel in the computer-animated/live-action {{adaptation}} of The Smurfs (2011). Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, buck teeth, eyebrows and a wig, {{as well as}} shaving his head. He spent approximately 130 hours in the make-up chair {{over the course of}} the production. Azaria considered Gargamel's voice to be the most important part of his performance. The producers wanted an [...] "old, failed, Shakespearean actor" [...] voice, but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European. He eventually selected a voice similar to that of Paul Winchell's from the cartoon. Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired, and considered Gargamel too one-dimensional a character and [...] "just this straight villain"; he opted to make Gargamel [...] "more sarcastic" [...] than in the cartoon, but [...] "discovered that there's no way to play Gargamel without screaming <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>off</b> at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs". He interpreted him as [...] "very lonely", adding that [...] "he hates the Smurfs because they're such a happy family. He wants in really badly. I think he wants to be embraced as a Smurf". Azaria worked with the writers to [...] "infuse" [...] the script with some of his ideas about the character, [...] "particularly with the 'married' relationship between Gargamel and [...] Azreal [...] " [...] which Azaria conceived.|$|E

2500|$|Sam Strike plays Jackson, born Jedidiah Sawyer, {{as one of}} {{the four}} inmates that escape the mental institution, before {{ultimately}} becoming the eponymous Leatherface after enduring tragedies that destroy his cognitive stability. Leatherface is a mentally disabled serial killer seen throughout the TCM franchise, known for wearing masks made of human skin, and using a chainsaw and mallet as his signature weapons. Strike joined the film after reading the script, which he opined was, for a horror film, very character-driven. He felt that there needed to be a contrast between {{the two sides of the}} character, to show how a somewhat kind person can become such a killer: [...] "It could happen to anybody. He had it in him because of his mother, but was at the mercy of his environment." [...] Strike integrated aspects from the original film into his performance out of respect, but wanted to give his own interpretation instead of imitating what came before. To make the character's transformation more believable, Strike intentionally tried to gain physical body weight before filming: [...] "I was trying to eat as much as I could to just feel physically capable. Chainsaws, in reality, are very heavy, especially ones that are manufactured back in the '50s and '60s. Leatherface looks like he could take <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>off</b> with a slap; I wanted to be able to feel that way." [...] Strike believed that the character's bursts of rage throughout the film contributed to his final permanent state as a monster. He developed a [...] "battle cry" [...] for whenever Leatherface lost his temper. As someone who was taken from his biological family and put into foster care at an early age, Jedidiah Sawyer was written in the screenplay to have been adopted at one point by a family that wanted a little girl, forcing him to wear drag clothing as a child and foreshadowing his gender ambiguity in the 1974 Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This plot point was absent from the final cut of the film.|$|E
