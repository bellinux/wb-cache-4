5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1943, Parks became {{active in}} the Civil Rights Movement, joined the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, and was elected secretary. She later said, [...] "I {{was the only woman}} there, and they needed a secretary, and I was too timid to say no." [...] She {{continued}} as secretary until 1957. She worked for the local NAACP leader Edgar Nixon, even though he maintained that [...] "Women don't need to be nowhere but in the kitchen." [...] When Parks asked [...] "Well, what about me?", he replied [...] "I need a secretary and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He's quite alone. He hasn't {{asked for}} you; but I think your going {{is the only}} chance. He took me for you. You told me once <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> nurse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' {{continued}} Mr. Barton, 'if <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> boy, God {{will love}} you, {{and you will}} grow up to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man. Now, let me hear next Thursday that <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> boy.' ...|$|R
60|$|RAMSDEN. You are right: I {{should have}} thought of that. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> girl, Annie.|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> boy, and I'm a beast {{to treat}} you so abominably. It's awfully nice of you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not very," [...] smiled my mother; [...] "but if {{you think}} about it a good deal it will not leave you. When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> boy, and later on, when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man, then I am the luckiest little mother in all the world. And every time you fail, that means bad luck for me. You will {{remember}} that after I'm gone, when you are a big man, won't you, Paul?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{know that}} at Athlone Terence was the {{ringleader}} of all the mischief that went on. Still, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> second, Ryan; that is, if that position does not really belong to O'Grady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor old whale, I {{wonder how}} you got here, where you came from, and if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> and happy {{creature}} while you lived," [...] said Freddy, patting the old bone with his little hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{wanted to}} work up your smaller {{sketches}} and sell them to the dealers. They seem to think the money sunk in <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> investment. Good Lord! who can account for the fathomless folly of the public?" ...|$|R
60|$|LORETTA. [In abasement.] <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man, Billy. [Billy {{shows that}} he {{believes}} it.] And I am a very wicked woman.|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL, jumping up, 'Not really? Hallo! I {{never for}} a moment--It was true, then. Amy, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> little girl to come.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--I won't have it. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{hard-working}} darling child, {{and your}} father is not the man to disappoint you when you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{always knew}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fellow, Ful,' he said, {{with his hand}} on his brother's knee, 'and I think you'll keep so, with Mr. Audley to keep you up to things, and show <b>you</b> how to <b>be</b> helped.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> general, {{and so for}} {{the matter}} of that was Bes. Oh! what agonies I went through while the fight hung doubtful. My heart was on fire, yes, I seemed to burn for----" [...] and she stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} say pretty girl," [...] said Miss Cringle, with calm self-abnegation, [...] "don’t mind me, say it. The captain knows what he’s about. He told me <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> milksop; he said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> young man and a teetotaller." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven {{send you}} both back safe! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man, and very generous. I knew it the evening {{we passed the}} Hallows Brig--but----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, dearest,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'I have prayed too, I verily believe. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> girl, I think.' Then the {{expected}} question came.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Thomas, I {{have some}} {{business}} {{to attend to}} to-night, {{in which you can}} help me if you choose. I know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mechanic.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> levity {{about your}} tone that I do not approve of, Armstrong," [...] Frank Mallett said, reprovingly. [...] "There were no women {{when we went}} out to the Crimea, at the time when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> little boy doing Latin exercises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{give it to}} him," [...] {{said the}} beadle. [...] "Come along with me, my dear. I think I told <b>you</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> girl at the inquest--if I didn't, I tell you so now. I'll give it to him! Come along with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{said that}} they were ready enough to fight. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> the government, now; and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> government, and they would fight for you and, besides, as the officer was carried off from their village, it was their duty to help to get him back.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, good-night, run along; <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> girl, {{but your}} mental Geschirr is not {{arranged}} for light and airy conversation. Leave {{me to my}} delusions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you {{are ready}} for a breeze; <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> seaman, an able commander. You are a skilful pilot, Robert; you will weather the storm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> {{sensible}} fellow, {{and have}} behaved nobly, and I honour you for it, and Claude shall {{come and see}} you every day." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{being unable}} to prosecute Harris for rape, the detectives find strong {{evidence}} {{that allows him to}} be prosecuted for kidnapping charges. Vicki confronts him in his cell and taunts him with his own words: [...] "Now I'll always know where <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> boy. Behave yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘My God,’ said Zero, ‘is this possible? And I so {{filled with}} {{tenderness}} and interest! Can it be, dear Somerset, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> under the empire of these out-worn scruples? or that you judge a patriot by the morality of the religious tract? I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> agnostic.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've 'ad my {{suspicions of}} it for some days," [...] he ses, with a wink, [...] "though you did come {{to me in a}} nice serge suit and tell me <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> actor.

6000|$|... "Stop," [...] she said, and I halted fearfully. [...] "David Ritchie, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man. I {{can make}} no amends to you,"--she did not finish.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, mon Dieu, Jamie, how welcome <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{to one in}} my sorrow!" [...] she continued. [...] "It is {{the fault}} of others that <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> so long out of the country. I but require of <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> subject to me, and you shall never find me other to you than you deserve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man, Walters, I {{should put}} a black mark against you for this. If {{it were the}} devil himself a constable on duty should never thank God {{that he could not}} lay his hands upon him. I suppose the whole thing <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> vision and a touch of nerves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurt you?" [...] {{repeated}} the veteran. [...] "I'm a deal too fond of you--and more shame {{for me at}} my age!--to hurt you. If I let go of your wrist, will you walk straight before me, where I can see you all the way? Will <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> girl, and walk straight up to your own door?" ...|$|R
