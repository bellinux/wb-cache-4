500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can't have <b>you</b> <b>using</b> drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out. You have got to get your act together." [...] Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.|$|E

[...] An instrumental/comitative case is arguably present in Turkish and other Altaic languages, {{as well as}} in Tamil. Also, Uralic languages reuse the adessive case where available, locative case if not, to mark the same category, or comitative case (Estonian). For example, the Finnish kirjoitan kynällä does not mean [...] "I write on a pen", but [...] "I write using a pen", even if the adessive -llä is used. In Ob-Ugric languages, the same category may also mark agents with verbs that use an ergative alignment, like [...] "I give <b>you,</b> <b>using</b> a pen".|$|E

Since hiring the firm, the university has paid the firm about $490,000, according to disclosure reports initially filed by Copeland Lowery; university records showed $702,500 paid. As the earmarks started arriving, Young began receiving calls from other universities and from town and county governments across the Inland Empire of central and southern California.

Indeed, she eschewed fashion in all things, and made no pretence of coming out before the world as a great lady. She had never kept any kind of carriage, though her means, {{combined}} with her son's income, would certainly have justified her in a pony-chaise. Since Lucius had become master of the house he had presented her with such a vehicle, and also with the pony and harness complete; but as yet she had never used it, being afraid, as she said to him with a smile, of appearing ambitious before the stern citizens of Hamworth.
