The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E
5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25million and 2million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E

5|$|Freshwater marl prairies {{are similar}} to sloughs, but lack the slow {{movement}} of surface water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called marl. Algae and other microscopic organisms form periphyton, which attaches to limestone. When it dries {{it turns into a}} gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl than they do in peat, the other type of soil in the Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually under water from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for longer than nine months and sometimes remain under water from one <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a monoculture. Other grasses, such as muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes) and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry {{in some parts of the}} year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from one <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians who were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.|$|E

40|$|Anthropogenic {{radionuclide}} concentrations {{have been}} determined in seawater and sediment samples collected in 1991, 1994 and 1996 in the Eurasian Arctic shelf and interior. Global fallout, releases from European reprocessing {{plants and the}} Chernobyl accident are identified as the three main sources. From measurements in the Eurasian shelf seas it is concluded that the total input of Cs- 134, Cs- 137 and Sr- 90 from these sources has been decreasing during the 1990 's, while I- 129 has increased. The main fraction of the reprocessing and Chernobyl activity found in Arctic Ocean surface layer is transported form the Barents Sea east along the Eurasian Arctic shelf seas <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Laptev Sea before entering the Nansen Basin. This inflow results in highest Cs- 137, I- 129 and Sr- 90 concentrations in the Arctic Ocean surface layers, and continuously decreasing concentrations with depth. Chernobyl-derived Cs- 137 appeared in the central parts of the Arctic Ocean around 1991, and in the mid 1990 's <b>the</b> fraction <b>to</b> total Cs- 137 was approximately 30 % in the entire Eurasian Arctic region. The transfer times for releases from Sellafield {{are estimated to be}} 5 - 7 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SE Barents Sea, 7 - 9 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kara Sea, 10 - 11 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Laptev Sea and 12 - 14 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central Arctic Ocean. The transfer times for releases from Sellafield are estimated to be 5 - 7 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SE Barents Sea, 7 - 9 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kara Sea, 10 - 11 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Laptev Sea and 12 - 14 <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central Arctic Ocean. Global fallout is the primary source of plutonium with highest concentrations found in the Atlantic layer of the Arctic Ocean. When transported over the shallow shelf seas, particle reactive transuranic elements experience an intense scavenging. A rough estimate shows that approximately 75 % of the plutonium entering the Kara and Laptev Seas are removed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sediment. High seasonal riverine input of Pu- 239, 240 is observed near the mouths of the large Russian rivers. Sediment inventories show much higher concentrations on <b>the</b> shelf compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deep Arctic Ocean. This is primarily due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> low particle flux in the open ocean...|$|R
5|$|Some temples kept sacred animals, {{which were}} {{believed}} to be manifestations of the temple god's ba {{in the same way that}} cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the Apis bull, worshipped at Memphis as a manifestation of the Memphite god Ptah, and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.|$|E
