He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E

After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008.

[...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some.

5000|$|On October 27, 2010, World Triathlon Corporation {{put out a}} {{press release}} announcing the {{creation}} of an athlete membership program called Ironman Access. This program was to offer advanced registration to its Ironman events before entries would be open for registration to the general public. Advance race registration for members of Ironman Access would be open one week prior to the event’s general entry registration date. Members of this program would also receive a number of other benefits, such as a free subscription to its LAVA magazine and discounts at its shopironman.com website. The cost of membership into the Ironman Access program was $1,000 USD. However, a day later, in response to comments the WTC received via email and from comments received through Facebook, Ben Fertic, then CEO of WTC, appeared in an online video announcing that Ironman Access program would be rescinded, stating: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>think</b> we're wrong, we're wrong." [...] As explained in the video by Fertic, the purpose of the program was to free up 2,500 to 3,000 entry slots that go unused by individuals who sign up for multiple Ironman events.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{shows were}} noted {{at the time}} for their {{confluence}} with historical events.

The performance of the song, but not the preceding remark, {{was included in the}} Live/1975-85 box set, and the performance was later included in full on a video release of the show in 2015. About a month later, on December 9, Springsteen went ahead with a scheduled concert at The Spectrum in Philadelphia the day after John Lennon was murdered, despite initial objections from sideman Steven Van Zandt. [...] "It's a hard world that asks you tolive with {{a lot of things that}} are unlivable", Springsteen announced before starting the show, [...] "And it's hard to come out here and playtonight, but there's nothing else to do." [...] He opened with an especially frenzied [...] "Born to Run" [...] and closed with a rendition of The Beatles' version of [...] "Twist and Shout".|$|E

5000|$|The {{high-profile}} {{music video}} for [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, who had previously worked with Carey on videos for both [...] "Honey" [...] and [...] "Don't Forget About Us", and was predominately shot in Paris, France in March 2006. Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams are both featured in the video, with the latter playing Carey love interest. Additionally, a cameo appearance is made by André Leon Talley, a retired fashion designer and Vogue editor. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the trip to France, {{as well as the}} video's behind-the-scenes moments:You know what was so great about being in Paris? Usually I'm inside a hotel room and I don't get to see anything. This time, I finally got to drive around the city, walk around the city and hang out. I love Paris; I love the electricity this city has. And it gave me a new perspective on this song, {{which is one of the}} first songs I recorded for Emancipation of Mimi. It's got a hot vibe to it, when you're driving around in the car on a normal, rainy day in Paris, driving around in circles in a Maserati — who doesn't do that every day?Aside from the several actors playing paparazzi throughout the video, Hunter included several shots of actual French paparazzi on scooters, who attempted to photograph Carey during the video's filming. Hunter claimed the additions made the video feel more realistic. For the video's primary filming locations, Carey had Louis Vuitton's flagship store on Champs-Élysées, one of the most prestigious avenues in Paris, shut down. When describing the experience filming in the boutique, Carey explained: [...] "Obviously, being able to take your pick of anything in the store and have the whole store shut down for you is every girl's dream. You know, just a pretty standard day in the life of anybody. No, just joking. There was a time in my life I only had one pair of shoes, so that's my justification for having that little perk on the job." [...] After filming concluded in France, Snoop Dogg's scenes were filmed on a Sunday in Los Angeles. When asked why Dogg was not present during the Paris shoot, Carey jokingly stated:If <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>think</b> I'm a diva and I have requirements, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions.
