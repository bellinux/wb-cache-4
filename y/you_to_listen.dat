500|$|... "Here We Go Again" [...] was {{recorded}} during a phase in Charles' career {{when he was}} focused on performing country music. Thus, [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] was a country music song released by the Tangerine label ABC-Paramount, but performed in Charles' rhythm and blues style. However, his works did not bear the Tangerine label until 1968. Feller left ABC in 1965, but he returned to arrange Charles' 1967 album, Ray Charles Invites <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>Listen.</b> Joe Adams produced and engineered the album, which included [...] "Here We Go Again".|$|E

500|$|The {{playlist}} of the 1967 tour promoting Ray Charles Invites <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>Listen</b> is {{not readily}} available, but [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] was the best-charting {{song on the}} album (and likely on the playlist). Charles' tour began with a benefit concert on the USS Constellation, which was preparing to depart for the Vietnam War from San Diego Harbor. The tour, Charles' first since 1964, continued to Europe in mid-April where it visited the Royal Festival Hall, London and Salle Pleyel, Paris, as well as Vienna. In May, the band played back in the United States at New York City's Carnegie Hall before returning to California. The tour received bad reviews from publications such as Jazz Journal, Jazz Magazine and the New York Post. Later that summer, the band played Constitution Hall, Washington, D.C. In the fall, Charles had his first lucrative Nevada casino performances, which started with a three-week run at Harrah's Reno that was praised in Variety. The tour also had an extended fall run at New York's Copacabana nightclub.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} of the single, for the NME, Derek Johnson admired McCartney's {{performance}} and the lyrics' [...] "pseudo-religious" [...] qualities. Although he considered that the melody paled beside some of the band's previous singles, Johnson added: [...] "As ever with The Beatles, this is a record to stop you dead in your tracks and compel <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> attentively." [...] John Gabree of High Fidelity magazine found the lyrics [...] "dangerous politically", but viewed the song as possibly [...] "the best thing musically that McCartney has done".|$|E

5000|$|In 2005 Davis stated: [...] "I wrote {{parts of}} that song Davis {{recorded}} it I never took credit for...The chorus, for example...did {{not exist in the}} original recording. Though that song is technically a cover, I put myself and my lyrics and my musical sensibility in it as I do with any cover. I wrote the bassline and programmed the drums. And so, when I perform that song, or when <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the album version, <b>you</b> are <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> a hybrid of the original.
