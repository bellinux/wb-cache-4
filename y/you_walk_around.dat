In 2001, Slater was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon hearing his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, fellow inductee and teammate Jack Youngblood said [...] "Jackie Slater didn't want to just beat you, he wanted to dominate you. That's what made him the player that he was." [...] On being honored, Slater stated [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> and shake hands with some of the greatest players in history, it finally hits you, that you belong. You're a part of the greatest roster ever assembled." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course, for {{the wall}} is a circle," [...] {{explained}} the rabbit. [...] "In {{the center of the}} circle stands the house, so <b>you</b> may <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> the Wall of Solid Air, but you can't get to the house." ...|$|R
5000|$|Said Malcolm Young later of {{the simple}} {{approach}} to the video, [...] "We basically told the film crew, 'We'll be playing - <b>you</b> film. <b>Walk</b> <b>around</b> the band - do whatever the fuck you want. We just want it done today'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vatn: A vatn (or vann) {{is a small}} lake. <b>You</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> a vatn in {{a couple}} of hours. Sognsvann near Oslo is one example of such usage. Vatn might be used for large lakes further north, such as Altevatnet in Troms and Snåsavatnet in Nord-Trøndelag.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} walk, Mr. Cuthbert, {{you had better}} keep {{around the edge of}} the chamber, for there is no knowing when they may come through. Mr. Burton and the foreman of the ice-men {{measured}} the bluff so that they say the hole they are making is exactly over the middle of the chamber you are in, and if <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> the edge the pieces may not fall on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{get along}} without; you shall eat my share. Now, don't worry if I'm not back until near sunset. The horses are close at hand, {{and you may be}} certain they won't stray while the feed is plentiful. Stay in the wagon, even though there is nothing to harm you if <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around.</b> We must be careful that no more trouble comes upon us; so keep under cover, mother dear, and I'll be here again before night comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pay your {{fine and}} come out of jail at once. You can avoid our constable by {{remaining}} with the company the greater portion of the time; but it is necessary you should learn who the visitor is. Can't <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> that way now and then? I don't fancy Bob will {{stay in the house}} all the time. This work can be done better now by you than any one I could send, since the presence of a stranger in the little village would attract attention." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It was green. It was soft. <b>You</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> in bare feet, {{and we used}} to go out {{and pick}} lots of berries that grew wild. I always thought of the world as being {{particularly}} generous and joyful. And when I was searching my memories, trying to write a book for very young children about being joyful, that popped right up." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1917, {{he said to}} wrestlers, [...] "I {{will give}} you one bale of rice if <b>you</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> the dohyō {{shouldering}} me." [...] A boy, who had not made his debut in professional sumo yet, acceded to his request. He failed at the first attempt but achieved at the second attempt.

50|$|Once {{you arrive}} in Sorong, {{you can visit}} the pagoda at any time but the best time is after 4 pm {{when the sun is}} less intense and <b>you</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> the gardens. The other reason to visit the pagoda in the evening is because you will get a chance to catch the {{beautiful}} panoramic sunset, which alone is worth a visit to this city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] said Bud. [...] "Didn't {{you never}} attend 'em? <b>You</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> {{and try to}} look at the tops of the skyscrapers. Well, we sold the ranch, and old man Sterling asks me 'round to his house to take grub on the night before I started back. It wasn't any high-collared affair--just me and the old man and his wife and daughter. But they was a fine-haired outfit all right, and the lilies of the field wasn't in it. They made my Fort Worth clothes {{carpenter}} look like a dealer in horse blankets and gee strings. And then the table was all pompous with flowers, and there was a whole kit of tools laid out beside everybody's plate. You'd have thought you was fixed out to burglarize a restaurant before you could get your grub. But I'd been in New York over a week then, and I was getting on to stylish ways. I kind of trailed behind and watched the others use the hardware supplies, and then I tackled the chuck with the same weapons. It ain't much trouble to travel with the high-flyers after you find out their gait. I got along fine. I was feeling cool and agreeable, and pretty soon I was talking away fluent as you please, all about the ranch and the West, and telling 'em how the Indians eat grasshopper stew and snakes, and you never saw people so interested.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dan," [...] he said, [...] "let <b>you</b> and I <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> two {{or three}} minutes. We'll stay close by so that Sam can give us the signal in case the men show up, and we may find Hazelton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the least idea," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "I advise <b>you</b> to <b>walk</b> all <b>around</b> the room {{and see if you}} can find it; and when you find it, get it examined." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "safe house" [...] first {{introduced}} in Way of the Samurai 2 returns, {{but this time}} <b>you</b> can actually <b>walk</b> <b>around.</b> A bed, weapon safe, money safe, item box, closet, and part box can be found inside the house.|$|R
50|$|Falkland Palace {{stands on}} three {{hectares}} of ground on a sandstone ridge which {{is dominated by}} the Lomond Hills in the background.

5000|$|... #Caption: This AN/FPS-35 Radar at Camp Hero State Park in Montauk, New York, is the {{centerpiece}} of the Montauk Project conspiracy theory. The decommissioned radar is still behind a fence but <b>you</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> the grounds in the park. The radar (the only one of its kind still in existence) was not torn down because boaters on nearby waters preferred the massive radar as a landmark rather than the nearby Montauk Point Light.|$|R
5000|$|The Museum reopened in May 2011. “It’s {{the only}} museum {{where you can}} come and touch things. other museums <b>you</b> have to <b>walk</b> <b>around,</b> keep your hands in your pockets. Here we say go up, touch it, play with it, push it, figure out what makes it work.” ...|$|R
5000|$|WhatGamesAre {{describes}} the gameplay {{as that of}} [...] "a simple adventure game where <b>you</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>around,</b> talk to people and open doors. Every day the game changes the scenario {{up a little bit}} and reinforces the message of how much time is left. In the end... the results are stark and affecting." [...] There are multiple endings, and some reviewers asked readers to share their own personal experiences on how they chose to spend their last 6 days on Earth before the ceasing of all life.|$|R
5000|$|To {{view the}} Seven Deadly Sins of Modern Times {{properly}} requires that <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> it and view {{each of the}} sections, which are artfully integrated. The center is a nocturnal eye with the inscriptions [...] "The Seven Deadly Sins" [...] on one side, and [...] "The Eye of Gaia Sees All" [...] on the other. The sections are described below after a short, general definition from Princeton's WordNet.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days before the lake was formed, Kooyongkoot Creek wound its way down the valley from Mitcham to Blackburn {{on its way to}} the Yarra River. It would have been joined along the way, {{particularly}} in winter, by many little rivulets and streams; some of these gullies can still be seen as <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> the lake today. In summer, the creek is suspected to have dried up at times.|$|E
5000|$|Mitchell is bullied by Lucien. As {{a teacher}} in a sports school he teaches his {{students}} also matters like talking about things bothering you; however, himself he communicates very poorly with Mitchell. Mitchell provocatively shows up dancing in a ballet tutu on his birthday party. Lucien freaks out and injures Mitchell. Mitchell goes in the tutu on his bike to some friends. They are not shocked about his tutu, they just wonder [...] "Does your father know that nowadays <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> like that?". Lucien starts living in his sports school. The film ends with a beginning of reconciliation: also they still hardly talk to each other, at least they drink coffee together.|$|E
30|$|Eventually after 20 - 30 {{minutes of}} walking, I gather them {{along the edge}} of the campus lawn along the bluff that overlooks the city. I hand them a sticky label with the words of John Francis, “As <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> look <b>around,</b> assess where you are, reflect on where you have been, and dream of where you are going. Every moment of the present {{contains}} the opportunity for change” (Francis 2009, 36). With the previous quote from Francis pasted into their sketchbook/journals, the students find a spot to sit alone and reflect on the experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Nobody could hire <b>you</b> to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> Mr. Man's barn three times,' I said, and {{the words}} hadn't much more than left my mouth before I was sorry that I spoke, for I surely didn't want Bobby to come to any harm, and after the trick he had played on Mr. Man {{it would be all}} his life was worth to go near the farm buildings, because even if it could be done without his being seen by some of the people there Mr. Towser would be certain to smell him out.|$|R
5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If <b>you</b> were to <b>walk</b> into the painting, <b>you</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|R
5000|$|Talking about {{recording}} the scenes involving manifests, Skarsgård said: [...] "How we practically {{do it is}} we usually shoot the scene first with the actor who plays the manifest and then we shoot the same scene {{exactly the same way}} but without anybody there. It looks fantastic, because <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around,</b> you gesture and talk to somebody that isn't there and it's quite interesting visually. To me, I'm the kind of actor who doesn't want to act towards a mark beside the camera; I want the real actor to be there, and I feed so much off the other actors. So it's very unnatural to me to do it, but since we always do the scene with the actor first I have a very clear memory and then we do it with the real actor saying the lines, so I still get a response and it becomes more like playing a game of ping pong”.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Maghen is also {{an outspoken}} {{advocate}} of Jewish growth, Jewish knowledge, Jewish joy and Zionist outreach. In a peroration written to the Jewish student body of Columbia in 1990, Maghen satirically lambasted his peers for their apologetic response to supposed anti-semitic hate speech on campus:"A man calls you a pig. Do <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> with a sign explaining that, in fact, {{you are not a}} pig? Do you hand out leaflets expostulating in detail upon the manifold differences between you and a pig ("A pig has a snout, I have a nose; a pig wallows in mud, I only occasionally step in a puddle, and then, of course, inadvertently...")? Do you stand on a soap box and discourse eruditely on why, in general, it is extremely not nice to call people pigs, and appeal to the populace to please have no truck with an individual rude and nasty enough to say such things about an upstanding citizen like yourself? Fellow Jews, where in hell is your dignity? Where is your abhorrence of useless, thoughtless, counterproductive endeavor?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Amnesiacs cover art {{was created}} by Yorke and the artist Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Radiohead since The Bends (1995). It depicts a weeping minotaur of Greek mythology. Donwood said the artwork was {{inspired}} by [...] "taking the train to London, getting lost and taking notes". Likening London to the mythological labyrinth, he saw the city as [...] "an imaginary prison, a place where <b>you</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> and <b>you</b> are the Minotaur of London, we are all the monsters, we are all half human half beast. We are trapped in this maze of this past." ...|$|R
50|$|You play a US spy in the CIA, Sam Porter, {{and have}} to travel {{all over the city}} looking for the bomb. <b>You</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>around,</b> or <b>you</b> can go to various {{destinations}} by taxi.

Most of the Berliners have nothing to offer you, so you are challenged with finding the ones who do. Some will tell the truth, some will lie, and some don't even know they possess information that would be of value.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to take <b>you</b> for a <b>walk,</b> <b>around</b> the housing complex Blok P in the centre of Nuuk, Greenland. I {{encourage}} you to move and listen, to smell and touch.

Let us explore urban nostalgia, not as an either/or reactionary, speculative, radical, or future-oriented but as the organizing narrative of our shared journey...|$|R
