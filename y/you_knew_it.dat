500|$|Grohl {{has said}} that Cobain told him, [...] "Music comes first and lyrics come second," [...] and Grohl {{believes}} that above all Cobain focused on the melodies of his songs. Cobain was still working on the album's lyrics well into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally, Cobain's phrasing on the album {{is often difficult to}} understand. Vig asserted that clarity of Cobain's singing was not paramount. Vig said, [...] "Even though you couldn't quite tell what he was singing about, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was intense as hell." [...] Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing [...] "Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?" ...|$|E

He gave an abridged {{version of his}} speech on The Oprah Winfrey Show in October 2007. The talk was modeled after an ongoing series of lectures where top academics are asked to think deeply about what matters to them, and then give a hypothetical [...] "final talk", with a topic such as [...] "what wisdom would you try to impart to the world if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was your last chance?" [...] Before speaking, Pausch received a long standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students. [...] When he motioned them to sit down, saying, [...] "Make me earn it", someone in the audience shouted back, [...] "You did!" ...|$|E

500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be the end".|$|E
500|$|Marissa Higgins, {{writing for}} xoJane, {{contended that the}} show [...] "didn't {{accomplish}} anything with their portrayal of sexual assault" [...] {{and said that she}} disliked the way that the story ended with Doggett effectively quitting her job as van driver in order to avoid further contact with Coates. Emma Eisenberg, of Salon, criticized the scenes depicting Doggett growing up in Waynesboro as being [...] "riddled with excessive Appalachian clichés". She went further by calling Doggett's mother unrealistic in her attitude towards sex: [...] "the mothers I met [...] wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices". Eisenberg claimed that, therefore, Doggett's mother's speech about sex − [...] "it’s like a bee sting, in and out, over before <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was happening" [...] − was not representative of people in Waynesboro at that time. Chloe Stillwell completely disagreed with Eisenberg and insisted that the character of Doggett was realistic: [...] "Eisenberg's argument completely misses the point that perhaps the show is trying to be as real as possible, and acknowledging that there are real life Pennsatuckies in this world isn't to disenfranchise Appalachia." ...|$|E
500|$|Mitchell earned preseason first-team All-Pac-10 honors from The Sporting News and Lindy's Sports {{before the}} 2000 season as he {{prepared}} to take over the starting wide receiver job following Farmer's graduation. Mitchell, along with teammate Poli-Dixon, was named to the Fred Biletnikoff Award watchlist for the best wide receiver in college football during the preseason. In the season-opener against third-ranked Alabama, Mitchell threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Poli-Dixon on a trick play in the first quarter and made a 46-yard touchdown reception from McCann in the third quarter. He finished the game with four catches for 91yards in the upset win. In the 24–21 win over Fresno State on September 9, Mitchell led the team in receiving with six receptions for 58yards and a 20-yard touchdown pass from McCann. Mitchell's catches went into the double-digits against third-ranked Michigan, as he had ten receptions for 137yards in the 23–20 upset win on September 16. On September 23, {{in the third quarter of}} a 29–10 loss against Oregon, Mitchell caught what appeared to be a touchdown in the corner of the end zone, but was ruled out-of-bounds by the officials. The Bruins settled for a field goal on the drive and Mitchell explained after the game that [...] "I knew it was a touchdown, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was a touchdown, everybody does. The ref knew it too because he looked at me like he was sorry." [...] On the next series, however, Mitchell caught a 54-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Bennett. Mitchell finished the game with eight receptions for 158yards. In a 38–31 comeback win over Arizona State on September 30, he caught two touchdown passes from Cory Paus in the third quarter, one of which was for 80yards, and had four total catches for 125yards in the game. On October 14, in a triple-overtime loss to California, Mitchell made eight receptions for 167yards and caught a 35-yard touchdown from Paus in the fourth quarter.|$|E

2500|$|At Abbey Road Studios on 20 May 1970, a {{month after}} the Beatles' break-up, Harrison ran through [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] alone on {{electric}} guitar for producer Phil Spector. Leng suggests that, following Lennon and McCartney's routine dismissal of many of his compositions, Harrison [...] "presented his new songs with reticence, almost with a Pavlovian expectation of their being rejected". In his interview for the 2011 [...] documentary, Spector explains his positive reaction to Harrison's spiritually themed songs: [...] "He just lived by his deeds. He was spiritual and <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> and there was no salesmanship involved. It made you spiritual being around him." [...] Harrison biographer Gary Tillery notes an additional need for faith on the singer's part in mid 1970 as [...] "pillars of Harrison's old life were passing away", with the demise of his former band and the fatal illness of his mother, Louise.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{responses}} {{to her voice}} emphasise her breathy sensuality. Another powerful feature was the sense of longing, in songs such as [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself" [...] and [...] "Goin' Back". The uniqueness of Springfield's voice was described by Bacharach: [...] "You could hear just three notes and <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was Dusty". Wexler declared, [...] "er particular hallmark was a haunting sexual vulnerability in her voice, and she may have had the most impeccable intonation of any singer I ever heard". Greil Marcus of Rolling Stone captured Springfield's technique as [...] "a soft, sensual box (voice) that allowed her to combine syllables until they turned into pure cream." [...] She had a finely tuned musical ear and extraordinary control of tone. She sang {{in a variety of}} styles, mostly pop, soul, folk, Latin, and rock'n'roll. Being able to wrap her voice around difficult material, her repertoire included songs that their writers ordinarily would have offered to black vocalists. In the 1960s, on several occasions, she performed as the only white singer on all-black bills. Her soul orientation was so convincing that early in her solo career, US listeners who had only heard her music on radio or records sometimes assumed that she was African American. Later, a considerable number of critics observed that she sounded black and American or made a point of saying she did not.|$|E
