5000|$|As {{the days}} pass by, both Tom and Eddie {{try to tell}} people {{that they are not}} who {{everyone}} thinks they are. All Tom can now do is hope that his Pop comes to pick him up, whilst Eddie, upon realising that the production has moved to Miami, decides to get to the film set himself. He hotwires his boat (which was left in Palm Beach) after Miles takes the key from him and throws it into the water to stop who he thinks is Tom from running away from home. After he doesn’t get very far in the boat, Eddie has to be bailed out by Milles from the police station, and driven home to Pop who starts on Miles for interfering. Miles says he just cares about Tom and doesn’t want to see him going off the rails, but warns Pop that's what will happen if he keeps pushing him. Whilst they are arguing, Eddie jumps into Milles' car and drives off in it. Pop and Milles follow him in Pop's truck, losing track of him when he stops at a roadside service station to buy a veggie burger meal. At the film set in Miami, Milles and Pop bluff their way in by saying that they are extras. They also ask if there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> pretending to <b>be</b> Eddie Tudor trying to sneak in yet, to which the security guard replies, [...] "No sir, not yet". Later, Eddie arrives and the guard says to him, [...] "You must be pretending to be Eddie Tudor" [...] and lets him in. Once on the set, he spots Tom and confronts him, yelling [...] "You're dead, punk!" [...] and they have a brawl with Eddie ranting [...] "You took my identity!", Tom responds with [...] "It wasn’t my fault-They switched location!". Eventually, all calms down and everyone finds out who is who and what has happened. Eddie tells his mom that he now realises that she only pushes him because she cares, to which she says [...] "That's right", and she also reunites with Miles, whom she used to date before Eddie was born, while he was still in the business-before he went off on his own, which he tells her was because he didn’t like the person he had become, not because he disliked her or acting. She understands and reveals to him that Eddie is his son.(Earlier in the movie when Miles thinks he is speaking with Tom he says [...] "I'm not your Dad, but I care about you a lot......I’ve known <b>you</b> since <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> little <b>kid</b> and I've always thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> cute, Tom".)(it is never revealed to Eddie that Miles is his father).|$|R
