500|$|Braid {{has been}} {{considered}} a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation {{and the need to}} understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if [...] "years of gaming blinders have been ripped away." [...] Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were [...] "elaborate and formidable", but [...] "impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was [...] "the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with its mature tale the next". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not [...] "feel immature" [...] as it [...] "expects [...] much" [...] of the player as any other form of media and [...] "doesn't short you in any respect". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork [...] "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were [...] "eye-catching but never distracting". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids [...] "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision", and that [...] "the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to rewind time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's [...] "core challenges".|$|E
2500|$|The series writer, Julian Fellowes, {{himself a}} Roman Catholic, {{explains}} that he chose to address {{this in terms of}} [...] "that casual, almost unconscious anti-Catholicism that was found among the upper classes, which lasted well into my growing up years." [...] Fellowes also stated that he [...] "thought it might be interesting" [...] to explore this in the series and described his own experiences where the British upper classes [...] "were happy for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> their dances or shoot their pheasants, but there were plenty who did not want you to marry their daughters and risk Catholic grandchildren." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Alors, M. Blondin, I {{understand}} that <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms..." ...|$|R

60|$|MRS MARCH. [Matter of fact {{in defeat}} as in victory] <b>You</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us, I hear.|$|R
6000|$|It was an oddity of Mrs. Lowder's {{that her}} face in speech was like a lighted window at night, but that silence {{immediately}} drew the curtain. The occasion for reply allowed by her silence was never easy to take; yet she was still less easy to interrupt. The great glaze of her surface, at all events, gave her visitor no present help. [...] "I didn't ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> hear what it isn't--I asked <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> hear what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be cursing, I tell you, girl. And {{what is it}} your misthress is {{wishing to}} do now? Did she tell <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me?" ...|$|E
60|$|LARRY. May I ask {{how long}} it took <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> business? You can hardly have known her for {{more than a couple of}} hours.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{are leaving}} you lonely in the holidays! <b>You</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Ormersfield, your nephews would {{take better care}} of you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{probably}} want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down <b>to</b> the 'Unusual' to-morrow morning," [...] he said. [...] "Bring any new songs you may have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bother money. Wealth is sordid. Washing {{stockings}} over a tub is {{the only}} life for me,--so long as I have <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> M. de Kercadiou with me, and to {{use your}} {{influence}} to obtain justice. I suppose I am asking too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{the fault}} of that stupid Chinaman, Grace, and I am sorry. It was so courageous of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me before them all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{may not be}} {{so fresh}} as Miss Ruck,” I said, “but in future, when you want information, I {{recommend}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me for it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What are <b>you</b> going <b>to</b> do for {{the rest}} of the vacation, Dave?” said Roger, that evening. “You know <b>you</b> promised <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my home.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Sulzer: [...] "My friends, this is {{a stormy}} night. It is {{certainly}} very good of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here <b>to</b> bid Mrs. Sulzer and me good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Carrie; {{you think}} I'm going <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> love me. I'm not. And I'm not going <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> Gopher Prairie!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my room {{as soon as}} you {{possibly}} can, child," [...] Berenice said. [...] "Shall I wait while you finish your game?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Guy laughed. 'You {{must come}} and see the example, Markham. I have a message from Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, to ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Hollywell at Whitsuntide.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We greet you well, {{and pray}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us without loss of time, [...] having need of you, we being {{a free man}} and no captive.|$|E
60|$|MRS DUBEDAT. I promise. But {{all that}} is far off, dear. <b>You</b> are <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Cornwall with me and get well. Sir Ralph says so.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; indeed, {{how should}} <b>you?</b> Well, <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the point, {{it has to}} do with that very charming {{daughter}} of yours and my son Morris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, Herbert," [...] said Julius, [...] "can I ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> me, {{now that}} we shall have a fair amount to do between us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} forgive my {{remarking}} it," [...] Mr. Pengarth said, [...] "this seems rather an extraordinary place for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{if you really}} dislike solitude." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{nothing at}} all, my dear; {{we hope to}} do more for you," [...] said Mrs. Harvey. [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> dinner soon. You'll come?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You earn your living! It's {{clear that}} {{something}} very extraordinary must have happened; but we'll talk of that after supper. So <b>you</b> decided <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not with you. As near as you like. But one house, one woman.... I'll have {{a little}} flat of my own--for <b>you</b> both <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
50|$|If <b>you</b> happen <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my house, oh dear, bring a lamp for me; and a windowso that I {{can watch}} {{the crowd in the}} happy street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Once I {{was eager}} to persuade <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> church to hear me; will you think it strange if I ask you not to come on this occasion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He ain't brought none but hisself, 'cause he come on horseback; and it's {{my belief}} he's going back almost immediate. But he wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him, Mrs Dale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very kind, Mr. Lancaster," [...] said Olive, {{breaking}} the silence, [...] "for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see us instead of writing. It {{is so much}} pleasanter for friends--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here, Tedham!" [...] I said. [...] "I don't {{know why}} <b>you</b> feel {{authorized}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me at all. It is useless your {{saying that there}} is no one else. You know very well that the authorities, some of them--the chaplain--would go and see Mrs. Hasketh for you. He could have a great deal more influence with her than any one else could, if he felt like saying a good word for you. As far as I am concerned, you have expiated your offence fully; but I should think you yourself would see that <b>you</b> ought not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me with this request; or <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me last of all men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! Why, Harcourt, {{you are not}} at {{all like}} yourself. If you admire her so much, I shall beg <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Littlebath any more." ...|$|R
