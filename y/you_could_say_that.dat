Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say.</b> <b>That</b> is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Secret Speech" [...] {{proved to}} be an utter misnomer. While the {{attendees}} at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked [...] "not for the press" [...] rather than [...] "top secret". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West. Khrushchev's son, Sergei, later wrote, [...] "learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the entire country became familiar with the speech... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{came from}} Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being {{inspired by the}} classic, Karan quoted, [...] "What appealed to me {{was the fact that}} the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different." [...] Similarly, Karan added an extra [...] "e" [...] to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was [...] "frothy and bubble-gummish", this one was [...] "more classy and sophisticated". He added that there would be [...] "plenty of drama" [...] in this film too, but handled more maturely.|$|E

500|$|<b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{five hundred}} years ago was the basis of blood quantum in Ibero-America. But in Anglo-America, while there was some preoccupation with it, it was not formalized until {{the passage of the}} General Allotment Act, mid-1880s. At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was demonstrably and documentably of at least one-quarter by quantum blood {{indigenous}} in a given group. You couldn't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth Arapaho and be an Indian. You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter Arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter. The reason for this was quite clear. They were identifying Indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point. If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such, then the rest of the land would be declared surplus. So it was clearly {{in the interests of the}} government to create a definition of Indianness that would minimize the number of Indians that were available. It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to Indianness in the first place. It's become increasingly so ever since." [...] (...) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that [...] "it would be difficult not to admire Raynor, {{if for no other}} reason than his persistence" [...] in the face of abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they [...] "were actually talking to me" [...] and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting [...] "When was the last time <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> about a character in a strategy game?" [...] A reader's poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming's top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy's voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing to put it all on the line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s the man you want to be fighting side by side with." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked Raynor as the 24th greatest soldier in video games.|$|E

2500|$|Ibn 'Arabī {{held that}} {{witnessing}} God {{in the female}} human form is the most perfect mode of witnessing: if the Prophet Muḥammad was made to love women, it is because women reflect God.

In a way, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio.

2500|$|Cox went on {{to suggest}} that oysters would be {{acceptable}} to eat, even by strict ethical criteria, {{if they did not}} feel: [...] "while <b>you</b> <b>could</b> give them the benefit of the doubt, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> also <b>say</b> <b>that</b> unless some new evidence of a capacity for pain emerges, the doubt is so slight that there is no good reason for avoiding eating sustainably produced oysters."

2500|$|The film {{features}} a satirical {{portrayal of the}} South Korean government as bureaucratic, inept, and essentially uncaring. Korean youth protesters are featured satirically in the film, in a mixed way, partially heroic and partially self-righteous and oblivious. According to Bong Joon-ho, the Park Nam-il character is a deliberate anachronism, a reference to South Korea's troubled political history, which involved violent protest. [...] "When you look {{in terms of this}} character, it's sort of like the feeling of time going backwards.

2500|$|David Nathan, a noted {{authority}} on soul music, {{and a friend}} of Troy's during (and long after) her brief stint on Apple, regards Doris Troy as [...] "certainly her most personal work", and concludes: [...] "In that sense <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is her best album. It is so reflective of who she was at the time." [...] In his preview of Apple Records' 2010 reissues, for Rolling Stone, David Fricke lists Doris Troy among his top five non-Beatle Apple albums, describing it as [...] "Strong but shy of classic". Sharon Davis of Blues & Soul writes that [...] "from the opening track 'Ain't That Cute' … American born Doris' distinctive R vocals settled easily into this pot pourie of musical styles", which [...] "crossed mid tempo, high melody, into rock and red-blooded gospel". Davis rates the album [...] "a must for true soul fans".|$|E

5000|$|The {{view that}} oysters are {{acceptable}} to eat, even by strict ethical criteria, has notably been propounded in the seminal 1975 text Animal Liberation, by philosopher Peter Singer. However, subsequent editions have reversed this position (advocating against eating oysters). Singer {{has stated that}} he has [...] "gone {{back and forth on}} this over the years", and as of 2010 states that [...] "while <b>you</b> <b>could</b> give them the benefit of the doubt, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> also <b>say</b> <b>that</b> unless some new evidence of a capacity for pain emerges, the doubt is so slight that there is no good reason for avoiding eating sustainably produced oysters".|$|R

We've always had trouble dealing with racial issues on film, so, in that regard, the film could be a landmark." [...] Claire Sutherland, in her review for the Herald Sun (Melbourne) wrote, [...] "A love letter to the Australian landscape and our history, Australia has international blockbuster written all over it", and Sydney's The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Kidman's screen presence {{is nothing short of}} radiant." [...] In his review for The Australian (Sydney), David Stratton wrote, [...] "It's not the masterpiece that we were hoping for, but I think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it's a very good film in many ways. While it will be very popular with many people I think there's a slight air of disappointment after it all. Despite its flaws — and it certainly has flaws — I think Australia is an impressive and important film." [...] Mark Naglazas of The West Australian (Perth) accused positive reviews from News Ltd press outlets of being manipulated by 20th Century Fox, as they are all owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, calling Australia a film of [...] "unrelenting awfulness" [...] that [...] "lurches drunkenly from crazy comedy to Mills and Boonish melodrama {{in the space of a}} couple of scenes".|$|E

And at least in its first edition — Mr. Capps intends to repeat Big Ears in Knoxville, and also export the idea to other cities — Big Ears was for concertgoers who appreciate not hearing a lot of introductions and context and sponsor announcements before the music even starts.

[...] "It would be {{distinguished}}, in a way. But it wouldn't be distinguished in the society way; the only way you've professed to care for. I know that we've always been an intellectual community, and New-Yorkers, and that kind of people, think, or profess to think, that we make a great deal of literary men. We do invite them somewhat, but I pass whole seasons without meeting them; and I don't know that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they are of society, even when they are in it. If such a man has society connections, he's in society; but he's there on account of his connections, not on account of his achievements.

I think Aileen really believed that she had killed in self-defense. I think someone who's deeply psychotic can't really tell the difference between something that is life threatening and something that is a minor disagreement, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> something <b>that</b> she didn't agree with. She would get into a screaming black temper about it. And I think that's what had caused these things to happen.

Yet {{they could have been}} sewn more quickly; for at times the needle stopped and she did not know it. Once a bedridden old woman, with whom she had been sitting up, lay watching her instead of sleeping, and finally said: [...] "What makes you sit staring at a cauld fire, and speaking to yourself?" [...] And there was a strange day when she had been too long in the Den. When she started for home she went in the direction of Double Dykes, her old home, instead.|$|R
