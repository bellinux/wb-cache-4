"I think, my dear," [...] {{she said}} gently, [...] "that I {{will have to}} tell <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> our family history {{that may not be}} very {{pleasant}} to hear or tell. Perhaps you don't know that when your mother married we--we--did not exactly approve of her marriage. Perhaps we were mistaken; at any rate it was wrong and foolish to let it come between us and her as we have done. But that is how it was. None of us approved, as I have said, but none of us was so bitter as your Uncle Paul. Your mother was his favourite sister, and he was very deeply attached to her. She was only a year younger than he. When he bought the Greenwood farm she went and kept house for him for three years before her marriage. When she married, Paul was terribly angry. He was always a strange man, very determined and unyielding. He said he would never forgive her, and he never has. He has never married, and he has lived so long alone at Greenwood with only deaf old Mrs. Bree to keep house for him that he has grown odder than ever. One of us wanted to go and keep house for him, but he would not let us. And--I must tell you this although I hate to--he was very angry when he heard we had invited you to visit us, and he said he would not come near the Grange as long as you were here. Oh, you can't realize how bitter and obstinate he is. We pleaded with him, but I think that only made him worse. We have felt so bad over it, your Aunt Ellen and your Uncle George and I, but we can do nothing at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|The movie {{generally}} was panned by its viewers with an 18% audience {{score and}} with a 4.2 rating on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb respectively. [...] BlogCritics made note that the film's elements were [...] "reminiscent of Spielberg's debut Duel {{as well as the}} likes of Jeepers Creepers, Blair Witch Project, and Paranormal Activity, and while the film's concept was not original, it [...] "is a well executed low-budget thriller," [...] with the reviewer remarking that [...] "the biggest complaint I have about it is that it feels a tad long with too little actually happening." [...] Dread Central wrote that while it was another [...] "found footage film", after speaking with him, they were willing to give director Dominic Perez the benefit of the doubt. They offered this quote from Perez himself: [...] "It took me 3 months to write Evil Things, 7 days to shoot it, and 1 month to edit it, but it took me 41 years to finally believe that I could make it happen." [...] Twitch Film wrote that the film was meandering, aiming for authenticity in its scares but missing the mark, commenting that it was the [...] "'free-form' dialogue from each of the five victims forces the authenticity; raising and lowering the tension immediately and in the process spiralling as far from reality as possible." [...] However, they did note the film was well shot: [...] "for a handheld piece the frozen vistas are quite remarkable and the winter holiday home is an excellent set piece for that unmistakable feeling of 'middle of nowhere'," [...] but concluded that despite the location, once the actors begin their dialog, [...] "the film loses its gravitas." [...] The website concluded that the film [...] "offers an interesting end {{in the form of the}} killers' point of view, but the nifty convention is ultimately lost in the mediocrity that came before it." [...] JoBlo.com compared the film to both Blair Witch and Lord of the Rings [...] "because for the better part of the movie, nothing much happens. But when the shit does hit the fan, it does so in a grand fashion that leaves you retarded on the floor and cowering in fear/excitement". They noted that while much of the film's early dialog was tedious and boring, the final 30 minutes when the reviewer felt that as a hand-held film, it finally delivered the excitement that was anticipated. They wrote that the actors did a great job of leading up to the final moments, doing [...] "great job of carrying the film, and keeping the audience intrigued right to the final screams," [...] offering that [...] "the horror of the payoff here feels personal, like it is actually happening, which is hard to accomplish in any movie". The reviewer also appreciated how the film was put together, as if edited by the killer himself after his deeds were done, with additional footage seemingly shot by the kiler himself edited into that taken by his victims. Action Flick Chick wrote that the film was a [...] "slow starter", but that the [...] "ending does give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a creep out factor, though." [...] Horror review site Life After Undeath panned the movie stating that [...] "Evil Things is every mock documentary ever made" [...] and that they [...] "can only recommend Evil Things for people who think The Ils Witch Activity would make a good movie, and then only if you liked the worst parts of each of those movies." ...|$|E
