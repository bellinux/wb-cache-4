25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse <b>you</b> <b>both</b> thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
500|$|Sellers's {{behaviour}} {{towards his}} family worsened in 1962; {{according to his}} son Michael, Sellers asked him and his sister Sarah [...] "who we love more, our mother or him. Sarah, to keep the peace, said, 'I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> equally'. I said, 'No, I love my mum.'" [...] This prompted Sellers to throw both children out, saying that {{he never wanted to}} see them again. At the end of 1962, his marriage to Anne broke down. In 1963, Sellers starred as gang leader [...] "Pearly Gates" [...] in Cliff Owen's The Wrong Arm of the Law, followed by his portrayal of a vicar in Heavens Above! ...|$|E
500|$|When the Panic of 1893 {{struck in}} the {{following}} year, the United States suffered one of its worst economic crises. By year's end, the unemployment rate was higher than 20%, and [...] "hunger demonstrations" [...] sometimes gave way to riots. Goldman began speaking to crowds of frustrated {{men and women in}} New York City. On August 21, she spoke to a crowd of nearly 3,000 people in Union Square, where she encouraged unemployed workers to take immediate action. Her exact words are unclear: undercover agents insist she ordered the crowd to [...] "take everything...by force", while Goldman later recounted this message: [...] "Well then, demonstrate before the palaces of the rich; demand work. If they do not give you work, demand bread. If they deny <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> take bread." [...] Later in court, Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered yet another version of her speech.|$|E

500|$|Bromwich {{noted that}} Hazlitt's thoughts, {{particularly}} {{as applied to}} Lear, are here in line with those of Shelley in his Defence of Poetry. Bromwich also noted that for Hazlitt {{the power of this}} play is achieved by Shakespeare's unwillingness to soften the harshness of [...] "nature", as expressed in Lear's halting, broken outcries, such as [...] "I will have such revenges on <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> /That all the world shall——". This approach is never quite followed by even so great a contemporary poet as Wordsworth. To Hazlitt, this is a demonstration of why the greatest poetry of his own age failed to achieve the level of greatness that Shakespeare reached here. That King Lear is strongest in subordinating the artistry of dramatic poetry to the power of nature is also why its kind of poetry is superior to the more artificial kind produced by Pope.|$|E
500|$|While shooting, {{crew members}} would {{collapse}} of heat exhaustion every day. Hersholt {{spent a week}} in the hospital after shooting was completed, suffering from internal bleeding. Hersholt claimed to have lost , and was covered in blisters by the end of filming. Despite the hardship Hersholt said that he considered it the best role of his career. In order to motivate Hersholt and Gibson during the scene where they fight, von Stroheim yelled at them, [...] "Fight, fight! Try to hate each other as <b>you</b> <b>both</b> hate me!" [...] Throughout filming, von Stroheim brought musicians on set to help create mood for the actors. He continued to use this for the Death Valley scenes with a harmonium and violin player. A theme, inspired by the music of Ruggero Leoncavallo, was composed and played throughout production. Other music used included the popular songs [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", [...] "Hearts and Flowers", [...] "Oh Promise Me", and [...] "Call Me Thine Own".|$|E
500|$|Acoustic guitar, {{violin and}} drums {{accompany}} Eminem's verses. The lyrics transition from discussing {{positive aspects of}} love to describing violent events. Eminem raps, [...] "It's the rage that took over, it controls <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> so they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." [...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's {{what happens when a}} tornado meets a volcano". The described love–hate relationship worsens and leads to domestic violence. Eminem admits to lying about promises he makes and says late in the song, [...] "If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire", a reference to Rihanna's lyrics.|$|E

500|$|On May 14, 1995, a {{referendum}} {{was conducted in}} all regions of Belarus. Out of four questions, one was the following: [...] "Do you support {{the introduction of the}} new national symbols?" [...] With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new state symbols were approved by a ratio of 3:1 (75.1% to 24.9%). The way the referendum was carried out was heavily criticized by the opposition, including the exact wording of the question about the national insignia. Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared to ones, used by collaboration forces, in propaganda that was published during the run-up to the vote. The comparison was made due to the white, red, white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada, the Belarusian government under the control of Nazi Germany. Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet-inspired symbols as a victory, especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base, by saying [...] "we have returned to you the flag of the country for which you fought. We have returned to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> memory and a sense of human pride." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Craig Harris {{awarded the}} game an Editor's Choice award, stating, [...] "This is an {{incredibly}} challenging, old-school throwback that might not set the genre afire with innovation, but in my book, it's better than the awesome game that inspired it. [...] Rare should be proud that its design is in the right hands. Or just insanely jealous. Either works." [...] Video game talk show Good Games two presenters gave the game a 9 and 8.5 out of 10, praising how true the music kept to {{the style of the}} original tracks, and that it managed to keep from becoming too complex while still avoiding being over-simplified, saying [...] "If you're a fan of the old Donkeys, or you just want a great platforming experience, this is worth {{at least as much as}} Kong's golden banana hoard." [...] X-Play praised the similarity of Returns to previous games in the series, the game's replay value, and its graphics, but the review criticized the motion controls [...] "that force you to react quickly at bad times, a button press would suffice" [...] and the co-op game play, saying, [...] "If your partner has a penchant for dying, look forward to some short games as he or she will most likely drain the number of lives <b>you</b> <b>both</b> share." [...] GamesRadar complimented the title for its standout levels and fan service, while criticizing it for levels that are [...] "frustrating, unclear and often misleading way that is unlike any prior Donkey Kong adventure", and motion controls that make them [...] "question the controls in a platformer". GameTrailers praised the game's gameplay and the diversity of the levels, while Giant Bomb claimed, [...] "Retro recaptures most of Donkey Kong's venerated platforming roots in this fine Wii sequel." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the age of}} 20, when {{he passed}} through Vilnius, his fame preceded him. Both Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Grodnenski [...] the leading Rav of Vilna and the {{son-in-law}} of Rabbi Yisroel Salanter [...] and Rabbi Elinke Levinsohn of Kretinga desired the young Torah prodigy for their own son-in-law. The two went to Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor of Kovno to decide which family would merit this honor. After hearing each one's position, Rabbi Spector asked to meet Rabbi Grodzinski, and spoke at length with him on various Torah topics. Afterward, Rabbi Spector told the two prospective fathers-in-law: [...] "The truth is that if I had a daughter to marry off, I would take him and leave <b>you</b> <b>both</b> out in the cold. Since I have no such daughter, however, I have decided {{in favor of the}} Rav of Vilna".|$|E

2500|$|The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, {{follows the}} {{traditional}} Tibetan Buddhist assertion that inappropriate sexual behaviour includes {{lesbian and gay}} sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse with one's own monogamous partner, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation. In a 1994 interview, he stated: [...] "If someone comes to me and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If <b>you</b> <b>both</b> agree, then I think I would say 'if two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay'." [...] However, in his 1996 book Beyond Dogma, he states, [...] "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else... homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper {{is the use of}} organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{theme of}} revenge is {{introduced}} in the opening scene. Upon seeing York seated on the royal throne, Henry reminds his allies of their conflict with the Yorkists {{in an attempt to}} motivate them; [...] "Earl of Northumberland, [...] slew thy father,/And thine Lord Clifford, and <b>you</b> <b>both</b> have vowed revenge/On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends" [...] (1.1.54–56). Northumberland responds to this with [...] "If I be not, heavens be revenged on me" [...] (1.1.57). Later, after Henry has resigned the crown to the House of York and has been abandoned by Clifford, Westmorland and Northumberland, Exeter explains, [...] "They seek revenge and therefore shall not yield" [...] (1.1.191). Later, after Edward has been installed as king, Oxford refuses to acknowledge him, arguing [...] "Call him my king, by whose injurious doom/My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere/Was done to death? And more than so, my father" [...] (3.3.101-102).|$|E
2500|$|Gartside's {{change in}} beliefs {{directly}} affected {{the music and}} particularly the lyrics of Songs to Remember. In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've got is needs, demands, and desires, and you go out and you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are about what happens when the anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away." [...] For example, he stated that the track [...] "Faithless" [...] was about [...] "how living without faith brings <b>you</b> <b>both</b> happiness and sadness. I've never had any religion, except maybe politics, although I am interested in having some means of achieving social order and progress." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{plot was}} {{positively}} received as [...] "quirky" [...] and [...] "bizarre and entertaining". A reviewer for Edge wrote: [...] "The beauty of Deadly Premonition is that it's a straightforward whodunnit viewed through the cracked prism of an unreliable narrator, conjuring {{an atmosphere of}} suspicion and confusion throughout." [...] According to Destructoids Jim Sterling, after the prologue, Deadly Premonition [...] "becomes a ludicrous pantomime of pop culture references, shamelessly contrived humor, {{and the kind of}} dialog that leaves <b>you</b> <b>both</b> scratching your head and laughing your face off." [...] The characters were positively received by reviewers as memorable, endearing, [...] "fascinating", and [...] "charming". [...] Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph remarked that the characters served as [...] "cartoon interpretations of small-town Americana" [...] with distinct personalities. According to IGN UK, the interaction with characters and uncovering the details of their fictional lives helped [...] "to fashion a genuine, albeit silly, emotional core - and its payoff resonates long after the credits have rolled as a result." [...] Matt Keil of G4TV described York as [...] "an oddly endearing character considering his arrogant behavior early on", with his love of films, video games, and music being a highlight. Eurogamer summed him up as [...] "a grade-A fruit-loop with a side of narcissism, {{and one of the most}} interesting gaming protagonists for years." [...] Reviewers also saw similarities in Deadly Premonitions characters with the characters of Twin Peaks.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hirst {{gave the}} book a {{positive}} review, {{in a piece}} for The Independent, though he cautioned British readers as to the difference from the style of journalism they are used to, writing, [...] "For anyone accustomed to the brevity of British journalism, these 20 features may seem grandiose in scale." [...] He wrote favorably of the article on the Beslan terrorism siege, commenting, [...] "Running to 56 pages, CJ Chivers's investigation of the 2004 Chechen school siege is hypnotic, like a slow-motion horror film." [...] Hirst concluded his review, [...] "Magazine journalism {{is one of the}} things that America does very well indeed." [...] In a review for The Daily Yomiuri, Cristoph Mark praised the writing style, readability, and organization of the book, commenting, [...] "Despite being nearly 500 pages, the collection is an incredibly quick read that leaves <b>you</b> <b>both</b> sad to finish the story you've just ended and yet happy to start anew, a feeling largely aided by the editors' innate ability to pace the order of the articles effectively, lightening the mood or going in for the punch as needed." [...] Kurt Rabin of The Free Lance–Star stated the publication was one of his three favorites of the year, including other compilations The Best American Crime Reporting and The Best American Sports Writing. Xujun Eberlain, writing for New America Media, wrote positively of William Langewiesche's Vanity Fair article, noting it [...] "has a great description" [...] of an incident involving a U.S. soldier operating in Iraq in a location under power of insurgents.|$|E
