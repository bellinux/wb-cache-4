500|$|The towering {{achievement}} of this album is, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> the preachiest song, [...] "Be Here Now". A straightforward evocation of Buddhist philosophy, its modal folk riffs and wavering melody are enchanting. Writer Ian MacDonald suggested that Nick Drake's [...] "River Man" [...] {{was based on}} this same Buddhist notion of mindfulness, and there's a similar combination of dreaminess and fierce intensity in this song, which is a masterpiece.|$|E
500|$|... in {{line with}} {{orthodox}} animal rights theory, animals are owed some utility-trumping rights—a right not to suffer and a right not to be killed; but, {{in line with}} utilitarianism, [...] wants to promote well-being without giving animals a right to liberty {{in the sense of}} outright protection from ownership and use by humans. Cochrane thus successfully ‘decouples’ the rights-utilitarian dichotomy and locates his theory in the middle ground between the two. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> he gives with one hand while taking away with the other.|$|E
500|$|Coward was {{homosexual}} but, {{following the}} convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned. The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 {{was close to}} an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: [...] "Forty years ago he was Slightly in Peter Pan, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> {{that he has been}} wholly in Peter Pan ever since. No private considerations have been allowed to deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E

2500|$|The {{grammar of}} Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is subject–verb–object. [...] However, word order is very flexible. [...] Commonly, verb-subject constructions {{are used to}} achieve a {{semantic}} effect. The sentence [...] "The train has arrived" [...] could be translated as [...] "Ha arribat el tren" [...] or [...] "El tren ha arribat." [...] Both sentences mean [...] "the train has arrived", but the former puts {{a focus on the}} train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival. [...] This subtle distinction is described as [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> while waiting in the station" [...] versus [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> on the train." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darling died of {{lymphoma}} on March 21, 1974, aged 29, at the Columbia University Medical Center {{division of}} the Cabrini Health Center. In a letter written on her deathbed and intended for Andy Warhol and his followers, Darling said, [...] "Unfortunately before my death I had no desire left for life... I am just so bored by everything. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> bored to death. Did you know I couldn't last. I always knew it. I wish I could meet you all again." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 August the Guerriere made contact with the Constitution. Dacres prepared to fight and the two ships closed and exchanged broadsides for some time. The range eventually decreased and after a brief close exchange the Guerrieres mizzenmast was shot away, allowing the Constitution to rake her several times, causing considerable damage, before the two ships became entangled. Shortly after this Guerriere lost both her main and foremasts, leaving her largely un-manoeuvrable. During the engagement Dacres had been wounded by a musket-ball in the back while on the starboard forecastle, but had refused to leave the deck. Constitution then drew away to repair some damage, while Dacres attempted to set a jury rig. The attempt failed, and on Constitutions returning, Dacres fired {{a shot in the}} opposite direction to the Constitution. Sensing that this was an attempt to signal surrender, Hull ordered a boat to take a lieutenant over to the British ship. When the lieutenant walked onto the Guerriere and asked if Guerriere was prepared to surrender, Captain Dacres responded [...] "Well, Sir, I don't know. Our mizzen mast is gone, our fore and main masts are gone-I think on the whole <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> we have struck our flag." ...|$|E

2500|$|Left unimpressed, Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote, [...] "You {{really have}} to feel for Alex Proyas. This guy wears bad luck like the grimy trenchcoats of his protagonists, only his zipper's stuck and he can't seem to shake the damn thing off." [...] In expressing his negativity, he {{believed}} [...] "Dark City looks like a million bucks (or rather, a million bucks gone to compost), but at its dark heart it's a tedious, bewildering affair, lovely to look at {{but with all the}} substance of a dissipating dream." [...] Left equally disappointed was John Anderson of the Los Angeles Times. Commenting on the directing, he thought [...] "If you had to guess, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that Proyas came out of the world of comic art himself, rather than music videos and advertising. Dark City is constructed like panels in a Batman book, each picture striving for maximum dread." [...] He went on to say, Proyas was [...] "trying simultaneously to create a pure thriller and sci-fi nightmare along with his tongue-in-cheek critique of artifice. And this doesn't work out quite so well." [...] Author TCh of Time Out, felt the development of the Murdoch character was [...] "surprisingly engrossing" [...] and thought production wise, the [...] "art direction is always striking, and unlike most contemporary sci-fi, the movie does risk a cerebral approach, tapping a vein of postmodern paranoia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{is a rare}} {{example of}} a poet whose main output came at a fairly {{advanced}} age. His first major publication (four poems from a sequence entitled [...] "Phases" [...] in the November 1914 edition of Poetry) was written at age 35, although as an undergraduate at Harvard, Stevens had written poetry and exchanged sonnets with George Santayana, with whom he was close through much of his life. Many of his canonical works were written well after he turned 50. According to the literary critic Harold Bloom, who called Stevens the [...] "best and most representative" [...] American poet of the time, no Western writer since Sophocles has had such a late flowering of artistic genius. His contemporary, Harriet Monroe, termed Stevens [...] "a poet, rich and numerous and profound, provocative of joy, creative beauty in those who can respond to Him". Helen Vendler notes {{that there are three}} distinguishable moods present in Stevens' long poems: ecstasy, apathy, and reluctance between ecstasy and apathy. She also notes that his poetry was highly influenced by the paintings of Paul Klee and Paul Cézanne:Stevens saw in the paintings of both Paul Klee—who was his favorite painter—and Cézanne the kind of work he wanted to do himself as a Modernist poet. Klee had imagined symbols. Klee is not a directly realistic painter and is full of whimsical and fanciful and imaginative and humorous projections of reality in his paintings. The paintings are often enigmatic or full of riddles, and Stevens liked that as well. What Stevens liked in Cézanne was the reduction, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> of the world to a few monumental objects.|$|E
