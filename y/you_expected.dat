[...] In spite of Berson's initial surprise at the song's sound, she went on to praise the single as [...] "very catchy, a bit inspirational", and [...] "energetic".

The ruling obtained, {{for the first time in}} British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals.
