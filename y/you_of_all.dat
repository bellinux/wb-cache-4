500|$|The {{film was}} widely {{appreciated}} for the comedy sequences featuring Nagesh. On 15 March 1964, the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan praised the filmmaker for having given an innovative comedy {{that did not}} bore audiences but entertain them. On On 29 February 1964, The Indian Express noted {{that the lack of}} major stars gave the film a feeling of freshness, applauded the performances of the cast members and concluded, [...] "One cannot carry home anything after seeing the picture.

2500|$|The final episode {{aired on}} January 13, 2012, with villainess Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick) narrating her {{views about the}} people of Llanview. During the last minutes of the episode, Todd Manning (Howarth) is put under arrest {{for the murder of}} twin brother Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John). The show ends with the {{discovery}} that Victor Lord, Jr. is still alive and has been kidnapped by Perkins. Perkins closes the 43-year-old soap opera by throwing the script of One Life to Live at Victor saying to him: [...] "But why spoil what happens next. <b>You</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> people should know things are rarely what they appear". The decision to conclude One Life to Live with an open-ended story is because the serial was supposed to continue on another network at the time the last scenes were taped (see section below).|$|E
2500|$|When the two {{themes are}} {{combined}} each note of (the first part of) the Beethoven theme {{is followed by}} the same note in the Elgar theme. So musically Elgar [...] "follows" [...] Beethoven, as Jaeger told him to do (see above, Var. IX) and, by doing so, in the vigorous, optimistic Finale the artist triumphs over his sadness and loneliness, expressed in the minor melody from the beginning. The whole piece is based on this [...] "Elgar theme", in which the Beethoven theme is hidden (and so the latter [...] "goes through and over the whole set, but is not played"). Although Elgar had told Dora Penny in private about the Beethoven story and the Pathétique theme behind the Jaeger/Nimrod-variation (see above, Var. IX) she could not solve the enigma because she did not see the connection between this and the enigma. Elgar had expected she would: [...] "I'm surprised.

2500|$|Jesus {{told his}} apostles that {{after his death}} and resurrection he would send them the [...] "Advocate" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ), the [...] "Holy Spirit", who [...] "will teach you {{everything}} and remind <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> that I told you". In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells his disciples [...] "If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!" [...] The Nicene Creed states that the Holy Spirit is one with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus); thus, for Catholics, receiving the Holy Spirit is receiving God, {{the source of all}} that is good. Catholics formally ask for and receive the Holy Spirit through the sacrament of Confirmation (Chrismation). Sometimes called the sacrament of Christian maturity, Confirmation is believed to bring an increase and deepening of the grace received at Baptism. Spiritual graces or gifts of the Holy Spirit can include wisdom to see and follow God's plan, right judgment, love for others, courage in witnessing the faith, knowledge, reverence, and rejoicing in the presence of God. The corresponding fruits of the Holy Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. To be validly confirmed, a person must be in a state of grace, which means that they cannot be conscious of having committed a mortal sin. They must also have prepared spiritually for the sacrament, chosen a sponsor or godparent for spiritual support, and selected a saint to be their special patron and intercessor.|$|E
