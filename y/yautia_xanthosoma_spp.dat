This research is aimed: (i) {{to know the}} variety of kimpul (<b>Xanthosoma</b> <b>spp.)</b> based on morphological characteristics and isozymes analysis; (ii) to know the correlation between its genetic space based on morphological characteristics and its genetic resemblance based on isozymes-banding pattern. This research results were analyzed and described by descriptive qualitative methods. Morphological observation {{was carried out in}} sub-District of Galur, Lendah and Girimulyo, Kulonprogo District, Yogyakarta. Morphological data of the kimpul plant was explored descriptively and then made dendogram. Data of isozymic banding pattern were analyzed quantitatively based on the appearance of the band on the gel, and qualitatively based on the thickness of the band formed, and then made dendogram. The correlation, between its genetic distance based on morphological characteristics and its genetic resemblance based on isozymes-banding pattern, were then analyzed grounded on coefficient correlation between product- moment and goodness of it criteria based on correlation. The results pointed out that morphologically, on eight observed samples which were consist of four different types (species), each Xanthosoma from different locations did not indicate obvious differences. Esterase was formed four different banding-patterns, Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase indicated eight different banding-patterns, and Peroxidase indicated seven different banding-patterns.

This work was developed {{with the aim}} of determining the effect of the planting material type on the incidence of dry rot in two cultivars of Colocasia and Xanthosoma genera. Primary and secondary rhizomes, crowns of primary rhizomes and in vitro plants were used. The plantation was maintained for twelve months and the plants were characterized morphologically in the growing stage. Besides, it was determined the incidence of dry rot per treatment at growing and harvest stage. Finally, the yield was determined. When in vitro plants were used the percentage of incidence and intensity of the damage of dry rot was less in both cultivars. The yield in primary rhizomes and overall was significantly higher. The results indicated the superiority of in vitro plants as initial plantation material over the traditional seed used in taro culture.

One {{of the most}} important measures to prevent it is the use of “in vitro” plants free of fungi. In this research was studied the incorporation of several natural and biological products in the plots employed to acclimatize the “invitro” plants. Were evaluated: Trichoderma harzianum, Chitosan, and lobster shell (Panulirus argus (Latreille)) and as control Mancozeb. The taro cultivars employed were Blanca INIVIT and Blanca Venegas, considerate as intermediated and susceptible respectively. Each plot was inoculated with propagules of Sclerotium rolsfii (Sacc.). In order to infer the action mechanism was conducted susceptible tests under “in vitro” conditions. The results showed that the most susceptible cultivar was Blanca Venegas. All treatments decrease the incidence of dry rot, among these. T. harzianum produced the highest effect, antagonist capacity and antagonist effect type.

40|$|Cocoyam (<b>Xanthosoma</b> <b>spp.),</b> {{the third}} most {{important}} starch food crop in Nicaragua, can be cultivated countrywide. However, very little information about the field performance and genetic background of the different genotypes is available. In this study, the agronomic performance of three purple genotypes established in four locations with different climatic conditions, were evaluated during 2 years. Phenotypic characteristics, yield, and virus incidence were assessed and the time at which the different genotypes reached their physiological maturity was estimated. The trials were based on randomized complete block design {{with three or four}} blocks. Genotype × location interaction was found both for phenotypic and yield traits. A differential response of the genotypes to the varying climatic conditions at the locations is suggested {{to be one of the}} causes to the interaction. The unpredictable and variable climate in the area where cocoyam traditionally has been grown is one possible explanation to the frequent genotype × year interaction at that location. Other locations with more stable climate only showed an interaction between genotype and year in a few traits. The genotypic differences regarding the time when the area of the largest leaf reached its maximum and the variation in presence of sprouts and roots on the cormels at harvest, indicate differences in optimal harvest time between genotypes. The percentage of plants infected with dasheen mosaic virus (DMV) differed across locations but not between genotypes...|$|R
40|$|The functional, {{particle}} size distribution and sorption kinetics of cocoyam cormels were investigated to reveal their suitability in food systems and storage stability. Four cultivars of cocoyam cormel were harvested processed into flour and the resultant flours investigated for the functional, {{particle size}} distribution and sorption isotherm. The Ede ofe of the Colocasia spp. had highest crude protein content (9. 72 %), followed by Ede ocha, <b>Xanthosoma</b> <b>spp,</b> (8. 13 %) while Ede cocoindia had the least, 7. 93 %. These values are higher than are obtainable in other root crops such as yam or cassava. Ede uhie had proportional distribution {{than the rest of}} the cultivers. Ede uhie had the highest value for viscosity, 0. 246 cp while Ede cocoindia had the least, 0. 089 cp. Ede cocoindia had the highest water absorption capacity, 2. 410 g/g, followed by Ede ofe, 2. 195 g/g while Ede uhie scored the least, 2. 082 g/g. The bulk density of Ede ofe was highest, 0. 95 g/cm 3 while Ede uhie had the least score, 0. 76 g/cm 3. The sorption isotherm study revealed that relative humidity in the neighborhoods of 65 - 70 % would be ideal for storage of the flours in moisture tight package materials. Monolayer values ranged from 0. 0367 - 0. 0787 gH 2 O/g solid which suggest better storage stability of the flour when store at ambient temperature, 30 o C. Going by the data obtained cormel flours from the Xanthosoma species can be used as a composite in bread making while their Colocasia counterparts would perform better in emulsion food system...|$|R
40|$|Cocoyam, <b>Xanthosoma</b> <b>spp.,</b> is {{cultivated}} in tropical regions {{as a source}} of carbohydrates for human nutrition, for animal feed, and cash income for the farmers. It is the most important export crop of all the root and tuber crops grown in Nicaragua, but the national yield and total planted area have drastically decreased during the last few years. The crop has received little research attention, and previous to the studies presented in this thesis there was hardly any information available regarding the number of genotypes {{cultivated in}} the country, the agronomic performance of the different genotypes, which diseases that infect the crop, and to what extent these diseases influence the yield. Three cocoyam genotypes were evaluated regarding agronomic traits in four field locations during two years. Significant interactions between genotype and location as well as between genotype and year were found for many of the traits. A differential response of the genotypes to the varying climatic conditions at the locations is one of the possible causes of these interactions. Different harvest times for the three genotypes are suggested, due to differences in time to reach the maximum growth. Dasheen mosaic virus (DsMV) is the most important virus that infects cocoyam. Virus-free plants were produced through meristem culture, and protocols for the regeneration of plants via callus and protocorm-like structures were established. Although a genotypic response to tissue culture was observed, all the tested genotypes produced shoots from meristem and from meristem-derived calli. Under field conditions the virus-free plants performed better, regarding yield, than infected in vitro plants. The fact that the plants were virus-free could not, by itself, explain the yield increase, suggesting that the process of in vitro re-invigoration also played an important role. Aphis gossypii was the only winged aphid observed during the field trial, suggesting that this insect is the virus-transmitting vector. cDNA fragments containing the coat protein (CP) and 3 ’-UTR regions of nine DsMV isolates were molecularly characterised. One isolate had a 19 aa long deletion in the N-terminus of the CP region. The Nicaraguan isolates formed two subgroups correlated with geographic origin of the cocoyam genotypes.

40|$|Rooted in culture, taro is both eaten and exalted in the Pacific, and dished {{up in the}} Caribbean and Africa too. Is {{its future}} {{precarious}} or promising? If you were a taro an oval tuber of 1 to 3 kg and under-flowing with confidence, you might well think {{that the world was}} trying to talk you into believing that you had a serious personality disorder. On the one hand, at least in the Pacific, you are revered by all the people you grow amongst. When you are served up at mealtimes, everyone present is bound to cease whatever hostilities they were pursuing. You feature in traditional medicine and on coins in Samoa and Tonga; you might end up on a national flag one day. You rank 14 th worldwide among staple crops. In Hawaii, you are so important that only men may grow you. In Cameroon, where the women do the growing and the cooking, you are the centre of a complex serving ritual, and are used as a way to catch your man. Something for everyone. But. You are on the list of the world s most under-utilised crops though you could regard that more as a challenge than a put-me-down. Your starchy flesh is toxic, to an irritating level, unless well cooked. You are perishable and store for a week, no more. You are susceptible to leaf blight, and to removal from entire nations fields and plates if resistance is not improved. Some people regard you as poor people s food. And after a brief flirtation in the 1990 s with the yuppie markets in Europe and North America, only the ethnic and diaspora markets stay true to you. More than meets the eye Chin up, taro, it s time, quite literally, to turn a new leaf. A root crop, Colocasia esculenta originated in Asia where it is widely known as taro a name that has spread across the world. Normally small and round, the Caribbean variety is longer, known as dasheen, from the French chou de chine, or Chinese cabbage, and the tubers are known as as eddo or malanga. As a member of the calla lily family, its leaves are cooked as greens; when served as callaloo in Trinidad or Jamaica, it attains the worship-level of a national dish. In West Africa, where the tubers are mashed with cassava as fufu, it is a staple in Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria. It shares the name cocoyam with its relation <b>Xanthosoma</b> <b>spp</b> also known as macabo or tannia. Grown in 30 countries, either in flooded wetlands or in uplands, the bulk of taro production is in Africa. Nigeria accounts for almost half of the world s production of 8. 5 million t. Other major producers in sub-Saharan Africa are Ghana, Côte d Ivoire, Madagascar and the Central African Republic. After Africa comes Asia, where China is the main producer, followed by Japan, the Philippines and Thailand. The heart of the diet With production at 300, 000 t, Oceania is outshone by all other regions except the Caribbean but only in volume. For the general shine of taro is brightest right here among the nations and territories of the Pacific. Says FAO, 'no other part of the world can match Oceania in terms of the intensity of production, utilisation and dependence on taro for food'. In Tonga, where tubers represent almost half the nation s intake of dietary calories, about 40 % of them come from taro. In Solomon Islands, about 10 % of people s dietary calories come from taro, 30 % from other tubers. It is in Samoa that the central role of taro is best expressed. Prior to a devastating spread of taro leaf blight in 1993, virtually all the population s dietary intake from tubers (one-fifth of the overall diet) came from taro. The overnight removal of taro from household menus, and the prohibition of even modest exports to Samoans in Australia, New Zealand and California, was a great shock to the nation s psyche, diet and economy in short, to its identity. That shock made many Pacific nations realise their vulnerability to leaf blight, and to re-focus on a crop that they had perhaps taken for granted. Given its sometimes spiritual attributes, one observer mused, maybe taro was a Pacific person s tenth chakra a person s hub of energy. In healthy moderation After the blight, the new impulse. Through the TaroGen programme, set up in 1998 at the Fiji office of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, advances {{have been made in the}} management, deployment and use of genetic diversity. The crop has bounced back in Samoa after farmers planted specially-bred disease-resistant varieties. Although more research is needed to maintain diversity and resistance, it must be accompanied by improved availability of resistant planting materials and seeds as much a question of organisation as research breakthroughs. Researchers are now focussing on DNA fingerprinting of taro varieties for the accurate comparison of accessions between countries. Another focus is on virus indexing procedures, to overcome quarantine concerns in international exchanges of taro germplasm. The establishment and maintenance of genebanks for in vitro storage remains a priority, but more attention is now going to seed storage systems and on-farm conservation. According to TaroGen, this will 'involve farming communities in research and development and combine social, biological and agroecological aspects involved in taro cultivation'. This perennial issue of good understanding between farmer and researcher is high on the agenda of the Third Taro Symposium, scheduled for late May 2003 in Fiji. But in a world of changing tastes, can taro become a more tradable commodity as well as being a cultural icon and an essential part of the diet of many Pacific nations? Improvements in quality, standards, marketing, new products, industrial processing techniques and storage will all help to pull one of the most ancient of crops into a new era, without pulling out its roots. Chips, powders, flours, cakes, biscuits, ice-creams banal enough, but power food in a way. Power for a people. Power for a plant.
