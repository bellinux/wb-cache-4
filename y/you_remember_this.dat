[...] And then without caring who else heard me, I burst out with: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't," [...] he said. [...] "You have {{no right}} to recoil from the mention of my love for <b>you.</b> <b>Remember</b> <b>this</b> is a man-talk.

[...] "I am a being that sprung up, like this flower, out of a grave; or, at least, I took root in a grave, and, growing there, have twined about your life, until you cannot {{possibly}} escape from me. Ah, Septimius! you know me not. You know not what is in my heart towards you. Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> broken miniature? would you wish to see the features that were destroyed when that bullet passed? Then look at mine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you--thank you," [...] she replied; [...] "your voice {{does not}} ring the cuckoo chime of compliment, but speaks {{like that of}} one who knows to what he pledges himself. If--but it is impossible--but yet, if an {{opportunity}} should occur, I will ask you if <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> promise; and I assure you, I shall not be angry if I find you have forgotten it, for it is enough that you are sincere in your intentions just now--much may occur to alter them ere I call upon you, should that moment ever come, to assist Die Vernon, {{as if you were}} Die Vernon's brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{believe we}} shall find it far easier than you think. I'm {{not quite a}} beggar--except for you, my Lena. I should like to go home this minute, and tell mother and Charlie and Rose, that I'm--I'm {{treading}} on air; but I should only be fallen upon for thinking of anything but my task-work. So I'll take a leaf out of your book, you cautious Lenore, and wait till I come down victorious, happy and glorious--and I shall now. I {{feel as if you}} had given me power to scale Olympus, now I know I may carry your heart with me. Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this,</b> Lena?" [...] He guided her hand to the smooth pebble on his chain. She responded by putting her own into his.|$|E

60|$|Having {{given you}} that little {{illustration}} {{with respect to}} the weight of the air, let me shew you certain consequences of it. You have a right to them, because you would not understand so much without it. Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> kind of experiment? Have you ever seen it? Suppose I take a pump somewhat similar to the one I had a little while ago to force air into the bottle, and suppose I place it in such a manner that by certain arrangements I can apply my hand to it: my hand moves about in the air so easily that it seems to feel nothing, and I can hardly get velocity enough by any motion of my own in the atmosphere {{to make sure that there}} is much resistance to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't leave me, Robert," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have not}} told you all. Don't <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> breastpin?" [...] {{unfastening}} the large silver brooch from her shawl and holding {{it out to}} him. [...] "You gave it to me, Robert; there were almost tears of joy in {{your eyes on the}} first day I wore it, although I was careful to let you know it meant nothing. Where are those tears to-day, Robert? It means something now. I have kept it all these years, although in the lifetime of Mr Keswick it was never cleaned, and I wore it to-day, Robert, that your eyes might rest upon it once again, and that you might speak to me the words you spoke to me the day after I let you pin it on my white neckerchief. You waited then, Robert, a whole day before you spoke, but you needn't wait now. Let your heart speak out, dear Robert." ...|$|E
6000|$|And I {{dare say}} <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> {{was just what}} your mother had often said to himself; and did say the day she went out and cried on the kitchen steps {{in order to make}} Talolo ashamed. But Iopu gave it all out as little new discoveries of his own. The last thing was the cows, and I tell you he was solemn about the cows. They were all destroyed, he said, nobody knew how to milk except himself--where he is about right. Then came dinner and a {{delightful}} little surprise. Perhaps you remember that long ago I used not to eat mashed potatoes, but had always two or three boiled in a plate. This has not been done for months, because Talolo makes such admirable mashed potatoes that I have caved in. But here came dinner, mashed potatoes for your mother and the Tamaitai, and then boiled potatoes in a plate for me! ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'My friends,' said I, {{drawing to}} the table, {{at which they}} were by this time seated in their usual chairs, 'do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>this</b> story bore another title besides that one we have so often heard of late?' ...|$|R
6000|$|First, {{as perhaps}} <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>this</b> {{is the place}} where the bills were [...] "lost" [...] for a week or two. The {{consequence}} has been that the agent could not announce all through the [...] "Jenny Lind" [...] time (the most important for announcing), and could but stand still and stare when people came to ask what I was going to read. Last night I read [...] "Copperfield" [...] to the most enthusiastic and appreciative audience imaginable, but in numbers about half what they might have been. To-night we shall have a famous house; but we might have had it last night too. To-morrow (knowing by this time what can, of a certainty, be done with [...] "Copperfield"), I had, of course, given out [...] "Copperfield" [...] to be read again. Conceive my amazement and dismay when I find the printer to have announced [...] "Little Dombey"!!! This, I declare, I had no more intention of reading than I had of reading an account of the solar system. And this, after a sensation last night, of a really extraordinary nature in its intensity and delight! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis a pity {{you could}} not have kept your eyes off my paper, madam," [...] said Mr. Washington. [...] "You will permit me to say so. A great deal of {{mischief}} has come because I chose to keep a secret which concerned only myself and another person. For a long time George Warrington's heart has been black with anger against me, and my feeling towards him has, I own, scarce been more friendly. All this pain might have been spared to both of us, had my private papers only been read by those for whom they were written. I shall say no more now, lest my feelings again should betray me into hasty words. Heaven bless thee, Harry! Farewell, George! And take a true friend's advice, and try and be less ready to think evil of your friends. We shall meet again at the camp, and will keep our weapons for the enemy. Gentlemen! if <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> scene to-morrow, you will {{know where to find}} me." [...] And with a very stately bow to the English officers, the Colonel left the abashed company, and speedily rode away.|$|E
6000|$|The {{conversation}} was chiefly {{with him as}} they went. He told her much now of the how, and the when, and the where. He hoped there might be no long delay. He would live, he said, {{for the next year}} or two at Aldershot, and would be able to get a house fit for her on condition that they should be married at once. He did not explain why the house could not be taken even though their marriage were delayed two or three months,--but as to this she asked no questions. Of course they must be married in London if Mrs. Dosett wished it; but if not it might be arranged that the wedding should take place at Stalham. Upon all this and many other things he had much to propose, and all that he said Ayala accepted as gospel. As the Angel of Light had appeared,--as the knight who was lord of the castle had come forth,--of course he must be obeyed in everything. He could hardly have made a suggestion to which she would not have acceded. When they had entered the wood Ayala in her own quiet way led him to the very spot in which on that former day he had asked her his question. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> path?" [...] she asked.|$|E
5000|$|He {{may have}} used {{the name of a}} {{character}} from the novel <b>You</b> Must <b>Remember</b> <b>This,</b> authored by Joyce Carol Oates. In the story, the character who bore the same name, though spelled as [...] "Stevick," [...] tried to commit suicide.|$|R
6000|$|... "Berners," [...] he said, [...] "I want <b>you</b> to <b>remember</b> <b>this.</b> If {{they land}} {{here and you}} see {{anything}} of them, will you have the goodness to understand that I am Mr. Andrew, fisherman, and that you are my lodger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{considerably}} {{older than}} you," [...] he went on, [...] "and I have {{the future of}} St. John's very much at heart, Mr. Hodder. I trust <b>you</b> will <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> and make allowances for it as I talk to you.|$|R
