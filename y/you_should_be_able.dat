500|$|Roper {{said that}} {{there were a couple of}} puzzles [...] "that seemed a little rough around the edges and whose {{otherwise}} straightforward solution suffered a bit from imperfect implementation." [...] He also criticized the difficulty of unlocking some of the bonus content, as some requirements are [...] "punishingly hard for most everyone." [...] Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, they are based on [...] "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, [...] "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." [...] Navarro said that at times, the combat is [...] "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," [...] and said that it was [...] "a bit disappointing" [...] that more was not done to the combat system.

However, he felt that he [...] "brought warmth, wit and promise" [...] and a [...] "formidable presence". Kelly believed that Eccleston was believable as a man who had destroyed two civilisations and was dealing with the repercussions and could have brought more to the show had Eccleston stayed for a second series. Seventh Doctor actor Sylvester McCoy praised Eccleston as being [...] "quite alien" [...] as the Doctor and that [...] "we were not sure if he was on the edge of insanity or not, which was rather good."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Online, King said that the sixth season [...] "is about answers and closure for all of them. It is an ending to the story that we started so long ago, but it's a very fast-paced ending to the story." [...] As a regard to the first 10 episodes of the season, executive producer Joseph Dougherty said that they [...] "are {{going to be like}} nothing that's ever happened before on this series.
