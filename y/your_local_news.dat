40|$|In local communities, the civically engaged – {{the people}} who vote, {{volunteer}} and connect with those around them – {{play a key role}} in community life. Thus, how and to what degree they stay informed about their communities carries added weight. A new study by Pew Research Center in association with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation reveals that, overall, the civically engaged are indeed more likely than the less engaged to use and value <b>local</b> <b>news.</b> But two particular aspects of civic engagement stand out as most closely associated with <b>local</b> <b>news</b> habits: a strong connection to one’s community and always voting in local elections. Americans with one of these two attributes, the study finds, consistently display stronger <b>local</b> <b>news</b> habits across a range of measures: news interest, news intake (the number and types of sources they turn to) and news attitudes – their views of <b>local</b> <b>news</b> organizations. This report focuses on five ways the public can connect to civic life and compares the <b>local</b> <b>news</b> habits of Americans who engage in each with those who do not. While these civic factors and news habits are related to each other, the data do not indicate the extent to which there is a causal relationship. In other words, the study does not point to whether civic engagement triggers <b>local</b> <b>news</b> interest, intake or more positive attitudes about <b>local</b> <b>news</b> media, or whether it is, in fact, the reverse...|$|R
