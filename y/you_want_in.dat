25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell Me What <b>You</b> <b>Want!</b> <b>in</b> 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell Me What You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E

Although the Daughters of Bilitis did take a political {{stand in the}} 1959 San Francisco mayoral race, Martin and Lyon preferred The Ladder to remain apolitical. Gittings was impressed with how her influence as editor impacted the magazine and the opinions of its readers.

He also received {{an offer from}} West Ham United, who were in a higher division, but he rejected this because he felt his first team opportunities would be greater at Charlton. Primus was playing in various positions until the club's youth team coach, Colin Clarke, decided that he should play as a centre back, [...] "I see you as a centre back, that way you can see everything <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>in</b> front of you".|$|E

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5-star rating, but noted: [...] "While the rarity value of this music certainly makes it interesting, the music itself is pretty average, with the dreck outweighing the good stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Libby is {{a mysterious}} {{character}}, {{seated at the}} tail-section of the plane. Her character was written {{to be in her}} late forties to early fifties, easy on the eyes, amicably maladjusted, and a compulsive liar so good at what she does, most people will not know she is not what she seems. Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters. She's that person <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>in</b> the trenches with you who can take lemons and make lemonade." ...|$|E

Fewer!". Wilders' response was [...] "Then we'll fix it!". This action led several PVV representatives to resign, among whom two of the party's members of Parliament (Roland van Vliet and Joram van Klaveren), the party's leader in the European Parliament (Laurence Stassen), and a number of its provincial legislators and municipal councillors. Many politicians denounced what happened. In response, a number of young Moroccans launched a social media campaign called 'Born here', in which they posted pictures of themselves alongside their Dutch passports.|$|E

Affleck starred opposite Sandra Bullock in the romantic comedy Forces of Nature (1999), playing a groom whose {{attempts to get}} to his wedding are complicated by his free-spirited traveling companion. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly remarked that Affleck [...] "has the fast-break charm <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>in</b> a screwball hero," [...] while Joe Leydon of Variety praised [...] "his winning ability to play against his good looks in a self-effacing comic turn". Affleck then appeared opposite Courtney Love in the little-seen ensemble comedy 200 Cigarettes (1999).|$|E

[...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E

He played two seasons at Claremont—1973 and 1974—alternating between the under-21 and the reserve teams, but did not manage to make the senior team.

2500|$|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe says, [...] "Treat {{people as}} they were {{that they ought to}} be and you may help them to become what they are capable of being". As a leader, there are two qualities that you need to focus on in an organization: the {{structure}} of the organization and how followers are involved. The type of leadership <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>in</b> an organization would be a democratic approach. A democratic leader does not feel threatened when followers make suggestions, but instead accepts the contributions to help improve the overall quality of decision-making. Having a democratic system allows for the followers to set goals for the organization, and this creates two-way communication that openly flows between the leader and followers. The leader wants to have more interaction with the followers. Through interaction it allows followers to be engaged in the organization, but they also have a higher participation rate. The democratic style of leadership communication is often most effective. Generally, the benefits derived from democratic communication far outweigh any potential cost.|$|E
