[...] The letter, signed by six prominent GOP women, including {{a state senator}} and state representative, called on Franken to apologize for what they {{referred to as a}} [...] "demeaning and degrading" [...] article. His campaign spokesman responded that [...] "Al had a long career as a satirist.

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN {{gave the}} game 9.0 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice Award, praising the game's [...] "pure {{over-the-top}} driving entertainment. The cars and environments are gorgeous, the crashes are spectacular, {{and the new}} Autolog feature breathes {{new life into the}} time-honored tradition of video game competition among friends." [...] Eurogamer gave the game 9 out of 10. Reviewer Tom Bramwell said [...] "It's stuffed with content but rarely for the sake of it, and knowing Criterion it will be handsomely supported for months to come, even though it's already the best pure arcade racing game since Burnout Paradise." [...] GameTrailers also scored the game 9 out of 10. The reviewer stated Hot Pursuit was [...] "excellently crafted, letting you take the world's fastest cars across miles of stunning landscapes. Chases are exhilarating from either perspective, and the autolog feature completely changes how you compete with friends, keeping you hooked until you've wrecked all of their scores." [...] Destructoid gave the game 9.5 out of 10. Reviewer Nick Chester noted that [...] "it delivers a near-perfect competitive experience, in a way that few games - racing or otherwise - can. Hot Pursuit is not only a defining moment for the series, but for arcade-style racing, period." [...] Reviewer Randy Nelson of Joystiq was the second reviewer to give the game a perfect score of 10/10. Reviewer Chris Antista of GamesRadar also gave the game 10 out of 10. Chris stated that [...] "with so many modes and diverse rewards to uncover in Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, it almost feels like 2.5 games in one package." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Brett Bates gave the game 9.0 out of 10, which felt much the same as GamesRadar's Chris Antista, stating [...] "In effect, you're getting two games in one: What <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> a racer has no bearing on what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> a cop." ...|$|E
