[...] They expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, cello and other strings, glockenspiel and electronic effects. The exploratory approach was summarised by Jonny Greenwood as [...] "when we've got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they're gonna play on it." [...] One reviewer characterised OK Computer as sounding like [...] "a DIY electronica album made with guitars".|$|E

The stump speech is hard to resist, especially when set to an arrangement that follows the lineage of hit midtempo ballads [...] "With You", and [...] "Irreplaceable". Although the lyrics are generic, Bieber's smooth delivery is right on point, and his tender vocals blend well with the song's easy-flowing beat." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song along with [...] "Down to Earth", [...] "uncomplicatedly beautiful and earnest."

[...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend.

His emotional life has been pulled in so many different directions. He's so incredibly confused." [...] Actor James Faulkner was cast in the role of Randyll, with Samantha Spiro portraying Samwell's mother and Freddie Stroma and Rebecca Benson portraying Samwell's brother Dickon and sister Talla.|$|E
500|$|Dreaming of Yous U.S. {{release date}} was {{confirmed}} on June 10, 1995 to be July 18 that year.

According to Heather Phares of Allmusic, the song [...] "has a silky verse melody that just barely conceals [...] spite", while she keeps [...] "her revenge sweet, the extra sting being given to it {{by the way she}} sounds like she's singing about how ice cream or puppies or being in love makes her smile". Blender reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen [...] "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called [...] "Smile" [...] an [...] "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When <b>you</b> <b>first</b> left me / I was wanting more / But you were fucking that girl next door / What you do that for?,'" [...] and {{went on to say that}} the theme of the song is melancholy, [...] "set against breezy beats", and while not being [...] "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, [...] is good but far from one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer [...] "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a [...] "breezy sha-la-la lilt that just made the song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a [...] "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that [...] "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," [...] while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she [...] "sings without a smirk of irony", is a UK chart-topper.|$|E
