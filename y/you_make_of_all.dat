Until recently, organizations have been limited to using subsets of their data, or they were constrained to simplistic analyses because the sheer volumes of data overwhelmed their processing platforms. But, {{what is the point of}} collecting and storing terabytes of data if you can't analyze it in full context, or if you have to wait hours or days to get results? On the other hand, not all business questions are better answered by bigger data. How can <b>you</b> <b>make</b> the most <b>of</b> <b>all</b> that data, now and in the future? It is a twofold proposition. You can only optimize your success if you weave analytics into your solution. But you also need analytics to help you manage the data itself. There are several key technologies that can help you get a handle on your big data, and more importantly, extract meaningful value from it. ...|$|R

6000|$|There {{were even}} some Greek {{officers}} and counselors {{in the family}} and court of Darius.

[...] "Perhaps," [...] said Charidemus, [...] "you may not be pleased with my speaking to you plainly, but if I do not do it now, it will be too late hereafter. This great parade and pomp, and this enormous multitude of men, might be formidable to your Asiatic neighbors; but such sort of preparation will be of little avail against Alexander and his Greeks. Your army is resplendent with purple and gold. No one who had not seen it could conceive of its magnificence; but it will not be of any avail against the terrible energy of the Greeks. Their minds are bent on something very different from idle show. They are intent on securing the substantial excellence of their weapons, and on acquiring the discipline and the hardihood essential for the most efficient use of them. They will despise <b>all</b> your parade <b>of</b> purple and gold. They will not even value it as plunder. They glory in their ability to dispense with all the luxuries and conveniences of life. They live upon the coarsest food. At night they sleep upon the bare ground. By day they are always on the march.

6000|$|Now it was fated that my Lord Duke Marino was to {{have his}} head cut off. And as it is {{necessary}} when any effect is to be brought about, {{that the cause of}} such effect must happen, it therefore came to pass, that on the very day after sentence had been pronounced on Ser Michele Steno, being the first day of Lent, a gentleman of the house of Barbara, a choleric gentleman, went to the arsenal, and required certain things of the masters of the galleys. This he did {{in the presence of the}} Admiral of the arsenal, and he, bearing the request, answered, No, it cannot be done. High words arose between the gentleman and the Admiral, and the gentleman struck him with his fist just above the eye; and as he happened to have a ring on his finger, the ring cut the Admiral and drew blood. The Admiral, all bruised and bloody, ran straight to the Duke to complain, and with the intent of praying him to inflict some heavy punishment upon the gentleman of Cà Barbaro.--"What wouldst thou have me do for thee?" [...] answered the Duke: [...] "think upon the shameful gibe which hath been written concerning me; and think on the manner in which they have punished that ribald Michele Steno, who wrote it; and see how the Council of Forty respect our person."--Upon this the Admiral answered, [...] "My Lord Duke, if you would wish to make yourself a prince, and to cut all those cuckoldy gentlemen to pieces, I have the heart, if you do but help me, to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> prince <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this state; and then you may punish them all."

For finding Charles, Count of Anjou, brother of the King Louis, he said to Raymond, [...] "'Give her now to him, for his fate is to be the best man in the world,'--prophesying of him. And so it was done. And after all this it came to pass, by envy which ruins all good, that the barons of Provence became jealous of the good romeo, and accused him to the Count of having ill-guided his goods, and made Raymond demand account of them. Then the good romeo said, 'Count, I have served thee long, and have put thee from little state into mighty, and for this, by false counsel of thy people, thou art little grateful. I came into thy court a poor romeo; I have lived honestly on thy means; now, make to be given to me my little mule and my staff and my wallet, as I came, and I will <b>make</b> <b>thee</b> quit <b>of</b> <b>all</b> my service.'

40|$|The latest {{events in}} the Arabian world, the {{sequence}} of people’s marches demanding democratic changes, made the question of command economies economic efficiency pressing again. If <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a list <b>of</b> <b>all</b> countries <b>of</b> the world and range them by income per capita, it will turn out that the decisive mark is not presence of mineral resources, size of the territory, population, geographical location, or {{the popularity of the}} government. A country’s place will depend on the level of political and economic freedoms. There is not a single exception here. Argentina, Australia, South Korea, Cuba, the USA, Mozambique, Congo and Germany hold their places only in accordance with presence or absence of certain freedoms in their territories. If far {{from the top of the}} list you spot a country, in which, at the first glance, there seem to be private property and political freedoms present, look for red flags signaling of certain limitations. These may be limitations for land and minerals private ownership, extensive licensing for various activities, orders, regulations, instructions and lots more. These countries’ economic and political fields are covered with restricted areas enclosed with high or not very high fences, sometimes of barbed wire, entrance to which is prohibited for all or is limited to a handful of chosen ones. The list of countries remains fairly stable, but sometimes dizzying leaps down or to the top occur. An example of an unusual leap was shown a few decades ago by Ireland. 25 years ago Ireland was one of the poorest countries in Europe, in 1987 its GDP per capita was almost twice as little as the indexes of the Great Britain. But then the “Celtic Tiger” made such a head-turning leap that many still cannot come round. In 1990 ies it not just caught up but left behind both Great Britain and Germany. The main driving force of the powerful growth was the increase of economic freedom level and general deregulation of the economy. ...|$|R
