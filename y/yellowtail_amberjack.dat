25|$|Amberjacks are a {{group of}} nine species {{belonging}} to the genus Seriola within the family Carangidae. Mainly open water fish, they can follow small forage fish into estuaries and enclosed waters, where they will also hunt for crustaceans. Amberjacks are fast swimming and aggressive predators that often hunt in schools around offshore reefs. the <b>yellowtail</b> <b>amberjack</b> can reach 1.8 metres in length and weigh 60 kilograms.|$|E
50|$|Almaco jack (Seriola rivoliana) is a {{game fish}} of the family Carangidae; {{they are in the}} same family as <b>yellowtail</b> and <b>amberjack.</b> They feed, both day and night, on other smaller fish such as baitfish and small squid. The flesh is thick and dense like tuna and can easily pass for white {{albacore}} if prepared as sushi.|$|R

One of the major attractions introduced on May 24, 2006 is Gastón, a 3 m, 100 kg male sand shark (Carcharias taurus) from the Océanopolis aquarium in Brest, France. With him lives a female sand shark named Hermosa.|$|R
5000|$|For culinary, sanitary, and {{aesthetic}} reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish {{to be eaten}} raw must be superior to that of fish {{which is to be}} cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese <b>amberjack,</b> <b>yellowtail</b> (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of ōtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning [...] "middle toro", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw neta.|$|R

40|$|Two hundred {{nineteen}} {{strains of}} causative organisms of fish vibriosis, which were isolated from {{various kinds of}} diseased fish cultured {{from all over the}} country, and 29 reference strains were examined by means of ordinary taxonomy, numerical taxonomy, DNA base composition and serological analysis. One hundred and seventy strains (phenon I, see Fig. 1) isolated from coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), ayu (Pleocoglossus altivelis), eel (Anguilla spp.), yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) and amberjack (Seriola purpurascens) were identified as V. anguillarum. Twenty five strains (phenon II, see Fig. 1) were not identified as V. anguillarum, but were closely related to above taxon in many characteristics. These strains were isolated from rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii), yamabe (O. masou var. ishikawae) and amago (O. rhodurus var. macrostomus) reared in fresh water. Twenty one strains isolated from ayu, yellowtail, red sea bream (Chrysophrys major) and anchovy (Engraulis Japonica) could not be identified as any species in genus Vibrio, and many differences were observed among them. The other 3 strains isolated from rainbow trout and ayu were identified as Aeromonas spp. One hundred and ninety two strains out of 195 strains identified as V. anguillarum and its related organisms (phenon I and II), were distinguished into three serological groups according to the serological analysis of the somatic antigens. Serotype J-O- 1 was comprised of 100 strains of V. anguillarum and 25 strains related to the species. One hundred and ten strains out of the above 125 strains were originally isolated from ayu, eel, rainbow trout, amago and yamabe reared in fresh water. Serotype J-O- 2 was comprised of 11 strains isolated from ayu and eel reared in fresh or salt water Serotype J-O- 3 was comprised of 56 strains isolated from ayu, coho salmon, <b>yellowtail</b> and <b>amberjack.</b> Except the 10 strains from ayu in fresh water, 46 strains were isolated from the fish reared in sea water...|$|R

40|$|The Pacific {{yellowtail}} Seriola rivoliana {{belongs to}} the Carangidae family of fishes, along with several other species commonly cultures in Japan such as the <b>yellowtail</b> (Seriola quinqueradiata), <b>Amberjack</b> (Seriola dumerili) and striped Jack (Caranx delicatissimus). These species represent an important resource for recreational and commercial interests worldwide. Among other attributes, yellowtail is being targeted as an aquaculture species due their fast growth, excellent flesh quality and significant market opportunities internationally. In Ecuador some preliminary works have been conducted to produce the specie in captivity. To date it established a breeding population of captive Pacific yellowtail which spawn spontaneously and provide eggs {{on a daily basis}} during the spawning season. In spite of the resulting larval stages have been considered the bottleneck; the juvenile stages have been reared successfully on grown to 1 kg in 6 months. This work describes the most important considerations of rearing Pacific yellowtail larvae and juveniles in adapted shrimp production systems. In this point, the paper mentions extensively the basic rearing techniques and information of Seriola sp. biology; likewise, it identifies the specific technology requirements to commercial S. rivoliana aquaculture. In the other hand, some economic considerations are discussed to be able to operate under the reviewed culture conditions. All of this in order to provide an overall analysis about the attractive financial returns on invested capital...|$|R

50|$|The fish often schools. In some areas, the {{juvenile}} is often found with the jellyfish Chrysaora lactea, {{with which it}} can find protection from predators. Several juveniles at once may shelter {{under the umbrella of}} the jellyfish, where they may be protected by the tentacles, or hide behind the umbrella, using it as a shield. When away from the jellyfish, it is sometimes eaten by the comb grouper (Mycteroperca acutirostris). The grouper is known to follow the jellyfish, waiting for the scads to come out.

5000|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} species of micronekton in the California Current, Pleuroncodes planipes fills an important ecological niche converting primary production into energy that larger organisms can use. P. planipes is accordingly an important food item for many species of birds, marine mammals and fish. It is favoured by tuna, leading {{to one of the}} species' common names - [...] "tuna crab". Other fish known to feed on P. planipes include billfishes, <b>yellowtail</b> <b>amberjack,</b> sharks and Epinephelus analogus. The diets of gray whales, Bryde's whales, blue whales and sea otters all include P. planipes. The Mexican endemic bat Myotis vivesi also feeds on P. planipes at some times of the year. Off Baja California, the stomachs of some loggerhead sea turtles have been observed to contain only P. planipes. Since P. planipes may be washed ashore in large numbers, it can be a valuable addition to the diets of seabirds such as the herring gull (Larus argentuatus), whose food supply is usually diminished in El Niño years.|$|E
50|$|The {{black jack}} {{is a large}} fish, and is {{confidently}} known to grow to a length of 1 m and a weight of 17.9 kg, although is more common at lengths under 70 cm. At least one source asserts a fish of 2.21 m has been reported, which if true would make the black jack the second largest species of carangid behind the <b>yellowtail</b> <b>amberjack</b> (2.5 m). The black jack has a similar overall body shape to {{the other members of}} Caranx, having an oblong, compressed form, with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile. This convexity is most pronounced at the head, which slopes steeply downwards, giving the head profile a very angular appearance. The profile between the snout and the nape is concave, with this indent centered near the nostrils. The mouth is fairly large compared to other members of its genus and the maxilla extends to under the centre of the fish's eye. The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of widely spaced conical teeth. The dorsal fin of the black jack is in two sections; the first has 8 spines and the second 1 spine and 20 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 anteriorly detached spines and 16 to 19 soft rays. The lobes of both the dorsal and anal fins are elongated. The pelvic fins contain 1 spine and 21 soft rays, while the pectoral fins are falcate and longer than the head. The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section below the lobe of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains around 50 scales while the straight section 26 to 32 strong scutes. The caudal peduncle also has paired bilateral keels. The chest is completely covered in scales, which {{like the rest of the}} body are small and cycloid in nature. The species has 23 to 30 gill rakers in total and there are 24 vertebrae present.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} weaning time on the rearing performance of <b>yellowtail</b> <b>amberjack</b> Seriola lalandi dorsalis in the experimental condition. Methods: The same weaning protocol started on four different days of post hatching (DPH), including 12 DPH (W 12), 15 DPH (W 15), 18 DPH (W 18), and 21 DPH (W 21), respectively. Growth, survival, and jaw malformation were used as the assessment criteria to evaluate the impact of weaning time {{on the performance of}} <b>yellowtail</b> <b>amberjack</b> larvae. Results: The highest specific growth rate was observed in W 21 treatment, and the lowest specific growth rate was found in W 12 treatment. The highest survival was achieved in W 21 treatment, and the lowest survival was recorded in W 12 treatment. With postponing the weaning started time, jaw malformation rate significantly reduced. At the end of this study, the highest malformation rate was observed in W 12 treatment, and the malformation rate was not significantly different in W 15, W 18, and W 21 treatment. Conclusions: Base on the results obtained in this study, we suggest that weaning of <b>yellowtail</b> <b>amberjack</b> larvae should be started from 15 DPH...|$|E
