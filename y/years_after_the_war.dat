5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was used {{primarily}} to train gunners and engine room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign.

However, there was {{a decline in the}} number of electric trains on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands in each direction during every off-peak hour.
