500|$|The Mercury Prize are {{the annual}} awards by the British Phonographic Industry and British Association of Record Dealers. In 2001, their debut album, Gorillaz, was {{nominated}} for an Mercury Prize, but it was later withdrawn at the band's request. Murdoc Niccals, the bassist of the band, described the nomination as, [...] "It's like carrying a dead albatross round <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> for eternity". This {{is the only time}} that Gorillaz has ever withdrawn for an award nomination.|$|E

500|$|There is an {{aesthetic}} focus on Béart's body, Julien telling Marie that [...] "I love <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> your arms, your shoulders, your mouth, your stomach, your eyes -- I love everything." [...] The focus {{is more than}} erotic as it symbolises Marie's fight for corporeality. The film includes Rivette's first ever sex scenes, one of them arranged by Béart. The five candid and emotionally charged sex scenes focus on their upper bodies and faces, and on their erotic monologues that employ elements of fairy tale, horror, and sadomasochism.|$|E
500|$|Presley began {{speaking}} to the audience between songs about various different things. During one live performance, he spoke about a movie magazine which said he was [...] "strung out" [...] because of his alleged drug problem, he got angry and said: [...] "Well by God, I'll tell you something, I have never been strung out in my life, except on music [...] [...] [...] If I find the individual who said that about me, I’m going to break <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> you son-of-a-bitch. I will pull your goddamn tongue out by the roots." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Today just as 10,000 years ago, {{images of}} the Goddess are {{everywhere}} in India. You'll find them painted {{on the sides of}} trucks, pasted to the dashboards of taxis, postered on the walls of shops. You'll often see a color painting of the Goddess prominently displayed in Hindu homes. Usually the picture is hung high on the wall so you have to crane <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> backward, looking up toward her feet. [...] In India, Goddess worship is not a 'cult,' it's a religion, [...] an extraordinarily spiritually and psychologically mature tradition. Millions of people turn every day with heartfelt yearning to the Mother of the Universe." ...|$|E

500|$|Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature {{magazine}} {{found the}} [...] "seductive" [...] throbbing {{beat of the}} track [...] "completely at ease with Jared's risqué lyrics". Leto described [...] "Up in the Air" [...] as a passionate and energetic song that [...] "feels really free" [...] but also features the concept of constraint and tension, particularly evident in the line [...] "I'll wrap my hands around <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> so tight with love". Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with getting to a {{point in your life}} where you're ready {{to let go of the}} past, embrace change and become more of who you really are".|$|E
500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E
500|$|Julie Emery from Heat criticised Fatboy's fashion sense, {{especially}} from the episode broadcast on 12 May 2011, saying [...] "We know clashing prints are soooooo this season, but really, Fatboy, they do nothing for you. And while we're at it, stop wearing that tinny 'F' round <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> for flip's sake. You're not a gangster rapper, and anyway your real name's Arthur." [...] Emery also said the storyline where Fatboy asks Mercy to marry him so she {{can stay in the}} country sounded [...] "somewhat familiar", as Coronation Street was featuring a similar storyline at the same time. Amy Duncan from the Metro said Fatboy was one of her favourite young characters in EastEnders and said that, with Poppy, he [...] "bring some much-needed light into the soap". Vicky Prior from the Metro said that Fatboy [...] "is easily one of the best characters in EastEnders, able to interact seamlessly with other characters, both young and old." ...|$|E

500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E

2500|$|Although she was worshipped as {{the goddess}} of love, Ishtar was not {{the goddess of}} marriage, nor was she ever viewed as a mother goddess.

The pearls of a prostitute are placed around <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> and you are likely to snatch a man from the tavern." [...] Ishtar had many lovers; Guirand writes: ...|$|E

2500|$|Howard Jones says [...] "Madame Nhu was chauffeured {{in a black}} Mercedes {{and wore}} a small diamond crucifix", and [...] "wore form-fitting apparel so tight that one French {{correspondent}} suggestively described her as 'molded into her ... dress like a dagger in its sheath.' On formal occasions, she wore red satin pantaloons with three vertical pleats, which was {{the mark of the}} highest-ranking women of the imperial court in ancient Annam."

[...] although in recent years, this outcue was used during only starting the second half-hour. [...] During the first half hour, Roker simply uses [...] "your local forecast" [...] which appears after a 30-second commercial.

2500|$|In The Genesis Flood (1961) Henry M. Morris reiterated Price's arguments, {{and wrote}} {{that because there}} had been no death before the Fall of Man, he felt [...] "compelled to date all the rock strata which contain fossils of once-living creatures as {{subsequent}} to Adam's fall", attributing most to the flood. He added that humans and dinosaurs had lived together, quoting Clifford L. Burdick for the report that dinosaur tracks had supposedly been found overlapping a human track in the Paluxy River bed Glen Rose Formation. He was subsequently advised that he might have been misled, and Burdick wrote to Morris in September 1962 that [...] "you kind of stuck <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> out in publishing those Glen Rose tracks."

[...] She picked it up and flew it back to Fargo's Hector Field, where she was working as a mechanics' apprentice, and christened it [...] "Miss Fargo." [...] In June 1929 she became the first licensed woman pilot in North Dakota. [...] That summer she barnstormed county fairs, worked as operations manager at Hector, and flew in her first race, where she took fourth place.|$|E

Don't get that albatross around <b>your</b> <b>neck.</b> Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena." [...] In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he [...] "was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision—a jejune and immature outlook—seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions." [...] Byrd also said in 2005, [...] "I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times... and I don't mind apologizing over and over again.
