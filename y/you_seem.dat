25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest {{as much as you}} do) while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which I am sure you would be as sorry to see as I. We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E
25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to you to be red it might not be so in reality, but if <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to yourself to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.|$|E
500|$|Dwight {{repeatedly}} denounced [...] Jeffersonian democracy, and Calhoun {{challenged him}} in class. [...] Dwight could not shake Calhoun's commitment to republicanism. [...] "Young man," [...] retorted Dwight, [...] "your talents {{are of a}} high order and might justify you for any station, but I deeply regret {{that you do not}} love sound principles better than sophistry – <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to possess a most unfortunate bias for error." [...] Dwight also expounded on the strategy of secession from the Union as a legitimate solution for New England's disagreements with the national government.|$|E

60|$|MABEL. <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> {{quite happy}} with him, you know, Lady Caroline.|$|R
60|$|I {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that it was hopeless. <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> to me rotten through and through.|$|R
500|$|Killen drew {{inspiration}} from the dreaming process: [...] "The concept of the way your dreams feel real, the way <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to experience them as something that you don't blink at until something crazy happens that sort of bursts that balloon. I think I {{became interested in the}} question of what if nothing ever popped that balloon? What if you couldn't tell the difference between when you were awake and when you were asleep? And then I started {{looking for a way to}} marry those two ideas up, and a few months later we had Awake." ...|$|E
500|$|Gwendolen, though, still {{insists that}} she can only love a man named Ernest. What is her fiancé's real first name? Lady Bracknell informs Jack that, as the first-born, {{he would have been}} named after his father, General Moncrieff. Jack {{examines}} the army lists and discovers that his father's name—and hence his own real name—was in fact Ernest. Pretence was reality all along. As the happy couples embrace—Jack and Gwendolen, Algernon and Cecily, and even Dr.Chasuble and Miss Prism—Lady Bracknell complains to her newfound relative: [...] "My nephew, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to be displaying signs of triviality." [...] "On the contrary, Aunt Augusta", he replies, [...] "I've now realised {{for the first time in}} my life the vital importance of being Earnest." ...|$|E
500|$|Peckham {{often was}} in {{conflict}} with his subordinate bishops, mainly because of his efforts to reform them, but Peckham's own attitude and handling of his clergy contributed to the problem. He once wrote to Roger de Meyland, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield [...] "These things need your attention, but you have been absent so long that <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> not to care. We therefore order you, on receipt of this letter, {{to take up residence}} in your diocese, so that—even if you are not competent to redress spiritual evils—you may at least minister to the temporal needs of the poor." [...] The historian Richard Southern says that Peckham's disputes with his suffragan bishops were [...] "conducted in an atmosphere of bitterness and perpetual ill-will", which probably owed something to a [...] "petulant strain in Peckham's character". Peckham's conflicts started because his own ideals were those of a Franciscan, but most of his clergy were concerned with more mundane and materialistic affairs. These strains between the archbishop and his subordinates were intensified by clashes over ecclesiastical and secular authority, as well as Edward's great need for income.|$|E
60|$|Ast. When {{you gave}} orders {{that he should}} be taken, <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> {{resolved}} how to dispose of him.|$|R
6000|$|Madame Merle stared, {{and indeed}} she was justly bewildered. [...] "Ah, {{a moment ago}} I thought <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> rather to disparage her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I crave your worship's pardon," [...] said Lambourne, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> {{familiar}} with Anthony Foster; now I am {{familiar with}} Anthony myself." ...|$|R
500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song. It begins with a conversation {{with one of her}} friends, who asks Jackson the title question. Lyrically, it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well as he used to, and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I never ask for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth. <b>You</b> <b>seem</b> to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A. McCoy in the book Lifepower: Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose, Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that [...] "life is about more than just what you say. Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing sends me into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E
2500|$|Article 112 is {{typically}} deployed with politically expedient timing, {{rather than at}} the time of the supposed offense. Jakrapob Penkair, a former Minister to the Office of the Prime Minister, commented [...] "It’s not about your action, it’s about the timing. They wait until the moment when <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> most vulnerable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1922, Margules {{began work}} as a police {{reporter}} for the City News Association of New York [...] Margules then considered himself something of an expert on art, and the painter Myron Lechay {{is said to have}} responded to some unsolicited analysis of his work with the remark [...] "Since <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to know so much about it, why don't you paint yourself?" [...] This led to study with Lechay and a flurry of painting.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Adolf?" [...] I inquired. [...] "I {{believe she}} {{thought you were}} {{preparing}} to run away with him. <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> to have him hypnotized." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{be getting}} on well with the swells, if you mean the Merrifields, {{especially}} Wilfred, if that is his name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chop {{that kind}} of talk," [...] {{interrupted}} Belding, bluntly. [...] "Tell us where Yaqui took you--what happened to Rojas--why <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> lost for so long." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{success of}} Home of the Gentry {{must have come}} as a {{surprise}} to Goncharov, who'd never considered Turgenev a novelist. In a letter dated March 28, 1859, he wrote: [...] "Would it be permissible for me to comment on your talent? I'd say you've got a gift for drawing tender landscapes, and have a keen ear, but <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to be eager to erect monumental structures [...] and give us drama. Goncharov's opinion seemingly never altered.|$|E
2500|$|Another viewer offered, [...] “I {{always thought}} {{painting}} {{was supposed to}} be about hopes, dreams, the imagination. [...] Instead, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to say it’s political statement at every brushstroke. [...] Your tendentious opinions betray a lack of understanding of the artist and a blindness to the paintings themselves. [...] Every painting is, according to you, an evil, cunning, greedy “Anglo-American.” Shame on you for choosing to make a statement (a very limited statement) about your “political correctness” instead of really looking at the art for what it says about the appeal of the West to our collective imagination. [...] Art is bigger than everyday logic.” (Signed VC, Alexandria, VA) ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his pacifist upbringing, {{as a young}} freedom fighter, Wali Khan seemed exasperated {{with the}} pacifism {{advocated}} by his father. He was to later explain his frustration to Gandhi, in a story he told Muklaika Bannerjee, [...] "If the cook comes to slaughter this chicken's baby, is non-violence {{on the part of}} the chicken likely to save the younger life?" [...] The story ended with a twinkle in his eye when he remembered Gandhiji's reply, [...] "Wali, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to have done more research on violence than I have on non-violence." [...] His first wife died in 1949 while Wali Khan was in prison. In 1954, he married Nasim Wali Khan, the daughter of an old Khudai Khidmatgar activist.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was about}} the murder. <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> {{interested}} {{in the fact that}} my office was within a few yards of the passage where it occurred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would have}} been sure if you hadn't become so {{unexpectedly}} quiet after I left Marmion. <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> to concur, {{to be willing to}} wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, {{how angry}} {{you will be}} with me. But <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> tolerably {{prepared}} in your last letter for my being in a passion.... Ever affectionately yours, ...|$|R
2500|$|Phaedrus and Socrates both {{note how}} anyone would {{consider}} Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to {{his love of}} learning which [...] "trees and open country won't teach," [...] while [...] "men in the town" [...] will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading {{him out of his}} native land: [...] "Yet <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to have discovered a drug for getting me out (dokei moi tes emes exodou to pharmakon heurekenai). A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books (en bibliois) I don't doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vallejos and Daniel Domingo appealed {{their cases}} to the Court of Final Appeal, and were {{respectively}} assigned the case numbers FACV 19 and 20/2012. They would be represented before the CFA by Michael Fordham; David Pannick continued {{to represent the}} Government. Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma rejected a further application for joinder by eight-year-old Liang Wing-ki, the Hong Kong-born daughter of mainland parents, whose next friend, mother Li Yinxian, filed suit on her behalf. Philip Dykes, for the applicant, argued that because Vallejos and Domingo's case would touch on issues of interpretation of the Basic Law under Article 158, Liang's interests would also be affected. In rejecting Liang's application, Ma stated: [...] "We feel that the points <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to argue are adequately covered and will be adequately covered". Liang and other Hong Kong-born children like her were ruled {{to be entitled to}} the right of abode in Hong Kong in the 2001 case Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen.|$|E
2500|$|Gardner depicts Mason as {{a lawyer}} who fights hard {{on behalf of his}} clients and who enjoys unusual, {{difficult}} or nearly-hopeless cases. [...] He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: [...] "You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. [...] When you turn your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth." [...] And in The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: [...] "Mr. Mason...from time to time <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to find yourself in predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. [...] The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients' interests." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can {{you give}} me a minute? Come in and shut the door. Won't you sit down? Very well. <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> sorry for Mrs Ford just now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} got on very well, Bertie, with Mrs. Dias. I did not hear what you were saying, but <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> to be doing stunningly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jim Crow, gruffly, [...] "what's {{the matter}} with you fellows? Haven't you got tongues? <b>You</b> <b>seemed</b> to talk fast enough a minute ago." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 20 December, T. V. Soong {{arrived in}} Xi'an, and Soong Mei-ling arrived two days later, {{in order to}} {{negotiate}} Chiang's release. At first, Chiang was opposed to negotiating with a CCP delegate, but withdrew his opposition {{when it became clear}} that his life and freedom were largely dependent on Communist goodwill towards him. On 24 December, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time that the two had seen each other since Zhou had left Whampoa over ten years earlier. Zhou began the conversation by saying: [...] "In the ten years since we have met, <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to have aged very little." [...] Chiang nodded and said: [...] "Enlai, you were my subordinate. You should do what I say." [...] Zhou replied that, if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang's command. By the end of this meeting, Chiang promised to end the civil war, to resist the Japanese together, and to invite Zhou to Nanjing for further talks.|$|E
2500|$|HAMLET. [...] I {{will tell}} you why; so shall my {{anticipation}} prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to {{the king and queen}} moult no feather. [...] I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this [...] majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. [...] What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how expressed and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! [...] And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> to say so.|$|E
2500|$|In remarks aired by the CNN program D.L. Hughley Breaks the News on March 1, 2009, Steele said he, {{rather than}} Limbaugh, is [...] "the de facto {{leader of the}} Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly." [...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when <b>you</b> <b>seem</b> obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{did you say}} to him? I {{longed to}} hear, for <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> to enjoy yourselves very much, but I didn't like to be a marplot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I {{dare say}} I {{must be very}} stupid. I saw you talking with Mr. Morton, and <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> interested. I thought I'd better not intrude." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. M. I didn't get in till half-past eleven. 'Had {{a look at}} you then, and <b>you</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{sleeping}} as soundly as a condemned criminal.|$|R
