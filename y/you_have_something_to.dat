500|$|Drake {{ended his}} studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered [...] "writing him long letters, {{pointing}} out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net {{was the one thing}} he did not want." [...] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.|$|E
500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say about the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E
6000|$|... "Allow me {{to remind}} you," [...] {{he said at}} length, looking again at his watch, [...] "that I am a little pressed for time. I understood, or imagined, that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to me--not about roses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> tell me, Tom," [...] remarked Sam, {{as the three}} were going downstairs to breakfast. [...] "What was it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said you}} wanted to hurry home," [...] he replied gently, passing his hand along his mustang's velvety neck, [...] "and--and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|After a brief tour, John K {{decided to}} rejoin Biomechanical full-time. In an interview, John said [...] "I found my self giving Biomechanical less that [...] 100% and {{that bothered me}} a lot... As a {{musician}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say and I think you can easily lose direction by playing {{in two or three}} bands. I personally find it disorientating and I would prefer to focus in my band only." [...] The decision was amicable and the band continued to work on other projects.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon--Captain Robertson, but myself, I don't drink {{anything}} before sundown. However, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat----?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can {{see from}} your face <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say; so we'll have it all to ourselves. You are in some trouble? What'll you drink?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{talk about}} just now. You and Janet Halliday {{understand}} each other well. I don't know if you are confidants or accomplices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know where}} Miss Gascoyne is, but you {{suggested}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> ask me, and I shall be busy by and by," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{night was}} dark and Douglas could not see much," [...] Deering remarked. [...] "I expect <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> go on that helped you fill out his statement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And your errand is {{much the}} same now, though one could fancy that you feel <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> back it?" [...] his {{companion}} suggested dryly.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is something!" [...] she exclaimed, {{drawing a}} little breath of relief. [...] "Sit down, Peter. Will <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat? I {{finished}} dinner an hour ago, but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I didn't know it, Nat. But I'm {{glad to hear}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do, and I hope you'll make {{a success}} of it," [...] {{returned}} Dave promptly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. We go by Sutton Leigh: so make haste, maidens." [...] Then, {{turning to}} his mother, [...] "Didn't I hear <b>you</b> say <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> send to Elizabeth, ma'am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} clearly, but I feel that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} matter. Indeed, it made the relief more welcome. But you haven't given me an explanation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You said {{yesterday}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been with Mr Slow, and that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> tell me. If you still wish to tell me anything, perhaps you can do so now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps later," [...] he said. [...] "Just now I {{feel that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to me. Is it not so? I talk better when I am standing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ambrose, {{does that}} mean <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> keep a secret from us?" [...] asked Naomi, {{approaching}} her lover with a smile. [...] "Is Silas ordered to hold his tongue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. FRYE. Is this Dr. Jonathan Pindar? I {{wondered}} {{if you were a}} relation--(he glances at ASHER)--but I wasn't looking for you in Foxon Falls. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> suggest--? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat? Then {{join me in}} {{a coffee}} and curacao. Try one of the proprietor's cigars. They are less {{poisonous}} than one would expect. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> the tools?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, get to business, then," [...] went on {{the lumber}} merchant. [...] "I {{am not going to}} stay here all day. <b>You</b> said <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say that would {{interest}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you understand," [...] he said, [...] "that Inspector Jacks {{is on your}} track? Rightly or wrongly, he {{believes}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the murder on the train that night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond smiled. [...] "I saw you," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I wasn't {{quite sure}} that another of my guests did not do so, too. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Dusty," [...] said Julia, [...] "you {{are more}} silent than ever. You won't take a dish I know: but {{tell us the}} news, for I am sure <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, [...] "I believe I understand. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> propose, and {{you wish}} to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Focused around Leonard Knight and Salvation Mountain's simple {{message of}} [...] "God Is Love", the film follows Knight's thirty year journey and his convicted {{dedication}} to spread that message. Hosted by actress Julianna Barninger, the documentary starts from {{the premise of}} asking the question: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to the world, how would you do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was unusual, perhaps," [...] he admitted; [...] "but {{who is not}} {{weary of}} usual things? I {{gathered}} from your note that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> explain. I was anxious to hear what that explanation could be." ...|$|R
6000|$|What {{woman could}} {{withstand}} {{the anguish of}} that honest boyish face? I fear Miss Mayfield could, for {{she looked at him}} over her handkerchief, and said: [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to your friend, and I've sent him off." ...|$|R
60|$|VENABLES. Pardon me. But he has righted himself {{subsequently}} in the neatest way. I {{have always}} {{found that the}} man whose second thoughts are good is worth watching. Well, Comtesse, I see <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has never}} been our habit, Rodgerson," [...] said Morris, turning pale. [...] "But give me time to turn round, and I'll see what I can do; I daresay we can let <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> account." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Chudleigh clenched {{her hand}} and her eyes flashed. [...] "You are willing to bear undeserved disgrace, to wander about Canada, an outcast from all society you could take {{pleasure}} in? It's incomprehensible, unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> gain." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHN FARNABY,--I {{have always}} {{suspected}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} disappearance of our child. I know for certain now that you deliberately cast your infant daughter on {{the mercy of the}} world, and condemned your wife to a life of wretchedness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, papa! I am so very glad. Not {{to be able}} {{to hinder}} him was so dreadful, when he wanted to pit Lucy and me against you. I could never <b>have</b> looked at <b>you.</b> I should always <b>have</b> felt that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> forgive me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Beavan--he's the wheelwright--said it couldn't, and {{dad said}} I could hardly {{expect him to}} send the canoe back to Kingston. He bought it for me at an exhibition." [...] Then a thought seemed to strike her. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with canoes in Canada?" ...|$|R
