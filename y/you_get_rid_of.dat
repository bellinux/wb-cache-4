500|$|Before the 1969 season, the Jets {{suffered}} offseason problems. Namath, {{faced with}} NFL claims that his Bachelors III bar was a hangout for gangsters, {{was told by}} the NFL to sell the bar. Instead, he briefly retired, feeling he had been badly treated. Six weeks following his announcement, Namath sold the bar and rejoined the team. A number of Super Bowl veterans were cut by the team, or had bitter contract disputes with Ewbank in his capacity as general manager. According to receiver Don Maynard, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> veteran ballplayers and replace them with rookies, the level goes down." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer David Amann {{explained}} that {{the inspiration for the}} story was [...] "What if you have a doctor who is prosperous but has a dark page from his past that comes back to haunt him?" [...] Spotnitz later elaborated that the story initially was [...] "going to be how do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> something you can't get rid of". However, the writers soon found this storyline difficult to develop, and, by Spotnitz's own admission, the story [...] "started to evolve into a Cape Fear type of situation". The episode was finished by the writers over the Christmas break and then [...] "handed over" [...] to Kim Manners, who became the episode's director.|$|E
500|$|Cake {{was formed}} in 1991 when John McCrea, a Sacramento, California native who had moved to Los Angeles with a band only to see it [...] "quickly crumble around him", {{returned}} to Sacramento. He began {{looking for a new}} band to play with, having [...] "grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit", and quickly attracted trumpet player Vince DiFiore, guitarist Greg Brown, bassist Shon Meckfessel and drummer Frank French. All were active in the music scene at the time; DiFiore notes that [...] " [...] came back and stole us from other bands". The band soon came up with the name [...] "Cake"; rather than referring to the foodstuff, the name is meant to be [...] "like when something insidiously becomes a part of your life... mean it more as something that cakes onto your shoe and is just sort of there until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> it". McFessel soon left to attend college, and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. After touring and becoming part of the club scene in San Francisco, the band independently recorded and released Motorcade of Generosity in 1994, selling copies from their van as a method of paying touring expenses.|$|E
