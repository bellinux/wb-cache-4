5|$|Boron is {{necessary}} for plant growth, but an excess of boron is toxic to plants, and occurs particularly in acidic soil. It presents as a <b>yellowing</b> from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves, {{but it can be}} confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants.|$|E

50|$|Southern <b>Yellow</b> cattle are one {{of three}} breeds of Chinese <b>Yellow</b> cattle, the other two being the Central Plains <b>Yellow</b> and the Northern <b>Yellow</b> breeds. The Southern <b>Yellow</b> breed is clearly Zebu (Bos taurus indicus), the Northern <b>Yellow</b> breed is clearly taurine (Bos taurus taurus), and the Central Plains <b>Yellow</b> breed is intermediate, which means at a glance that the Southern <b>Yellow</b> cattle have high, erect humps, the Northern <b>Yellow</b> cattle have no humps, and the Central Plains <b>Yellow</b> cattle have small humps. Philippine Native cattle are mainly derived from Southern <b>Yellow</b> cattle brought from Fujian to the Philippines, they are usually very similar.|$|R

5|$|Several viruses {{are known}} to infect the plant, {{including}} seed-borne strawberry latent ringspot virus, parsnip yellow fleck virus, parsnip leafcurl virus, parsnip mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus.

5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a <b>yellowing</b> latex.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and <b>yellowing</b> of the leaves). This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (<b>yellowing</b> {{of the eyes}} and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30%–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30%–50%), fever (up to 20%), {{and changes in the}} color of stool or urine. To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) {{are more likely to have}} jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.|$|E

5|$|Violet {{root rot}} {{caused by the}} fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in <b>yellowing</b> of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor {{the development of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as <b>yellowing</b> (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. <b>Yellowing</b> of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as <b>yellowing</b> of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia spinulosa var.spinulosa was {{introduced}} into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by Joseph Banks who supplied seed to Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens and Woburn Abbey among others; var.collina followed in 1800 and var.cunninghamii in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained soils with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from Wianamatta shales may tolerate heavier soils. It is resistant to dieback, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia spinulosa is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, it manifests as <b>yellowing</b> of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and {{occurs when the}} plant is grown in soils of higher pH. This can also happen where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Variety subreticulatus, like variety boralis, has a {{generally}} darker coloration than the two-colored bolete, but varies {{much more than}} either. When fresh the coloration of the cap varies from a rose red, red, rose pink, dark red, and purple red. With age it changes to a cinnamon red or a rusty rose color, with <b>yellowing</b> toward the margin. The pore surface {{is similar to that}} of the main speciesyellow when fresh and with age changing to a dull ochre yellow; the bruising coloration is blue but is much lighter and sometimes not appearing to stain when bruised at all. The spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety subreticulatus is very similar to the distribution of the two-colored bolete in North America, and appears north to eastern Canada and south to Florida, and west to Wisconsin.|$|E
