The fact that this futuristic-looking plant was situated in such a beautiful spot {{so close to the}} sea made me curious. Are they safe when it comes to earthquakes and tsunamis? Further reading revealed that many of these plants are situated in earthquake-prone areas, some of them are even located next to shores that had been hit in the past by tsunamis.A photo of Mihama made me narrow down my focus only to Japanese nuclear plants. I wanted to make a soundtrack to some of them, concentrating on the architecture, design and localizations, but also questioning the potential radiation danger (a cooling system being destroyed by a landslide or earthquake, etc). As the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said: [...] "the plants were so well designed that 'such a situation is practically impossible'.The album was finished on February 13th. On March 17th I received the following message from a Facebook friend: 'Geir, some time ago <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>people</b> for a photo of a Japanese nuclear powerplant.

How you doing? I’m good, man. Swag.” They like to say swag where it’s not even necessary anymore. Having swag used to be having that swagger on the mic and you know, the little pauses and that. But it’s almost too much swag these days. Everybody is just so swagged out. It’s like, “Fuck swag and fuck you.” Nowadays, everybody tries to be so different that to stand out as an artist, being different isn’t different anymore.

Accordingly, we asked a number of academics, journals and academic institutions to reflect on the term.
