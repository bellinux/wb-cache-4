[...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>try</b> to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E

If you’d like <b>you</b> <b>could</b> also <b>try</b> to recreate some of the other figures from either Rust and Rothwell (1995) or Rothwell and Rust (1995).

6000|$|What is {{extremely}} important too, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>try</b> this method with safety; extension of the suffrage you cannot so try.

Nothing but good from this. From extension of the suffrage, some think, you might get quite other than good. From extension of the suffrage, till it became a universal counting of heads, one sees not in the least what wisdom could be extracted. A Parliament of the Paris pattern, such as we see just now, might be extracted: and from that?

Often enough they have succeeded, been decisive of great campaigns and wars, and become splendid {{in the eyes of}} all mankind; sometimes, as in this case, they have only deserved to succeed, and to be splendid in the eyes of judges. How get these masses of enemies lured away, so that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>try</b> such a thing? There lay the difficulty; insuperable altogether, except by the most fine and appropriate treatment. Of a truth, it required a connected series of the wisest measures and most secret artifices of war;--and withal, that you should throw over them such a veil as would lead your enemy to see in them precisely the reverse of what they meant. How all this was to be set in action, and how the Enemy's own plans, intentions and moods of mind were to be used as raw material for attainment of your object,--studious readers will best see in the manoeuvres of the King in his now more than critical condition; which do certainly exhibit the completest masterpiece in the Art of leading Armies that Europe has ever seen." ...|$|E

In fact, trying to solve the puzzle of Donnie Darko is a recursive action. Once you find a new interpretation, you have to reinterpret the previous ones as well.

50|$|The summer {{image at}} top {{right of the}} page shows the station before the big trees at the Dunlopillo factory (on the left in that image) were pruned back to the trunks. These trees had the whole trunks felled in 2012 giving an open feel to {{that side of the}} station not seen for many years. At that time, in early mornings in spring, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> watch buzzards <b>trying</b> to rob the rooks' nests in those trees. Since the trees were pruned (on the left in the snowy image) the buzzards have stopped coming, but in spring you can still watch jackdaws {{attempting}} to nest in the chimneys of the shop. The once rare and threatened red kites can now regularly be seen riding on the thermals above the station. During summer, house martins and swifts frequently scream over the station, and goldfinches and bullfinches graze on the weed-seeds between the station and Dunlopillo car-park.|$|R
50|$|One way of {{changing}} the direction perceived is to use averted vision and mentally look for an arm going behind instead of in front, then carefully move the eyes back. Some may perceive a change in direction more easily by narrowing visual focus to a specific region of the image, such as the spinning foot or the shadow below the dancer and gradually looking upwards. One can also try to tilt one's head to perceive a change in direction. Another way is to watch the base shadow foot, and perceive it as the toes always pointing away from you and it can help with direction change. You can also {{close your eyes and}} try and envision the dancer going in a direction then reopen them and the dancer should change directions. Still another way is to wait for the dancer's legs to cross in the projection and then try to perceive a change in the direction in what follows. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> also <b>try</b> using your peripheral vision to distract the dominant part of the brain, slowly look away from the ballerina and you may begin to see it spin in the other direction. Perhaps the easiest method is to blink rapidly (slightly varying the rate if necessary) until consecutive images are going in the 'new' direction. Then open your eyes and the new rotational direction is maintained. It is even possible to see the illusion {{in a way that the}} dancer is not spinning at all, but simply rotating back and forth 180 degrees.|$|R
