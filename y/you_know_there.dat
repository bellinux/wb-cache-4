500|$|The surname [...] "Affleck" [...] is of Scottish origin. Affleck {{appeared}} on the PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots in 2014. When told during filming that an ancestor had been a slave owner in Georgia, Affleck responded: [...] "God. It gives me kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> it is, part of our history ... We tend to separate ourselves from these things by going like, 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'." [...] Later, a representative for Affleck told host Henry Louis Gates Jr. via email that Affleck [...] "was uneasy about the slave owner" [...] and the information {{was not included in}} the show's final cut. When this became public knowledge during the 2015 Sony email hacking scandal, Affleck said he had been [...] "embarrassed" [...] by the information.|$|E

[...] He wrote that he and Grace anticipated criticism [...] "from all sides" [...] but felt it would be worthwhile anyway, because [...] "we want to help marriages and single people aspiring to marry...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ginsberg {{responded in}} a 1958 {{interview}} with The Village Voice, specifically addressing {{the charge that}} the Beats destroyed [...] "the distinction between life and literature". In the interview, he stated that [...] "the bit about anti-intellectualism {{is a piece of}} vanity, we had the same education, went to the same school, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> are 'Intellectuals' and there are intellectuals. Podhoretz is just out of touch with twentieth-century literature, he's writing for the eighteenth-century mind. We have a personal literature now—Proust, Wolfe, Faulkner, Joyce." ...|$|E

Lisa replies [...] "Ewwww!" [...] In the 1995 video release of the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy, there was an interview with George Lucas conducted by Maltin included {{before the start of}} the movies. Maltin is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the world's shortest movie review; his two-star review of the 1948 musical Isn't It Romantic? consists of the word [...] "No". In 1985 he delivered a three-word movie review on Entertainment Tonight for that year's horror film spoof, Transylvania 6-5000. The review begins with a silent Maltin swaying to a recording of the Glenn Miller Orchestra playing [...] "Pennsylvania 6-5000", wherein the instrumental melody is interrupted by the sound of a telephone ringing (part of the original recording), after which the band chants the title of the song. In his review, Maltin timed it so that his review began with the phone ringing: [...] "Transylvania 6-5000 ... stinks!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? He told us we were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> are millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even 'S' told us we were great and that they were just a bunch of Arabs (in Hebrew, 'arabushim')...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews? A few 'arabushim' die, there is no harm in that." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by another soldier, Soldier Y, who remarked, [...] "it's a war, in a war these things happen...It's just a bunch of Arabs. Why are you taking it so hard?" [...] An official army spokesman's statement questioned the accuracy of Kol Ha'ir report.|$|E
2500|$|Oak Ridge was {{developed}} by the federal government as a segregated community as a requirement by the Southern bloc of Democrats in Congress to authorize funding for the project. Due to generally holding lower-ranked jobs, their assigned dwellings were predominantly government-built [...] "hutments" [...] (one-room shacks) located very close to the Y-12 plant, in the one residential area designated as colored. [...] Kenneth Nichols, the MED District Engineer, was told by the main construction contractor for the K-25 plant that the Negro construction labor force had a large turnover rate, so Nichols gave permission to set up a separate black women's camp. When Leslie Groves visited the plant with K. T. Keller of Chrysler, Keller saw twelve Negro women sweeping the thirty-foot wide alley between the production units, and said [...] "Nichols, don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> is a machine made to sweep a concrete floor like this?" [...] Nichols replied [...] "Sure I do, but these gals can do more than one of those machines". The men now had an opportunity to [...] "fracas" [...] on Saturday night, and labor turnover had reduced. During the war, plans were made for a colored neighborhood of houses equal in quality to those provided for whites, but it was not implemented due to limited resources. After the war, all hutments were dismantled, and a colored neighborhood of permanent houses {{was developed}} in the Gamble Valley area of Oak Ridge, which during wartime had been occupied by a white trailer community.|$|E
