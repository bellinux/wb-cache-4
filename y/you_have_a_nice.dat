It could be {{regarded}} as an exhortation to achieve an outcome that the recipient has no power to influence. However, {{it is also possible}} to interpret the phrase as a contraction of [...] "I hope that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day".|$|E

500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the novel. On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I really have no strong views.

The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E

500|$|Sandi Mann concludes {{from her}} {{research}} that the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture will prevail, becoming used by more companies and countries. In the service industry, for example, {{she explains that}} products have become more uniform {{over the past few}} decades. Thus, the sole way for companies to distinguish themselves is to have better customer service. She notes that there are positive and negative effects. A positive effect is that it is beneficial for business and for people who enjoy fake displays. A negative effect is that emotions incompatible with the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture are repressed, leading to what Mann terms the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome. [...] In an interview for the Wall Street Journal, an employee of a telemarketing company, was called a son of a bitch. Clenching his teeth, he responded [...] "Thank you very much, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day." [...] The stress of suppressing their feelings and faking cheerfulness caused people like the telemarketer to feel insincere and phony. Individuals affected by the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome must carry out emotional labor, which could lead to diminished self-esteem, depression, and cynicism.|$|E
