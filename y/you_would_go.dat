My sons have laid out good roads, and built bridges and mills; the people are improving, and everything is prosperous.|$|E

He {{revealed}} that he had initially objected to Hattie Morahan being cast in the role of the eldest Dashwood sister, Elinor. However, he was glad that his objections were ignored, because he fell in love with her performance. Morahan told The Daily Telegraph's Jasper Rees that she deliberately chose not to watch the 1995 film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility or think about Emma Thompson's portrayal of the character.

Art started playing trumpet professionally {{at the age}} of 16, {{performing}} in the bands of Horace Henderson, Jimmy Mundy, and Floyd Ray, among others. These opportunities came about through a combination of his ability and the absence of numerous older musicians, who were still in the armed forces following World War II. Around this time in Los Angeles, there were abundant opportunities for musical development, according to Farmer: [...] "During the day <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to somebody's house and play. At night there were after-hours clubs [...] anybody who wanted to play was free to come up and play". Farmer left high school early but persuaded the principal to give him a diploma, which he did not collect until a visit to the school in 1958.|$|E

[...] However, he continued {{to have a major}} impact on the historiography of the Battle of Jutland by serving throughout the 1920s as Winston Churchill's naval consultant on submarine-warfare. [...] Churchill wrote an anti-Jellicoe tract in his World Crisis, Volume III which in large measure shared Dewar's views on tactics and even some diagrams.

For the disc game, Horowitz and Kitsis wrote a rough draft of the scene, and sent the script to Kosinski; he summarized his perspective of the sequence's visuals to them. [...] "He described them as these underlying platforms," [...] said Horowitz, [...] "that would then coalesce and then the way <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> from round to round in the game is you defeat someone, they kinda come together as {{you see in the}} movie." [...] After giving his intake, Kosinski sent various sketches of the scene to the writers and would often revise the script. Kitsis thought that illustrating the character's stories to be the most difficult task in writing Tron: Legacy. The writers collaborated with the creative process throughout production, which was helpful especially considering the difficulties of describing in a tangible way a digital world that [...] "in its very nature defies basic screenwriting conventions." ...|$|E

When {{asked if he was}} bothered {{by the fact that the}} first black metal bands were against Christianity, front-man Jeff Arwadi replied: [...] "I think you're wrong if first black metal bands were highly against Christianity. [...] I dig the very first black metal bands a lot... those 80s bands like Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, early Sodom, etc. [...] By my knowledge, none of those bands were against Christianity. They only had those kind of 'satanic' image which is more like some high-school Halloween movies or parent-shocker rather than Satanism as a {{philosophy}} or ideology". Earlier in the interview he even went as far as to say that [...] "even bands like Celtic Frost were once considered 'white-metal' from some 'true' black metal fans because the band thanked God on album thanks list, and one member wearing a cross necklace instead of inverted cross. It's a totally relative issue, depending on how 'extreme' <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>go,</b> right?"
