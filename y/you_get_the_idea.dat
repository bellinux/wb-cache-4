I {{have before}} noticed--though I {{am not sure}} that you have yet {{believed}} my statement of it--the significance of Sir Walter's as of Shakspeare's names; Diana 'Vernon, semper viret,' gives you the conditions of purity and youthful strength or spring which imply the highest state of libertas. By corruption of the idea of purity, you get the modern heroines of London Journal--or perhaps we may more fitly call it 'Cockney-daily'--literature. You have one of them in perfection, for instance, in Mr. Charles Reade's 'Griffith Gaunt'-- [...] "Lithe, and vigorous, and one with her great white gelding;" [...] and liable to be entirely changed in her mind about the destinies of her life by a quarter of an hour's conversation with a gentleman unexpectedly handsome; the hero also being a person who looks at people whom he dislikes, with eyes [...] "like a dog's in the dark;" [...] and both hero and heroine having souls and intellects also precisely corresponding to those of a dog's in the dark, which is indeed the essential picture of the practical English national mind at this moment,--happy if it remains doggish,--Circe not usually being content with changing people into dogs only. For the Diana Vernon of the Greek is Artemis Laphria, who is friendly to the dog; not to the swine. Do you see, by the way, how perfectly the image is carried out by Sir Walter in putting his Diana on the border country? [...] "Yonder blue hill is in Scotland," [...] she says to her cousin,--not in the least thinking less of him for having been concerned, it may be, in one of Bob Roy's forays. And so gradually <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Norman franchise carried out in the free-rider or free-booter; not safe from degradation on that side also; but by no means of swinish temper, or foraging, as at present the British speculative public, only with the snout.|$|E

What I mean to say is, we had always been the greatest of pals and all that, but it never struck me that she would think it much of a wheeze getting hooked up for life with a chap like me. We just sort of drifted along and so forth. All very jolly and what not. And then this evening--I don't know. I had a bit of a hump, what with one thing and another, and she was most dashed sweet and patient and soothing and--and--well, and what not, don't you know, and suddenly--deuced rummy sensation--the jolly old scales seemed to fall, if you follow me, from my good old eyes; I don't know if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> I suddenly seemed to look myself squarely in the eyeball and say to myself, 'Freddie, old top, how do we go? Are we not missing a good thing?' And, by Jove, thinking it over, I found that I was absolutely correct-o! You've no notion how dashed sympathetic she is, old man! I mean to say, I had this hump, you know, owing to one thing and another, and was feeling that life was more or less of a jolly old snare and delusion, and she bucked me up and all that, and suddenly I found myself kissing her and all that sort of rot, and she was kissing me {{and so on and so}} forth, and she's got the most ripping eyes, and there was nobody about, and the long and the short of it was, old boy, that I said, 'Let's get married!' and she said, 'When?' and that was that, if you see what I mean. The scheme now is to pop down to the City Hall and get a licence, which it appears you have to have if you want to bring this sort of binge off with any success and vim, and then what ho for the padre!

Jay Cocks, reviewing Rhinoceros for Time magazine, faulted it for its “upbeat, frantic vulgarization” of the Ionesco text, {{arguing that}} O’Horgan “removed not only the politics but the resonance as well. What remains is a squeaky sermon on the virtues of nonconformity.” Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, dismissed the film as “an unreliable mouthpiece in an unreliable metaphor so grossly overdirected by Tom O'Horgan that <b>you</b> might <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> Mr. O'Horgan thought he was making a movie for an audience made up entirely of rhinoceroses instead of people.” ...|$|R

"I {{will differ}} with you there, gossip, and will {{undertake}} {{to show the}} company"here he looked around upon us and nodded {{his head in a}} confident way"that there is a grain of sense in what the child has said; for look you, it is of a certainty most true and demonstrable that it is a man's head that is master and supreme ruler over his whole body. Is that granted? Will any deny it?" [...] He glanced around again; everybody indicated assent. [...] "Very well, then; that being the case, no part of the body is responsible for the result when it carries out an order delivered to it by the head; ergo, the head is alone responsible for crimes done by a man's hands or feet or stomachdo <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea?</b> am I right thus far?" [...] Everybody said yes, and said it with enthusiasm, and some said, one to another, that the maire was in great form to-night and at his very bestwhich pleased the maire exceedingly and made his eyes sparkle with pleasure, for he overheard these things; so he went on in the same fertile and brilliant way. [...] "Now, then, we will consider what the term responsibility means, and how it affects the case in point. Responsibility makes a man responsible for only those things for which he is properly responsible"and he waved his spoon around in a wide sweep to indicate the comprehensive nature of that class of responsibilities which render people responsible, and several exclaimed, admiringly, [...] "He is right!he has put that whole tangled thing into a nutshellit is wonderful!" [...] After a little pause to give the interest opportunity to gather and grow, he went on: [...] "Very good. Let us suppose the case of a pair of tongs that falls upon a man's foot, causing a cruel hurt. Will you claim that the tongs are punishable for that? The question is answered; I see by your faces that you would call such a claim absurd. Now, why is it absurd? It is absurd because, there being no reasoning facultythat is to say, no faculty of personal commandin a pair of tongs, personal responsibility for the acts of the tongs is wholly absent from the tongs; and, therefore, responsibility being absent, punishment cannot ensue. Am I right?" [...] A hearty burst of applause was his answer. [...] "Now, then, we arrive at a man's stomach. Consider how exactly, how marvelously, indeed, its situation corresponds to that of a pair of tongs. Listenand take careful note, I beg you. Can a man's stomach plan a murder? No. Can it plan a theft? No. Can it plan an incendiary fire? No. Now answer mecan a pair of tongs?" [...] (There were admiring shouts of [...] "No!" [...] and [...] "The cases are just exact!" [...] and [...] "Don't he do it splendid!") [...] "Now, then, friends and neighbors, a stomach which cannot plan a crime cannot be a principal in the commission of itthat is plain, as you see. The matter is narrowed down by that much; we will narrow it further. Can a stomach, of its own motion, assist at a crime? The answer is no, because command is absent, the reasoning faculty is absent, volition is absentas {{in the case of the}} tongs. We perceive now, do we not, that the stomach is totally irresponsible for crimes committed, either in whole or in part, by it?" [...] He got a rousing cheer for response. [...] "Then what do we arrive at as our verdict? Clearly this: that there is no such thing in this world as a guilty stomach; that in the body of the veriest rascal resides a pure and innocent stomach; that, whatever it's owner may do, it at least should be sacred in our eyes; and that while God gives us minds to think just and charitable and honorable thoughts, it should be, and is, our privilege, as well as our duty, not only to feed the hungry stomach that resides in a rascal, having pity for its sorrow and its need, but to do it gladly, gratefully, in recognition of its sturdy and loyal maintenance of its purity and innocence in the midst of temptation and in company so repugnant to its better feelings. I am done." ...|$|E

But while wiping out nearly every character on the show would have been a memorably bleak way to end things, Grimm seeks to imbue the finale with emotional weight by applying the tried and true formula of the importance of family. Whether or not that undercuts what was building up to be a remarkably violent and somber end will likely depend on how much mileage <b>you</b> <b>get</b> from <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of ghosts returning to help the living in their time of need. In the end, it works as an appropriate narrative loophole affording the series the chance to reminisce about its television journey while also playing with (though not fully committing to) <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of truly bringing things to an end.

5000|$|He {{explains}} it saying, [...] "O Cruel Irreligious piety!" [...] With this oxymoron - the Goth Queen Tamora's plea to spare her son from being sacrificed {{at the hands}} of the Andronici - Shakespeare starts the engine that drives the play - the engine that drives my music. it is fueled by the combustion of opposites: vengeance and forgiveness, purity and defilement, the grotesque and the sublime. But there is another byproduct - for this lamentable tale of woe oddly yields a great deal of irony and humor. In perhaps one of Shakespeare's most absurdist moments (Act III, scene i) the two heads of Titus' wrongly accused sons, and the General's own severed hand, are cruelly returned to him outside his home. At this nightmarish presentation, Titus inexplicably breaks into laughter. He then commands his handless daughter, Lavinia, to take up his severed hand between her teeth and enter the house. Performance after performance, production after production, audiences nervously laugh at this scene, thus falling into Shakespeare's ingenious trap: the playwright has devilishly induced the audience into a similar state to Titus' - involuntarily laughing at the horror. Such unexpected juxtapositions forced me to find unexpected musical solutions.But let me take you back to the beginning. Almost one year prior to the commencement of principal photography on Titus, I was encouraged by Julie Taymor and scenic designer Dante Ferretti to accompany them on location scouting in Rome. On day one, glancing at the Palatine Hills from a 1998 Fiat, we saw the great Circus Maximus with the ruins of privileged patricians' villas perched overhead, and I heard in my mind's ear an archetypal ancient percussion ensemble. In that same moment, another car pulled up alongside ours, equipped with a sub woofer - with the pentameters and hexameters of hip-hop blasting through every window. The music cross-faded as I watched a group of Andean pan flute players in native Bolivian garb hawking their tapes and playing their music, which was almost drowned out by an Elvis impersonator with a cheap karaoke setup - replete with cheesy reverb - singing [...] "Jailhouse Rock" [...] in a Neapolitan dialect...well, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> My mind was put at ease: in Rome - as in this film - it is possible in an instant to embrace æons.
