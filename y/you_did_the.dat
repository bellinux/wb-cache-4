I suspect that their families will suffer the more as they simply don't understand why <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>The</b> brutality of these ladies' deaths, designed by you to evade discovery, showing the coldness {{with which you}} dispatched them, is appalling. You should clearly have faced up like {{a man at the}} overwhelming nature of the Crown's case against you but you chose to put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial." [...] The motive for Smith's actions remained unclear after the trial, but police believed a [...] "lack of permanent sexual relations" [...] had been a contributing factor.|$|E
500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had thought <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E

I solicit {{the resignation of}} Prime Minister Victor Ponta", the president said after a meeting with Prime Minister Victor Ponta at the Cotroceni Palace. Shortly after Iohannis' request, Victor Ponta announced on Facebook that he doesn't resign, claiming that his term as prime minister depends on Parliament. Former President Traian Băsescu, {{one of the most}} vocal objectors of Victor Ponta, reacted vehemently by a post on Facebook: [...] "if you want not to do more harm than <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> country from 2012 until now, please do one simple thing: leave now!". Former Justice Minister and current European Member of Parliament Monica Macovei thinks Ponta's insistence on remaining head of government [...] "is an act of betrayal that discredits Romania".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{released}} the album's first single [...] "This Is Music" [...] in May, and it reached No.35, their first single {{to reach the}} Top 40. It was followed by [...] "On Your Own" [...] in June which performed even better, reaching No.28. This single was particularly new for the Verve {{as it was a}} soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single [...] "History", which reached No.24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: [...] "I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because {{it could have been the}} greatest time of our lives, with [...] "History" [...] doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{obtaining the}} summit of the ridge the allied column found itself facing the French {{infantry}} line. The French guards rose and advanced towards the crest, whereupon the two forces confronted each other at a distance of 30 paces. The moment was immortalised by Lord Charles Hay of the 1st Regiment of Guards who later wrote that he stepped forward, took out a hip flask and drank with a flourish, shouting out to his opponent, [...] "We are the English Guards, and we hope you will stand till we come up to you, and not swim the Scheldt as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Main at Dettingen." [...] He then led his men in three cheers. Voltaire's version of this famous episode has become proverbial. He wrote: [...] "The English officers saluted the French by doffing their hats … [...] the French, returned the greeting. My Lord Charles Hai, captain in the English Guards, cried, 'Gentlemen of the French Guards, fire.' The Comte d'Auteroche, then lieutenant of Grenadiers, shouted, 'Gentlemen, we never fire first; fire yourselves.'" [...] The French were the first to fire, the volley was somewhat ineffective but threw the Third Guards into some confusion and wounded George Churchill, the commander of the guards brigade. Captain Lord Panmure led the unbroken companies of the Third Guards to the flank of the First Guards. Up to this point the British column had not fired a single musket shot, but now the allied infantry poured a devastating discharge into the French. The volley of musketry with the battalion guns delivering numerous rounds of grape-shot, swept away the front rank of the ten battalions of the French first line, killing and wounding between 700–800 men, breaking the Gardes Françaises, while the Gardes Suisses and the four battalions of the Brigade Aubeterre were driven back by the British advance.|$|E
