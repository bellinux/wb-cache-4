The last Mariposa lily {{vanished}} from the burnt grasses as the California Indian summer dreamed itself out in purple mists on the windless air. Soft rain- showers first broke the spell. Snow fell on the summit of Sonoma Mountain. At the ranch house the morning air was crisp and brittle, yet mid-day made the shade welcome, and in the open, under the winter sun, roses bloomed and oranges, grape-fruit, and lemons turned to golden <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness.</b> Yet, a thousand feet beneath, {{on the floor of}} the valley, the mornings were white with frost.|$|E

30|$|Phenological {{development}} was reasonably well predicted for all {{regions of the}} North German Plain. Deviations between simulated and measured values were mostly within the standard deviation (Fig.  2, Tables  2, 3). This is in agreement with Palosuo et al. [21], who found DSSAT {{to be capable of}} reproducing the anthesis (EC 61) and <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness</b> (EC 90) dates of European wheat production, with comparable RMSE of approximately 6  days for anthesis and 8  days for <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness.</b> For maize, Vučetić [33] found satisfying results in predicting the phenology of maize in Zagreb, Croatia, predicting silking with R 2 [*]=[*] 0.71 and maturity with R 2 [*]=[*] 0.66, which is within the range documented in the present study (Table  2). Somewhat larger discrepancies became evident for the maize harvest, as indicated by high standard errors of up to 3  weeks (Tables  2, 3). Most likely {{this is due to the}} underlying database, where harvest was not differentiated among different production types, i.e. silage maize, corn cob mix and grain maize. The harvest date provided by DSSAT maize is physiological maturity, but the phenological data recorded in the North German Plain will contain a considerable proportion of maize harvested at silage maturity. In this respect, the different maturation behaviour of silage maize with respect to the maturity group and the maturation of stover compared to cob may have further contributed to larger deviations between the observed and simulated data. Nevertheless, the calibration parameter set can be regarded as valid to describe the phenological development of maize and wheat in the four regions. This is particularly true since other environmental factors, such as local water and nutrition supply, are generally not considered for phenological development in crop models [28].|$|E

6000|$|The August {{night had}} {{gathered}} by the time Basil Ransom, having finished his supper, stepped out upon the piazza of the little hotel. It was a very little hotel and of a very slight and loose construction; the tread of a tall Mississippian made the staircase groan and the windows rattle in their frames. He was very hungry when he arrived, having not had a moment, in Boston, on his way through, to eat even the frugal morsel with which he was accustomed to sustain nature between a breakfast that consisted of {{a cup of coffee}} and a dinner that consisted of a cup of tea. He had had his cup of tea now, and very bad it was, brought him by a pale, round-backed young lady, with auburn ringlets, a fancy belt, and an expression of limited tolerance for a gentleman who could not choose quickly between fried fish, fried steak, and baked beans. The train for Marmion left Boston at four o'clock in the afternoon, and rambled fitfully toward the southern cape, while the shadows grew long in the stony pastures and the slanting light gilded the straggling, shabby woods, and painted the ponds and marshes with <b>yellow</b> gleams. The <b>ripeness</b> of summer lay upon the land, and yet there was nothing in the country Basil Ransom traversed that seemed susceptible of maturity; nothing but the apples in the little tough, dense orchards, which gave a suggestion of sour fruition here and there, and the tall, bright goldenrod at the bottom of the bare stone dykes. There were no fields of yellow grain; only here and there a crop of brown hay. But there was a kind of soft scrubbiness in the landscape, and a sweetness begotten of low horizons, of mild air, with a possibility of summer haze, of unregarded inlets where on August mornings the water must be brightly blue. Ransom had heard that the Cape was the Italy, so to speak, of Massachusetts; it had been described to him as the drowsy Cape, the languid Cape, the Cape not of storms, but of eternal peace. He knew that the Bostonians had been drawn thither, for the hot weeks, by its sedative influence, by the conviction that its toneless air would minister to perfect rest. In a career in which there was so much nervous excitement as in theirs they had no wish to be wound up when they went out of town; they were sufficiently wound up at all times by the sense of all their sex had been through. They wanted to live idly, to unbend and lie in hammocks, and also to keep out of the crowd, the rush of the watering-place. Ransom could see there was no crowd at Marmion, as soon as he got there, though indeed there was a rush, which directed itself to the only vehicle in waiting outside of the small, lonely, hut-like station, so distant from the village that, as far as one looked along the sandy, sketchy road which was supposed to lead to it, one saw only an empty land on either side. Six or eight men in [...] "dusters," [...] carrying parcels and handbags, projected themselves upon the solitary, rickety carry-all, so that Ransom could read his own fate, while the ruminating conductor of the vehicle, a lean, shambling citizen, with a long neck and a tuft on his chin, guessed that if he wanted to get to the hotel before dusk he would have to strike out. His valise was attached in a precarious manner to the rear of the carry-all. [...] "Well, I'll chance it," [...] the driver remarked sadly, when Ransom protested against its insecure position. He recognised the southern quality of that picturesque fatalism--judged that Miss Chancellor and Verena Tarrant must be pretty thoroughly relaxed if they had given themselves up to the genius of the place. This was what he hoped for and counted on, as he took his way, the sole pedestrian in the group that had quitted the train, in the wake of the overladen carry-all. It helped him to enjoy the first country walk he had had for many months, for more than months, for years, that the reflexion was forced upon him as he went (the mild, vague scenery, just beginning to be dim with twilight, suggested it at every step) that the two young women who constituted, at Marmion, his whole prefigurement of a social circle, must, in such a locality as that, be taking a regular holiday. The sense of all the wrongs they had still to redress must be lighter there than it was in Boston; the ardent young man had, for the hour, an ingenuous hope that they had left their opinions in the city. He liked the very smell of the soil as he wandered along; cool, soft whiffs of evening met him at bends of the road which disclosed very little more--unless it might be a band of straight-stemmed woodland, keeping, a little, the red glow from the west, or (as he went further) an old house, shingled all over, grey and slightly collapsing, which looked down at him from a steep bank, at the top of wooden steps. He was already refreshed; he had tasted the breath of nature, measured his long grind in New York, without a vacation, with the repetition of the daily movement up and down the long, straight, maddening city, like a bucket in a well or a shuttle in a loom.|$|R

In the phase of <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness</b> all internodia were shortened more intensively. At the end of vegetation the degree of shortening amounted 25, 8 - 28, 9 % as compared to non – treated plots. 2.

40|$|Cereal crop {{species and}} {{varieties}} differ in competitive ability against weeds mainly as influenced by differences in canopy architecture. The FASSET crop model {{was used to}} separate {{the effects of a}} number of crop traits on the suppressive ability of winter wheat varieties and the ability to tolerate weeds. The model simulated the competition between different varieties of winter wheat and a sown grass mixture for light, water and nitrogen. Crop physiological parameters of eight varieties and one variety mixture were estimated from measurements in a 3 -year field experiment. The parameters estimated were thermal time from emergence to flag leaf appearance, thermal time from flag leaf appearance to anthesis, thermal time from anthesis to <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness,</b> height development rate and final plant height, specific leaf area, leaf area per N uptake, vertical displacement of leaf area, and extinction coefficient for light. Variety differences were found in most of the parameters. The varieties were evaluated in terms of their abilities for suppression and tolerance. A suppression index (SI) was defined as the ratio of grass biomass at start of grain filling in a specific variety divided by the average biomass over all cultivars. A tolerance index (TI) was defined as the slope of a linear regression between crop yield and weed biomass at anthesis. Significant variety differences were observed for SI, but not for TI.

40|$|Global {{climate change}} is {{predicted}} to shift seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns. An increasing frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves and prolonged droughts is predicted, but there are high levels of uncertainty {{about the nature of}} local changes. Crop adaptation will be important in reducing potential damage to agriculture. Crop diversity may enhance resilience to climate variability and changes that are difficult to predict. Therefore, there has to be sufficient diversity within the set of available cultivars in response to weather parameters critical for yield formation. To determine the scale of such ‘weather response diversity ’ within barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), an important crop in northern conditions, the yield responses {{of a wide range of}} modern and historical varieties were analysed according to a well-defined set of critical agro-meteorological variables. The Finnish long-term dataset of MTT Official Variety Trials was used together with historical weather records of the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The foci of the analysis were firstly to describe the general response of barley to different weather conditions and secondly to reveal the diversity among varieties in the sensitivity to each weather variable. It was established that barley yields were frequently reduced by drought or excessive rain early in the season, by high temperatures at around heading, and by accelerated temperature sum accumulation rates during periods 2 weeks before heading and between heading and <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness.</b> Low temperatures early in the seaso...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: FN, protein {{percent and}} gluten quality are amongst the most {{important}} quality parameters that determine the baking quality of wheat. Rainfall after physiological maturity causes PHS which reduces grain quality and value. To {{determine the effect of}} delayed harvest on PHS five spring wheat cultivars were used such that they were harvested one week after <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness,</b> and then in 3 days interval for a period of six weeks. FN for each variety and harvest time was determined, as well as protein content and SDS sedimentation volume. Data from another set of wheat samples was used to study the effect of environment and nitrogen fertilizer on these quality parameters. This comprised data from the on-going research project, Future Wheat obtained from field trials of 12 varieties which were grown in Vollebekk and Apelsvoll in 2009, 2010 and 2011. FN, protein content and SDS sedimentation value was determined for each varieties and locations. Results showed that FN, protein content and SDS sedimentation values were affected by delayed harvest. The FN showed stable and high values for a long time period (approximately one month), and then it decreased. Except Demonstrant all other 4 varieties maintained FN > 200 (threshold level set for bread wheat in Norway) until last harvest. These results are discussed against the actual weather data and the development of dormancy. Significant effects of environment, variety and N fertilization were found for FN, protein content, SDS sedimentation value and specific SDS value. Additional N fertilization at heading increased protein content and SDS sedimentation values in all varieties...|$|E
40|$|During {{a three-year}} period (2002 - 2004), {{studies were carried out}} on {{nitrogen}} dynamics and losses during cultivation of winter wheat as influenced by disease and insect attacks. Three treatments with different degrees of plant protection (fungicides and pesticides??) were tested in a field trial on a silty clay soil in south-western Sweden. The wheat crop was continually inspected for pests and diseases. Direct measurements of nitrogen leaching were performed in tile-drained field plots equipped with individual collectors for drainage water. Ammonia emissions from the wheat stands were measured in one replicate plot during the first two growing seasons. Nitrogen accumulation and distribution in plants were investigated by sampling the crop at different stages of development and analysing different plant parts for total nitrogen content. Soil mineral nitrogen was determined within the 0 - 90 cm soil layer in early spring, at <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness</b> and in November. Grain yield and grain nitrogen efficiency were always significantly larger and mean residual soil mineral nitrogen levels (at maturity and in November) significantly lower in the treatments with crop protection. At maturity, total N concentration in the straw was significantly higher in the treatment without plant protection. Mean nitrogen leaching was greater in the treatment without crop protection but the differences were not statistically significant. Ammonia emissions tended to be somewhat smaller in fungicide-treated wheat stands, but were very small in all treatments. The better N use efficiency with crop protection was probably due to a combination of larger N amounts in above-ground plant parts and better N translocation to grain when diseases were reduced...|$|E
40|$|During {{a three-year}} period studies of {{nitrogen}} dynamics, the utilization ratio of nitrogen by crops, and the leaching of nitrogen by tile drainage water in sandy soil in south-western Sweden. The field was divided into ten separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 0. 16 hectare. The amount of drainage water from each plot was measured and water samples were collected twice a month and weekly during flood periods. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus an potassium. The fertilizer regimes were: Unfertilized, commercial fertilizer according to general recommendations (90 - 110 kg/ha), liquid manure (pig slurry) in spring or autumn (90 - 110 tot. N kg/ha) supplemented with commercial fertilizer applied in the spring (45 - 55 N kg/ha) and treatments with double amount of liquid manure applied in spring or autumn also supplemented with commersial fertilizer. all treatments were grown with and without a catch crop exept the treatments with autumn application of mature that are {{required by law to}} be followed by a green cover during the winter. During the first two years, Ialian ryegrass, and in the year perennial ryegrass wass grown as catch crop. The ryegrass was undersown in the main crop. The grop rotation was: Oat (1989), spring wheat (1990) an barley (1991). The treatments with ryegrass were ploughed in the spring whereas the other treatments were ploughed in the autumn after stubble cultivation following harvest. The catch crop reduced the spring leaching substially in the single dose treatments with only commersial fertilizer and in th combined system with both manure and commercial fertilizer. The reduction was as high as 74 and 78 %, respectively, but in the treatment with a double dose of pig slurry the reduction stopped at 50 %. When pig slurry was applied in the autumn, the losses were doubled compared to spring application in spite of the catch crop. The unfertilized treatment (8 years) without a cac crop had 50 % less leaching compared with treatments with springapplied normal doses of fertilizers without a catch crop. The yield in the unfertilized treatment was only 34 % of the yield in the treatment with a normal dose of commercial fertilicer. The treatment with a singel dose of manure and half a dose of commercial fertilizer, bothe appliedin the spring, gave 7 % higher yield but a more lodged stand compared with the treatment with a single dose of commercial fertilize. The last two treatments had the best nitrogen utilization ration (82 % of applied N was taken away by the grain yield). A double dose of manure lowered both the yield and the nitrogen utilization ratio indipendent of time of application. The main reason for this was higher lodging tendency and higher leaching values. The cath crop lowered the yield (7 - 24 %) both in 1989 and 1990 in the treatment with spring-applied fertilizers. Also the fertilizer utilization ration was lower in the catch crop treatments. But in 1991 the diffferences were smaller. The main reason for this seems to be a delivery by mineralization from organic nitrogen from earlier ploughed-in catch crops. Important reasons for the drop in yield in the treatments with a catch crop seem to be competition with the main crop and large deficiency of mineral nitrogen in the early spring compared with treatments without a catch crop. Any net immobilization of nitrogen following the ploughing-in of cath crop could not be verified. At the time of <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness</b> for the cereals, the intersown ryegrass had taken up 7 - 14 N kg/ha in the standing crop (above ground) {{and in the middle of}} November 11 - 90 N kg/ha, most in treatments were the nitrogen supply was good, such as in treatments with autumn application of manure or in treatments where the frequent use of manure had enlargeed the mineralization capacity of the soil. In the autumn the dry matter content of the catch crop varied between 800 - 2700 kg d. w. per hectare. From last autumn to early spring the N content of ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil (0 - 90 cm) from the time of <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness</b> to late autumn exept in the treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a catch crop, the nitrogen mineralization capacity of the soil. In late autumn the dry matter content of the ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amounts of mineral nitrogen in the soil 80 - 90 cm) from the time of wellow ripeness to late autumn exept in the treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a catch crop, the nitrogen mineralization increased in the storage of mineral nitrogen throughout the autumn, leading to a higher leaching during the following winter compared with treatments with a catch crop. In the treatments with a catch crop, the mineral nitrogen storage continued to be fairly small until the time of spring ploughing. During the time from spring ploughing with a catch crop than in corresponding treatments without a catch crop. Yearly application of manure enlarged the delivery of mineral nitrogen from the soil compared with to treatments without manure. The delivery was also lowered in the treatment without any fertilizer application. Calculations show that a frequent manure addition gave an enlarged nitrogen leachong magnitude, as well as increased ammoniavolatilization and denitrification. In the autumn-ploughed treatments without a catch crop, the net mineralization of nitrogen from the time of <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness</b> to early spring was higher than in the treatments with catch crop and spring ploughing. However, during the growing season, the minratlization was higher in the treatments with a catch crop and spring ploughing. Thus, it seems as if anutumn ploughing stimulates the mineral N-mobilization during winter. In the treatments with a spring ploughed catch crop, the net mineralization during growing season is enlarged. The amounths of nitrogen mineralization also increased during the years, suggesting an additional influence of several years durration given by the ryegrass residues. The combination of a cath crop and spring ploughing therefore seems to both diminish leaching losses though retention of nitrogen in plants and plant residues, and futher offer a possibility to govern nitrogen prosesses in the soil in such a way that nitrogen ta a greater extent will released when it can be utilized by the crop...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the solid}} {{biofuels}} {{that can be}} produced in agriculture, straw is often considered to have the greatest potential. However, there is some uncertainty regarding the quantities available, e. g. due to decreasing straw length {{as a result of}} modern plant breeding. This study had four main objectives: a) to investigate the cultivation areas and yields of different straw crops in the counties of Sweden, b) to present straw:grain-ratios {{that can be used to}} estimate the quantities of straw available with respect to the varieties used today, c) to estimate the quantities of straw available in each county for fuel purposes after deducting the quantities used in animal husbandry, and d) to investigate the time of crop harvest. As expected, the largest areas of straw crop cultivation were located in the plain counties (Skåne, Västra Götaland, Östergötland, Uppsala and Södermanland). During the period 1989 - 2008, the cultivation of winter wheat and spring wheat increased in most counties, while the cultivation of winter rye decreased markedly. The cultivation areas of barley and particularly of oats also decreased. The area of oilseed crops decreased considerably during the same period, although it has increased again in recent years. Yields per hectare increased somewhat for most crops, e. g. that of winter wheat increased by 0. 5 % per year in the county of Skåne. The quantities of straw available for harvest are usually estimated by means of the straw:grain ratio. In comparison to earlier studies, this study showed that straw:grain ratio has declined considerably during recent decades. The composition of a total of 147 samples taken during the harvest seasons 2007 - 08 in the counties of Skåne, Blekinge, Halland, Västra Götaland and Uppsala in terms of quantity of straw in relation to quantity of grain was as shown in the table below. The figures are weighted with respect to the cultivation areas of different varieties, and they are valid for a stubble height of 20 cm (40 cm for the oilseed crops). It was concluded that the ratios varied greatly depending on variety, conventional/organic cultivation, weather conditions, etc. The straw:grain ratios obtained were used to estimate the quantities of fuel straw in all Swedish counties. The physical quantities were reduced by multiplying them by a harvest coefficient that accounted for restrictions regarding rain during harvest, low soil organic matter contents, etc. The quantities used for fodder and bedding were then deducted. Surplus straw was found in the counties of Skåne, Östergötland, Västra Götaland, Uppsala, Västmanland, Södermanland, Örebro and Stockholm. The total annual surplus was nearly one million tonne, corresponding to 3 - 4 TWh. The median dates for harvest of winter wheat, winter rye, spring wheat, spring barley and oats were estimated using data from the Swedish objective crop yield surveys for the period 1980 - 92 and data on <b>yellow</b> <b>ripeness</b> times for the varieties used at that time and today. A deeper analysis was also carried out regarding the starting date and duration of winter wheat harvest in the counties of Malmöhus, Skaraborg and Uppsala. The results showed that on average, the harvest period in e. g. Malmöhus had started on 13 August (the most common date was 3 August), that half the area was combined by 21 August, and that harvesting lasted for about 13 days suitable for combining (these figures were valid for the county as a whole; locally the harvest period, for example, may be considerably shorter) ...|$|E
