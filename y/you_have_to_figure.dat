I was reporting on the lingerie business and perfume launches — what everybody at Women's Wear Daily has to start off with. That's where you learn about the industry; that's the baptism by fire. You learn about fabrics, you have to cover Premiere Vision, which is the big fabric fair in Paris, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out who the perfume nose is at Christian Dior {{and the difference between}} the fragrances.

The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in [...] "The Bubble", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, {{and the arrival of}} Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast.

Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all summer <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out how <b>to</b> get yourself out of it".

According to music {{supervisor}} Randall Poster, [...] "One {{of the great}} creative breakthroughs we had was that we, talking to Neil Burger the director, really looked at Kanye's Yeezus record and 'Black Skinhead' in particular and said, 'You know what, musically this sounds like the world of Dauntless, obviously, the lyrical topicality {{was not going to}} work for us and so doing some exploration we sort of landed on this DJ producer Gesaffelstein who worked with Kanye West." [...] Randall further talked about the soundtrack album, [...] "I {{think that one of the}} challenges for a movie like this is that it's set in the future and so <b>you</b> sort of <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out, 'OK, what might music in the future sound like?' The film is actually set not in a perfected future, but actually kind of in a future world that is deteriorating. And so we wanted to create a musical element that had reflected on current music sounds, but also felt kind of time-forward and had a certain futuristic element. Really our notion was to find music that was dangerous, tribal and had electronic elements without really being dance-y." ...|$|R

In carriage deals that the company struck with major cable channel owners such as A&E Networks, The Walt Disney Company and Scripps Networks Interactive during 2014, Dish Network obtained the over-the-top distribution rights to their networks as part of clauses incorporated into the agreements pertaining to its existing direct broadcast satellite service - a move {{that served as a}} stepping stone for Dish towards launching a mainstream OTT offering. In November 2014, Dish Network chairman Charlie Ergen explained that the company planned to launch its OTT service {{by the end of that}} year, and was aiming for the package to retail for around $30 per month. He explained: [...] "the regular linear MVPD business is a mature business.

Here's to hoping that {{the second half of the}} season begins to take all of those interesting story lines and make something of them." [...] Phil Nugent of The A.V. Club would prefer the series to center more on Cullen.
