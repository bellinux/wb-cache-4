25|$|The {{traditional}} Rabbinical Jewish {{belief is}} that the observance of these commandments and the other mitzvot are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven Noahide laws, several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

500|$|John, which {{regularly}} describes Jesus' opponents {{simply as}} [...] "the Jews", is more consistently hostile to [...] "the Jews" [...] {{than any other}} body of New Testament writing. Historian and former Roman Catholic priest James Carroll states: [...] "The climax of this movement comes in chapter 8 of John, when Jesus is portrayed as denouncing 'the Jews' who were gathered at the Temple as the offspring of Satan." [...] In [...] Jesus tells the Jews: [...] "You are of <b>your</b> <b>father</b> the devil, and the desires of <b>your</b> <b>father</b> you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him." [...] In [...] and , [...] "the Jews" [...] are depicted as wishing to kill Jesus.

[...] Josh Weinstein called {{it one of the}} most [...] "real" [...] episodes, commenting that every character in the episode, from Superintendent Chalmers to Lisa, acts like a real person throughout.

500|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, the anti-German {{sentiment}} in Britain {{during the war}} is repeatedly referenced.

Blackadder takes the chance to [...] "interrogate" [...] Captain Darling, who vehemently denies being a spy and says that he is [...] "as British as Queen Victoria", to which Blackadder sarcastically replies [...] "So <b>your</b> <b>father</b> is German, you're half German and you married a German?". Blackadder's retort references the fact that Victoria {{was a member of the}} House of Hanover and that her husband was a prince from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1917, Victoria's grandson King George V changed the royal house name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in an effort to appease British nationalist feelings.|$|E

500|$|Jane was {{in contact}} with Irish Land League leaders, {{including}} John Dillon and William O'Brien, and lobbied {{for the release of}} the latter after his imprisonment under the Coercion Act of 1881. She and her sisters supported the Irish Plan of Campaign, a scheme whereby tenants acted collectively to secure fair rents from their landlords. This plan was eventually denounced by the Roman Catholic Church as contrary to natural justice and Christian charity, although some priests supported it. [...] The attachment of Jane and her sisters to the rebellious factions in Ireland strained relations between the sisters and many of their father's former Liberal Unionist colleagues, but won approval from Thomas Bayley Potter, who had succeeded Richard Cobden as MP for Rochdale. In October 1887 he wrote to Jane: [...] "You are true to the living and just instincts of <b>your</b> <b>father...</b> You know your father's heart better than John Bright does".|$|E
