500|$|Allmusic's Clayton Bolger {{described}} Young Modern as {{an improvement}} by the band, praising [...] "catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements". He claimed {{the album was}} the pinnacle of the band's development. PopMatters' Nick Pearson saw the opposite, claiming that [...] "nce you reach the level of intellectual maturity where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair". Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales, after the success of past works, calling it more boring than its predecessors. Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band XTC.|$|E
500|$|Nick Pearson of PopMatters, meanwhile, was {{critical}} of the album. He began his review with the statement [...] "Once you reach the level of intellectual maturity where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair", and continued {{in the same fashion}} throughout. Pearson likened Johns to Kurt Cobain, saying they share a common inability; [...] "his inability to write lyrics". His only praise was for the third single released from the album, [...] "If You Keep Losing Sleep", stating [...] "'If You Keep Losing Sleep' is proof that Silverchair are capable of recording interesting music".|$|E
500|$|James {{had several}} unique {{experiences}} while {{living with the}} Smith family in Nauvoo. She recorded that often, as she went about doing the washing and cleaning for the Smiths, either Emma (Joseph's wife) or Lucy (Joseph's mother) would stop her and talk with her. One day while James was in Joseph's mother's room, the woman told her to [...] "bring me that bundle from the bureau and sit down here." [...] According to Jane, she was shown the Urim and Thummim, the tools used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon. Lucy then said to her, [...] "You will live long after I am dead and gone and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and Thummim". Another time, Emma asked James if {{she would like to}} be adopted by and sealed to her and Joseph. Not understanding at the time, James said nothing. Emma encouraged her to think about it. Two weeks later, she asked James again, at which time she said [...] "no m'am". James would say later that she did not understand what that meant, or she would have taken the couple up on their offer. This early decision {{had a significant impact on}} James' later life as a member of the Latter Day Saint church.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
