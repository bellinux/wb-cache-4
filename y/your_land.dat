John Muir had long been in the habit of sending Coolbrith letters, and the occasional box of fruit such as cherries picked from the trees on his Martinez estate, and he made such an offering in late 1894, accompanied by a suggestion for a new career which he thought would keep her in the area—she could fill the position of San Francisco's librarian, recently vacated by John Vance Cheney. Coolbrith sent a response to Muir, thanking him for [...] "the fruit of <b>your</b> <b>land,</b> and the fruit of your brain". After signing the letter [...] "your old-time friend", she added a post-script comment: [...] "No, I cannot have Mr. Cheney's place. I am disqualified by sex."

Cooder did not tour in promotion of Election Special, as the Kennedy Center was his last show. In an interview for The Strand at the time, he expressed disinterest in playing larger concert venues for the album, finding them more suitable for [...] "fame" [...] purposes rather than spreading a political message.

2500|$|The {{plague of}} locusts in [...] finds {{parallels}} in several ancient texts, often involving {{the actions of}} gods. [...] The ancient Sumerian tale The Disputation Between the Hoe and the Plow relates the acts of the god Enlil’s hand and the locust swarm. Similarly, an Ugaritic poem about the goddess Anat circa 1450–1200 BCE related how Anat did battle, leaving corpses like locusts. In a New Kingdom Egyptian letter, one scribe chided another for leaving scribal work to labor in agriculture, where “The mice abound in the field, the locust descends, the cattle devour.” An Akkadian prophecy foretold that locusts would arise and devour the land. The 754 BCE treaty between Ashur-nirari V of Assyria and Mati'ilu of Arpad, Syria, provided that if Mati'ilu violated the treaty, “May locusts appear and devour his land.” Similarly, the treaty between Ktk and Arpad struck at about 750 BCE provided: “If Matti’el is false to Barga’yah and to his son and to his offspring [...] [...] [...] May Hadad pour out everything evil on earth and in heaven, and every trouble. [...] And may he pour out hailstones upon Arpad. [...] Seven years shall the locust eat. [...] Seven years shall the worm eat. [...] Seven years shall blight come upon the face of its land, and no grass shall sprout, so that nothing green can be seen and its vegetation does not appear.” And the Vassal-Treaties of Esarhaddon, who ruled the Neo-Assyrian Empire 681–669 BCE, threatened the vassal who breached the treaty with these threats: “May Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, {{put an end to}} vegetation in <b>your</b> <b>land,</b> may he avoid your meadows and hit <b>your</b> <b>land</b> with a severe destructive downpour, may locusts, which diminish the produce of the land, devour your crops, let there be no sound of the grinding stone or the oven in your houses, let barley rations to be ground disappear for you, so that they grind your bones, (the bones of) your sons and daughters instead of barley rations, and not even the (first) joint of your finger should be able to dip into the dough, may the [...] [...] [...] eat the dough from your troughs[...] [...] [...] May they (the gods) let lice, caterpillars, and other field pests eat up <b>your</b> <b>land</b> and your district as if locusts.” An Assyrian blessing wished: “The evil locust which ravages the grain, the malignant grasshopper which dries up the orchards, which would cut off the regular offerings of god and goddess, — Enlil listens to you, Tutu obeys you — may it (the grasshopper) be counted as nought!” ...|$|E

For six years you may plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest your crops, but the seventh year is a sabbath of sabbaths for the land. It is God's sabbath during which you may not plant your fields, nor prune your vineyards. Do not harvest crops that grow on their own and do not gather the grapes on your unpruned vines, since it is a year of rest for the land. [...] the land is resting may be eaten by you, by your male and female slaves, and by the {{employees}} and resident hands who live with you. All the crops shall be eaten by the domestic and wild animals that are in your land." [...] (Leviticus 25:1–7) [...] "And if ye shall say: 'What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase'; then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store." [...] (Leviticus 25:20–22) [...] " [...] I will scatter you among the nations, and keep the sword drawn against you. <b>Your</b> <b>land</b> will remain desolate, and your cities in ruins. Then, as long as the land is desolate and you are in your enemies' land, the land will enjoy its sabbaths. The land will rest and enjoy its sabbatical years. Thus, {{as long as it is}} desolate, [...] will enjoy the sabbatical rest that you would not give it when you lived there." [...] (Leviticus 26:33-35) ...|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, Italy and France many clergyman and {{university}} professors gave speeches saying all of Europe owed a huge debt to ancient Greece, {{that the modern}} Greeks were entitled to call upon the classical heritage {{as a reason for}} support and Greece only achieve progress with freedom from the Ottoman Empire. A young medical student in Mannheim wrote that hearing his professor lecture on the need for Greek freedom went through him like an electric shock, inspiring to drop his studies and head to Greece while a Danish student wrote: [...] "How could a man inclined to fight for freedom and justice find a better place than next to the oppressed Greeks?". In France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, the United States and many other places [...] "Greek committees" [...] were established to raise funds and supplies for the revolution. The classicist Edward Everett, professor of Greek at Harvard, was active in championing the Greek cause in the United States and in November 1821 published an appeal from Adhamantios Korais reading [...] "To the Citizens of the United States, it is <b>your</b> <b>land</b> that Liberty has fixed her abode, so you will not assuredly imitate the culpable indifference or rather the long ingratitude of the Europeans", going on to call for American intervention, in several American newspapers. In 1821, the Greek committee in Charleston, South Carolina sent the Greeks 50 barrels of salted meat while the Greek Committee in Springfield, Massachusetts sent supplies of salted meat, sugar, fish and flour. Newspapers in the United States gave the war much coverage and were overwhelmingly pro-Greek in their stance, which explains why American public opinion was so supportive. In New York City, one ball put on by the Greek committee raised $8, 000 dollars. In Russia, the St. Petersburg Greek committee under Prince Alexander Golitsyn had raised 973, 500 roubles by August 1822. By the end of the war, millions of roubles had been fund-raised in Russia for the relief of refugees and to buy Greeks enslaved freedom (through the government forbade buying arms for the Greeks), but no Russian is known to have gone to fight with the Greeks.|$|E
