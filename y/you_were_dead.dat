5|$|After Simpson's {{decision}} {{to focus on}} Fightstar, the band entered Criterion Studios in London with producer Mark Williams to begin work on their first EP, They Liked You Better When <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Dead.</b> It was released as a mini-album, containing nine tracks written during the six months Simpson and Westaway lived together. Recording sessions were often interrupted, since Simpson {{was in the midst}} of a sold-out series of Wembley shows with Busted.|$|E
5|$|Fightstar are a British post-hardcore {{band from}} London, England that formed in 2003. The band is {{composed}} of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock, emo and other genres into their general post-hardcore sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. Their live shows got a more positive reaction, and their 2005 debut EP, They Liked You Better When <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Dead,</b> was a critical success.|$|E

Oakwood was a [...] "restricted community"; Jews {{were not allowed}} to reside or own stores there. According to Leonard Spialter, president of the Dayton Jewish Genealogical Society, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>dead,</b> you could be buried in Oakwood, but if you were alive, you couldn’t live there". Relatives began moving those buried at the Rubicon cemetery to the new [...] "Riverview Cemetery", including Lebensburger, who had died by this time. This process was not completed until 1967.|$|E

500|$|Kraft could, however, {{be a tough}} taskmaster, {{making it}} clear that there was no place in the flight {{operations}} division for those who {{failed to live up to}} his exacting standards. [...] "To err is human," [...] went one of his favorite sayings, [...] "but to do so more than once is contrary to Flight Operations Directorate policy." [...] Subordinates who seriously displeased Kraft could find themselves deprived of the opportunity to make it up to him. Kraft possessed the power to end careers at Johnson Space Center; as mission controller Sy Liebergot recalled, [...] "if he was behind you, you had as much leverage as you needed; if he was against you, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>dead</b> meat." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of They Liked You Better When <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Dead,</b> the band were approached by their management about whom they wanted to produce their debut full-length album. They requested Colin Richardson; initially sceptical about their chances, Richardson agreed to collaborate after he listened to their demos. Fightstar entered studios in west London and Surrey with Richardson in October 2005. Richardson, who had previously produced albums for Funeral for a Friend, Machine Head and Fear Factory, was meticulous during pre-production and took five days to tune the drums. When recording began, he called the band [...] "very focused" [...] and {{said that there was}} a [...] "real buzz because nobody knows what to expect." [...] Grand Unification is a loose concept album, influenced by and based on the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series. With lyrics loosely based on the personal experiences of Charlie Simpson and Alex Westaway, its underlying concept revolves around two people who experience the last few days of their lives {{before the end of the}} world.|$|E
500|$|They Liked You Better When <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Dead,</b> {{released}} on 28 February 2005 {{after a brief}} UK promotional tour. It was a critical success, though Punknews.org reviewed it negatively. Alex Westaway, the band's lead guitarist and co-lyricist, drew its artwork (based on Edward Norton) for the booklet; the EP's lead single, [...] "Palahniuk's Laughter", was inspired by David Fincher's film Fight Club (1999), which in turn {{was based on the}} novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. [...] "Palahniuk's Laughter" [...] received heavy rotation on music-video channels and spent many weeks on charts based on video and radio requests. The track, originally entitled [...] "Out Swimming in the Flood", was renamed after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The EP's UK version contained five tracks (including a sixth hidden track), and was ineligible for the UK Singles Chart. It was released the following year in North America as an extended mini-album by Deep Elm Records. The release was praised by critics, despite initial scepticism due to Simpson's former pop career with Busted.|$|E
