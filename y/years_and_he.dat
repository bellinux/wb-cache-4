5|$|As a child, Keenor had a keen {{interest}} in football, using tennis balls or rags tied together to form a ball, due to the expensive nature of footballs at the time, to play the game in his local streets. He attended Stacey Road primary school in Adamsdown and captained the school's football team for several <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was later selected to represent the city of Cardiff's schoolboy team. One of his former teachers at the school, Walter Riden, would later go on to join the board at Cardiff City while Keenor was a player.|$|E

His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.|$|E

5|$|In February 1959, formal {{authority}} for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some {{officials from the}} Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so {{the start of the}} construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished within four <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.|$|E

5|$|While {{wandering}} in the woods, Finn and Jake fall down two separate holes. Finn {{lands in the}} Kingdom of Huge, where he is greeted by its sovereign, King Huge. The king lavishes Finn with food and asks that he stay and watch the chiming of his cuckoo clock. However, it soon becomes apparent that King Huge is insane; he demands that Finn remain and watch every time the clock chimes the hour. Meanwhile, Jake lands on the barge of a bear named Seven. According to Seven, the barge has been falling for <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> warns Jake not to try and escape, lest he die.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{was born}} and raised in Huyton, Merseyside. He began his {{football}} career with Manchester City in 2002 after working his way through their youth system. His appearances in the first team gradually increased over the following five <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> made more than 150 for the club. He earned his first cap for the England national team in February 2007, despite his criticism of some of the team's players. He then joined Newcastle United for a fee of £5.8million in July 2007. After four years with the club, he joined Queens Park Rangers in August 2011, from where he was loaned to Marseille in 2012. He returned from his loan spell the following season, and helped QPR to promotion to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs. However, QPR were relegated again, and Barton was released at the end of the season. He signed a one-year deal to play for Burnley in 2015, helping them win promotion to the Premier League, but left to join Rangers in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E

5|$|In 1936 Mitchell-Innes {{was elected}} {{captain of the}} Oxford team. The side lacked the batting {{strength}} of the previous <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was forced to move himself from his preferred position of batting at number three or four, to open the batting during the season. The batting suffered a further blow {{just prior to the}} University match when Roger Kimpton suffered an injury and was unable to play. Along with Kimpton, Mitchell-Innes led the batting averages by a large margin, having scored 917 runs at 43.66. He also reached his highest score in first-class cricket against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, scoring 207 runs. Oxford lost more matches than they won during the season, including an eight-wicket loss to Cambridge in the University match. Despite the loss, the match was Mitchell-Innes' most successful contest against Cambridge, as he scored 43 and 84. During this season, Mitchell-Innes had his most effective spell as a bowler, taking 22 wickets for Oxford at an average of 26.27, but Bolton described the team's bowling performances as unremarkable.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Kilburn entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, {{with a state}} scholarship, {{a county}} major scholarship, and a minor open scholarship, where he studied mathematics. Although many {{university}} dons were absent performing war work at places like Bletchley Park, and the University of Cambridge maintained a vigorous mathematical community, and Kilburn became the Sidney Sussex College representative in the New Pythagoreans, a clique with the Cambridge University Mathematical Society that also numbered Gordon Welchman and Geoff Tootill among its members. Due to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, courses were compressed to two <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> graduated in 1942 with First Class Honours in Part I of the Mathematical Tripos and preliminary examinations for Part II.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Chadwick {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He {{increased the number of}} research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In {{what became known as the}} Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA.|$|E

5|$|The River Slea {{rises to}} the west of Sleaford, near Ancaster, and flows in an easterly direction, passing through Sleaford on its way to South Kyme, beyond which it is called the Kyme Eau, joining the River Witham at Chapel Hill. Kyme Eau had been navigable since at least the reign of Edward III, for in 1375 Gilbert d'Umframville was accused of {{illegally}} collecting tolls on boats carrying food products to the people of Kesteven. He had been doing so for 12 <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> defended his case before the king, explaining that the river was navigable from Dog Dyke to Brent Fen, but that it suffered from silting and the banks were in a poor state of repair. Having agreed to carry out repairs, he was granted the right to levy tolls by letters patent.|$|E
5|$|Born in Barranquilla, Colombia, Rentería {{was signed}} by the Florida Marlins in 1992. He debuted with them in 1996, and he {{finished}} second to Todd Hollandsworth in Rookie of the Year Award balloting. In 1997, his RBI single off Charles Nagy in the eleventh inning of Game 7 of the 1997 World Series won the first World Series in Marlins' history.
