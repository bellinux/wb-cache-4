5000|$|Due {{to stage}} hypnotists' showmanship, {{many people believe}} that {{hypnosis}} is a form of mind control. However, the effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of relatively ordinary social psychological factors such as peer pressure, social compliance, participant selection, ordinary suggestibility, and some amount of physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery. The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please are thought to convince subjects to [...] "play along". Books written by stage hypnotists sometimes explicitly describe the use of deception in their acts. For example, Ormond McGill's New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis describes an entire [...] "fake hypnosis" [...] act which depends upon the use of private whispers throughout:hypnotist whispers off-microphone: [...] "We are going to have some good laughs on the audience and fool them ... so when I tell you to do some funny things, do exactly as I secretly tell <b>you.</b> <b>Okay?</b> Swell." [...] (Then deliberately wink at the spectator in a friendly fashion.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes the baiting went both ways. As {{depicted}} in the documentary Giuliani Time, Parkinson's disease patient John Hynes called Giuliani's show in January 2000 to complain about being cut off from Medicaid after paying more than $100,000 of taxes in his life before he was disabled with the disease. Hynes accused the New York City Human Resources Administration of repeatedly opening fraud investigations on him, then dropping the case for lack of evidence, only to re-open it. Hynes told Giuliani, [...] "The biggest thing you could do to reduce crime would be to resign, sir. Crime would drop like a rock if you resigned. You're the biggest criminal in the city." [...] Giuliani responded, [...] "What kind of little hole are you in there, John? It sounds like {{you are in a}} little hole. JOHN! Are <b>you</b> <b>okay</b> there? You're breathing funny." [...] Hynes replied: [...] "No, I'm not okay. I'm sick, and you cut me off my food stamps and Medicaid several times; but I suppose you don't give a damn about that either." [...] Giuliani replied, [...] "There's something really wrong with you there, John. I can hear it in your voice.... Now, why don't you stay on the line. We'll take your name and your number and we'll send you psychiatric help, 'cause you seriously need it." [...] After Hynes hung up, Giuliani continued, [...] "Man! Look, it's a big city, and you get some real weirdos who hang out in this city, and that's what I was worried about on, uh, New Year's Eve. I wasn't, you know - I figured, the terrorist groups and all that we could keep under control - worried, but who knows what, what's living in some cave somewhere. So, uh, and John called up. John calls up from Queens, but who knows where he's from." [...] Hynes subsequently said, [...] "Mr. Giuliani showed a total lack of respect for all disabled people when he mocked me after I revealed that I was sick." ...|$|E

In this paper, I explore the relationship between vulnerability and meaningful human connection, via sources such as Brene Brown, Alphonso Lingis, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and John Berger. I also explore the relationship that sensitivity and tenderness, both qualities of and tools for approaching vulnerability, have to connection and touch. I explore other forms of touch - the touch of sight and the touch of words. Then, I illustrate these themes through both the work of other artists, {{as well as my}} own, including my master’s thesis exhibitions, The Better Choice and I Love You Are <b>You</b> <b>Okay,</b> 2017...|$|E
