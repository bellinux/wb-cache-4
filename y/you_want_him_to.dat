[...] "What he does is get {{underneath}} your skin, whoever he's negotiating with, because he figures out what your objectives are, your angles. He understands the market; he understands the players. He's a brash, arrogant, egotistical, aggressive negotiator, which is good, because when you have someone represent you, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do that. Marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one {{who came up with}} the concept of 'Air Jordan.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Boras has {{represented}} Holliday as his agent since he turned professional. [...] Holliday described {{his relationship with}} Boras and his staff in that he [...] "enjoy(s) sitting down and talking to them. [...] Scott is as accessible as <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be. [...] I could call him right now. He's {{got a lot of}} clients and people say they don’t hear from Scott but he’ll give you as much or as little attention as you want." [...] Holliday further explained that due to the amenities the Boras Corporation provides, including a staff psychologist, research to assist players in prolonging careers, studies into arbitration cases, and statistical performance computation, he felt that Boras' agency gave him the best opportunities to succeed.|$|E
500|$|The {{sentencing}} {{phase of}} the trial began on October 18, 2010, during which the jurors had to decide if Hayes should be executed or imprisoned for life. The second day of these deliberations began on November 6, 2010. Attorney Thomas Ullman told the jury that a sentence of life in prison would be the harshest possible punishment for his client Hayes, {{because he was so}} tormented by his crimes and would be isolated in prison. [...] "Life in prison without the possibility of release is the harshest penalty," [...] Ullman said. [...] "It is a fate worse than death. If you want to end his misery, put him to death," [...] he added. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> suffer and carry that burden forever, the guilt, shame, and humiliation, sentence him to life without the possibility of release." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Jean, the episode's table read went [...] "great" [...] {{until the}} third act. The Simpsons writers found the third act [...] "pretty challenging" [...] to write, because by having Homer's jaws wired shut, they [...] "took [...] funniest character" [...] and [...] "remove comedy." [...] In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Selman {{described it as}} [...] "It's the comedy of saying: 'Oh, he [...] can't do all the stuff <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do'." [...] It was also hard to [...] "keep the story moving" [...] back to normal, since they kept having to [...] "re-use the premise". The episode features American comedian John Kassir {{as one of the}} dogs in the gay pride parade {{in the beginning of the}} episode. Barbara Walters and Star Jones, the hosts of The View, were portrayed by American voice-actor Tress MacNeille. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Jean stated that MacNeille is [...] "very versatile". Lisa Ling and Joy Behar were portrayed by voice-actor Pamela Hayden.|$|E
500|$|On February 1, 2008, Bako {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. At the end of spring training, he {{was added to the}} 40-man roster. Though he batted only [...]217, Bako appeared in a career-high 99 games in 2008, hitting six home runs and notching 35 RBIs. On January 30, 2009, the Chicago Cubs signed Bako to a one-year contract. However, he was unconditionally released near the end of spring training. On May 18, Bako signed {{a minor league}} deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was called up from the Reading Phillies to the Major League roster on June 9. He became the Phillies only backup catcher when the Phillies waived [...] "folk hero" [...] Chris Coste on July 10; Coste had broken into the big leagues {{for the first time with}} Philadelphia at age 33. The next day, Bako came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning against Pittsburgh Pirates closer Matt Capps with the score tied, 7–7; the Phillies had been behind by four runs before home runs by Matt Stairs and Ryan Howard tied the game. With the bases loaded, Bako hit a single through the left side of the infield, driving in the winning run (Raúl Ibañez) and sealing the Phillies fourth consecutive victory in a season-high ten-game winning streak. After the acquisition of starting pitcher Cliff Lee, Bako caught all of his first five starts with the Phillies, when Lee posted a 5–0 record and an 0.68 earned run average. Bako said, [...] "With as many strikes as he throws and as many weapons as he has, it's a lot of fun to catch him." [...] Manager Charlie Manuel, however, denied that Bako was scheduled to be Lee's personal catcher, as he had done for Maddux in 2001. [...] "'s [...] not his personal catcher... Of course you guys will write whatever you want to write. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be his personal catcher, go right ahead. But I'll handle it anyway, so it doesn't matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles McGrath of The New York Times {{described}} Mickey in [...] "Rose" [...] as Rose's [...] "well-meaning but dopey boyfriend". In their {{review of}} the episodes [...] "Aliens of London" [...] and [...] "World War Three" [...] Graeme Burk and Robert Smith praised the character's development stating that [...] "by the time he faces down a Slitheen in his apartment, armed only with a baseball bat... <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become a regular companion." [...] The authors felt that the character had [...] "grown magnificently" [...] {{by the time of}} his temporary departure in the second series, remarking favourably on his [...] "zero to hero" [...] arc in light of his status as the first ethnic minority companion in the televised series. By [...] "Army of Ghosts"/"Doomsday" [...] they contend that the character is [...] "at last... flirtatious, smart and dashing".|$|E

5000|$|American Vogues {{creative}} director Grace Coddington, then a model herself, said [...] "It was the Sixties, {{it was a}} raving time, and Bailey was unbelievably good-looking.

6000|$|Berrie's {{tone was}} a shade resentful of his insinuation. [...] "He has never said {{much about his}} family one way or another.

Of course, I could see by his ways and the clothes he wore that he'd been brought up in what we'd call luxury, but we never inquired into his affairs." ...|$|R

[...] IGN ranked the episode 7th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, praising the characterization of Logan. [...] "Up to this point, Logan was just a tool and <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get knocked down. But here, you get a peek at his troubled home life. ...

6000|$|To my readers: Well, my dears, here is {{what you}} have asked for: another [...] "Oz Book" [...] about Dorothy's strange adventures.

Indeed, the wishes of my little correspondents have been considered as carefully as possible, and if the story is not exactly as you would have written it yourselves, you must remember that a story has to be a story before it can be written down, and the writer cannot change it much without spoiling it.|$|R
