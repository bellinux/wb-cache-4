25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe {{a quarter of the}} way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that although it is [...] "inevitable" [...] that Homer's car will be a disaster, the [...] "joy of this episode is anticipating exactly what sort of disaster." [...] A member of the IGN staff wrote in a season two review that [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] {{is one of the}} [...] "real winners {{to be found in the}} second season." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the most memorable line of the episode was Homer's idea of the perfect car, [...] "You know that little ball <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car! And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style â€” like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Work on Lightning {{was done}} between January 1 and July 2012, in Matt and Kim's old {{apartment}} on Grand Street in Brooklyn, New York. The album was written and recorded using the music production software Logic Pro. The 10 tracks of Lightning were pared from 25-26 songs originally {{written for the}} album, which Matt Johnson said that [...] "it gave us [...] {{a lot more to}} choose from, which let Kim and I really broaden this album out." [...] He {{said in an interview that}} the group [...] "felt there was a lot going on in the songs" [...] on their album Sidewalks. [...] "In a way, the safest thing you can do with a song is to make it have a lot of stuff. The more <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> less the actual songwriting is exposed. For the new album , I was excited to do as little possible to the songs production-wise and still have them be strong." [...] He also said that the album's recording location [...] "was a nice farewell" [...] to the apartment.|$|E

6000|$|Sally's eyes sparkled at {{the sight}} of the slippers. She rose at once, and limped away to her room. Amelius, observing that she still walked in pain, called her back. [...] "I had {{forgotten}} the blister," [...] he said. [...] "Before <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new stockings, Sally, let me see your foot." [...] He turned to Toff.

60|$|So, I {{will change}} the subject to myself. You {{told me that you}} were going to read my book, and I want to know what you think of it. If you were given to {{compliment}} and insincerity, I should be afraid of asking you; because, among other evident reasons, I might then appear to be asking for your praise instead of your opinion. As it is--I want to know what you think of my book. Is the translation stiff? If you know me at all (and I venture to hope that you do) you will be certain that I shall like your honesty, and love you for being honest, even if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> very blackest of black caps....|$|E
6000|$|... 'You shall think me {{very good}} yet! I have no notion of being opposed {{by a little}} vassal of mine; and we'll succeed, if it were but {{for the fun of}} the thing! Monseigneur de Therouenne is on your side, or would be, if he were sure of the Duke of Burgundy. You see, these prelates hate nothing so much as the {{religious}} orders; and all the pride of the Luxemburgs is in arms against Clairette's fancy for those beggarly nursing Sisters; so it drives him mad to hear her say she only succoured you for charity. He thinks it a family disgrace, that can only be wiped off by marrying her to you; and he would do it bon gre, mal gre, but that he waits to hear what Burgundy will say. You have only to hold out, and she shall be yours, if I hold her finger while <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ring. Only let us be sure of Burgundy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Herbert Loring," [...] she cried, [...] "what {{does all}} this mean? I was there during {{the whole of the}} {{exhibition}} of what you called the magic egg. I saw all those people wild with excitement at the wonderful sight of the chicken {{that came out of the}} egg, and grew to full size, and then dwindled down again, and went back into the egg, and, Herbert, there was no egg, and there was no little box, and there was no wand, and no embroidered cloth, and there was no red bag, nor any little chick, and there was no full-grown fowl, and there was no chair that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table! There was nothing, absolutely nothing, but you and that table! Even the table was not what you said it was. It was not an unpainted pine table with four straight legs. It was a table of dark polished wood, and it stood on a single post with feet. There was nothing there that you said was there. Everything was a sham and a delusion; every word you spoke was untrue. And yet everybody in that theatre, excepting you and me, saw all the things that you said were on the stage. I know they saw them all, for I was with the people, and heard them, and saw them, and at times I fairly felt the thrill of enthusiasm which possessed them as they glared at the miracles and wonders you said were happening." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through" [...] is a {{paean to}} rock music, celebrating {{how it is}} always there to help you through troubled times.

5000|$|The {{film was}} parodied in the South Park episode [...] "Butterballs", {{including}} {{a scene in}} which Kyle asks Stan (who created an anti-bullying documentary) [...] "If this video needs to be seen by everyone, why don't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet for free?" [...] to which Stan had no answer.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile more patrols came in; {{all told}} the same tale: no Boers anywhere. Well, then, let us push on. Why not seize the heights above Potgieter's? If held, they would cost a {{thousand}} men to storm; now, perhaps, {{they might be}} had for nothing. Again, why not? Orders said, 'Go to Springfield;' nothing about Potgieter's at all. Never mind--if cavalry had never done more than obey their orders how different English history would have been! Captain Birdwood, 11th Bengal Lancers, glorious regiment of the Indian frontier, now on Lord Dundonald's staff, was for pushing on. All and sundry were eager to get on. 'Have a dash for it.' It {{is very easy to}} see what to do in the field of war until <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thick blue goggles of responsibility. Dundonald reflected, reflected again, and finally resolved. VorwÃ¤rts! So on we went accordingly. Three hundred men and two guns were left to hold the Springfield bridge, seven hundred men and four guns hurried on through the afternoon to Potgieter's Ferry, or, more properly speaking, the heights commanding it, and reached them safely at six o'clock, finding a strong position strengthened by loopholed stone walls, unguarded and unoccupied. The whole force {{climbed to the top of}} the hills, and with great labour succeeded in dragging the guns with them before night. Then we sent back to announce what we had done and to ask for reinforcements.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{appeared}} {{upon the}} scene--say at the races, {{or the public}} balls, or anywhere else you like--a certain man, who made love to Miss Havisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago, before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention {{that he was a}} showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham's counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she was doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has never seen her since." ...|$|E
