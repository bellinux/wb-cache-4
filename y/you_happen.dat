500|$|The tale is {{followed}} immediately by two morals: [...] "one {{stresses the importance}} of possessing industrie and savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess." [...] The Italian translation by Carlo Collodi notes that the tale gives useful advice if <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas.|$|E
500|$|Even before Born {{had taken}} up the chair in Berlin, von Laue had changed his mind, and decided that he wanted it after all. [...] He {{arranged}} with Born and the faculties concerned for them to exchange jobs. In April 1919 Born became professor ordinarius and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics on the science faculty at the University of Frankfurt am Main. While there, he was approached by the University of Göttingen, which {{was looking for a}} replacement for Peter Debye as Director of the Physical Institute. [...] "Theoretical physics," [...] Einstein advised him, [...] "will flourish wherever <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to be; there is no other Born to be found in Germany today." [...] In negotiating for the position with the education ministry, Born arranged for another chair, of experimental physics, at Göttingen for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck.|$|E

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of Vox {{likewise}} {{praised the}} structure of the season, noting the recent absence of Ramsay Bolton as a positive, but continuing, [...] "Though it wasn't as good as the last two episodes, [...] "Blood of My Blood" [...] continued the general upswing in quality Game of Thrones season six has undergone." [...] VanDerWerff also wrote in his review, [...] ""Blood of My Blood" [...] is another exciting hour of television, even if it's a bit more piece move-y than, say, [...] "The Door". The revelations are milder, the characters mostly talk about what they're going to do next, and the stories go from Point A to Point B, instead of Point X, Y, or Z. But there's still plenty going on that's worth checking out." [...] Comparing the episode to [...] "Book of the Stranger", Jeremy Egner of The New York Times said, [...] "The problem with emerging naked from a flaming temple is that it's hard to top. It's hard to top, that is, unless <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to have a dragon with a flair for dramatic timing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at myself in the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|She is, however, {{at pains}} to stress the {{differences}} between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books {{you go into a}} world within a world that you can see if <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child.

2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
