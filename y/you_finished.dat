500|$|Campbell {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the best power running backs in NFL history, and was highly regarded by his peers. [...] "Every time you hit him you lower your own IQ," [...] said Redskins linebacker Pete Wysocki. Cornerback Lester Hayes of the Raiders said [...] "Earl Campbell was put on this earth to play football." [...] Cliff Harris, safety for the Cowboys, recalled Campbell as [...] "the hardest-hitting running back I ever played against. He didn't have the elusiveness of an O. J. Simpson. But when <b>you</b> <b>finished</b> a game against Earl, you had to sit in a tub with Epsom salts." [...] Bum Phillips, when asked if Campbell was in a class by himself, quipped, [...] "I dunno.

500|$|After the momentous {{victory in}} the Battle of Stalingrad the Soviet troops {{proceeded}} to nationwide counter-offensives and Shanina on 2 April 1944 joined the 184th Rifle Division, where a separate female sniper platoon had been formed. Shanina was appointed a commander of that platoon. Three days later, southeast of Vitebsk, Shanina killed her first German soldier. In Shanina's own words, recorded by an anonymous author, her legs gave way after that first encounter and she slid down into the trench, saying, [...] "I've killed a man." [...] Concerned, the other women ran up saying, [...] "That was a fascist <b>you</b> <b>finished</b> off!" [...] Seven months later, Shanina wrote in her diary that she was now killing the enemy in cold blood and saw the meaning {{of her life in}} her actions. She wrote that if she had to do everything over again, she would still strive to enter the sniper academy and would go to the front again.|$|E

Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously, telling his rivals to [...] "get your fucking head down and work to sort it out", but later {{made it clear that he}} [...] "didn't mean the f-word in relation to him" [...] regarding the comments by Christian Horner. Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season, saying during the post-race press conference: [...] "I hope we can have a good fight. That would be awesome." [...] This statement caused amusement from Sebastian Vettel, who replied: [...] "Be honest. Do you really hope so?

2500|$|Although {{the first}} name of 'I' is not stated {{anywhere}} in the film, {{it is widely believed}} that it is 'Peter'. This myth arose {{as a result of a}} line of misheard dialogue.

Then pointing at Marwood he says [...] "He's just had an audition for rep".

In 2007, Mayall said of the incident: [...] "You don't leave the trenches … selfishness is one thing, being a cunt is another. I mustn't start that war again." [...] Edmondson poked fun at the event during their stage tours.
