500|$|Beginning in 1661, {{boys who}} aspired to become {{officers}} were sent {{by their families}} to serve on ships with a [...] "letter of service" [...] from the crown, and were paid {{at the same rate}} as midshipmen. The letter instructed the admirals and captains that the bearer was to be shown [...] "such kindness as you shall judge fit for a gentleman, both in accommodating him in <b>your</b> <b>ship</b> and in furthering his improvement". Their official rating was volunteer-per-order, but they were often known as King's letter boys, to distinguish their higher social class from the original midshipman rating.|$|E
500|$|A {{retrospective}} feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm {{as one of}} the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of {{the most}} entertaining titles on the console. Video game database AllGame gave the game a two and a half out of five rating, noting how the graphics made it difficult to play. The review stated that the design of the graphics [...] "makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate <b>your</b> <b>ship,</b> especially when you are trying to fight back!" [...] The review concluded that the developers [...] "have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of them like a scene from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll even hear some speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware... and that is truly a shame." [...] In 2008, Kolan called it [...] "a really competent shooter" [...] with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as [...] "pretty good fun to play", although inferior to Star Fox. However, Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game [...] "kind of sucked".|$|E

500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of <b>your</b> <b>ship</b> is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Commodore Jones, {{accepting}} {{that if he}} could not use the 18-pounders, he could not win a gun fight, quickly adopted a policy of trying to grapple and board his opponent. Pearson’s crew spotted the change and adapted rapidly, using the superior maneuverability of Serapis to keep out of reach, while continuing to bombard the slower ship. On one occasion though, according to the later recollection of First Lieutenant Richard Dale, Bonhomme Richard’s bow ran into Serapis’ stern and, with neither side {{able to take advantage of}} the situation, Captain Pearson cheekily asked the punning question, [...] "Has <b>your</b> <b>ship</b> struck?". Dale reports Jones’s reply as, very simply, [...] "I have not yet begun to fight!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, for unknown reasons, she [...] "fled" [...] to Singapore {{where she}} married Elbert Lewis, an auditor for Socony-Vacuum Oil Company (later merged with Mobil Oil). How they met is unknown. From the {{available}} documentation, the assumption would be they {{met on the}} dock when she arrived in Singapore. However, {{in a letter to}} her dated February 8, 1942, Elbert wrote, [...] "Do you remember, dearest, the morning of your first arrival in Singapore, seven sweet years ago, when I pushed all the boats out of the harbor so <b>your</b> <b>ship</b> could come in?" [...] which could be either romantic metaphor, or a hint he was waiting for her there (the same letter mentions a clearly metaphorical female character he calls [...] "Elfin," [...] to which Elbert attributes much [...] "good luck" [...] he apparently thinks they had in the past).|$|E
