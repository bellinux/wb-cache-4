500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Wishing Stone". Noel Gallagher told NME in 1996, that [...] "Wonderwall" [...] {{was written for}} his then-girlfriend, Meg Mathews. However, after Gallagher divorced Mathews in 2001, he said the song was not about Mathews: [...] "The meaning of that song was taken away from me by the media who jumped on it, and how do <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> Mrs it's not about her once she's read it is? It's a song about an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself".|$|E

2500|$|Nixon asked Anna Chennault {{to be his}} [...] "channel to Mr. Thieu" [...] {{in order}} to advise him to refuse {{participation}} in the talks. Thieu was promised a better deal under a Nixon administration. Chennault agreed and periodically reported to John Mitchell that Thieu {{had no intention of}} attending a peace conference. On November 2, Chennault informed the South Vietnamese ambassador: [...] "I have just heard from my boss in Albuquerque who says his boss [...] is going to win. And <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>your</b> boss [...] to hold on a while longer." [...] In 1997, Chennault admitted that [...] "I was constantly in touch with Nixon and Mitchell." [...] The effort also involved Texas Senator John Tower and Kissinger, who traveled to Paris on behalf of the Nixon campaign. William Bundy stated that Kissinger obtained [...] "no useful inside information" [...] from his trip to Paris, and [...] "almost any experienced Hanoi watcher might have come to the same conclusion". While Kissinger may have [...] "hinted that his advice was based on contacts with the Paris delegation," [...] this sort of [...] "self-promotion....is at worst a minor and not uncommon practice, quite different from getting and reporting real secrets." ...|$|E
