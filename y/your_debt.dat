60|$|MASTER, - A plea from a {{place so}} distant should have some weight, and from a heart so {{grateful}} should have some address. I have been long in <b>your</b> <b>debt,</b> Master, and I {{did not think it}} could be so much increased as you have now increased it. I was long in <b>your</b> <b>debt</b> and deep in <b>your</b> <b>debt</b> for many poems that I shall never forget, and for SIGURD before all, and now you have plunged me beyond payment by the Saga Library. And so now, true to human nature, being plunged beyond payment, I come and bark at your heels.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Not at all. Your {{child must}} live on that. Only {{one person can}} pay <b>your</b> <b>debts</b> without dishonouring you, and that is your elder sister.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That, sir, is {{the extent}} to which. I am in <b>your</b> <b>debt.</b> Do you think it small? It is so great that I have no words in which to attempt to express my thanks." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gildoy made {{a feeble}} effort {{to put forth}} a hand towards Mr. Blood. [...] "Sir," [...] he said, [...] "you leave me in <b>your</b> <b>debt.</b> If I live I shall study how to {{discharge}} it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "About <b>your</b> <b>debts,</b> Kilcullen: {{why did you}} conceal from {{me their}} full amount? Why, at any rate, did you take pains to make me think them so much less than they really are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Estimate {{its value}} in cash?"--Hugh sharply took her up. [...] "Ah, Lady Sandgate, I am in <b>your</b> <b>debt,</b> {{but if you}} really bargain for your {{precious}} information I'd rather we assume that I haven't enjoyed it." ...|$|E

40|$|If {{you find}} {{yourself}} “over-extended ” and have tried financial counseling, spending plans, reducing your payments, and/or paying more than the minimum amount due and still cannot make headway in repaying <b>your</b> <b>debts,</b> bankruptcy may be an option worth investigating. When you have incurred more debt than {{you think you can}} reasonably repay, bankruptcy may be a way to debt relief. Filing for bankruptcy, however, brings long-term consequences for your credit rating. What Is Bankruptcy? Bankruptcy is a privilege based on the United States Constitution and the laws passed by Congress. Bankruptcy adjusts the relationship between you, the debtor, and your creditors. Many of <b>your</b> <b>debts</b> will be forgiven...|$|R
