500|$|Sell said God of War {{has very}} few flaws {{and that the}} only one worth {{mentioning}} is the camera system: he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos, [...] "there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> to make a jump because you couldn't really see the jump properly". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is [...] "a little disappointing". Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts [...] "a little bothersome". He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies, but they will eventually get their [...] "brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Declan Whitebloom in London on 28 November 2011. Whitebloom approached shooting the clip with a [...] "what you get, is what you get" [...] sentiment, which, as he noted, [...] "can create some real magic." [...] In regard to its concept, Whiteboom characterised the clip as [...] "kind of Monkees or Beatles-esque", elaborating that it revolves around [...] "five lads go crazy in London, it's like a big day out in London." [...] In a December interview with Capital FM, member Harry Styles reflected that the shoot was a fun, careless romp. Premiering on YouTube on 13 January 2012, the music video depicts the band performing in and around London. As of October 2017, the music video has garnered more than 550 million YouTube views. One Direction surged 35-10 from the previous week on Billboards Social 50 chart. Alex Hughes of The Huffington Post commented that the music video has an effortless element of happiness, proclaiming: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> to crack a smile, there is a 100 percent chance {{that you are the}} devil." ...|$|E
500|$|Converge {{took their}} {{music in a}} more {{progressive}} direction with Axe to Fall. Kurt Ballou noted that drummer Ben Koller had been listening to more progressive rock {{over the last few}} years, and that he tried to complement this sound on the guitar. He {{went on to say that}} he was getting the [...] "more straightforward, raw punk aggression out in a yet-to be named hardcore side project that I started. So that leaves me free to get weird and progressive with Converge." [...] Ballou considers the band's previous three albums (Jane Doe, <b>You</b> <b>Fail</b> Me and No Heroes) to be a trilogy in regards to their sound, and hoped to push their musical boundaries on Axe to Fall. The tracks on the album have been noted to range from [...] "drone-and-pummel" [...] to atmospheric. Jacob Bannon believes this album is [...] "not about being as loud and vicious as possible." [...] Feeling that 40–50 minutes of metallic hardcore can be difficult to listen to for some, Converge used softer tracks, or [...] "slow jams," [...] such as [...] "Damages" [...] and [...] "Wretched World" [...] to take the listener [...] "to some other places." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics praised Super Meat Boys {{platforming}} elements, {{and often}} {{commented on the}} game's difficulty. X-Play reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had [...] "riveting platforming action", and added that [...] "Super Meat Boys designers are masters of their craft." [...] Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt the platforming was [...] "perfect". He wrote that [...] "while it's always tough and demanding, it never feels cheap, or like the game is cheating you." [...] A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that [...] "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> and making {{you feel like a}} platform pro when you succeed". Joystiq's Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: [...] "Super Meat Boy is tough, as tough as the toughest nails in the toughest universe." [...] Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's [...] "precise control", [...] "excellent level design", and [...] "smooth difficulty curve". Reviewer Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer warned that Super Meat Boy is [...] "a hard game. It should make you want to throw the pad across the room".|$|E
500|$|As {{the matter}} {{involved}} the prince, Stacey consulted other {{officers in the}} regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming {{to remain in the}} regiment while he defended himself, or removing him straight away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the Duke of Connaught, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke [...] "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on half-pay. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: [...] "Because you signed that document you will never put on a sword in the regiment. If you bring a successful action you will be allowed to retire: if <b>you</b> <b>fail,</b> you will be dismissed [...] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.|$|E

2500|$|Kelley responded, {{in a paper}} titled [...] "A Question of Sanction", by disputing Schwartz's {{interpretation}} of the sanction principle in particular and his {{interpretation of}} moral principles in general. Subsequently, in an essay appearing in The Intellectual Activist, Peikoff endorsed Schwartz's view and claimed that Kelley's arguments contradicted the fundamental principles of Objectivism. Peikoff maintained that many non-Objectivist systems of thought, such as Marxism, are based on [...] "inherently dishonest ideas" [...] whose advocacy must never be sanctioned. He attributed the fall of NBI and subsequent schisms not to [...] "differences in regard to love affairs or political strategy or proselytizing techniques or anybody's personality," [...] but to a [...] "fundamental and philosophical" [...] cause: [...] "if you grasp and accept the concept of 'objectivity,' in all its implications, then you accept Objectivism, you live by it and you revere Ayn Rand for defining it. If <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> fully to grasp and accept the concept, whether your failure is deliberate or otherwise, you eventually drift away from Ayn Rand's orbit, or rewrite her viewpoint or turn openly into her enemy." [...] Those who criticized his position were to make their exit: [...] "if {{you agree with the}} Branden or Kelley viewpoint or anything resembling it—please drop out of our movement: drop Ayn Rand, leave Objectivism alone. We do not want you and Ayn Rand would not have wanted you [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|The triumphant {{return with}} the gems in hand greatly {{increases}} Harap Alb's prestige, and positively impresses the Green Emperor himself. Envious, the Bald Man explains to the imperial court that the feats were entirely attributable to himself, the master, {{and to his}} stern ways. While the monarch agrees with the explanation, his daughter and her sisters are yet more skeptical, and decide to investigate further. Just prior to a feast, they ask the Bald Man to allow Harap Alb the honor of serving at their table, which he agrees to only after making the servant swear {{not to engage in}} conversation with the ladies. During the celebrations, the court is unexpectedly visited by an enchanted bird-like creature, Pasărea măiastră, who announces: [...] "You are eating, drinking and enjoying yourselves, but <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> to think about the Red Emperor's daughter!" [...] There follows a debate [...] concerning the tyrannical Red Emperor and his daughter, during which some of the guests claim that the latter is a malevolent witch, and some still that she is the bird itself, on a mission to propagate fear. After witnessing this, the Bald Man proposes to send Harap Alb on a quest to capture the Red Emperor's daughter and reveal the mystery, the servant being forced to leave before the feast is over. While he is gone, the Bald Man continues to undermine his reputation, but also inadvertently sparks more suspicions about his background and character.|$|E
