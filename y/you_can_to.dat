500|$|James Berardinelli observed, [...] "Catch Me if You Can never takes {{itself or}} its {{subjects}} too seriously, and contains more genuinely funny material than about 90% {{of the so-called}} 'comedies' found in multiplexes these days". In addition Berardinelli praised John Williams' film score, which he felt was [...] "more intimate and jazzy than his usual material, evoking (intentionally) Henry Mancini". Peter Travers was one of few who gave the film a negative review. Travers considered Catch Me if <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "bogged down over 140 minutes.

[...] Cammarano suggested adapting Joseph Méry's 1828 play La Bataille de Toulouse, which he described as a story [...] "that should stir every man with an Italian soul in his breast". The premiere was set for late January 1849. Verdi travelled to Rome {{before the end of}} 1848. He found that city on the verge of becoming a (short-lived) republic, which commenced within days of La battaglia di Legnanos enthusiastically received premiere. In the spirit of the time were the tenor hero's final words, [...] "Whoever dies for the fatherland cannot be evil-minded".|$|E

As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations. While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, [...] "It {{seems to me that there}} are two things you can do when listening to any new work. The most important thing is to lend yourself—or to put it another way—try to be as sensitive as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> the overall feeling the new piece gives off. The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece, realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense." [...] He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail.|$|E
500|$|The {{south-east}} London club Charlton Athletic {{were linked}} with {{a move to}} [...] "a progressive Midlands borough" [...] in 1973, a year after Charlton's relegation to the third tier. The Gliksten family, which owned Charlton from 1932 to 1982 and {{had a history of}} proposing elaborate schemes for the club, revealed plans to build a community sports complex at The Valley, and to hold a public market at the ground on weekdays. Greenwich Council refused to license the market and insisted that the complex be built on public space at a local park. The club reacted by announcing the proposed move to the Midlands. Fans inundated the local media and club offices with strong opinion against a move, prompting Charlton to print a statement in the 14 April 1973 match programme telling fans that the proposed move was because of the council's attitude regarding the market and complex plans, which the team said threatened its future. [...] "You, the supporters, can make sure the club continues in Charlton by protesting as loud as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> Greenwich Council over their refusal to grant us permission for our plans," [...] the message explained. No relocation occurred.|$|E

2500|$|In Verdi's mind, he had {{the perfect}} subject, {{to be based on}} the novel L'assedio di Firenze ("The Siege of Florence") by Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, which glorified the life of the 16th Century Florentine soldier Francesco Ferruccio.

[...] Some critics have postulated that, similar to Lynch's previous Blue Velvet, the sudden idealistic ending of perfect happiness is ironic, suggesting that people who have the potential for violence struggle to find true happiness. Lynch himself, however, refers to the ending of Wild at Heart as being a [...] "happy" [...] one, having consciously made the decision to change the original darker ending from the novel.|$|E

This looting, United Nations Observers reported, appeared to have been systematic as army trucks were used for transportation. The situation, states the report, created a new influx of refugees into Lebanon. Israeli forces, he stated, have occupied the area in Galilee formerly occupied by Kaukji's forces, and have crossed the Lebanese frontier. Bunche goes on to say [...] "that Israeli forces now hold positions inside the south-east corner of Lebanon, involving some fifteen Lebanese villages which are occupied by small Israeli detachments." ...|$|E

Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm’s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I appeal to you to help me.
