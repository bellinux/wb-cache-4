6000|$|... "It's {{all over}} for sure, this time," [...] he said. [...] "It's cold and goin' to be colder. How are you {{standing}} it? If <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> cold I can heat a stone. How is the hurt foot?" [...] He drew near {{and looked down}} upon her anxiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} able to hold on here," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "for a few days, and I expect that one day's good tramp, when <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> better, will take us there. After that we ought to have no great {{difficulty}} till we get down near the desert." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We can try {{the last}} bet now, if <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> pretty steady," [...] said my lord, {{springing}} up, stretching {{his arms and}} limbs, {{and looking at the}} crisp, dry grass.

50|$|Another {{freestyle}} footwork trick. Set up with <b>your</b> one <b>foot,</b> or <b>your</b> other <b>foot,</b> on {{the tail}} of the board, put <b>your</b> one <b>foot</b> on the nose of the board. Two things will happen now, and both must be done at the same time. Pressure is applied to the nose and you pivot 180 degrees {{on the tail}} to the side <b>your</b> other <b>foot's</b> heel <b>was</b> facing. <b>Your</b> one <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> also removed prior to the 180 degree pivot and brought to where your board will end up after the 180 degree pivot. It is an advanced version of the End-Over or 180 pivot on the nose or tail because <b>your</b> other <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> detached from the board.|$|R

6000|$|... "Isn't it fun?" [...] she responded. [...] "In a way it's nicer {{on account}} of the storm. But you are not dressed right; you should have {{waterproof}} boots. You never can tell when you may be set afoot. You should always go prepared for rain and snow, and, above all, have an extra pair of thick stockings. <b>Your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> soaked now, aren't they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mamma’s feet {{began to}} {{pat on the}} floor during this operation, and Beatrix, whose bright eyes nothing escaped, saw that little mark of impatience. She ran up and embraced her mother, with her usual cry of, “Oh, you silly little mamma: <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> quite as pretty as mine,” says she: “they are, cousin, though she hides ’em; but the {{shoemaker}} {{will tell you that}} he makes for both off the same last.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you arrive}} at your apartment," [...] he said, [...] "you will find there a little packet from me. Be wise, dear.

Dear Marguerite!" ...|$|E

Strike them out, Joan, strike them out, and wait only one daytwo days at mostthen write and say <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> wounded but is well againfor it surely be well then, or very near it. Don't {{distress}} her, Joan; do as I say." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1300, when Khusrow was forty {{seven years}} old, {{his mother and}} brother died.

6000|$|... [113] Ames, by {{report of}} Waldo Emerson, {{expressed}} the popular [...] security wisely, saying, [...] "that a monarchy is a merchantman, [...] which sails well, but will sometimes strike on a rock, and [...] {{go to the}} bottom; whilst a republic is a raft, which would [...] never sink, but then <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> always in the water."

6000|$|... "I don't {{believe in}} imagining things {{different}} from what they really are," [...] retorted Marilla. [...] "When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He doesn't mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me. Go into the sitting room, Anne--be sure <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> clean and don't let any flies in--and bring me out the illustrated card that's on the mantelpiece. The Lord's Prayer is on it and you'll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There's to be no more of such praying as I heard last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [66] Ames, by {{report of}} Waldo Emerson, says [...] "that a monarchy is a merchantman, which sails well, but will {{sometimes}} strike on a rock, {{and go to}} the bottom; whilst a republic is a raft, which would never sink, but then <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> always in the water."
