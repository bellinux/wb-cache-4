60|$|HOTCHKISS. I hope so. Surely <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be vindictive, Rejjy. Besides, youll {{have all}} the {{advantages}} I formerly enjoyed. Youll be the visitor, the relief, the new face, the fresh news, the hopeless attachment: I shall only be the husband.|$|E

60|$|SIR PATRICK. No: {{about your}} behavior. Theres {{nothing wrong with}} your spine; and theres nothing wrong with your heart; but theres {{something}} wrong with your common sense. <b>Youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die; but you may be {{going to make a}} fool of yourself.

6000|$|TARLETON. Good. Well, do {{you like}} me? Dont {{misunderstand}} me: I'm perfectly aware that <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fall in {{love at first sight}} with a ridiculous old shopkeeper. I cant help that ridiculous old shopkeeper. I have to carry him about with me whether I like it or not. I have to pay for his clothes, though I hate the cut of them: especially the waistcoat. I have to look at him in the glass while I'm shaving. I loathe him because hes a living lie. My soul's not like that: it's like yours. I want to make a fool of myself. About you. Will you let me? ...|$|E
50|$|The Times reviewer, Michael Billington, was not impressed: Inspired by Jules Verne", {{the credits}} for this film rather cryptically announce. One cant {{argue with the}} credits, of course; but a more {{instantly}} recognizable inspiration is that brand of screen comedy that assumes that a large gathering of well-known names plus some vintage piece of machinery (a car for preference, but a plane or rocket will do) adds up to irresistible mirth. But, as this film takes nearly two hours to demonstrate, its no use cramming the cast with comedy actors if <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give them anything very funny to do.|$|E

5000|$|Barrymore {{repeatedly}} {{called to}} plea that she {{play the role}} of Anita. Davis later said, [...] "I saw her and knew she was perfect. You could see shes been through a lot, and the world has not been easy to her. And yet she has this incredible vulnerability. Shes so determined to prove that shes worthy of the Barrymore name." [...] Barrymore said, [...] "Anita was very close to home for me. Not that I was so much like her. Im not. But I had the best understanding of her than any character Ive ever played in my life." [...] Barrymore declined to have a chauffeur drive her to the filming locations, which is commonly done for actors. According to Davis: [...] "She said, No, <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> treat me like a baby. She said, I can get to work on time on my own." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{showed it}} to Al Feldstein, {{and the first thing}} I said was, Al, Ive got this crazy idea, and <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> buy it, because it mutilates the magazine. So I put it in front of him, and the thing about Al was, he liked things that {{intrigued}} him. The mechanics of it intrigued him. He said, You mean, you fold it, like this [...] [...] [...] ? And then [...] [...] [...] ? He folded it, he unfolded it, he folded it, and then he said, I like this! But I said, Al, it mutilates the magazine. And he said, Well, Ill have to check it with Bill. He takes it, runs it to Bills office, and he was there a little while, and he comes back and he says, Were going to do it! You know what Bill said? Bill said, [...] "So they mutilate the magazine, and then theyll buy another one to save!" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was told}} that at Disney the actor was told to play it like a cartoon with all that exaggeration. In Lord of the Rings, I had the actors play it straight. The {{rotoscope}} {{in the past has}} been used in scenes and then exaggerated. The action becomes cartoony. The question then comes up that if <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be cartoony, why animate? ...It is the traditional method of rotoscoping but the approach is untraditional. Its a rotoscope realism unlike anything thats been seen. It really is a unique thing for animation. The number of characters moving in a scene is staggering. In The Lord of the Rings, you have hundreds of people in the scene. We have cels with a thousand people on them. It was so complex sometimes wed only get one cel a week from an artist. It turned out that the simple shots were the ones that only had four people in them. Ralph Bakshi ...|$|E

500|$|During a September 2009 {{earnings}} call, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick {{was asked}} about Grand Theft Auto V, the purported next game in the series.

5000|$|PPO: [...] "You seem so {{positive}} {{to me and}} so gung ho. What drives you? Is it just in you?"Tara: [...] "I think it just all {{has to do with}} me wanting to walk again. When this happened I was completely devastated. I mean, this has been my life since I was 11-years-old. This is what I know and its what I love. Its what I absolutely, without a doubt love. I mean, not being able to ride my bike again {{for the rest of my}} life... It would crush me. And so for me, I cant have a negative thought in my mind. I cant because you know doctors can come in, and they can walk in... and say, [...] "youre never going to walk again." [...] But, you know what, to me so much of it is mind over matter. They do a test the first week that youre here in Craig and in the test they deemed me [...] "complete". What complete means is that basically <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> walk again. You know what? My legs have started to move again, especially my left leg. One of my doctors was like, [...] "holy shit!". I said, [...] "you can take your complete and shove it!" [...] Not to her of course..." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétiens use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might the nomination. But <b>youre</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get the chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and Ive got to put people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident {{that he was going to}} win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|E

6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing?
