5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b>|$|E
500|$|When {{adapting}} The Kite Runner for the theatre, Director Eric Rose {{stated that}} he was drawn into the narrative by the [...] "themes of betraying <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> {{for the love of}} your father", which he compared to Shakespearean literature. Throughout the story, Amir craves his father's affection; his father, in turn, loves Amir but favors Hassan, going as far as to pay for plastic surgery to repair the latter's cleft lip.|$|E

500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
500|$|Stenson {{assessed}} that Steph [...] "really isn't all bad, {{more of a}} lovable rogue {{who just}} likes making mischief for attention." [...] She deemed her character [...] "very unpredictable", {{with a great deal}} of confidence. The LINC Online called her a [...] "beautiful blonde wild child with a penchant for arrogance and displays of egotism". Sarah Moolla of The People branded her [...] "superficial", the Daily Record Merle Brown referred to her as [...] "a true [...] female, and Emma Johnson of the Liverpool Echo assessed that she had a [...] "couldn't-care-less" [...] attitude. BBC America described Steph as a two-sided character. They observed that as well as a bitch, she could be [...] "dishonest, vain, jealous and small-minded", and wrote [...] "She causes trouble when she wants to and will happily lie and gossip to get her own way." [...] Conversely, they noted that for those on her good side, [...] "She can be <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> a confidante and sweet natured girl".|$|E
500|$|While {{the verses}} are {{dedicated}} to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / <b>Your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". As Carey sings the second chorus, she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father, however now revisiting 2005, [...] "And you {{never got a chance}} to see how good I've done / And you never got to see me back at No. 1", referencing her return to the top of music with The Emancipation of Mimi. The song does not feature a bridge, instead repeating the chorus twice, once in the same key as the rest of the song, while the other in a raised octave. During the last chorus, Carey's voice is doubled, with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords, while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mind,' was his {{farewell}} speech, 'I {{expect you}} to keep me au courant du jour. I {{will not be in}} the dark about <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> and neighbours when I come home next July.' ...|$|R

500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{served as}} the album's thirteenth track, and also {{composed}} by Carey and Stargate. An [...] "inspirational power ballad", it is influenced by R and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", and finds Carey remembering both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / <b>Your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and put their hands up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't ever say bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] was compared to the closing number on Mimi, [...] "Fly Like a Bird". Similarly, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] incorporates gospel influence into its melody of [...] "rousing piano waltz", that [...] "extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors." [...] Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than [...] "Side Effects": [...] "'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: [...] "Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide to protect myself / But you can't manipulate me like before." [...] She then prescribes Bible study and says, [...] "I wish you well." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Angie, Den's first wife, Chrissie [...] "has {{a strong}} will and fights {{for what she}} wants". However, as Oberman noted, [...] "there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes {{a certain type of}} strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of {{feminism}} behind her", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: [...] "I like to think of Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [...] equal a bit more than Angie was." [...] Oberman later expanded: [...] "Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E

2500|$|The {{band members}} had a mixed {{experience}} in Hamburg.

[...] McCartney commented: [...] "It was as if we'd mutated into something different and yet we were still just the boys. But we knew and they knew that we'd got famous in the meantime …" [...] The Beatles had also tired of the generally inane questions put to them at press conferences throughout the German tour, with only McCartney attempting to humour the local reporters. At the between-shows press conference in Hamburg, Lennon's impatience was palpable, leading a female reporter to ask why the band had become [...] "so horrid and snobby". On 27 June, the Beatles and their entourage flew from Hamburg to London's Heathrow Airport, where they boarded a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight over the North Pole to Tokyo.|$|E

[...] Moffat added to this analysis of the character by saying, [...] "He has a tremendous ability with throwaway humour {{and a lot of}} it is around the fact that sometimes he is terribly rude.

[...] It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share [...] "a certain acid wit" [...] of Malcolm Tucker, the role Peter Capaldi is most famous for, [...] "specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous".

2500|$|The samples used in Chill Out {{contribute}} fundamentally to {{the character}} of the composition. In particular, the recurring sampled sound effects of rolling stock and other transport illustrate the journey concept, often during segues between parts of the composition. Many of these effects are taken from the 1987 CD version of Elektra Records' Authentic Sound Effects Volume 2. The tracks used are [...] "Crossing Bells and Horn with Electric Train Pass" [...] and [...] "Short Freight Train Pass", along with processed versions of [...] "F18 Diamond Fly-By", [...] "Dodge Van Starts, Drives Out", and [...] "Surf". Samples of American, British and Russian radio stations are also used, including the BBC pips and a jingle from Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 1: [...] "Rock radio into the nineties and beyond". Some of the more obscure sounds (Tuvan throat singers and Basque shepherds in the Pyrenees) come from the Saydisc Records soundtrack of the 1980s [...] "Disappearing World" [...] series on Granada TV in the UK.

2500|$|Believed to {{have been}} written in the 1390s, Chaucer's short poem Fortune, is also {{inferred}} to directly reference Lancaster. [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] openly defies Fortune, proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares [...] "my suffisaunce" [...] (15) and that [...] "over himself hath the maystrye" [...] (14). [...] Fortune, in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims {{that he does not}} know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, [...] "And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve" [...] (32, 40, 48). [...] Chaucer retorts that [...] "My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse" [...] (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. [...] Fortune turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and [...] "Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne" [...] (78–79). [...] The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76, [...] "as three of you or tweyne," [...] to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of {{at least two of the}} three dukes. Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's [...] "beste frend". [...] Fortune states three times in her response to the plaintiff, [...] "And also, you still have <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> alive" [...] (32, 40, 48); she also references his [...] "beste frend" [...] in the envoy when appealing to his [...] "noblesse" [...] to help Chaucer to a higher estate. [...] A fifth reference is made by [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] who rails at Fortune that she shall not take his friend from him. [...] While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem Fortune distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.|$|E
