Ground stress (especially the tectonic stress) has a notable effect on the occurrence and distribution of outbursts in the field practice.

The results showed that the gas pressure and the strength reduction from the adsorbed gas aggravated the coal mass failure and the ground stress altered by tectonics would affect the plastic zone distribution. To demonstrate the outburst tendency, the ratio of potential energy for the outburst initiation and the energy consumption was used. Increase of coal gas and tectonic stress could enhance the potential energy accumulation ratio, meaning larger outburst tendency. The component of potential energy for outburst initiation indicated that the proportion of elastic energy was increased due to tectonic stress.

With regards to Task 1, a biphase catalyst system, [1. 5 -HDRhC 1] 2 /Buffer, was investigated for the hydrogenation of tetralin to decalin under the condition of atmosphere H 2 and room temperature. The primary results indicate that tetralin was hydrogenated to decalin in more that 91 % yield when only 0. 5 mole% of catalyst was used.

40|$|Gasification is a {{clean and}} {{efficient}} technology {{with a long history}} dating up to the 19 th century. The possible application of this process ranges from gas production and chemical synthesis to the energy sector and therefore this technology holds noticeable potential for future applications. In order to advance it, a new efficient approaches for this complex process are necessary. Among possible methods, a process enhancing additives, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals seems to be a promising way of achieving such a goal, but in practice might turn to be a wasteful approach for metal economy, especially in large scale production. This paper shows alkali abundant waste material that are green liquor dregs as a viable substitute. Green liquor dregs is a waste material known for its low potential as a fuel, when used separately, due to its low organic content, but its high ash content that is also abundant in alkali and alkaline earth elements seems to make it a suitable candidate for application in coal gasification processes. The aim of this work is an evaluation of the suitability of green liquor waste to work as a potential process enhancing additive for coal steam gasification process. During the experiment, three blends of hard coal and green liquor dregs were selected, with consideration for low corrosive potential and possibly high catalytic activity. The mixtures were gasified in steam under four different temperatures.

40|$|In this study, a high-sulfur and high-ash <b>yield</b> <b>coal</b> sample {{obtained}} from the Yanshan coalfield in Yunnan, China was analyzed. A series of char samples was obtained by pyrolysis at various temperatures (300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C) and at a fast heating rate (1000 °C/min). A comprehensive investigation using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), a mercury analyzer, ion-selective electrode (ISE) measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to reveal {{the effects of the}} pyrolysis temperature on the transformation behavior of trace elements (TEs) and the change in the mineralogical characteristics and functional groups in the samples. The results show that the TE concentrations in the raw coal are higher than the average contents of Chinese coal. The concentrations of Be, Li, and U in the char samples are higher than those in raw coal, while the opposite was observed for As, Ga, Hg, and Rb. The F and Se concentrations are initially higher but decrease with pyrolysis temperature, which is likely caused by associated fracturing with fluoride and selenide minerals. Uranium shows the highest enrichment degree, and Hg shows the highest volatilization degree compared to the other studied TEs. As the temperature increases, the number of OH groups decreases, and the mineral composition changes; for example, pyrite decomposes, while oldhamite and hematite occur in the chars. It is suggested that the behavior and fate of TEs in coal during fast pyrolysis are synergistically influenced by self-characteristic modes of occurrence and mineralogical characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Oxy-coal {{combustion}} is {{an emerging}} low-cost “clean coal” technology for emissions reduction and Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS). The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools {{is crucial for}} the development of cost-effective oxy-fuel technologies and the minimization of environmental concerns at industrial scale. The coupling of detailed chemistry models and CFD simulations is still challenging, especially for large-scale plants, because of the high computational efforts required. The development of scale-bridging models is therefore necessary, to find a good compromise between computational efforts and the physical-chemical modeling precision. This work presents a procedure for scale-bridging modeling of coal devolatilization, in the presence of experimental error, that puts emphasis on the thermodynamic aspect of devolatilization, namely the final volatile <b>yield</b> of <b>coal,</b> rather than kinetics. The procedure consists of an engineering approach based on dataset consistency and Bayesian methodology including Gaussian-Process Regression (GPR). Experimental data from devolatilization tests carried out in an oxy-coal entrained flow reactor were considered and CFD simulations of the reactor were performed. Jointly evaluating experiments and simulations, a novel yield model was validated against the data via consistency analysis. In parallel, a Gaussian-Process Regression was performed, to improve the understanding of the uncertainty associated to the devolatilization, based on the experimental measurements. Potential model forms that could predict yield during devolatilization were obtained. The set of model forms obtained via GPR includes the yield model that was proven to be consistent with the data. The overall procedure has resulted in a novel <b>yield</b> model for <b>coal</b> devolatilization and in a valuable evaluation of uncertainty in the data, in the model form, and in the model parameters.

The results clearly demonstrate the importance of specifying a structural break when testing for breaks in persistence, whereas our findings are robust to the exact date of the structural break. Our analysis <b>yields</b> that <b>coal</b> and natural gas prices are trend stationary throughout their evolution, while oil prices exhibit a break in persistence during the 1970 s.

The investigation focused {{on the effects of}} pyrolysis temperature and coal particle size on the product distribution and composition. The experimental results show that an increase in the pyrolysis temperature results in a higher yield of gaseous products while a larger particle size leads to a decrease of the liquid yield. An optimum temperature for the liquid yield was found to be 650 degrees C. A certain amount of phenol groups was found in the liquid products, which may be used to produce high-valued fine chemicals. The FTIR analyses of the coal and chars show that aliphatic structures in the chars are gradually replaced by aromatic structures with the increasing of pyrolysis temperature and coal particle size. The results of this study provide fundamental data and optimal conditions to maximize light oils <b>yields</b> for the <b>coal</b> topping process. The {{experiments on}} the flash pyrolysis of a. lignite were carried out in a fast-entrained bed reactor as a basic study on a so-called 'coal topping process'.
