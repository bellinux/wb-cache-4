[...] Former Chief of the Defence Staff (most senior officer of all British armed forces) and Chief of the General Staff (most senior officer in the British Army), General Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank, explained that the highest level of safeguard was against a prime minister ordering a launch without due cause: [...] Lord Guthrie stated that the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom provided some protection against such an occurrence, as while the Prime Minister is the chief executive and so practically commands the armed services, the formal commander-in-chief is the Monarch (to whom they swear allegiance to and indeed, is called the [...] "Royal" [...] Navy/Air Force), to whom the chief of the defence staff could appeal: [...] "the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make quite sure that that order was not obeyed... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> actually prime ministers give direction, they tell the chief of the defence staff what they want, but it's not prime ministers who actually tell a sailor to press a button in the middle of the Atlantic.

[...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy {{told me that she had}} no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E

In her first audition, she sang Aretha Franklin's cover of [...] "Respect". The Voice recounted her performance as being [...] "confident" [...] and [...] "show-stopping", and as a promising sign of Misha B's future in the competition. Noted for her [...] "Lauryn Hill-like rap-singing style", she was mentored by American recording artist Kelly Rowland and finished fourth. A variety of sources including The Daily Telegraph, Digital Spy and bluesandsoul.com have regarded Misha B {{as one of the}} more gifted and exciting acts ever to have come out of a talent competition. BBC 1xtra noting her [...] "show-stopping performances", considered her {{to be one of the}} most credible artists to emerge from the show and a [...] "break from the traditional X Factor contestant". In a review of the series, The Daily Telegraph picked her performance of [...] "Rolling in the Deep"(Adele) as one of the highlights of the series, saying she [...] "oozed star quality from the start... Like a 21st century Grace Jones or an urban Lady Gaga, the teenager seemed like a proper pop star already." [...] Bryan was involved in a controversy during the third live show when Tulisa Contostavlos accused her of making [...] "mean comments" [...] and [...] Louis Walsh accused her of being a [...] "bully" [...] backstage. No evidence was ever provided to support either allegation and both accusers apologised the next day. The other two judges and her fellow contestants defended Misha B during and after the show. Judge Gary Barlow later said he believed the wrongful allegations had ended Misha B's chances of winning the competition. Bryan asked about her experience on X Factor said [...] "I one hundred percent appreciate the platform it gave me...but it's not for the faint-hearted lol. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> at the end of the day it’s an entertainment show for TV." [...] "Things are said which are out of all of our hands as contestants. [...] I wasn't asked any questions, I was just accused." [...] Misha B spoke to grammy.com in 2013, [...] "I experienced not only highs but my share of lows on The X Factor, but it has set me up with the thick skin needed for this industry... I will always be grateful for my time on the show. I mean, it got me to where I needed to be." ...|$|E

However, instead of {{different}} items that are in a fixed location on the game board, there is only one item, that appears in different positions on the game board during each turn. [...] "1-N" [...] means that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the position of the item, one turn back.

I felt a little dizzy just now, or you wouldn't have got me back again, but I'm going to make another attempt to-morrow. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> when I get up I get better.

Since, in {{my present}} writings, I hope {{to bring into}} one focus the pieces of study fragmentarily given during past life, I may refer my readers to {{the first chapter of}} the 'Queen of the Air' for the {{explanation}} {{of the way in which}} all great myths are founded, partly on physical, partly on moral fact,--so that it is not possible for persons who neither know the aspect of nature, nor the constitution of the human soul, to understand a word of them. Naming the Greek gods, therefore, you have first to think of the physical power they represent. When Horace calls Vulcan 'Avidus,' he thinks of him as the power of Fire; when he speaks of Jupiter's red right hand, he thinks of him as the power of rain with lightning; and when Homer speaks of Juno's dark eyes, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> she is the softer form of the rain power, and to think of the fringes of the rain-cloud across the light of the horizon.

50|$|We {{were still}} inside and backstage. My {{understanding}} is, they arrived and left, and I'm only {{telling you what}} I heard in a bread track. My thought is probably a van of some kind that came in under the War Memorial, and they came upstairs. They literally dropped their guitars and ran and they were gone. They were out of that building so fast you couldn't believe it. The poor kids out front all thought they were still there of course. Tried to rush the stage and all that.

We sent flyers and gave other warnings to civilians to leave before our attacks." [...] Vice Premier Shimon Peres said Israel had no intention to harm Lebanese civilians, but warned that civilians who live near Hezbollah weapon caches were in danger: [...] "Because we {{know that some of}} their rocket caches, which are fired at Israel, are hidden in private apartments, I call on these residents to leave their homes. He who lives near a rocket is likely to get hurt." [...] Hezbollah had placed large amounts of weaponry into sealed rooms in private home prior to the outbreak of the conflict, placing the Lebanese citizenry at risk of attack.|$|E

[...] Also in {{an interview}} with Digital Spy, Jo Joyner commented on the relationship between Tanya and Cora at present. She said: [...] "I think that now we've explored all of the history with Tanya's father, the two of them are in a new territory. Cora can sometimes be distant and cold, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> they hadn't spoken for a long time. At the moment, because of Tanya's illness, Cora is being supportive and quite 'mummy' - but there's always the possibility that things could take a turn for the worse with their relationship, so I think that could change."
