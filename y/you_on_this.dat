500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by {{the first week of}} live shows of The X Factor (UK) where Little Mix were the favourites to be eliminated and felt disheartened by hearing the odds in the show's green room. Group member Jesy Nelson also recalled, [...] "the paps waiting outside to shoot us were all shouting 'See <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>This</b> Morning on Monday' because that's where the losers go. I was like: 'Oh, right, thanks!'" [...] Further inspiration came from Nelson who as an aspiring singer was told by her teachers that she would end up working at Tesco. Little Mix also wrote the song as an uplifting message for their fans. Nelson said, [...] "There's nothing wrong with writing songs about clubs and partying but I think it's cool to do a song with meaning." [...] Prior to [...] "Wings", the group had been vocal about standing up to bullying and wanted the song to have a similar message that listeners would be able to relate to. However, they did not want it to sound cheesy or as if they were preaching and instead wrote it with a theme of maternal advice.|$|E
500|$|M. C. Gainey {{first met}} Lost {{producer}} Carlton Cuse {{while working on}} The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. The {{opportunity to work with}} Cuse again was motivation enough to take the part of Tom, even without a script or description of the character. Gainey watches every episode of the series, but admits to not knowing what is happening much of the time. In his first appearance, in the season one finale [...] "Exodus: Part 2", Gainey was credited as [...] "bearded man", and was lovingly called [...] "Gay Tom" [...] in season 4. then in his season two appearances as [...] "Mr. Friendly". In the Official Lost Podcast, Damon Lindelof confirmed Mr. Friendly is not his real name, but is how the producers refer to him internally, because [...] "he's so friendly"; however, his surname was later suggested to actually be Friendly during Comic-Con 2009. He is nicknamed [...] "Zeke" [...] by Sawyer in [...] "The Hunting Party", which led to some critics using this name for him. In the season two finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", his name is revealed to be Tom. On his character's death, Gainey noted that [...] "just because they kill <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> show, don't mean they don't need you anymore 'cause everybody's got a past." ...|$|E
500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now {{that we want to}} do, what good is the power? Let's test it and try to get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill <b>you.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{features}} the first appearance of Cynthia Watros as Libby in Lost since the character {{was murdered in}} the second season. Despite a promise by writer's assistant Matt Ragghianti {{that there would be}} an episode in the second season in which flashbacks would focus on Libby, Watros became the first main cast member to never play the central role in a Lost episode. Following Libby's death, Co-creator/executive producer/writer Damon Lindelof revealed plans to tell her story in the third season. Libby's story was later postponed again—Lindelof stated that her back story would be told through flashbacks of a new character introduced in the fourth season. Executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse further explained that these flashbacks would unfold over multiple episodes. This failed to materialize; however, Watros made a couple of appearances via hallucinations in Michael's flashbacks in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". The writers asserted that while they had yet to shed light on the character's past, they would finally in their fifth year. The writers later made further revisions, with Cuse concluding that Libby's part in the show is [...] "pretty much finished." [...] When Watros returned to Lost for [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", she did not receive the [...] "special guest star" [...] credit, as was customary for former main cast members of Lost. She was instead billed simply as a guest star, although her name appeared with that of frequent guest star M.C. Gainey ahead of the remainder of the episode's guest cast, who were listed alphabetically on-screen. Gainey explained that [...] "just because they kill <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> show, don't mean they don't need you anymore 'cause everybody's got a past." [...] Damon Lindelof said that [...] "it was sort of like a walk down memory lane for the dead", as it not only included Tom and Libby, but also Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) and George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens), two characters from the freighter who had met their demises earlier in the season.|$|E

Tendulkar reportedly sent a text message to the BCCI saying [...] "Harbhajan is innocent and I can assure <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this...</b> In this hour of crisis, the board should stand by him".

This city will be {{the capital of the}} Lithuanian lands and the dwelling of their rulers, and the glory of their deeds shall echo throughout the world". The location offered practical advantages: it lay within the Lithuanian heartland at the confluence of two navigable rivers, surrounded by forests and wetlands that were difficult to penetrate. The duchy had been subject to intrusions by the Teutonic Knights.|$|E

[...] Zhang Wen replied, [...] "I've never held great responsibilities in the court before, nor do I possess the ability to handle diplomatic affairs well. I'm afraid I can neither spread Wu's fame as well as Zhang Zhao did, nor make decisions as well as Zichan. However, Zhuge Liang is wise, discerning and good in long-term planning, so I believe he will definitely understand your intentions and the reasons behind your dealings with Wei. With the blessing of the imperial court, I believe it won't be difficult to understand what Zhuge Liang is looking out for. There is nothing to worry about." ...|$|E

2500|$|His first {{office was}} {{as one of}} the twenty annual quaestors, a {{training}} post for serious public administration in a diversity of areas, but with a traditional emphasis on administration and rigorous accounting of public monies under the guidance of a senior magistrate or provincial commander. Cicero served as quaestor in western Sicily in 75 BC and demonstrated honesty and integrity in his dealings with the inhabitants. As a result, the grateful Sicilians asked Cicero to prosecute Gaius Verres, a governor of Sicily, who had badly plundered the province. His prosecution of Gaius Verres was a great forensic success for Cicero. Governor Gaius Verres hired the prominent lawyer of a noble family Quintus Hortensius Hortalus. After a lengthy period in Sicily collecting testimonials and evidence and persuading witnesses to come forward, Cicero returned to Rome and won the case in a series of dramatic court battles. His unique style of oratory set him apart from the flamboyant Hortensius. On the conclusion of this case, Cicero came to be considered the greatest orator in Rome. The view that Cicero may have taken the case for reasons of his own is viable. Hortensius was, at this point, known as the best lawyer in Rome; to beat him would guarantee much success and the prestige that Cicero needed to start his career. Cicero's oratorical skill is shown in his character assassination of Verres and various other techniques of persuasion used on the jury. One such example is found in the speech Against Verres I, where he states [...] "with <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> bench, gentlemen, with Marcus Acilius Glabrio as your president, I do not understand what Verres can hope to achieve". Oratory was considered a great art in ancient Rome and an important tool for disseminating knowledge and promoting oneself in elections, in part because there were no regular newspapers or mass media. Cicero was neither a patrician nor a plebeian noble; his rise to political office despite his relatively humble origins has traditionally been attributed to his brilliance as an orator.|$|E
