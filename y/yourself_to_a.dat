Rona Gindin and Jennifer Greenhill-Taylor write highly of the restaurant's hot-fudge sundaes in Fodor's 2012 Walt Disney World. In Plan Your Walt Disney World Vacation in No Time, Douglas Ingersoll writes very positively of the milkshakes, {{and argues that}} the sandwiches and burgers are better than at the fast food restaurants in the park. A reviewer for the United Kingdom's The Sentinel also writes positively of the Sci-Fi Dine-In's milkshakes, and argues that, [...] "if you chose to treat <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> good lunch {{in one of the}} Disney parks, then this is the one".|$|E
500|$|According to Denis Arnold, {{although}} Monteverdi's late operas retain {{elements of}} the earlier Renaissance intermezzo and pastoral forms, they may be fairly considered as the first modern operas. In the 1960s, however, David Johnson {{found it necessary to}} warn prospective Il ritorno listeners that if they expected to hear opera akin to Verdi, Puccini or Mozart, they would be disappointed: [...] "You have to submit <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first or second hearing merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence." [...] A few years later, Jeremy Noble in a Gramophone review wrote that Il ritorno was the least known and least performed of Monteverdi's operas, [...] "quite frankly, because its music is not so consistently full of character and imagination as that of Orfeo or Poppea." [...] Arnold called the work an [...] "ugly duckling". Later analysts have been more positive; to Mark Ringer Il ritorno is [...] "the most tender and moving of Monteverdi's operas", while in Ellen Rosand's view the composer's ability to portray real human beings through music finds its fullest realisation here, and in Poppea a few years later.|$|E

500|$|The {{last years}} of Monteverdi's life were much {{occupied}} with opera for the Venetian stage. Richard Taruskin, in his Oxford History of Western Music, gives his chapter on this topic the title [...] "Opera from Monteverdi to Monteverdi." [...] This wording, originally proposed humorously by the Italian music historian Nino Pirrotta, is interpreted seriously by Taruskin as indicating that Monteverdi is significantly responsible for {{the transformation of the}} opera genre from a private entertainment of the nobility (as with Orfeo in 1607), to what became a major commercial genre, as exemplified by his opera L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643). His two surviving operatic works of this period, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione are held by Arnold to be the first [...] "modern" [...] operas; Il ritorno is the first Venetian opera to depart from what Ellen Rosand terms [...] "the mythological pastoral". However, David Johnson in The North American Review warns audiences not to expect immediate affinity with Mozart, Verdi or Puccini: [...] "You have to submit <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence." ...|$|E

Malema said the ANCYL would emphasise its HIV programme and [...] "one boyfriend, one girlfriend" [...] stance in an awareness campaign across the country. ANC Women's League deputy president Nosipho Dorothy Ntwanambi said: [...] "it is not right to have an extramarital affair if you have committed to <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> marriage.
