500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] {{was written}} by American {{recording}} artist Chris Brown and his team which included Brian Kennedy, Rob. A and Andre Merritt, {{better known as the}} Graffiti Artizts. The track was originally considered {{to be part of the}} re-release edition of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Tom Haverford also undergoes {{changes during}} the final episodes of the season, in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions. The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in [...] "The Bubble", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, {{and the arrival of}} Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast. Schur said they sought to [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write,</b> and then you have all summer {{to figure out how to}} get yourself out of it".|$|E
500|$|When writing lyrics for {{previous}} releases, Moore would [...] "start mumbling and I try {{to figure}} out what I'm saying and then try to make it make sense". With Blood, he [...] "really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent. I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables. And if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> some words and lyrics that match that, sometimes it flows really well." [...] He described all the songs as based on [...] "personal experiences". [...] "I'll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." ...|$|E

500|$|The final {{few minutes}} of [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{introduced}} major developments for several of the characters, including Leslie being approached with the idea to run for elected office, {{which has been a}} lifelong dream for her. Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write,</b> and then you have all summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it". Although Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet and the writers would be brainstorming how to handle them over the summer.|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. According to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine, it is {{reminiscent}} of Rihanna's 2007 single [...] "Don't Stop the Music". McAlpine {{also noted that the}} song has a [...] "frosty-rave" [...] chorus accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "icy" [...] vocals. It was written by Brian Kennedy Seals, Chris Brown, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, [...] "Forever", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced [...] "Disturbia", while Makeba Riddick produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings about giving [...] "Disturbia" [...] to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have".|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{independence}} being declared, a Committee of Five {{was charged with}} drafting the Declaration, and included Adams, along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman. The Committee, after discussing the general outline that the document should follow, decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document; but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, [...] "Why will you not? You ought to do it." [...] To which Adams responded, [...] "I will not – reasons enough." [...] Jefferson replied, [...] "What can be your reasons?" [...] And Adams responded, [...] "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear {{at the head of}} this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> ten times better than I can." [...] "Well," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." [...] Adams concluded, [...] "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting." [...] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself is uncertain – accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are otherwise contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a primary role in its completion. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 4. Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as [...] "the pillar of [...] support on the floor of Congress, [...] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Singleton had {{encouraged}} Ice Cube {{to try his}} hand at screenwriting, telling him, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> a record, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> a movie." [...] With this encouragement, Ice Cube wrote the screenplay for what became the 1995 comedy Friday, in which he also starred, alongside then up-and-coming comedian Chris Tucker. Friday earned $28million worldwide on a $3.5million budget, and spawned two sequels, Next Friday and Friday After Next. In 1995, he also starred in his second collaboration with John Singleton, Higher Learning, as university student Fudge.|$|E

During a match against Andorra in March 2007, McClaren and the England team received abuse from supporters during a poor performance in a 3–0 win. McClaren {{walked out of the}} post-match press conference after only two minutes of questions, saying, [...] "Gentlemen, if you want to write whatever you want to write, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> it because that is all I am going to say.

2500|$|Being very {{detached}} from the Hollywood scene, Murray {{does not have an}} agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts in films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters, Inc., The Squid and the Whale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Little Miss Sunshine. [...] When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, [...] "It's not that hard. If you have a good script that's what gets you involved. People say they can't find me. Well, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> a good script, that's a lot harder than finding someone. I don't worry about it; it's not my problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1940 {{he wrote}} his most famous song, [...] "This Land Is Your Land", as a {{response}} to what he felt was an overplaying of Irving Berlin's [...] "God Bless America" [...] on the radio. Guthrie thought the lyrics were unrealistic and complacent. He adapted the melody from an old gospel song, [...] "Oh My Loving Brother", which had been adapted by the country group the Carter Family for their song [...] "When The World's On Fire". Guthrie signed the manuscript with the comment, [...] "All <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> is what you see". Although the song was written in 1940, it was four years before he recorded it for Moses Asch in April 1944. Sheet music was produced and given to schools by Howie Richmond sometime later.|$|E
2500|$|BYTE in 1989 listed Turbo C and Turbo Pascal {{as among}} the [...] "Distinction" [...] winners of the BYTE Awards. Citing their user {{interface}} and continued emphasis on speed, the magazine stated that [...] "for rapid prototyping there's not much better". In the same issue Pournelle again praised version 4.0 and 5.0 of Turbo Pascal. Citing Anacreon as [...] "a {{good example of how}} complex a program <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> in Pascal", and the many libraries available from Borland and other developers, he wrote [...] "I am more and more convinced that Turbo Pascal is the programming language of choice for people who are more interested in what they want the machine to do than in how to make that happen. Turbo Pascal may be neither as elegant nor as portable as C, but it's sure less obscure. I think it may well be the language for the rest of us".|$|E

[...] And I said, [...] "I...agree with you." [...] So I went to Bob Anderson, the Secretary of the Navy, and I said, [...] "There is machinery in the law which is very strict about the promotion and the Secretary can't dictate, but there is a way that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> in a precept a certain qualification that you want, and we can write it so strongly that they can't accept anybody but Rickover." [...] So I wrote a precept for a board of 6 line [...] and 3 EDOs and...tied it up so that the qualification was such that only Rickover could qualify.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first half}} of Welcome Table {{are made up of}} Angelou's grandmother's and mother's recipes, along with anecdotes that go along with them; {{the second half of the}} book include [...] "a {{dazzling}} array of international grownup tales, flavored with a collage of recipes joined together by association with Angelou". The Baltimore Sun states that Angelou [...] "uses remembered meals and dishes as a prism through which to view her own life, its turning points and its intersections with the lives of others". The essays focus on events, paired with food, that occurred throughout Angelou's life, from Angelou's childhood in Stamps, Arkansas, to her adolescence and young adulthood spent with her mother Vivian Baxter, to her career, which brought her fame. She impresses a prospective employer with Southern food; he tells her, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> half as good as you can cook, you are going to be famous". As her fame grows, [...] "the food world widens (tamales, pâté, minestrone, chachouka)" [...] and her dining companions are also among the famous (Oprah Winfrey, Jessica Mitford, Rosa Guy). She serves what M.F.K. Fisher called [...] "the first honest cassoulet I have eaten in years".|$|E
