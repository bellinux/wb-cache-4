But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} {{to answer the question}} “Why do <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> twist everything? ” We review the various ways in which twists, twisted actions and twisted crossed products arise, and then discuss some cohomological obstructions to the existence and triviality of twisted actions. Our review begins with the classical problems of classifying group extensions and irreducible unitary representations, and explains how cocycles and twisted actions arise. We then describe the various kinds of twisted actions occurring in the operator-algebra literature. For completeness, we have included brief descriptions of how cocycles arise in quantum mechanics and deformation theory. In § 2, we discuss three cohomological obstructions. These lie in, respectively, a sec-ond cohomology group, a relative cohomology group introduced by Huebschmann and Ratcliffe, and a third cohomology group. All these cohomology groups have descriptions in terms of extensions, and we use these descriptions wherever possible. The groups are related by an eight-term exact sequence which extends the usual five-term restriction-inflation sequence; our main point is that this exact sequence is compatible with our us...|$|R

30|$|In line 5 of Table  6, S 4 {{suggested}} using “the charge rule” as {{an explanation}} for why NaI would conduct electricity. Here, S 4 referred {{to the presence of}} positive charges in sodium ions and negative charges in iodide as the “charge rule.” This was further described by S 2 who stated in line 6 “when freely moving ions are present…” although she was interrupted before she could finish her thought. S 4 ’s suggestion of “to use the charge rule” appears to have prompted S 2 ’s response in line 6. S 1 asked for a group consensus: “I need to write it on the sheet, so how do <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> phrase it?” (LN 7). S 4 responded by saying “I’d put that it [NaI] will conduct electricity in an aqueous solution because it’s an ionic bond so the NaI compound would change to Na+ ions and I- ions and the particles would be surrounded by water, which [water?] conducts electricity” (LN 8). Clearly, S 4 had a good grasp of conductivity, as evidenced by her reference to NaI dissociating into charged particles which when surrounded by water will conduct electricity. In line 9, S 1 asked skeptically “So, when added to water it will change to ions?” S 4 responded by saying “Yeah” (LN 10).|$|E

He purchased the Colorado Women’s College campus, resurrected DU’s engineering school, and oversaw {{the building of}} the Driscoll University Center. He raised the University’s enrollment from 7700 in 1978 to 8600 in 1984, and increased the endowment fund from $18.5 million to $22.5 million over the same time period. Despite these achievements, financial troubles continued to plague the University. DU reported a $2.4 million deficit in 1983, and more than a $1 million deficit in 1984. As a result, Pritchard announced that in 1984 there would be no salary raises for faculty or staff. A majority of DU faculty members voted no confidence in Pritchard, and demanded he resign as chancellor. Reports published by committees of the University Faculty Senate and faculty of the arts and sciences claimed that Pritchard was responsible for “the deteriorating state of the University in general, and of enrollment and development (fund-raising) in particular.”1 The board of trustees voted unanimously to terminate Pritchard’s employment on 1984, when {{the chairman of the board}} Lucien Wulsin declared it was “time for new blood” and named himself interim chancellor.2Sargent Shriver, who directed the Peace Corps when Pritchard worked as regional director, explains “American Indians always had two chiefs—one to rule in peace, the other to lead the tribe in war.

At one point, tired of being asked how he types with boxing gloves on, Strong Bad attaches fake fingers: a shrimp, a lit birthday candle, and an action-figure toy." [...] Johnny Dee, a reviewer from The Guardian of the United Kingdom, described the humor of Strong Bad.

5000|$|At {{the first}} major of 2015 Williams opened her {{campaign}} for a 6th Australian Open title against Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium. The world No. 1 was dominant in taking the first set without dropping a game in 21 minutes. A tighter second set followed giving the American her 15th first round win at the tournament in as many tries. In the second round Williams came up against former world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva, a rematch of the 2010 Wimbledon final. Williams fell behind and then responded by rattling off ten consecutive games to win in two sets and advance to the final 32. Serena was also scheduled to play doubles with her sister Venus, drawing Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova in the first round; however, the pair pulled out without giving an official reason before the doubles tournament began and were replaced by an alternate team. In the third round Williams came up against Ukrainian counter-puncher Elina Svitolina and after overcoming a slow start, which saw her drop the first set, she fought back to take the match in three sets, hitting 45 winners to her opponent's 27. The trend of sluggish starts continued in the fourth round where Williams came up against her conqueror from the previous year's French Open, Garbiñe Muguruza. As in their previous meeting the young Spaniard took the opening set from a flat-footed Williams. The pair exchanged breaks {{early in the second}} set but the world No. 1 raised her level to earn the decisive break in the eighth game and take set two. After a difficult opening service game in the third set, in which Williams saved six break points, the American blasted a total of 15 winners to take the third set and the match. [...] "Growing up I wasn't the richest, but I had a rich family in spirit and support, and standing here with 19 championships is something I never thought would happen. I went on the courts with just a ball, a racquet and a hope. That's all I had. So all <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do something or be something, just never give up. You never know what can happen or who you can inspire. I'm just so honored." [...] Williams during her winner's speech after defeating Maria Sharapova to win her 6th Australian Open. At the quarterfinal stage Williams earned her most comfortable victory of the tournament against the previous year's surprise finalist Dominika Cibulková. The top seed hit 15 aces and dropped just four games en route to setting up a final four meeting with her sister's conqueror Madison Keys. Williams had never failed to win the title in Melbourne once making it to the semifinal stage; however, she was broken in the first game and struggled to get into her Fed Cup teammate's service games. Williams eventually broke back in sixth game and won the set in a tiebreak. The world No. 1 coasted in set two and closed out the match on her ninth match point. With passage in to her 23rd Grand Slam final Williams secured she would maintain the number 1 ranking. In the final she came up against her long-time rival and world No. 2 Maria Sharapova to whom she had not lost to in 15 consecutive meetings. Williams began the match aggressively and broke Sharapova's serve immediately. The match continued with serve until the pair traded breaks in the seventh and eighth games, then the world No. 1 broke to love to take the first set from the 2008 champion. The second set was more tightly contested with both women creating break point opportunities but ultimately going with serve to a tiebreaker. Sharapova saved two championship points on her own serve, but Williams' won on her third championship point for her 19th major title. Williams ended the match with 38 winners, including 18 aces and only 25 unforced errors to Sharapova's 21 winners, including 5 aces and 15 unforced errors. With this win Williams broke her tie with Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for second most Grand Slam singles titles in the Open Era and put herself only three major wins behind Steffi Graf's 22.|$|R

5000|$|Ekk Deewana Tha {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews upon release. Avijit Ghosh of The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5 saying, [...] "Ekk Deewana Tha has its moments but it doesn't really {{put you in}} the mood for love." [...] Oneindia.in commented that [...] "In a nutshell, Ek Deewana Tha is good romantic thriller and this can be good for this Valentine's season." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 2 stars out of 5, and said, [...] "On the whole, Ekk Deewana Tha has a few sparkling moments, that's about it. However, it lacks the fizz for the spectator to go deewana!" [...] Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express also gave the film 2 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Simbu's stubbly guy-next-door, helplessly in love with the feckless Trisha was the highlight, apart from its lovely songs, of VTV Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa: where did all the passion go in Ekk Deewana Tha?" [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN too gave the film 2 stars out of 5 saying, [...] "This Hindi remake is a disappointing bore of a love story that tests your threshold for pain as it hobbles along indulgently for close to 2 hours and 40 minutes." [...] Zee News gave the film 2 stars out of 5, and concluded that, [...] "All in all, Ekk Deewana Tha is a movie that seems to have been lost in translation. However, Prateik deserves praise for his efforts." [...] Blessy Chettiar of DNA gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, concluding saying, [...] "A simple and sweet story treated badly. Skip. Simple." [...] Komal Nahta for Koimoi.com gave the film a single star out of 5, blaming the routine story, the weak screenplay and lack of feeling of empathy for the two lead characters.

Shubha Shetty-Saha of MiD DAY too gave the film 1 star out of 5 saying, [...] "No, the story is not really as bad as it seems.

[...] Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times again gave the film 1 star out of 5 saying, [...] "We’re beyond midway through the movie: chuck chemistry, all you’re wondering is what the hell’s the story." [...] Kaveree Bamzai of India Today too gave the film 1 star out of 5, and said, [...] "We are supposed to feel the longing he has for Amy. We only feel the irritation. Get on with it <b>guys</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say. Come to the point. By the time they do you are exhausted, and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do what Prateik says Amy's character did to his feelings-showed him the middle finger. So there." [...] Kunal Guha of Yahoo! gave the film minus 1 rating, and said, [...] "it is in fact the iceberg that makes this painful love story crash as we endure the burn." ...|$|R
