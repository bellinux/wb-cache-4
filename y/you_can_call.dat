5|$|In 2011, Frusciante married Nicole Turley, drummer {{and lead}} vocalist of the {{experimental}} band Swahili Blonde. On May 8, 2015 {{it was announced that}} Turley had filed for divorce. On October 3, 2015, Turley announced that she was seeking $75,000 a month as part of their divorce settlement. According to court documents, Turley, who was already being paid $20,000 a month, needs a higher payment to maintain her quality of living. She claims her finances are down to only $30,000. Turley said that Frusciante was worth $14 million and she was entitled to more money saying that together the couple employed a team of personal assistants, and owned three homes and a private music studio. A week later Frusciante responded to Turley's demands saying that he refuses to pay her any more money and that she is also seeking $2,600 a month for gifts and expenses for her adult brother. He also said he was done footing the bill for her musical career saying “I don’t know if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> her recording efforts a hobby or a past-time … but it seems improper to characterize Nicole as a professional musician.” On October 19, 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Turley saying Frusciante had to pay his former wife $53,000 a month. Frusciante was also forced to pay $71,000 for Turley's legal expenses.|$|E

500|$|As governor, Huntsman listed {{economic}} development, health-care reform, education, {{and energy}} security as his top priorities. He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm comfortable with a requirement – <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it whatever you want, but at some point we're {{going to have to get}} serious about how we deal with this issue".|$|E

In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders. In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.|$|E

500|$|Nevermind was {{mastered}} on {{the afternoon}} of August 2 at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] intended to appear at the end of [...] "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was kind of a}} verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there." [...] When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of [...] "Something in the Way" [...] and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.|$|E
500|$|DeeKay of SoulCulture {{commented that}} [...] "even with the straightforward, hugely {{predictable}} electro-pop on the Swedish House Mafia-produced 'Numb' and 'Euphoria', Usher is operating {{at a level}} above his David Guetta and RedOne-loving peers." [...] Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that [...] "Numb" [...] is a single quality track, [...] "which we can see seeping through the radio {{in the latter half}} of 2012– with the mantra of letting your problems go and dance." [...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even though <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} the sound of a {{motorcycle}} engine. Bob Dylan's [...] "Gotta Serve Somebody" [...] is delivered, according to Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone, with [...] "the air of Old Testament-style authority it demands". James does not modify the lyrics, singing [...] "You can call me Bobby, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> me Zimmy". [...] "Don't Let My Baby Ride", originally by Deadric Malone and O. V. Wright, adds a bit of sensuality to the album with the line: [...] "If his jeans are too tight... you might see what you like". Other covers include Al Green's [...] "Rhymes", [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] (Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly, Harry M. Woods), and Otis Redding [...] "Hawg for Ya". The tempo of The Rolling Stones' [...] "Miss You" [...] is slowed down to a [...] "sensual simmer". James modified the gender mentioned in the lyrics, singing [...] "Puerto Rican boys just dying to meet you". Following [...] "Hawg" [...] are Malone's [...] "You're Gonna Make Me Cry", which features vocals by Finnigan, Sandy Jones' [...] "Walking the Back Streets", and Benny Latimore's [...] "Let's Straighten It Out". Closing the album are John Fogerty's [...] "Born on the Bayou", [...] "Come Back Baby" [...] (Ray Charles, Lightnin' Hopkins), and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller's [...] "Hound Dog".|$|E

500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown {{in the last five}} or six starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I had to work hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let me tell you, it wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us. [...] <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it a run-and-hit." [...] Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled induced labor for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its early}} days, Rutgers athletes were known informally as [...] "The Scarlet" [...] in {{reference}} to the school color, or as [...] "Queensmen" [...] {{in reference to}} the institution's first name, Queen's College. In 1925, the mascot was changed to Chanticleer, a fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart) which was used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales. At the time, the student humour magazine at Rutgers was called Chanticleer, and one of its early arts editors, Ozzie Nelson (later of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet fame) was quarterback of the Rutgers team from 1924 to 1926. The Chanticleer mascot was unveiled at a football game against Lafayette College, in which Lafayette was also introducing a new mascot, a leopard. However, the choice of Chanticleer as a mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with [...] "being chicken." [...] In 1955, the mascot was changed to the Scarlet Knight after a campus-wide election, beating out other contenders such as [...] "Queensmen", the [...] "Scarlet", the [...] "Red Lions", the [...] "Redmen" [...] and the [...] "Flying Dutchmen." [...] Earlier proposed nicknames included [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Cannoneers". When Harvey Harman, then coach of the football team, was asked why he supported changing the Rutgers mascot, he was quoted as saying, [...] "You can call it the Chanticleer, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it a fighting cock, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it any damn thing you want, but everybody knows it's a chicken." [...] Harman later is said to have bought the first [...] "Scarlet Knight" [...] mascot costume for the 1955 season, which was to be his final season as football coach at Rutgers.|$|E
