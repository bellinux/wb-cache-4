6000|$|BALSQUITH. When <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> {{that they}} are the real rulers and they can do what they like, nine times out of ten, they say, [...] "All right, tell us what to do."

6000|$|... "It {{is within}} the city limits and well within them." [...] I argued. [...] "Don't {{think that you have}} picked up a greenhorn Yankee. Do you see those hills over there?" [...] I went on, {{pointing}} toward the east (I could not see them, myself, for the drizzle); [...] "well, I was born and raised on their other side. You old fool nigger, can't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> from other people when you see 'em?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Mr. Hogarth, {{among the}} variety of kindnesses shown to me when I was [...] {{too young to have}} a proper sense of them, was used to be very [...] earnest that I should obtain the acquaintance, and if {{possible}} the [...] friendship, of Dr. Johnson; whose conversation was, to the talk of [...] other men, like Titian’s painting compared to Hudson’s, he said: [...] ‘but don’t <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> now that I say so’ (continued he) ‘for [...] the connoisseurs and I are at war, you know; and because I hate [...] them, they think I hate Titian—and let them!’ ... Of Dr. [...] Johnson, when my father and he were talking about him one day, ‘That [...] man’ (says Hogarth) ‘is not contented with believing the Bible; but [...] he fairly resolves, I think, to believe nothing but the Bible. [...] Johnson’ (added he), ‘though so wise a fellow, is more like King [...] David than King Solomon, for he says in his haste, All men are [...] liars.’ ”—MRS. PIOZZI.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the first}} party will say, But {{is it not}} written, [...] "Love not the world, neither {{the things that are}} in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him?" [...] And to that, the second party will answer, And do you say that we are not to love this fair and {{wonderful}} earth which God has made for our use, and put us into it? Why did He make it lovely? Why did He put us into it, if He did not mean us to enjoy it? That is contrary to common sense, and contrary to the whole teaching of the Old Testament. But if by the world you mean the world of man, the society in which we live--dare you compare a Christian and civilized country like England with that detestable Roman world, sunk in all abominable vices, against which St John and St Paul prophesied? Are not such thoughts unjust and uncharitable to your neighbours, to your country, to all mankind? Then the first party will say, But you do away with all devoutness; and the second party will answer, And you do away with all morality, for <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> {{that the only way to}} please God is to feel about Him in a way which not one person in a thousand can feel; and therefore what will come, and does come, of your binding heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and laying them on men's shoulders is this,--that the generality of people will care nothing about being good or doing right, because you teach them that it will not please God, and will leave all religion to a few who have these peculiar fancies and feelings.|$|E

She received her prize from BJP spokesperson, Shaina NC. “ I wore a saree in rainbow colors because when <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> you are gay, they {{try to take the}} Indian-ness out of you by terming it a 'Western' concept. I am proud to be Indian and want equal rights like any other Indian citizen”, she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I shall; I didn't sleep much last night, {{and when}} I did I dreamed like fun.

40|$|This article reports two {{worldwide}} {{studies of}} stereotypes about liars. These studies {{are carried out}} in 75 different countries and 43 different languages. In Study 1, participants respond to the open-ended question "How can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> when <b>people</b> are lying?" In Study 2, participants complete a questionnaire about lying. These two studies reveal a dominant pan-cultural stereotype: that liars avert gaze. The authors identify other common beliefs and offer a social control interpretation. 15 page(s...|$|R

What have they already had? How many should I cook for? Can I reschedule?" [...] In addition, the recipient family was also asking questions: [...] "Who is delivering tonight? Can we invite more people? Someone just called and wants to bring something by, are we available? Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> not to bring any more soup?"

5000|$|In 2014 Dan Kahan {{was skeptical}} about Ranney's {{approach}} and this website's large-scale effectiveness in educating people about global warming, telling Nova Next, [...] "I don’t {{think it makes}} sense to believe that if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> in five-minute lectures about climate science, that it’s going to solve the problem". However, Ranney and his colleagues have been assessing the videos in randomized controlled experiments and indicate that the videos (including a 4-minute German video), like the 400-word mechanistic text, increase viewers' global warming acceptance—as do the aforementioned representative statistics. In addition, the website contrasts the change in earth's temperature since 1880 with the change {{in the value of the}} Dow Jones Industrial Average (adjusted for inflation); this contrast also increases readers' global warming acceptance.|$|E
5000|$|On a March 12, 2010 {{appearance}} on the national CBS Early Show, McMillen {{said that she had}} first asked the school principal about bringing a same-sex date to the prom in December 2009, and that he said it was not allowed, due to a concern that pairs of same-sex friends who were not in a relationship would buy less expensive couples tickets instead of individual tickets. [...] McMillen said she told him [...] "you can't pretend like there's not gay people at our school, and if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> they can't bring a same-sex date, that is discrimination to them." [...] Although the school board did not explicitly say the prom was cancelled due to McMillen's request, the cancellation came only one week after the ACLU {{sent a letter to the}} board pleading her case.|$|E

5000|$|Richard Hatem {{says that}} the {{backdrop}} of the stories of Miracles were intentionally made to be those of everyday life, to better connect with the audience. Hatem acknowledged Stephen King as a powerful influence in the development of Miracles, as well as his own career; in the DVD interview he commented that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> {{you want to do something}} like Stephen King, people will listen to you". He references a book in his personal collection about a haunted apartment complex in Santa Ana, California, which Hatem claims to [...] "love more than anything"; [...] "I would love to visit the haunted apartment complex in Santa Ana". Hatem recalls enjoying the [...] "haunted gas station mini mart" [...] from the episode The Battle at Shadow Ridge, which he claimed to possibly be the [...] "goofiest" [...] episode of the series; Hatem said, [...] "If a gas station mini mart can be haunted, then I can go to sleep a happy man; then I know this world is truly a special place".|$|E
5000|$|On April 25, 2006, a video {{appearing}} to show Zarqawi surfaced. In the tape, {{the man says}} holy warriors are fighting on despite a three-year [...] "crusade". U.S. experts told the BBC they believed the recording was genuine. One part of the recording shows a man - who bears a strong resemblance to previous pictures of Zarqawi - {{sitting on the floor}} and addressing a group of masked men with an automatic rifle at his side. [...] "Your mujahideen sons were able to confront the most ferocious of crusader campaigns on a Muslim state," [...] the man says. Addressing U.S. President George W. Bush, he says: [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> that your soldiers are committing suicide, taking drugs and hallucination pills to help them sleep?" [...] "By Allah", he says, [...] "your dreams will be defeated by our blood and by our bodies. What is coming is even worse." [...] The speaker in the video also reproaches the U.S. for its [...] "arrogance and insolence" [...] in rejecting a truce offered by [...] "our prince and leader", Osama Bin Laden. The United States Army aired an unedited tape of Zarqawi in May 2006 highlighting {{the fact that he did}} not know how to clear a stoppage on the stolen M249 Squad Automatic Weapon he was using.|$|E
40|$|African-American men bear {{a greater}} burden of type- 2 {{diabetes}} {{and its associated}} complications. The purpose of this analysis was to explore in greater depth themes that emerged in illness narratives of {{a small sample of}} African-American men living with type- 2 diabetes. The primary theme that is the focus of this article is the lived experience of black manhood and masculinity and its intersection with the challenges of diabetes self-management. In-depth interviews with 16 African-American men who had established type- 2 diabetes yielded thematic analyses of four questions: (1) What do you fear most about having diabetes? (2) In what ways have people in your life treated you differently after learning you have diabetes? (3) In what ways has knowing you have diabetes affected the way you see yourself? and (4) What are some reactions when <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> you have diabetes? This preliminary study suggests that the requirements of diabetes self-management often run counter to the traditional sex roles and learned behaviors of African-American men, and this can contribute to nonadherence to medications and poor glycemic control. Gender identity is a key cultural factor that influences health-related behaviors, including how men with type- 2 diabetes engage with the healthcare system and manage their diabetes. Understanding African-American men's gender identity is an important component of cultural competency for physicians and can be consequential in patient outcomes...|$|E
