Ebert said, [...] "In 39 years, I have never written these {{words in a}} movie review, but here they are: <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{yourself}} to see this film.

[...] He said the game was [...] "one of the coolest things I've played on PC lately." [...] Kieron Gillen from Rock Paper Shotgun considered Gravity Bone to be an intellectual mix of Hitman, , and Team Fortress 2, stating {{that it is the}} [...] "wittiest game" [...] he has played since World of Goo. Gillen applauded every aspect of the game, stating that Gravity Bone was an [...] "indie art game whose main effect is to delight you at every turn."

500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged me to play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. <b>You</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E

The EP showed {{a change of}} direction from The Chameleon Script, with the band dropping {{a lot of the}} predominant ska influences. This showed a transition that the band cemented with the release of The Answer Is Never later in the same year. The album was hailed by critics as [...] "a masterpiece" [...] and [...] "one of the best British rock records ever made", with [...] firmly stating [...] "If you claim to love music, <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> yourself to own this record, simply as that".|$|E

If the fans saw {{that kind of behavior}} in a football coach, they'd be repelled by it. Isn't it funny that one kind of behavior is expected from a football coach and another from a baseball manager? And they both have essentially the same job.

IGN gave the game {{a rating of}} 8.5 out of 10, stating [...] "This is the best Assassin's Creed yet, even if that victory is claimed by an inch and not a mile.

[...] 1UP gave the game a rating of B+, stating [...] "While Revelations lacks that one supreme improvement or standout mechanic that defined AC2 and Brotherhood each, it's still a damn fine sendoff for Altair and Ezio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mobutu reproached the United States in a Newsweek interview, {{saying he}} was [...] "bitterly {{disappointed}} by America's attitude" [...] and: [...] "If you have decided to surrender piecemeal to the Soviet-Cuban grand design in Africa, I think <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> us and to your friends to have the frankness to admit it." [...] Former National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger also blamed the Soviet Union, saying, [...] "Whatever {{the details of the}} current invasion of Zaire, {{it is clear that the}} attack took place across a sovereign border from a country in which the government was installed by Soviet arms and the military personnel of a Soviet client state. It could not have taken place—and it could not continue—without the material support or acquiescence of the Soviet Union—whether or not Cuban troops are present." [...] China concurred, provoking unpleasantness with Soviet ambassadors in Beijing and later calling the FNLC invasion [...] "a new offensive drive in the Soviet Union's political and military aggression in Africa".|$|E
