2500|$|The {{song was}} written by singer-songwriter Alicia Keys and samples R singer Loleatta Holloway's [...] "We're Getting Stronger" [...] from Holloway's 1976 debut LP. Keys had {{requested}} {{to be a part}} of Houston's album and Houston decided she wanted to work with Keys after hearing her perform at one of Clive Davis' parties. Houston said for MTV News that “When she performed at one of [...] parties the year before last, I kind of looked at her, and it was when she had [...] record out, and it was the only record that came on the radio that inspired me”. “I walked over to her, and off the cuff said, ‘Hey, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> produce me?’ She said, ‘Yeah, I think I can,’ ” Houston explained.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} {{volume of the}} book A Positively Final Appearance (1997), Guinness recounts grudgingly giving an {{autograph}} to a young fan {{who claimed to have}} watched Star Wars over a hundred times, on the condition that the boy promise to stop watching the film because [...] "this {{is going to be an}} ill effect on your life". The fan was stunned at first but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently). Guinness is quoted as saying: [...] "'Well', I said, 'do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> promise never to see Star Wars again?' He burst into tears. His mother drew herself up to an immense height. 'What a dreadful thing to say to a child!' she barked, and dragged the poor kid away. Maybe she was right but I just hope the lad, now in his thirties, is not living in a fantasy world of second hand, childish banalities." [...] Guinness grew so tired of modern audiences apparently knowing him only for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi that he would throw away the mail he received from Star Wars fans without reading it.|$|E
2500|$|Rose would {{occasionally}} sexually abuse the girl herself, and would later take extreme gratification in degrading {{the child with}} acts such as binding Anna Marie to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, and forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt. From the age of 13, both Fred and Rose forced Anna Marie to prostitute herself within the household, with her clients being informed Anna Marie was 16. Nonetheless, Rose was always present {{in the room when}} these acts occurred, to ensure the girl did not reveal her true age. On one occasion when Anna Marie was aged either 13 or 14, Rose took the girl to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of barley wine. Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anna Marie. Once the trio had left the premises, Anna Marie was bundled into her father's van and beaten by Rose, who asked the girl the question: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be my friend?" [...] before she was sexually abused by both her father and stepmother.|$|E

6000|$|... "I understand, noble herald," [...] he said. [...] "Still, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{find me a}} {{messenger}} to the Lord Cromwell? If so, this trifle----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> love me?" [...] {{continued}} this persistent young man. [...] "I don't {{mean all}} at once, {{and in a}} moment, because I {{know very well that}} I am not worthy of it. But in time don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come to love me?" ...|$|E
60|$|THE PRINCESS. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{be happy}} with me? I attach such {{importance}} to that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{how long}} do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> find happiness, in calling {{beautiful}} gardens into existence, one after another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet, but {{the voice}} in me said--I mean, I dreamed--that it goes down to the river-side. If you leant on me do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> walk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|ERNEST. Oh, very well. (He {{is leaving}} these selfish ones.) I don't want your old boots. (He gives his uncle a last chance.) <b>You</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> spare me one boot? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{the creatures}} {{could have been}} driven off by a woman, {{we could have done}} it ourselves. I don't know why <b>you</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do it any better than we could." ...|$|R
60|$|MABEL CHILTERN. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} {{make your}} son behave {{a little better}} occasionally? Just as a change.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> win the {{election}} if you tried?" [...] Ruth continued, after looking at him questioningly for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|He too {{found himself}} {{compelled}} to think {{before he could}} speak again. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> like your associates {{if you were to}} be married to Mr. Thwaite?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> forget, too, uncle, {{that the}} name I am known by in the city is Robert; and that my name, at all other times, is Bob?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are indeed}} a comforter!" [...] Louise murmured. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} {{get down and}} advise us what to do? You look so far away up there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Freddie," [...] intervened Derek hastily, [...] "my mother's rather tired. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{be going}} ahead {{and getting a}} taxi?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It's a bit awkward,' he retorted. 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> make an {{exception}} in favour of the sub-editor on press night?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you really?" [...] Geoffrey exclaimed. [...] "I wish we {{were going}} with you. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take us, Master Lirriper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} find me," [...] he said, [...] "ungrateful. And now, my dear lady, let us talk about Jeanne. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> persuade her to leave London so suddenly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{might be}} {{easy enough to}} say what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> always be sure just what you DO think," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "So often I can't be sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think that}} possible?" [...] he said, {{standing}} over her, and looking down upon her. [...] "Judging {{from your own}} heart do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do that if outward circumstances made it convenient?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arabella," [...] said he, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> love a shaggy-hided {{beef with}} black hair? Could {{you love him}} for himself alone?" ...|$|E

6000|$|I have {{received}} {{this week the}} two most astonishing letters I ever yet received in my life. And {{one of them is}} yours, read this morning--telling me--that <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> write the life of an old woman! Yet <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can write the life of Christ! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{seem to me}} to {{have acted}} all through this matter like a very brave and {{sensible}} girl, Miss Hunter.

6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] she said. [...] "Austerly will be horribly anxious. Well, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{leave the}} tiller lashed, I have dinner ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cousin Eustace," [...] said Cowslip, [...] "that was a {{very nice}} story of the Gorgon's Head. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell us another as good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so, my dear?
