40|$|The {{last couple}} of years the {{interest}} of consumers for environmental products has grown. This development has resulted in new and innovative product and markets. One of these markets is the Renewable energy system (RES) market for the home consumers. The RES can be divided into Solar panels and Urban Wind Turbines (UWT), in which Solar panels are the most adopted by the consumers, but why? The most applicable system is depending on the location and environment for which UWT might be more interesting in some situations. This resulted in the research question of; ‘Why are the Urban windmills not yet adopted within the private consumer market with respect to the financial issues and the Green social status?’. The research is done for the company, Kaffee Engineering, a <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>company</b> in the Netherlands. Kaffee Engineering is in possession of a design of a UWT but doesn’t know how to put it into the market. The research is there to use for Kaffee Engineering to develop a strategy to innovate its product. The research is an exploratory, quantitative, applied and deductive research. In this the literature is used to create and examine a survey which is hold under the possible market group. Theories such as the Blue Ocean Stategy, Green Consumerism, and Value proposition are used to create the survey and to analyse the data. The sample group is living in North and South-Holland since this is an area where the product could be well implemented and has to be a house owner or an almost house owner. This since the average wind in this area is high and the product can be seen as an investment for the house. The total sample size of the survey is set to 68 participants to get sufficient data. The Survey shows that a market opening for the UWT is to develop a low costs and easy maintained product in which the looks are not very important. As a recommendation more research can be done in the investment options and new revenue models to create an even better Blue Ocean...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the relevance of}} geographic proximity for companies in our age of advanced ICT. Many visions of, and speculations on, an increased footlooseness of companies and a concomitant dispersal of urban economic activity {{have been published in}} recent years. To identify whether urban agglomeration economies (in particular, knowledge spillovers) are still a key force in preventing such dispersal, we investigate the degree of footlooseness of <b>young,</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies.</b> First, we briefly review the traditional theory of agglomeration economies, in particular knowledge spillovers. Next, we connect this theory with more recent resource-dependence views. We then present the results of an empirical analysis of <b>young,</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> in various city regions in the Netherlands.

40|$|The {{access of}} <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> in Finland to professionally {{delivered}} sources of start up and early growth finance has improved significantly {{over the last}} decade. Despite this long-term positive trend, there are major challenges that still remain. Finland’s world class innovation reputation is not yet matched by equivalent commercial success for its innovative products and services despite many recent successes. At {{the start of the}} present century, the international decline of the financial markets following the bursting of the dot. com bubble caused serious damage to technology investors in Finland given the immature venture capital infrastructure at the time. Promising but early stage enterprises were particularly vulnerable to negative market sentiments. At this crucial time, Tekes, Finnish Industry Investment Ltd., Finnvera, and Sitra all directly addressed elements of the financing problem for entrepreneurs. Each agency helped to fill the ‘financing gap’ experienced by young but high potential Finnish firms with a range of targeted financing instruments. Public policy enacted through these agencies has been extremely valuable, and probably essential, in helping many new <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> to emerge and in supporting existing young enterprises to survive the hostile first years of the twenty-first century. However, over the next five to seven years, Finland needs to further develop the financing of <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> to reflect current and new challenges, and to ensure the continuing effectiveness of the Finnish financing system across different stages of the economic cycle. A number of recommendations are made in this report. First, Finland should set an ambitious goal to make Finland one of the most vibrant investment markets in the world for investing in and creating and capturing value from <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies.</b> This market should be privately led and provide clear incentives for professional investors {{as well as for the}} entrepreneurial owner-managers to invest in and create and capture value from <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies.</b> Second, the government should give clear signals of commitment of making high growth entrepreneurship and private risk taking valued and rewarded in Finland. Tax incentives could be used to catalyze entrepreneurial activity and private investment and to reinforce this signal. Third, Finland should take an open and global approach and leverage all available financial and human resources to the nation’s long term advantage regardless of their origin. Fourth, Finland should be determined in implementing this market-centered strategy. Accordingly, the government should remove unnecessary duplication, fragmentation and unwarranted growth of public services. The improvement of inter-agency coordination and a greater customer orientation in the provision of public finance should be a priority. The state’s primary responsibility is to create the long-run conditions for the optimal working of competitive and efficient markets. Actions by the state that replace or substitute for the private and fully commercial actions of professional investors should be taken with great caution and should, at best, be viewed as temporary.

40|$|This report {{looks at}} venture capital (VC) funds, their characteristics, and functioning. It {{specifically}} {{focuses on the}} relationship between VCs and innovation, investigating whether VC funds encourage <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> to innovate or whether they successfully predict which companies will innovate more. The report also focuses on the selection process at micro-level. VC funds invest in <b>young</b> and <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> and decide where to invest based on imperfect information and signals. The ICT industry has a number of <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies.</b> VC funds have unsurprisingly concentrated their efforts into the ICT industry. In 2013, about 25 % of invested funds went into ICT companies even though ICT companies represent less than 6 % of all companies. The report then steps back to look at the macro-level. Once they have invested, VC funds use stage financing, monitoring, and exit incentives to re-align their incentives with those of the company receiving the funds. Since they rely on monitoring, VC funds usually prefer to invest in local companies that they can visit regularly. This issue of local investment is seen as a hindrance and EU policymakers have tried to remedy to this issue: the EU has passed a regulation to facilitate the cross-border funding; and the EU has partly funded the European Investment Fund to further encourage investment and cross-border investment.

40|$|This paper {{fits into}} a new trend in {{empirical}} studies on agglomeration economies paying explicit attention to heterogeneity within <b>innovative</b> <b>companies.</b> The paper represents micro-level research, {{and is based on}} 21 in-depth case studies in a selected sample of <b>young,</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> in the Netherlands. The selection criteria for sampling are derived from resource-based theory, e. g. age, size, corporate position, engaged in services or manufacturing industry. The selected sectors include mechatronics, biotechnology, ICT services and engineering services. In an attempt to identify causal factors and to identify different clusters of companies, we make use of rough set analysis, a method that typically fits small samples and qualitative data. Our research focuses on the importance perceived by company managers of a range of agglomeration advantages for the functioning of the company and on the perceived space in which the company could function satisfactorily. Based on our empirical explorations and given the theoretical positions of the selected case-studies, we arrive at the following findings (1) there is a divide of <b>young,</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> into two, namely those facing a high level of importance (in large cities), and those facing a limited importance. In addition, network-based companies that outsource most of their activities to other companies may be facing no importance at all, potentially representing a third category; (2) the strongest factor influencing importance of agglomeration economies is corporate position, e. g. being a corporate spin-off or subsidiary (or not); (3) the spatial influence of agglomeration advantages tends to be broader than large cities only, but there are differences between the individual advantages, e. g. those working in a larger area of central cities, suburban places and medium-sized cities at larger distances, and those exclusively working in large cities or the largest city. Examples of the latter are a pool of young, internationally oriented labour force and direct access to the most advanced telecommunication infrastructure and services. The paper discusses the research design and the empirical outcomes and proposes various new hypotheses to be tested in large scale research. ...|$|R

The recent EU Council deal on an 'enhanced' European patent system does not solve the above problems, and has not eliminated lingering governance issues. The risk for Europe is that a final patent agreement might be reached that does not cure the system of its major ills, and thus does not bring about any significant improvement for those that need it most: entrepreneurs and <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> starting out on the innovation process. The creation of an effective single EU patent requires (i) English-only post-grant translation, (ii) the end of nationally granted patents, (iii) phasing-out of the current 'European patent', (iv) lower fees for <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies,</b> and (v) a radical shake-up of the governance of the European Patent Office.

Moreover, other entrepreneurial attitudes such as the ability to cooperate with other firms in producing innovation or the capacity to develop significant organizational changes appear to be less important or even absent in Italian YICs.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> companies' (YICs) R&D activities {{taking into account the}} autoregressive nature of innovation. Using a large longitudinal dataset comprising Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1990 - 2008, we find that previous R&D experience is a fundamental determinant for mature and young firms, albeit to a smaller extent {{in the case of the}} YICs, suggesting that their innovation behaviour is less persistent and more erratic. Moreover, our results suggest that firm and market characteristics play a distinct role in boosting the innovation activity of firms of different age. In particular, while market concentration and the degree of product diversification are found to be important in fostering R&D activities in the sub-sample of mature firms only, YICs' spending on R&D appears to be more sensitive to demand-pull variables, suggesting the presence of credit constraints. These results have been obtained using a recently proposed dynamic type- 2 tobit estimator, which accounts for individual effects and efficiently handles the initial conditions problem.

40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been considered}} in Finland to catalyze new growth oriented <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> and to develop {{the functioning of the}} risk capital market. One approach suggested in several studies and public statements has been to consider creating tax incentives to catalyze informal venture capital investments. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review existing research knowledge and international experiences on the use of tax incentives to catalyze informal venture capital. Based on current (still quite limited) research and experiences from many countries, well designed and targeted tax incentives can be assessed to have an important role in catalyzing informal venture capital investments. Tax incentives could improve the supply of risk capital needed in growth oriented <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> and they could also strengthen the domestic ownership of Finnish companies. Furthermore, adoption of tax incentives to catalyze informal venture capital would also be seen as a clear and credible signal of positive change in the Governments attitude towards growth-oriented entrepreneurship and thereby improve the entrepreneurship culture in Finland. tax incentives, venture capital, entrepreneurship...|$|R
40|$|To {{resume the}} main findings, {{industry}} data shows that, contrary to conventional belief, the European {{industry is not}} 'small' {{as compared to the}} US industry. Although the venture capital industry is clearly underdeveloped in continental Europe, it possesses the attributes of a mature industry in the UK. However, it appears that - all over Europe - venture capitalists essentially provide late-stage development capital, and there are few investments in start-up companies. Even if conclusions must be drawn with caution, these features of the European industry may advocate some government intervention. Of course, public support can take different forms, such as tax and regulatory changes or direct inflows of capital. Regulatory impediments to the industry should obviously be removed. In the case of direct inflows, past experience in the US and Europe points out the inadequacy of conventional tools such as loans or guarantee schemes for <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies,</b> and suggests that investments in private funds offer a better alternative...|$|R

40|$|Innovation policies, {{addressing}} the barriers that inhibit Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) to innovate, {{have the potential}} to be extremely effective. Nevertheless, as this article will illustrate, market failure for innovating SMEs needs to be carefully identified, to better target government policies. And even if policy is well targeted, there could still be failures in implementation, as the evidence from actual policies being implemented in the EU and elsewhere suggest. In order to support policy making for stimulating innovation at SMEs, this article first reviews the empirical evidence on the contribution of SMEs to innovation, examining whether the barriers to innovation are related to market failures and whether SMEs are affected more by market failure induced barriers. We also take a look at trends in actual SME innovation policies in Member States and at EU level and how they have been evaluated on effectiveness.

40|$|Recent policy {{initiatives}} in the EU aim at supporting so-called <b>Young</b> <b>Innovative</b> <b>Companies</b> (YICs). This paper provides empirical evidence from German CIS {{data on the}} innovative performances of this specific type of firms, supporting why they matter. We first characterize YICs in the sample of innovation active firms. We show that firms that combine newness, smallness and high R&amp;D intensity, are rare in the sample of innovative firms, but achieve significantly higher innovative sales than other innovative firms, especially innovative sales that are new to the market. Not surprisingly, YICs view financial constraints, both internal and external, as an important factor hampering their innovation activities, significantly more so than other innovation active firms. This access to finance problem is an often used motive for government intervention. In Germany, subsidies schemes for innovation are general and not particularly targeted at YICs. When assessing {{the effectiveness of these}} public funding schemes for our sample firms, we find that they are not effective to increase the innovative sales of YICs, unlike the average innovative firm in our sample...|$|R

The focus is on behavioural additionality in R&D projects related {{to the introduction of}} a fiscal scheme for advance payment partial exemption in favour of highly qualified researchers in business enterprises in Belgium. The empirical analysis is based on a representative sample of YICs. Information regarding behavioural additionality is provided by a questionnaire sent in 2011 to all R&D active firms in Belgium. The survey combines quantitative and qualitative questions regarding the management of the money made available to the firm based on the fiscal wage pre-emption measure. We find evidence that the government support measures influence the firm’s internal management capabilities that empower resource-constrained YICs to strengthen creative innovation behaviour in terms of risk and acceleration of R&D projects during economic turbulence. The unique situation of creation of a tax incentive at the moment of economic recession sheds new insights on the relation between government support and research management in YICs. status: publishe...|$|R

However, {{we have little}} information about their relations with universities as sources of information. This paper explores university-industry interaction involving YIC in the Valencian Community, using YIC founders’ personal attributes and motivations as explanatory variables. The Valencian Community has a relatively high degree of university-industry interaction, but surprisingly little technological innovation. A survey of YICs in the region shows that, in their case, firm size {{does not affect the}} probability of contracting with universities, and that R&D intensity is not significant if we consider firm founders’ personal characteristics and motivations. YIC founders exploiting market opportunities recognized in previous business activities, and necessity entrepreneurs, are the least likely to interact with universities.

40|$|The recent {{decline in}} IPO {{activity}} {{can be explained}} by the small firms' increasing preference for being acquired rather than growing independently. This paper sheds light on this explanation by focusing on the nature of the firms facing this decision and their potential merger synergies. First, the above explanation should be particularly true for <b>Young</b> <b>Innovative</b> <b>Companies</b> (YICs), which are often superior to incumbents in originating innovations but face greater difficulties in bringing them to the market. Second, a firm's trade-off between being acquired and remaining independent strongly depends on the extent of the synergies arising from a potential merger, which are however difficult to assess ex-ante. Using a new, text-based measure of business similarity as a proxy for M&A synergies, we document that YICs facing the potential to develop larger synergies are the main responsible for the decline in IPOs. Compared to 15 years ago, the quarterly number of IPOs conducted by these firms has decreased by 20. At the same time, while M&A activity of other firms has declined, the number of acquisitions involving this particular type of firms has remained stable over time...|$|R

First we decompose the R&D intensity gap into a structural and an intrinsic component and, comparing the EU to its main competitors, we find that the gap is largely structural and that Europe's position relative to any of the other four regions, has worsened during the years 2005 - 2006. Since then, it has slightly improved relative to Japan and especially the Asian Tigers, but it has definitely worsened relative to the US and to the BRICS. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the EU-US comparison and, using firm-level data, we confirm the structural interpretation. We also find that European young companies seem to depend much more on their internal resources for the financing of R&D when compared to US young companies. This suggests that policies directed at financing <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> might play a role in closing the EU-US R&D intensity gap. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R

40|$|A country’s {{economic}} growth is often related to its ability to be innovative. Innovation is unluckily difficult to measure {{and it is hard}} to find a specific source of innovation. Start-ups/new firms are however one of those specific sources. One investment type that has specialized in investing in young and highly technological portfolio-companies is venture capital. This thesis therefore aims to investigate the impact that the venture capital industry has on <b>young</b> and <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> in Sweden by a literature review and a quantitative study of approximately 60 different companies. By firstly thoroughly examining the underlying scientific theory for this subject and furthermore examining both the international as well as the Swedish venture capital industry it was possible to conduct an empirical study. A selection of young companies was taken from an impartial source and then identified as innovative or not by Schumpeter’s definition of innovation. Moreover these companies were investigated on the premises on whether they had been invested in by venture capital or not. It was found that the Swedish venture capital industry is highly involved in <b>young</b> and <b>innovative</b> Swedish <b>companies,</b> and a linkage between innovation and venture capital exists. However {{the answer to the question}} on whether it is venture capital that drives innovation or if it is already <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> that attract venture capital is inconclusive in this thesis and future studies in this field is needed...|$|R

Results provide evidence that inhouse R&D is linked to product innovation both in mature firms and YICs; however, YICs turn out to be less in-house R&D-based and, unlike their mature counterparts, more dependent on external sources of knowledge. While this outcome corroborates and further reinforce what found—using a different methodology—in Pellegrino et al.

The results of the econometric estimations show that these attitudes turn out to be key innovative strategies in the incumbent firms but, in some specific cases (such as for the ability to cooperate), appear to be far less important in the YICs. These results are somehow worrying, since they show that Italian innovative entrepreneurs are mostly driven by routinized rather than creative strategies...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Europe’s young, dynamic, high-growth {{firms are}} in a {{precarious}} position, despite their pivotal role in bringing radically new innovations to market. EU start-ups face higher entry and growth barriers than their coun-terparts in the United States, and consequently Europe has fewer <b>young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> (YICs) than the US. Those that Europe does have are less R&D intensive. The main barriers to innovation are access to finance and the difficulty that YICs have in accruing the benefits from their innova-tions. In the current crisis, YICs must also adapt to a double whammy of credit that is even more constrained than usual, and higher bankruptcy risk. Policymakers must provide support for these firms, and they must get their policy interventions right. POLICY CHALLENGE EU member state recovery programmes pay most attention to large, long-established firms, and all but ignore young, radical innovators. This short-term approach jeopardises the long-term benefits that breakthrough innova-tions can bring. An EU YIC programme should first and foremost deal with financial constraints, and should reward the risk-taking inherent in radical innovation. Such a programme could be targeted to particular policy areas – especially environmental technology development – would relate to the pre-commercialisation stage of projects, would involve phased financing, and would not include the typical EU stipulation that projects should involve cross-border collaboration. However, project applications and evaluation should be pooled at EU level to ensure highest standards of excellence in the selection procedure...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The research analyses the case of MUUSE, a paradigmatic fashion company based in Copenhagen, Denmark in order to examine its creativity inside-out (external image and internal environment/operations).

40|$|Successful newly {{established}} companies {{are a significant}} factor for the prosperous development of a national economy. <b>Young</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>companies</b> {{play a key role}} in the quick market launch and distribution of new technologies and products. As founders only rarely have sufficient own funds, financing has a considerable influence on the success of a {{newly established}} company. In the course of the investment boom in the USA and the breathtaking speed at which American Venture Capital (VC) companies listed their newly established portfolio companies in the stock market, the general attitude seems to be that a strong VC sector makes a significant contribution to the establishment of new companies and to innovation. However, it remains to be seen what role banks play in financing young technology companies. The analysis conducted by DIW together with the KfW bank group concerning the financing pattern of credit institutions and private equity companies in the sector of young technology companies is an initial contribution towards closing the gap in regard to the German market. 1 The result of the analysis 2 is that private equity is very likely to flow into investments bearing a higher financial risk. However, such clear statements cannot be made in connection with the economic performance risk _ possibly expressed in terms of innovation contents and objectives of the project. Many indicators for the economic performance risk _ this includes the company's R&D-orientation as well as various characteristics of the executed innovation projects _ proved to be insignificant or do not show the expected trend. Only the variable 'regular research and development' increases the likelihood of receiving private equity financing. The next step in the course of the research cooperation between DIW Berlin and the KfW bank group will be the quest for the causes of these unexpected findings. ...|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurship plays {{a crucial}} role in {{economic}} development and understanding the financing of new ventures is crucial. A common belief about the financing of new ventures is that they are primarily financed by equity. Several empirical studies on entrepreneurial firm datasets show bank financing is an important source of financing for new businesses. Moreover technological innovation affects the way new ventures are funded. Equity Crowdfunding (ECF) platforms play an increasing role in the funding cycle of <b>young</b> and <b>innovative</b> <b>companies.</b> The aim of this explanatory qualitative research is to analyze the interactions between ECF and bank lending looking at the relationships these actors have implemented. Moreover, we investigate the demand-side through a qualitative analysis conducted with entrepreneurs who have successfully funded their company on a French ECF platform. Our results suggest that financial sources cannot be analyzed in isolation while their interconnectedness becomes increasingly important. Furthermore it questions the linear funding chain of outside equity financing because alternative funding sources offer various shades of funding...|$|R
