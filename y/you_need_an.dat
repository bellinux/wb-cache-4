In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor (ombudsman), Daniel Okrent, wrote that [...] "the Op-Ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing {{a range of}} views in the essays from outsiders they publish – but <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists, only two of whom {{could be classified as}} conservative (and, even then, of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and, in the case of William Safire, opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{works of}} Gilbert and Sullivan are {{themselves}} frequently pastiched and parodied. Well known {{examples of this}} include Tom Lehrer's The Elements and Clementine; Allan Sherman's I'm Called Little Butterball, When I Was a Lad, <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>an</b> Analyst and The Bronx Bird-Watcher; and The Two Ronnies' 1973 Christmas Special. Other comedians have used Gilbert and Sullivan songs as {{a key part of}} their routines, including Hinge and Bracket, Anna Russell, and the HMS Yakko episode of the animated TV series Animaniacs. Songs from Gilbert and Sullivan are often pastiched in advertising, and elaborate advertising parodies have been published, as have the likenesses of various Gilbert and Sullivan performers throughout the decades. Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature, film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, such as in the film The Girl Said No. There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biographical films, such as Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy (2000) and The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan (1953), as well as shows about the partnership, including a 1938 Broadway show, Knights of Song and a 1975 West End show called Tarantara!

What do <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> assault weapon for, if you're going hunting? That's overkill. But I don't think that means {{you go to a}} total ban {{for those who want to}} use gun for skeet shooting or hunting or things like that. But what's the point of passing gun laws if we're not going to enforce them? If you want to talk about gun control, that's where you need to start. We've got 300 gun laws on the books right now. At the end of the day, it's about how we enforce the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tumultuous {{relationship}} between Wilder and Chandler only enhanced {{the product of}} their collaboration. Wilder, in fact, believed that discord, a tug-of-war, was a vital ingredient necessary for a fruitful collaboration: [...] "If two people think alike," [...] he once said, [...] "it's like two men pulling {{at one end of}} a rope. If you are going to collaborate, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> opponent to bounce things off of." [...] His tugging with Chandler did have a softer side, it seems: over 60 years after the film's initial release, it was discovered that Chandler had agreed to appear in a fleeting cameo at 16 minutes 12 seconds into the film, glancing up from a book as Neff walks past in the hallway. This is notable because, other than a snippet from a home movie, there is no other footage of Chandler known anywhere.|$|E

[...] This leads the townspeople say he is endowed with a charm, or mutya, as it is called, that {{protected}} him from harm. [...] The young man was good at heart and simple in spirit, but also quiet and secretive. In particular, he would not say much of his frequent visits into the wood of Maria Makiling. But then war came to the land, and army officers came recruiting unmarried young men. The man entered an arranged marriage so that he could stay safely in the village. A few days before his marriage, he visits Maria one last time. [...] "I hope that you were devoted to me," [...] she said sadly, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> earthly love, and you do not have enough faith in me besides. I could have protected you and your family." [...] After saying this, she disappeared. Maria Makiling was never seen by the peasants again, nor was her humble hut ever rediscovered.|$|E
