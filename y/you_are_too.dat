Sorry to have to be so blunt, but the country is in mortal danger from our present {{government}} and our liberty is already near dead because of this government. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> stupid to turn things around with your vote, there are people out here like me who are willing to turn things around with guns, force and violence. We hope our method does not become necessary.|$|E

Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld admitted that his team needed time to co-ordinate their defence: [...] "It took us time to get into top gear and to organise ourselves. And when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> slow playing a team like Liverpool, then you expect to get punished." [...] Hitzfled was critical of his players stating that [...] "individual mistakes cost us the match." [...] He also praised man of the match Michael Owen stating that Bayern [...] "could not counter his threat." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1908 Lang was {{informed}} of his election as Bishop of Montreal. Letters from the Governor General of Canada and the Canadian High Commissioner {{urged him to}} accept, but the Archbishop of Canterbury asked him to refuse. A few weeks later a letter from Herbert Asquith, the prime minister, informed Lang {{that he had been}} nominated Archbishop of York. [...] Lang was only 44 years old, and had no experience as a diocesan bishop. On the issue of age, the Church Times believed that Asquith deliberately recommended the youngest bishop available, after strong political lobbying for the appointment of the elderly Bishop of Hereford, John Percival. Such a promotion for a suffragan, and within so short a period after ordination, was without recent precedent in the Church of England. Lang's friend Hensley Henson, a future Bishop of Durham, wrote: [...] "I am, of course, surprised that you go straight to an archbishopric... But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> meteoric for precedent." [...] The appointment was generally well received, although the Protestant Truth Society sought in vain to prevent its confirmation. Strong opponents of Anglo-Catholic practices, they maintained that as Bishop of Stepney Lang had [...] "connived at and encouraged flagrant breaking of the law relating to church ritual".|$|E

2500|$|Non-Arab {{people were}} {{reportedly}} raped by Janjaweed militiamen {{as a result}} of the Sudanese government's goal of completely eliminating the presence of black Africans and non-Arabs from Darfur. The Washington Post Foreign Service interviewed verified victims of the rapes and recorded that Arabic terms such as [...] "abid" [...] and [...] "zurga" [...] were used, which mean slave and black. One victim, Sawelah Suliman, was told by her assailant, [...] "Black girl, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> dark. You are like a dog. We want to make a light baby." [...] In an 88-page report, victims from Darfur have also accused the Rapid Support Forces of rape and assault as recently as 2015.|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the context}} of the Rwandan genocide, victims of sexual {{violence}} were predominantly attacked {{on the basis of their}} gender and ethnicity. The victims were mostly Tutsi women and girls, of all ages, while men were only seldomly the victims of war rape. Women were demonized in the anti-Tutsi propaganda prior to the 1994 genocide. The December 1990 issue of the newspaper Kangura published the [...] "Ten Commandments", four of which portrayed Tutsi women as tools of the Tutsi community, as sexual weapons that would be used by the Tutsi to weaken and ultimately to destroy the Hutu men. Gender based propaganda also included cartoons printed in newspapers that portrayed Tutsi women as sex objects. Examples of gender based hate propaganda used to incite war rape included statements by perpetrators such as [...] "You Tutsi women think that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> good for us" [...] and [...] "Let us see what a Tutsi woman tastes like". Victims of war rape during the Rwandan genocide also included Hutu women considered moderates, such as Hutu women married to Tutsi men and Hutu women politically affiliated with the Tutsi. War rape also occurred regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation, with young or beautiful women being targeted based on their gender only. Sexual violence against men occurred significantly less frequently, but it frequently included the mutilation of their genitals, which were often displayed in public. The perpetrators of war rape during the Rwandan genocide were mainly members of the Hutu militia, the [...] "Interahamwe". Rapes were also committed by military personnel within the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), including the Presidential Guard, and civilians.|$|E
