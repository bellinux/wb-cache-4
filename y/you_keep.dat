A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
500|$|Nick Pearson of PopMatters, meanwhile, was {{critical}} of the album. He began his review with the statement [...] "Once you reach the level of intellectual maturity where {{you can tell the}} difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair", and continued in the same fashion throughout. Pearson likened Johns to Kurt Cobain, saying they share a common inability; [...] "his inability to write lyrics". His only praise was for the third single released from the album, [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> Losing Sleep", stating [...] "'If <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> Losing Sleep' is proof that Silverchair are capable of recording interesting music".|$|E

Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't think I want to act full-time.

Lim responded: [...] "How do you expect non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> harping on this?
