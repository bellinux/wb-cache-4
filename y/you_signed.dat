500|$|As {{the matter}} {{involved}} the prince, Stacey consulted other {{officers in the}} regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming {{to remain in the}} regiment while he defended himself, or removing him straight away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the Duke of Connaught, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke [...] "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on half-pay. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: [...] "Because <b>you</b> <b>signed</b> that document you will never put on a sword in the regiment. If you bring a successful action you will be allowed to retire: if you fail, you will be dismissed [...] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.|$|E
2500|$|The longest {{trip was}} the voyage of about [...] on an uncomfortable sailing ship {{rounding}} the treacherous, cold, and dangerous Cape Horn between Antarctica and South America and then sailing on to California or Oregon. This trip typically took four to seven months (120 to 210 days) and cost about $350 to $500. The cost {{could be reduced}} to zero if <b>you</b> <b>signed</b> on as a crewman {{and worked as a}} common seaman. The hundreds of abandoned ships, whose crews had deserted in San Francisco Bay in 1849–50, showed many thousands chose to do this.|$|E

2500|$|Dupont and Vedel {{returned}} to Paris in disgrace and were duly court-martialed, deprived of rank and title, and imprisoned at Fort de Joux for {{their role in}} the disaster. (Dupont was not paroled until the restoration of Louis XVIII; indeed, rumours persisted that he had been quietly assassinated in captivity.) None of the commanding officers, however slight their share of the responsibility, escaped without retribution: Napoleon held that his army in Spain had been [...] "commanded by postal inspectors rather than generals." [...] In January 1809, the Emperor halted a parade in Valladolid when he recognized Dupont's chief of staff among the commanders, scolding the unfortunate officer {{in full view of the}} troops and ordering him off the square. According to General Foy, Napoleon began his tirade: [...] "What, general! did not your hand wither up when <b>you</b> <b>signed</b> that infamous capitulation?" [...] Years later, Napoleon opened an inquiry into the Convention of Andujar under the mandate of the Imperial High Court, in camera, which turned out yet another proclamation against Dupont. An Imperial decree dated May 1, 1812, prohibited any field commander to treat for capitulation and declared every unauthorized surrender a criminal act punishable by death.|$|E

[...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge you to send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} at Indian Affairs was the 1969 White Paper, {{a proposal to}} abolish the Indian Act. The paper was widely opposed by First Nations groups, and later abandoned. It was the 1969 White Paper that first brought Chrétien to widespread public attention in English Canada. At a press conference announcing the White Paper, Chrétien openly clashed with Indian activists with one First Nations women asking Chrétien [...] "When did we lose our identity?", to which the minister replied [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>signed</b> the treaties", which prompted boos and jeers. Another women from the Iroquois reserve at Brantford asked Chrétien [...] "How can you come here and ask us to become citizens, when we were here long before you?", noting the Crown had granted the Grand River valley to Joseph Brant in 1784, to which Chrétien had no reply. The Cree activist Harold Cardinal in his bestselling 1969 book The Unjust Society attacked Chrétien and Trudeau for the White Paper, accusing them of [...] "cultural genocide" [...] against the First Nations. To counteract such criticism, Chrétien during a 1970 visit to the Northwest Territories adopted from the local orphanage in Inuvik an Inuit boy, whom he named Michel, whose mother was an alcoholic prostitute and whose unknown father {{had been one of}} her johns. As Indian Affairs Minister, Chrétien {{fell in love with the}} far north of Canada, whose beauty moved him, and he vacationed in the north every summer during his time while holding the Indian Affairs portfolio.|$|E
