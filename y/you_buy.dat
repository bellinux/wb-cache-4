The main distinction between timeshare and fractional ownership is that with a timeshare <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> {{the right to use}} a property, but with fractional ownership, you are buying real estate. You get a deeded piece of real estate, just not for the entire parcel.|$|E

25|$|The {{trade deficit}} induced Buffett {{to enter the}} foreign {{currency}} market {{for the first time}} in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a gold standard for the United States dollar in 1998 at Harvard: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> in at appropriate prices.|$|E

In 2010, the Swedish Air Force's Gripen fleet completed the MS19 upgrade process, enabling compatibility with a range of weapons, including the long-range MBDA Meteor missile, the short-range IRIS-T missile and the GBU-49 laser-guided bomb. Speaking on the Gripen's selection of armaments, Saab's campaign director for India Edvard de la Motte stated that: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> Gripen, select where you want your weapons from.

"If <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> {{only one}} LP in 1972, make it this one," [...] Richard Williams wrote in Melody Maker, echoing the {{goodwill}} felt throughout the music press towards the Bangladesh relief project. Williams lavished praise on {{every one of}} the triple album's seventeen selections: Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan's interplay towards the end of [...] "Bangla Dhun" [...] made for a [...] "marvellous opening" [...] (like [...] "Charlie Parker trading licks with Johnny Hodges", he noted); Harrison's trio of All Things Must Pass tracks were [...] "nbelievably... in some ways even better" [...] than the originals, with Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner's drumming [...] "just breathtaking" [...] on [...] "Awaiting on You All"; Billy Preston's [...] "That's the Way God Planned It" [...] was [...] "feverishly exciting", the audience [...] "absolutely wild" [...] {{by the end of the}} song. [...] "Can all this be happening?" [...] Williams asked, even before moving on to the second of the three discs.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> it. And why not? The song's lovely.|$|E

500|$|The {{inclusion}} of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] on Harrison's otherwise self-produced 1973 album has confused some critics and reviewers. Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden noted: [...] "This {{was considered an}} underhand trick in some quarters. However, since the single had clearly not received the attention it merited, {{it could be argued}} that George was simply husbanding his resources carefully." [...] On release, in an otherwise highly favourable review for Material World, Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone called the song [...] "an overblown attempt to restate the [...] spiritual message in material terms: 'Won't you try some / Baby won't <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> some.'" [...] In Melody Maker, Michael Watts wrote that the song fitted the album-wide description of Harrison's personal journey to [...] "musical iconographer" [...] status from his Beatle past. Watts considered the arrangement the [...] "most imaginative" [...] on Material World and described the recording as [...] "a fairground sound, using harpsichord and couched in waltz-time".|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} {{version of the}} album contains ten tracks and the deluxe edition adds three acoustic versions as bonus tracks. Editions of the album sold at Walmart stores in North America feature a censored version of [...] "The Devil Beneath My Feet". Manson later criticized the store and its gun sales policy, categorizing Walmart in an Australian interview as [...] "that store in America which sells guns to kids but won't sell R-rated lyrics." [...] Manson went on to joke that he might [...] "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, {{and you get a}} free record with it when <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> a gun." [...] American CD versions of the album were packaged with black polycarbonate discs identical to those used by Sony for the original PlayStation in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of Concord Music from the same plant Sony used. A heat-sensitive thermal texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's balance {{of humor and}} horror, noting [...] "Although 'Leonard Betts' is not a comedy, the three writers take such pleasure in the story that <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> the situation. There's a lot of situational (and scary) humor in the script." [...] Furthermore, she noted that the ending revelation that Scully has cancer and the following conversation between Mulder and Scully was [...] "one of the season's best scenes." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the [...] "amiable quality to the story which makes its finale moments all the more of {{a kick in the}} teeth."

[...] "I hear young women going 'well if he can buy me something'", Ndegéocello explained. [...] "That song—'Put It in the Bag'—which is based on 'can <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> me some things?' And then the male counterpart, all he can really talk about is sex and if the woman can cook. And it’s funny to me. That you're {{no more than a}} whore, you just have a wedding ring." [...] "Bright Shiny Morning" [...] was titled after the book of the same name by James Frey. Ndegéocello wrote the song after reflecting on her past lies and misrepresentations, particularly those she made in an attempt to be accepted in the music industry. [...] "People change themselves", she said. [...] "Almost in the sense of creating mental anguish in order to make other people happy and to obtain celebrity and fame.

500|$|Phil Gallo of Variety called Veronica Mars [...] "the smartest teen-oriented drama since Freaks and Geeks". He enjoyed Bell's acting, {{describing}} her [...] "as charismatic {{as she is}} tough and intelligent, giving a multilayered perf that touches on simple 17-year-old insecurity and convincingly incorporates deeper issues concerning family, love and disappointment." [...] Gallo discussed the pilot's reliance on flashbacks and voiceover, and felt that neither {{got in the way}} of the storytelling or felt too obvious. He praised Thomas' writing of the [...] "fine script" [...] and Piznarski's directing. Robert Bianco of USA Today felt that Veronica Mars was more akin to Buffy Summers than Nancy Drew, with [...] "sharp wits, steely nerves and a wicked sense of humor". Bianco praised Bell's portrayal of the character, saying [...] "whether <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> the idea of teen crime-solvers or not, there's no questioning Bell's credentials as a TV star." [...] Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that the pilot was [...] "showing signs of being network television's next Buffy", emanating from a tough, emotionally battered heroine. McFarland found the acting to be fantastic, and said that Bell and Colantoni [...] "create a wonderful father-daughter dynamic". Samantha Bonar of the Los Angeles Times thought that the writing was clever, and praised Bell ability to channel charisma, smarts and frustration.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E
