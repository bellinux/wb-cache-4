The latter of the two, {{which went}} on to become particularly popular with fans of the series on the Internet, was written by Moynihan and intended for the episode [...] "Return to the Nightosphere". Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, the episodes helped make the network the number one television destination for boys aged 2–11, 6–11, and 9–14 on Monday nights. Both episodes received largely positive critical reviews.|$|E

The first said I was dead; the second said I was dying; and the third said I was about to die." [...] He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him. It finally arrived from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: [...] "I am sending you my Preludes [...] I finished them on <b>your</b> <b>little</b> piano, which arrived {{in the best possible}} condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs." [...] Chopin was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.|$|E

I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear.

500|$|... "Daddy's Little Monster" [...] {{features}} several songs, including [...] "Not Just <b>Your</b> <b>Little</b> Girl", {{written by}} Sugar. Sugar and Sanchez originally tried writing the song—which was originally {{to be called}} the [...] "Cone Zone"—together, but Sugar eventually completely rewrote it. When it came time to storyboard the episode, Sanchez with the help of former storyboard artist and then-creative director Adam Muto, storyboarded the scene, and Ward asked Sugar to record a quick demo of the song for reference. She filmed herself recording the demo, but jokingly noted that she asked [...] "Pen and Cole to face the other way" [...] out of embarrassment. The political rap featured in [...] "Daddy's Little Monster", written by Moynihan, was originally intended for [...] "Return to the Nightosphere", but was cut for time. Sugar, however, liked the song so much that she insisted it be added to [...] "Daddy's Little Monster". Moynihan was pleased with the largely positive critical reception the rap had from fans of the series.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Fool in Love" [...] is a rhapsodic ballad, which {{incorporates}} acoustic {{and electric}} guitars, synthesizers and drums. Lyrically, Rihanna tells {{of how she}} has met a relatively good man who her parents do not approve of, but requests that they accept her decision {{to be with him}} due to their love for each other, despite familial concerns. Rihanna insists that she is in love, singing [...] "Papa he's quite a man, he adores me/ He's my biggest fan." [...] She then claims that he has taken a hold over her, singing [...] "We're too far down the hole/ He's got a hold on my soul." [...] Rihanna's vocal performance in the song was described as the singer's [...] "biggest ornamented" [...] song by Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail, as well as noting that the singer emotes a sense of fatality in her vocals during the bass sequences in the song. [...] "Fool in Love" [...] displays Rihanna emoting a vulnerable style of singing, due to the lyrical content and mood in the song, which can be heard in the lyrics [...] "Papa, are you ashamed of how <b>your</b> <b>little</b> girl turned out?" [...] due to how the singer feels as though her parents are disappointed in her choice of man. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy commented that Rihanna appeared to be channelling Madonna on the song.|$|E

Select's Ian Harrison liked the song, but felt that it [...] "pilfers from The Smiths 'How Soon Is Now?'". In a review for Billboard, Larry Flick rated [...] "Vow" [...] his Critic's Choice and wrote, [...] "Move over Courtney Love. Garbage combine the tough-headed hooks of Hole with an unforgettable vocal prowl which rivals 'Miss World'. A numbed female vocal cries before a raging guitar riff begins to shatter a pain-filled pop texture. Commit to it." [...] Dan Dinello, of Alternative Press, described [...] "Vow" [...] as [...] "menacing tale of violence and revenge sounds like Patti Smith fronting The Clash while quoting the Beatles [...] "No Reply"." [...] Spins Charles Aaron likened the band to [...] "Bunnymen wannabes doing '90s reverb angst" [...] and compared Erikson's guitar to Aldo Nova, but ultimately considered that [...] "even though they sound totally prefab, the singer hints at a pleasantly pissed personality". Jude Rogers of The Guardian described the song as a [...] "Kerrang-friendly rout of skronky rawk guitars, with Ms Manson offering a gentle hello: [...] "I came to cut you UP/I came knock you DOWN/I came around to TEAR <b>your</b> <b>little</b> WORLD a-PART!" ...|$|E

The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to have asked for. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that he hung up before Tom had a chance to finish). His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door. SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another one? Look, I told <b>your</b> <b>little</b> friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E
