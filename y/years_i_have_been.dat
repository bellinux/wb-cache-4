500|$|Brownlee denied {{absolutely}} MacMillan's claims. [...] He {{said that}} there had been no sexual activity between him and MacMillan, likening their relationship instead to that of an uncle and his favourite niece. [...] To claims that he had induced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and arranged a position for her in the Attorney General's office, he asserted [...] "in the thirteen <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in public life I have never promised any person in this Province a position." [...] He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until Christopher Pattinson, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Edson, told him. [...] He further claimed that his sex life with Mrs. Brownlee was what he would consider normal for a husband and wife (which was corroborated by his wife).|$|E

[...] He became the youngest senator ever to start a seventh full term, and said, [...] "In all my life, the greatest honor bestowed upon me has been serving the people of Delaware as their United States senator." [...] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. [...] Biden resigned from the Senate later that day; in emotional farewell remarks on the Senate floor, where he had spent most of his adult life, Biden said, [...] "Every good thing I have seen happen here, every bold step taken in the 36-plus <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here, came not from the application of pressure by interest groups, but through the maturation of personal relationships." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{parliamentary}} party agreed {{on this issue}} 12–8, Hall resigned the leadership on 16 March 1972, stating that [...] "I cannot continue to lead a Party that will not follow; I cannot lead a Party which has lost its idealism and which has forgotten that its purpose for existence is to govern successfully {{for the welfare of}} all South Australians. Our Party is still deeply cleft by the persuasive influence of a number of its members in the Legislative Council." [...] Later in the speech, he said [...] "Over the last three <b>years</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> subject to a great deal of disloyalty on a continuing basis ...

[...] Premier Dunstan, with whom Hall had never had amiable relations, crossed {{the floor of the house}} and shook Hall's hand in a gesture of solidarity. Hall said he [...] "was knifed" [...] and said the conservatives' actions were [...] "a clear example of how deeply the wooden horses of the Legislative Council have entrenched themselves in the ranks of the Assembly membership". The LCL President Ian McLachlan put on a brave face, saying [...] "Mr Hall had some personal problems with the party, but these differences do not make a divided party" [...] but he was quoted the next day as saying that the proposal was mooted to gauge Hall's power. The obscure and low-key conservative Bruce Eastick was installed as the new leader, as some more prominent figures such as Millhouse were seen as too sympathetic to Hall. In the meantime, there was a strong reaction to Hall's departure among the public, and segments of the LCL, notably the youth wings, demonstrated against the events and made motions of objection. Hall had expected to become a normal backbencher, but the groundswell of support prompted a change of heart.|$|E
