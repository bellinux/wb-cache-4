6000|$|... 'Then {{have them}} all packed up,--as small as you can; never mind about wool and cases and all that. Have them close to your hand so that if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> you can take them with you. Do you understand?' ...|$|E
5000|$|He told Entertainment Weekly {{interviewer}} Melissa Maerz, [...] "When I {{was growing}} up, {{my mom and}} dad took me to the Poe museum in Richmond, Virginia.

I thought it was the coolest thing in the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|Haberlin {{was born}} in Hawaii and raised in La Cañada Flintridge, California, where he soon grew an {{interest}} in drawing. By high school, Haberlin's friends turned him into comic books, introducing him to John Byrne's work on Uncanny X-Men and Frank Miller on Daredevil, along with older artists such as Jim Starlin, Jim Steranko, John Buscema and Barry Smith. By the age of 18, Marvel Comics was already offering Haberlin {{a job as a}} penciller, which he refused because [...] "the pay was terrible, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> New York and they wouldn’t promise consistent work.".|$|R
5000|$|Bette Midler said [...] "she {{changed my}} view of the world, {{listening}} <b>to</b> those songs, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> dance, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep looking for the rebel boy." [...] Near tears, Love noted that she will turn 70 later this year, and thanked Spector [...] "for recognizing my talent and making me the main voice in his Wall of Sound." [...] Her speech elicited a standing ovation. Later, she sang [...] "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" [...] with Springsteen playing a lowdown solo on a Telecaster.|$|R

5000|$|He {{has built}} up the company. Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to a {{different}} stage in the business where it's about operations, it’s about quality, it's about efficiency.

5000|$|Bassist Richard McGuire did {{the cover}} artwork, which {{consists}} of red, yellow, and black whorls. He wanted to capture the songs' rhythms, which he described as [...] "like {{standing in the middle}} of four tornados all swirling around". The band's name is formed by placing liquid in stacked letters next to liquid written with a vertical baseline. McGuire wanted it to be readable in two directions so [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> it <b>to</b> read it." [...] The band considered [...] "Optimo" [...] to be [...] "the main track" [...] and named the EP after it.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2000, Sylvia Chang's nine-year-old son Oscar {{was kidnapped}} and held for a ransom of HK $15 million. The police found him {{after a few}} days, safe, and arrested the kidnappers.

5000|$|... "It was cruel. You saw {{the back}} fours and the keepers {{not being able}} to believe balls all night, and at the back one wrong step and it can be a nightmare. For our goal I was {{disappointed}} from a goalkeepers' union standpoint. You never want to see that happen. It's not nice, it's embarrassing, so I felt for Adam but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on from it." [...] Tim Howard, on his first goal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor {{would you}} want them. <b>You</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> about quickly, and guns would be terribly inconvenient, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> push your way through a hedge or a close thicket.

5000|$|The {{group that}} toppled the rock {{asserted}} {{that it was}} a safety hazard because a friend of theirs had broken a leg on the rock formation. Chris Havel, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department associate director, noted that the formation was fenced-off and signs warned visitors against approaching it: [...] "The fence is very clear, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> intentionally <b>move</b> the wires aside and crawl through it." ...|$|R

50|$|In 2D and 3D in GDL, all {{the model}} {{elements}} {{are linked to}} a local right-handed coordinate system. For placing an element in the desired position, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the coordinate system to the desired position (and orientation), then generate the element itself. Every movement, rotation or stretching of the coordinate system is called a transformation. Transformations are stored in a stack, which can be extended by further transformations and can be cut by deleting one or more transformations {{from the top of}} it.|$|E
50|$|Cylinder C1 is {{one inch}} in radius, and {{cylinder}} C2 is ten inches in radius. If the force exerted on C1 is 10 lbf, the force exerted by C2 is 1000 lbf because C2 is {{a hundred times}} larger in area (S = πr²) as C1. The downside to this is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> C1 a hundred inches to move C2 one inch. The most common use {{for this is the}} classical hydraulic jack where a pumping cylinder with a small diameter is connected to the lifting cylinder with a large diameter.|$|E

Tony Reynard, the chairman of Bouvier's Singapore freeport, has said, [...] "We had to move on to Luxembourg because Geneva was full. With Luxembourg we have an airport that can handle cargo.

60|$|Now why is this? Simply {{because in}} laying {{one thing on}} another you only move weight. In {{thrusting}} one thing under another, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not only <b>to</b> <b>move</b> weight, but <b>to</b> overcome friction. That is why you do it, though you are hardly aware of it: simply because so you employ less force, and take less trouble.|$|R
5000|$|Being {{based in}} Bristol was very {{important}} to Sarah; despite neither being from Bristol, both Wadd and Haynes loved the city and wanted to make the political point that to run a successful record label <b>you</b> didn’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> London. Each 7" [...] single featured a picture of the city on its centre label, the label's compilation albums were named after places in and around Bristol (and numbered after the buses that went there) and the city’s road layout provided the board for Saropoly - the board game about running an indie record label (packaged as a 7" [...] single) that was the label’s fiftieth release.|$|R

50|$|Under both NBL and IBMXF rules at {{the time}} you stayed in the same age {{division}} as according to how old you were on January 1 even though you would have an intervening birthday. Therefore Richie Anderson was still a 14 Expert in July 1982 despite turning 15 the previous March. A racer could turn 13 on say January 1 and have to race 13-year-old classes. However a racer who turned 14 on January 2 will still under the rule race in the 13-year-old class, having a day less than a full year of extra physical development over his so-called peers. Due to this both the NBL and IBMXF changed this rule during the off season between 1982 and 1983 and on the day of your birthday and after <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> up an age division, which was ABA practice.|$|E
