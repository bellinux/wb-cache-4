60|$|But <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> abroad?--I {{think they}} would go abroad; I only say that I believe such is the fact.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not,' said Evan, imperiously. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come {{to meet a}} Sassenach duinhe-wassel {{in such a way}} as that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{if a man}} had {{a danger}} hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> turn to the police for protection?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{have done}} such great things, {{politically}} speaking?" [...] Peter risked. [...] "Do {{you consider that}} {{the root of the}} matter was so essentially in him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she said, {{a little}} timidly, [...] "I don't {{understand}} this at all, {{but it is}} terribly tragic. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have lived {{if he had not}} undertaken the journey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thy {{will be done}} on earth.' He who bade us {{ask that}} boon for generations yet unborn, was very God of very God. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>He</b> <b>would</b> have bidden us ask a blessing, which <b>He</b> knew <b>would</b> never come? ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{will come}} back--come back again, {{as long as}} the red Earth rolls. He never wasted a leaf or a tree. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> squander souls? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If so, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{have let}} that house instead of keeping {{it up in}} empty state! There {{is a good deal}} of {{character}} in those Whites.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great Scott!" [...] {{answered}} her husband. [...] "How {{did you expect}} him to look? Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have a red nose and a patch over one eye?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{there is}} one thing wanting," [...] she whispered. [...] "What do you suppose, if he were here at this moment, Paul Fiske would say? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be content to listen to these brazen voices and accept their verdict?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Consider further," [...] the Marquis continued, [...] "that he {{has taken}} Broomleys and will {{therefore}} be a neighbour of ours for some time. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have done this with the knowledge in his mind he had involved me in a transaction which was destined to have an unfortunate conclusion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How long do {{you suppose}} father would keep you after I told him what I know of <b>you?</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> for a moment place the future of his {{business}} {{in the hands of}} an ex-waiter from Feinheimer's---that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> let a milk-wagon driver tell him how to run his business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY. Yes, yes: {{of course}} you are. But don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> make a better {{impression}} on the American captain {{if he were a}} little more respectably dressed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> dare?" [...] she asked, quickly, {{and then}} turned again to go in, adding in a lower tone, [...] "He would not dare. Arabs are all cowards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> see me?" [...] asked Stephen, eagerly. He was {{emboldened by}} the {{apparent}} lack of ceremony of the candidate. The landlord {{looked at him in}} some surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{did well}} to tell me, Karema, for within a moon {{of this day}} I should have been where perhaps no {{messengers}} would have found me. Now I will wait and let it be your part to prepare the mind of Bes. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> give me an army to lead to Egypt, if there were need?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{if there}} is {{anything}} special, won't you tell me?" [...] There had been something very special, which Clarissa certainly would not tell. [...] "What has he said to <b>you?</b> I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be simply cross to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His tenements are down, {{but they}} were insured; and as to his stock, he says he owes its safety entirely to <b>you,</b> Julius. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> present <b>you</b> with both his models as a testimonial, if you could only take them," [...] said Raymond.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. King's kind {{offer of}} washing his shirt {{had come to}} nothing. She asked Harold about it, and had for answer, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> after the way you served him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be {{very much}} excited?" [...] asked the girl, with the sarcastic humor which had risen up in her {{to be one of}} the reliefs of her earlier intensity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps I {{should have}} begun {{by saying that}} Felix is all but {{prepared}} to take her off. She is quite ready to go. She is devoted to him. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be wrong?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bellamy is {{not even}} on the train," [...] Von Behrling protested. [...] "He went north to Berlin. That itself is the proof that they know nothing. If he had had the merest suspicion, do <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have stayed with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, it'll be just an excuse," [...] said I. [...] "He {{is still}} after this marriage, which I wish {{from my heart}} that we could bring about. And he asks <b>you</b> because <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> I <b>would</b> {{be less likely to}} come wanting you." ...|$|R
5000|$|If Lon Cohen had a title, I didn't {{know what}} it was and I doubt if he did. Just his name was {{on the door of the}} little room on the twentieth floor, two doors down from the corner office of the publisher, and in that {{situation}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be out of the dust stirred up by the daily whirlwind of a newspaper, but he always seemed to be up, not only on what had just happened but on what was just going to happen. Archie Goodwin writing in Too Many Clients (1960), chapter 2 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{never allow}} it! You {{really think that}} such a {{creature}} as Genevieve, as perfect a lady as ever existed, must always be a victim to these hateful rules about station.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been just the thing for him; and we at Oxford together, and everything. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have liked to be there? It would have put him in mind of other things, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{mother looked}} at her with angry severity. [...] "Well, Penelope Lapham! For a {{sensible}} child, you ARE the greatest goose I ever saw. Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come here and SEE if you wouldn't let him come?" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the artists}} {{attending}} those meetings was painter John Opper, who {{said in an interview}} that Swinden was very quiet, shy, and inhibited. He also said that Swinden was one of the best painters in the group. [...] "His paintings were very powerful, very strong. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be one of those robust persons like Gorky, for instance. But he was the opposite of Gorky. He was very withdrawn." [...] Around this time, Swinden may have painted abstracts exclusively. But later, according to Irving Sandler, [...] "it was sort of a mixture between figurative and geometric abstraction. It was a kind of hard-edge figure towards the end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You won't {{be called}} upon to do that," [...] she said smiling; [...] "for this letter that I have just opened is from him, and he tells me he is coming here at once to see <b>you,</b> for <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> it <b>would</b> be too hard to ask me to spare you again so soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|She nodded. [...] "It is my one hope," [...] she said, [...] "my one hope. I go to {{meet the}} postman every morning. It is three weeks since he wrote {{and said that he}} was going to send for me. <b>You</b> don't <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> change his mind?" [...] she asked, turning {{suddenly}} towards him with almost tragic intensity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope it isn't that. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{slip away}} without telling us, {{and go back}} to the old life again? Don't believe he would. Ben isn't a bit of a sneak; that's why I like him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want you}} to think--of your husband--of Everard. He was a soldier once for a short time, was he not? What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have done now that this terrible war has come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing to do {{with his}} youth. It's the system, the infernal system. If that man had to work for his bread, like {{everybody}} else, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> dine off bank notes? No! to be sure he wouldn't! It's the system.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] the {{boy said}} sturdily. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be a {{lieutenant}} general at twenty-eight, and that all the soldiers would speak of him as they do, if it were only fortune? Look how he captured Landrecies and Solre, and drove the Austrians back from Maubeurge, and aided the Duke of Weimar to thrash them at Weilenweir, and stormed the main fort of Breisach! He {{has been successful in}} all his enterprises, and now it is said he is to command in Italy, where things have been going on badly. The cardinal would not have chosen him had he not considered that no one could do better than he." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't say {{anything}} to the boss then. He was leaning on his elbow on his rug, and didn't {{seem to want to}} be spoken to. He's like that--sometimes that familiar <b>you</b> might <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> eat out of your hand, and at others <b>he</b> <b>would</b> snub you sharper than a devil--but always quiet. Perfect gentleman, I tell you. I didn't bother him, then; but I wasn't likely to forget them two fellows, so businesslike with their knives. At that time we had only one revolver between us two--the governor's six-shooter, but loaded only in five chambers; and we had no more cartridges. He had left the box behind in a drawer in his cabin. Awkward! I had nothing but an old clasp-knife--no good at all for anything serious.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look at Leblanc,' he said. 'He's just {{a simple}} soul. There are {{hundreds}} and thousands like him. I admit, a certain dexterity, a certain lucidity, {{but there is not}} a country town in France where there is not a Leblanc or so to be found about two o'clock in its principal cafe. It's just that he isn't complicated or Super-Mannish, or any of those things that has made all he has done possible. But in happier times, don't <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Wilhelm, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have remained just what his father was, a successful epicier, very clean, very accurate, very honest. And on holidays <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have gone out with Madame Leblanc and her knitting in a punt with a jar of something gentle and have sat under a large reasonable green-lined umbrella and fished very neatly and successfully for gudgeon....' ...|$|R
