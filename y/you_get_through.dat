500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder about the people who voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you're offended by that, how do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The film review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes reports 71% positive reviews {{based on}} 52 surveyed critics {{and an average}} score of 7.4/10. [...] The site's consensus reads: [...] "The ending {{could use a little}} work but this is otherwise another sterling example of David Fincher's iron grip on atmosphere and storytelling." [...] Metacritic rated it 61/100 based on 19 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising Douglas as [...] "the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Mr. Fincher, like Michael Douglas in the film's leading role, does show real finesse in playing to the paranoia of these times". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Fincher's style is so handsomely oppressive, and Douglas' befuddlement is so cagey, that for a while the film recalls smarter excursions into heroic paranoia (The Parallax View, Total Recall)". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, [...] "It’s formulaic, yet edgy. It’s predictable, yet full of surprises. How far <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> this tall tale of a thriller before you give up and howl is a matter of personal taste. But there’s much pleasure in Fincher’s intricate color schemes, his rich sense of decor, his ability to sustain suspense {{over long periods of time}} and his sense of humor". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Emotionally, there's not much at stake in The Game — can Nicholas Van Orton be saved?! — but Douglas is the perfect actor to occupy the center of a crazed Rube Goldberg thriller. The movie has the wit to be playful about its own manipulations, even as it exploits them for maximum pulp impact". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, [...] "At times The Game is frustrating to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes". However, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers felt that [...] "Fincher's effort to cover up the plot holes is all the more noticeable for being strained ... The Game has a sunny, redemptive side that ill suits Fincher and ill serves audiences that share his former affinity for loose ends hauntingly left untied".|$|E
2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it was just one of those things where, you know, you don’t quit, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down as one of my favorite movies. But it was pretty popular." ...|$|E
