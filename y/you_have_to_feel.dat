Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season.

2500|$|Lighting {{challenges}} were abound for Greenberg {{as most of}} {{the film}} took place at night. One of the simplest techniques for lighting employed by Greenberg was using a car's headlights to dramatically produce a scene of terror. Greenberg explained, [...] "We had a scene on Zuma Beach where the bad guys are dragging somebody into the ocean. I wanted to have a very hard, but very natural, and strong look. So, I used the car headlights. It was nice because everything behind the villains fell into darkness. It had a surrealistic look." [...] Greenberg also remarked how he had a close working relationship with DeLuxe lab in getting the correct color for the extensive night shooting in the film by bluntly saying, [...] "In a movie like this I wanted the blacks to be very black, so I worked closely with DeLuxe lab ..." [...] He felt the daily challenges of night shooting visibly enhanced the appeal of Alien Nation by figuratively mentioning, [...] "as a cameraman, you can create a lot more at night.

Rachel has mixed feelings about the test results. Two pet chimpanzees are rescued from their isolated lives of misery and torment. They meet at the Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund's forest sanctuary in Mefou National Park. Theirs is a story to warm even the coldest of hearts. And Shufai, the one year old gorilla, starts life in the nursery. When he arrived 3 months ago he was nearly dead, riddled with a hunter's shotgun pellets. His name means 'courageous one' and as he walks into an enclosure full of gorillas for the first time, you can see it's a name that fits.|$|E
50|$|I {{was just}} going through the motions. I was {{completely}} numb. At the time, I was dating Dennis Rodman. He was such a fun person to be around, and we went out every night. I remember thinking, this is my out. I'm {{just going to have}} fun, and I'm not going to worry about anything. Right after my mom and sister died, I flew to Las Vegas and Dennis and I got married. I guess I was trying to cling to whatever I had. I'd lost my mom and my sister; I didn't want to lose anyone else. We were married for about five months. When I started going through some really hard times with Dennis, I became addicted to feeling that pain instead of dealing with my feelings about my mom and sister. But at some point, I realized I had to stop blaming him. So I got out of my marriage and started reading a lot of self-help books and watching Oprah Winfrey. And one day Oprah said, In order to heal, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel.</b> At that moment I realized I wasn't letting myself feel what I needed to.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to his online teaching presence Farber toured extensively throughout the United States and internationally giving lectures at the Smithsonian Institution, the George Eastman House and many universities, as well as seminars and on-location workshops with models. Education about the craft and profession {{has always been an}} integral aspect of Farber’s professional life. In his books during this period Natural Beauty (2001) and American Mood (2004) he includes a technical glossary of the locations, camera, film speeds and processing for each photograph, a consistent theme throughout his literary oeuvre. When describing his teaching methods with the magazines Photo Insider and the British Journal of Photography he also emphasizes the unique perspective of every photographer: “I like sharing how I do my work. But even in the exact same settings, no two pictures turn out identically. All photographs reflect the photographer, the technical is just one side.” And further in his introduction to Natural Beauty: “Of course, many powerful images are technically perfect, but that is not what makes them great. If the viewer is taken in by a perfect exposure, then the image lacks what is most important: the soul of its creator. All this translates as sensitivity: sensitivity to the subject, whether it be human or otherwise. A spark in the eyes is not merely a reflection of light, just as a tear is more than a drop of water. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> your subject {{in the same way that}} a dancer has to feel the music.” ...|$|E

40|$|<b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it in {{your heart}} - {{a case study of}} the {{employees}} perception about Umeå university, the internal communication and how the communication contributes to this perception”. This study is based on that deficiency is common in internal communication in a authority that consists of several different units and different occupational levels. In an authority there is variety of units, employees with different occupational levels, a hierarchical structure and laws and regulations that must be followed. Because of these characteristics, a clear internal profile might be of extra importance. The internal profile will reflect the external perception, the authority’s image. This study examines how the internal communication of an authority like Umeå University works. The aim was to find out the employees perception of Umeå University and what their perceptions of the internal communication are. The method to examine this has mainly been based on group interviews conducted with focus groups representing different occupational levels. In summary the interviews indicate that there is a common perception of the university's identity among the different occupational levels. For example, words like: young, wide, open and norrländskt. These words were not based on any official core values of the university but were brought up by the participants. Umeå university have a vision which all participants had seen before and recognized, "The University of Umeå face the future with boundless knowledge". But they found it hard to grasp the vision with related goals, they felt overall and difficult to apply in their daily work. The results showed that the focus groups believe that there are many different subcultures at Umeå University. One reason for the formation of subcultures may simply be that Umeå University is an authority and there are certain factors that affect the University's properties. Keywords: Internal communication, organizational communication, organizational identity, organizational culture, communication process, vision, subculture. ...|$|E
