25|$|For one thing, {{we would}} no longer allow breeding. People could not create {{different}} breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals {{would have to be}} refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> protective relationship with them just as you would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, and we would return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a system for {{checking}} for copying errors, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a more rapid rate of variation than nuclear DNA. This 20-fold higher mutation rate allows mtDNA to be used for more accurate tracing of maternal ancestry. Studies of mtDNA in populations have allowed ancient migration paths to be traced, such as the migration of Native Americans from Siberia or Polynesians from southeastern Asia. It has also been used to show that there is no trace of Neanderthal DNA in the European gene mixture inherited through purely maternal lineage. Due to the restrictive all or none manner of mtDNA inheritance, this result (no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA) would be likely unless there were a large percentage of Neanderthal ancestry, or there was strong positive selection for that mtDNA (for example, going back 5 generations, only 1 of your 32 ancestors contributed to your mtDNA, so if one of these 32 was pure Neanderthal you would expect that ~3% of your autosomal DNA would be of Neanderthal origin, yet <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> ~97% chance to have no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA).|$|E

The film was called an [...] "anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty" [...] by the Washington Post. His other work in period pieces such as Ken Russell's horror film The Lair of the White Worm (1988), award-winning Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993) and (as Frédéric Chopin in) Impromptu (1991) went largely unnoticed. He later called this phase of his career [...] "hilarious," [...] referring to his early films as [...] "Europuddings, where <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they {{thought that was the}} way to sell it to America." ...|$|E
