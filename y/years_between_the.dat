5|$|Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn (3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014), {{originally}} {{known as}} Anthony Wedgwood Benn, but later as Tony Benn, was a British politician, writer, and diarist.

5|$|At the opposite, the {{absolute}} chronological position of Neferhotep is debated with Ryholt and Baker seeing him respectively as the 26th and 27th pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty while Detlef Franke and Jürgen von Beckerath contend {{that he was}} only the 22nd ruler. Similarly, {{the absolute}} datation of Neferhotep's reign varies by as much as 40 <b>years</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> scholars, with Kim Ryholt dating the beginning of his reign c. 1740 BC and Thomas Schneider c. 1700 BC.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} <b>years</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Colossus-class ships' commissioning {{and the start}} of World War I, and the most important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, both ships were equipped with a director by December 1915.|$|E
5|$|For several <b>years,</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> March 1841 arson and 1848, court {{convened in}} various private residences. Without a {{courthouse}} in Oregon, the county seat, proposals {{to move the}} county seat began to circulate. Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand Detour and Daysville were all in contention for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it retained its status as county seat of Ogle County.|$|E

Before the release of the fifth book, 200million copies of the first four books had already been sold and translated into 55languages in 200countries. As the series was already a global phenomenon, the book forged new pre-order records, with thousands of people queuing outside book stores on 20 June 2003to secure their copy at midnight. Despite the security, thousands of copies were stolen from an Earlestown, Merseyside warehouse on 15 June 2003.|$|E
5|$|The 500Hispanic {{settlers}} who {{had lived}} near Los Adaes had to resettle in San Antonio in 1773. In the six <b>years</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> inspection {{and the removal of}} the settlers, the immigrant population of East Texas had increased from 200 Europeans to 500, a mixture of Spanish, French, Indians, and a few blacks. The settlers were given only five days to prepare to relocate to San Antonio. Many of them perished during the three-month trek and others died soon after arriving.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} a {{settlement}} at Northallerton since Roman times, however its growth in importance began in the 11th century when King William II gifted land to the Bishop of Durham. Under the Bishop's authority Northallerton became an important centre for religious affairs. It was also a focus for much conflict in subsequent <b>years</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> English and the Scots, most notably the Battle of the Standard, nearby in 1138, which saw losses {{of as many as}} 12,000 men.|$|E
5|$|As {{at the end}} of the 2016–17 season, the club's {{first team}} had spent 101 seasons in the top {{division}} of English football, and 13 in the second. Their worst league finish to date is 10th in the second tier, their placing {{at the end of}} the 1896–97 season. Arsenal's best-ever start to a Premier League season came in 2007–08, when they won 11 of their first 14 matches. The club's longest period without a competitive honour is 31 <b>years,</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 1889–90 and 1921–22 seasons. Ted Drake holds the record for most competitive goals in a single season for Arsenal; he scored 44 during the 1934–35 campaign.

5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} <b>years</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> St Vincents' commissioning {{and the start}} of World War I and the most important development was the director firing system. Mounted high in the ship, a fire-control director electrically provided data to the turrets via a pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, St Vincent was equipped with a director by December 1915 and the others by May 1916. The ships were fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables in the transmission stations by early 1916, which combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.|$|E

5|$|Following the Confederate raid on Washington that {{resulted}} in the Battle of Fort Stevens, new assessments were made of weak spots in Washington's defenses. In the three <b>years</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> construction of Fort Stanton and the attack on Fort Stevens, Fort Stanton's perimeter had been greatly increased with the addition of two subsidiary forts and additional rifle pits and trenches, as well as the completion of the military ring road. A report by Maj. Gen. Christopher C. Augur of the U.S. Volunteers recommended Fort Stanton receive one 32-pounder howitzer, two 4½-inch rifled guns, four 12-pounder howitzers, and two 12-pounder Napoleons to bolster its defenses and control its position {{at the center of the}} Eastern Branch defenses.|$|E
5|$|In the 35 <b>years</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> time of Chandler's {{reorganization}} and {{the election}} of Wendell H. Ford as governor in 1971, the executive branch had again become unwieldy. 60 departments and 210 boards reported directly to the governor by 1972, and duplication of services between departments had created inefficiencies. On January 1, 1973, a plan that Ford had issued in late 1972 took effect, consolidating the departments reporting to him into six program cabinets: Consumer Protection and Regulation, Development, Education and the Arts, Human Resources, Safety and Justice, and Transportation. Ford continued merging departments and reorganizing the executive branch throughout 1973 to the extent that, {{by the end of}} the year, there were only three program cabinets (Development, Education and the Arts, and Consumer Protection and Regulation) and four additional departments (Human Resources, Justice, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and Transportation).|$|E
5|$|In the east, Selvo {{not only}} {{maintained}} good {{trade relations with}} the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family to consolidate the alliance that had existed for many <b>years</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Teodora Ducas, daughter of Constantine X and sister of the reigning emperor, Michael VII. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though {{the popularity of the}} new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.|$|E
