He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and {{you look like you}} might be a lawyer; would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is possible," [...] Dias said dryly; [...] "but I don't {{remember}} {{in all these}} years we have been married that I have known <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll fight a rearguard {{action for}} you if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a bolt now," [...] volunteered Clovis; [...] "you've a clear ten yards start if you don't lose time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That won't suit her; {{you let me}} manage it, and don't {{feel any}} shame or anxiety about it. You did many a kind and generous thing for Belle when you had the power, and <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it; now let her pay her debts, and have the same pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are well}} and strong now, {{so you can}} do it pretty easily," [...] added the mother; [...] "but still, unless <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it {{yourself}} for her sake, I can get the man <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. But if <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it yourself, I think it would please her very much as an expression of your gratitude and love for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Queer? Aw, Lem, he ain't queer," [...] said Montana. [...] "He's jest white. Wade, I {{feel the}} same as <b>you.</b> I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> somethin' fer thet locoed Buster Jack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to the visit, {{that depends}} upon what <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> yourself. I should {{think that you}} would prefer staying with the Wortleys, since they are so kind as to receive you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haven't {{you been}} in bitter {{distress}} once when a helping hand was held out to you? You {{know how much it}} means. Couldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> someone a good turn when you have the chance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Lundie. Strictly speaking, I am {{the only}} authority. But my {{sister-in-law}} is Blanche's step-mother, and she is appointed guardian {{in the event of}} my death. She has a right to be consulted--in courtesy, if not in law. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it?" ...|$|E
60|$|There is a {{small part}} in Bulwer's comedy, but very good what there is--not much--my servant, who opens the play, which I should be very glad if <b>you</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Captain Zingall smiled affably. [...] "At {{the present}} moment," [...] he said, [...] "that man is my unthinkin’ slave, an’ {{whatever}} I wish him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> he does. Would any of <b>you</b> <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When he had {{finished}} his dutiful dance Tanis took him aside and begged, [...] "Dear, wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for me? I'm all out of booze, and the Bunch want to celebrate. Couldn't you just skip down to Healey Hanson's and get some?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{was just}} pretending you wouldn't come, or {{something}} had happened to keep you, so that I could have the good of the revulsion when you did come, and feel that it was worth all I had suffered. Don't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sylvia smiled rather wistfully. [...] "That must be confessed; I need {{a little}} stir and {{brightness}} and I so seldom get it. You know Muriel; I owe her a good deal, but she's so dull and she makes you feel that everything <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is wrong." ...|$|E
5000|$|Berry {{achieved}} {{a level of}} notoriety for having banned both rock and roll music {{as well as an}} [...] "obscene" [...] film from Jersey City during his tenure. Berry banned the film The Moon Is Blue from being shown for being [...] "indecent and obscene" [...] and refused to allow Bill Haley and the Comets to play a concert at municipally-owned Roosevelt Stadium. The latter act is believed to have inspired Haley to write the first protest song in rock and roll, [...] "Teenager's Mother," [...] which included the lyrics [...] "Are you right? Did you forget too soon? How much <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the Charleston?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, well; {{you must}} go, since you wish it; {{and if there}} is no other way of getting over the {{difficulty}} of having nobody to take you, I'll take you myself. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so? I can dance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, Mr. Barkis?' said I, doubtfully. 'You {{might tell}} her, if you would,' said Mr. Barkis, with another slow look at me, 'that Barkis was a-waitin' for a answer. Says you--what name is it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|LIEUTENANT (remonstrating). Oh, I say, General! No, look here, you know: {{nobody can}} say I'm a coward after Lodi. But {{to ask me}} to go into the dark by myself without a candle after such an awful {{conversation}} is a little too much. How would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it yourself? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the fox-trot," [...] he said. [...] "The {{old ones}} were no good. Have a cigarette? These are Armenian, {{or would you}} prefer a Honolulan or a Nigerian? Now," [...] he resumed, when we had lighted our cigarettes, [...] "what would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> first? Dance the tango? Hear some Hawaiian music, drink cocktails, or what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Though much surprised, and vexed, Zeke moved not a muscle. [...] "Peter," [...] said he at last--very gravely--and after mature deliberation, [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the cooking? It's easy work; and you needn't do {{anything}} else. Paul's heartier; he {{can work in}} the field when it suits him; and before long, we'll have ye at something more agreeable:--won't we, Shorty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be calm, my friend," [...] said Ned, who now {{believed}} that the poor man's mind was wandering, [...] "I don't want your gold; I wish to comfort you, if I can. Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything for you after--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, laddie, you {{are doing}} no good here, and now that my knee is getting more limber I was hoping that I might get on active service again. I {{wondered}} whether maybe <b>you</b> might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a little soldiering under me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must do that, or {{take the}} chances of providin' sport for the painted snakes, as <b>you</b> were <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a short time ago," [...] Kenton replied curtly, and I {{understood}} by the tone that he was losing patience because of the man's stubbornness.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{grandfather}} had turned back again, {{and did not}} hear the boy's reply. As soon as the white-haired man had vanished {{she said in a}} tone of pique to the child, [...] "Ungrateful little boy, how can you contradict me? Never shall you have a bonfire again unless you keep it up now. Come, tell me <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things for me, and don't deny it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure. Well, a microbe is a {{kid that}} just runs wild out in the country. He don't have to hang around in a white-tiled nursery and eat sterilized junk {{and go to bed}} when they tell him to. He has a swell time out in the woods, fishing and playing around in the dirt and going after birds' eggs and picking berries, and--oh, shucks, {{anything}} else you can think of. Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{what would}} <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Yussuf?" [...] Edgar went {{on when the}} negro had quieted down. [...] "I can {{recommend}} you here to some merchant as a faithful man whom he can trust, or {{if you would like}} to set up a shop here I will give you two hundred dollars with which to trade. Or I can take you up with us to Suez and give you strong letters of recommendation with which you can obtain employment there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{shall be}} carried out if I go!' said the girl violently; 'and I can make that a job that two of <b>you</b> won't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Isn't there anybody here,' she said, looking round, 'that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Between such old and {{intimate}} friends as ourselves,' pursues Veneering, 'there should {{in such a}} case be no reserve. Promise me that if I ask you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything for me which <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> or feel the slightest difficulty in doing, you will freely tell me so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{tears were}} so happy {{now that he}} felt that the wound was healed, and that he might venture to leave her, only asking first, [...] "And now what would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Shall I try to persuade my brother to come away from this place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lying so, {{feeling the}} magic of the sun, hearing the music of the water, and {{watching}} the girl, he regained a serener mood, and when she came back with his food he thanked her for it with a glance before which her eyes fell. [...] "I don't see why you are so kind to me, I really believe <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things for me." [...] Her head drooped to hide her face, and he went on: [...] "Why do you care for me? Tell me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Swithin also waited, wedged {{against the}} wall. Once or twice, for his sight was sharp, {{he saw her}} steal a look at him, a beseeching look, and {{hardened}} his heart {{with a kind of}} pleasure. After five minutes Boleskey, Margit, and Kasteliz appeared. Seeing Rozsi they broke into exclamations of relief, and Kasteliz, with a glance at Swithin, put his lips to her hand. Rozsi's look said, [...] "Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that?" [...] Swithin turned short on his heel, and walked away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, my child!" [...] the Professor replied emphatically. [...] "He'll go on {{doubling}} it, till he dies. You see it's always worth {{while waiting}} another year, to get {{twice as much}} money! And now what would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> my little friends? Shall I take you to see the Other Professor? This would be an excellent opportunity for a visit," [...] he said to himself, glancing at his watch: [...] "he generally takes a short rest --of fourteen minutes and a half--about this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little things, indeed!" [...] I thought again. [...] "The head-hunters are right. These are {{the things}} that women <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so?' said Robert, in {{the quiet}} matter-of-course way of one to whom painful offices had become well-nigh natural.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see it <b>do</b> {{some of your}} sums, Jeff?" [...] {{said the}} mother to the drowsy boy, {{blinking}} in a corner. [...] "You better go to bed." ...|$|R
