Budgeted at $8 million, the film became a box office flop, grossing only $1 million and was like Phoenix's previous projects, not well received by critics.|$|E
25|$|The same Greek word neaniskos (young man) {{is used in}} both Secret Mark and at Mark 14:51. If {{we accept}} Helmut Koester's theory that the {{canonical}} Mark is a revision of Secret Mark, another explanation is possible: namely, that the ancient editor who deleted an earlier encounter of Jesus with such a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cloth, then added this incident also involving a young man during Jesus' arrest.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} The Finger Guy, Stephen (Pender) {{is a man}} who pretends to be pulling an object from his pocket but in facts flips off the person, {{followed}} by oohs and aahs. He generally performs this act to a figure of authority such as a bus ticket collector, a police woman, or a judge. Sometimes these sketches break character continuity. The character is generally depicted as a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gray hoodie but has also been portrayed as a politician and a medieval knight.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} victim {{linked to the}} Michigan Murderer was a 19-year-old Eastern Michigan University {{accounting}} student named Mary Terese Fleszar, who was last seen alive {{on the evening of}} July 9, 1967, by a neighbor walking towards her Ypsilanti apartment. This neighbor twice observed a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> blue-grey Chevrolet slow to a halt beside Fleszar and begin talking to her: each time, Fleszar had shook her head and walked away from the car. Her nude body was found by two 15-year-old boys on an abandoned farm in Superior Township on August 7, and was formally identified via dental records the following day.|$|E

In April 2014, the literary publisher Graywolf Press issued Franco's first collection of poetry, Directing Herbert White. The title alludes to a poem (made by Franco into a 2010 short film) by Frank Bidart, who has served as friend and mentor to Franco.|$|E

500|$|... "Not to everyone's taste, granted, [...] is {{nevertheless}} an original and disturbing take on modern love stories" [...] was {{the view of}} Stuart Willis writing for the Sex-Gore-Mutants website. Believing that the film was a [...] "pleasant surprise", he praised the improvised nature of the work, believing that it created believable scenes and allowed the viewer {{to get to know}} the characters [...] "almost without realising." [...] He considered the acting to be very good, and particularly praised Hoyle's ability to portray a paedophile grooming a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that was both [...] "pathetic and truly sinister all at once". Rather than falling into [...] "tasteless exploitation", Willis thought that the film was saved by a lack of sensationalism. Praising the exterior scenes as [...] "beautifully atmospheric" [...] and the music as [...] "fitting the laconic mood and sense of ill-foreboding well", he considered the film to be a good example of low-key filmmaking, akin to that produced in Britain during the early 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The tale {{can be read}} as {{the social}} and sexual {{maturation}} of a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brutal world. The soldier has his knapsack (mind and talents) and his sword (power and phallus), and learns not to deplete them wastefully but to control them and direct them for personal happiness and success. The psychological thrust of the tale is connected to Andersen’s criticism of the artificiality, hypocrisy, and injustice of the aristocracy and its eventual overthrow by the [...] "true nobility" [...] of the young, lower-class soldier.|$|E

2500|$|At the Spring Salon of 1921, Gecan {{exhibited}} the painting [...] "Cinik" [...] (The Cynic), {{which is now}} considered the most important work of Croatian Expressionist painting. This image derives from cubist and expressionist styles, symbolizing {{the world as a}} stage, and marked deformation of character. A <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> red suit and bow tie sits at an oversized table with a shifted perspective that is tilted towards the viewer. He is reading Der Sturm, a newspaper that was known to promote expressionist art. The man in the picture is Gecan himself, who at the time was 27 years old. He looks cramped and awkward, the body language suggesting some inner turmoil, while the facial expression is a grimace.|$|E
2500|$|In Mark 14:51-52, a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> linen cloth is seized during Jesus' arrest, but he escapes at {{the cost}} of his clothing. This passage seems to {{have little to do with}} the rest of the narrative, and it has given cause to various interpretations. Often it is {{suggested}} that the young man is Mark himself. Some commentators believe that the boy was a stranger, who lived near the garden and, after being awakened, ran out, half-dressed, to see what all the noise was about (vv. 46-49). W. L. Lane thinks that Mark mentioned this episode in order to make it clear that [...] "all (not only the disciples) fled, leaving Jesus alone in the custody of the police." ...|$|E

In 1853, they started their first missionary journal, The Missionary Reporter. In 1859, the religious revival which reached Britain had a transforming effect on many of the assemblies and brought in new leaders such as Joseph Denham Smith. Ulster became one of the stronger centres, and expansion occurred in Scotland and northern England. In London, Thomas John Barnardo began his rescue work with orphans. Dwight L. Moody from Chicago, on a trip to England to visit George Müller and Charles H.
