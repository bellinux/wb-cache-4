50|$|The <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> is a diurnal hunter, {{which usually}} hunts in pairs, {{but may also}} hunt in packs of three or more. It preys on rats, mice, hares, snakes, lizards, eggs and ground nesting birds such as {{pheasants}} and francolins. It is reported to kill cats and poultry. It {{has been known to}} feed on human corpses, and was once thought to be able to attack an unarmed man in groups of 3 to 4. The <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> may prey on small ungulates. In the Himalayas and Burma, it is reported to frequently kill muntjac fawns, while in Ussuriland the base of its diet consists of musk deer, particularly in winter. The young of larger ungulate species are also taken, but within a weight range of 10 to 12 kg. In winter, the <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> hunts musk deer by driving them onto ice. Two or three yellow-throated martens can consume a musk deer carcass in 2 to 3 days. Other ungulate species preyed upon by the <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> include young wapiti, spotted deer, roe deer and goral. Wild boar piglets are also taken on occasion. It may prey on panda cubs and smaller marten species, such as sables. In areas where it is sympatric with tigers, the <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> may trail them and feed on their kills. Like other martens, it supplements its diet with nectar and fruit, and is therefore considered to be an important seed disperser. The <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> has few predators itself but occasionally they may fall foul of much larger carnivores and sporadic individuals have turned up in the scat or stomachs of Siberian tigers and Asian black bears.|$|E
50|$|Their predators include leopard snow leopard, Eurasian lynx, red fox, gray wolf. Juveniles {{were also}} killed by <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> and large raptors.|$|E
50|$|Chitwan is {{considered}} to have the highest population density of sloth bears with an estimated 200 to 250 individuals. Smooth-coated otters inhabit the numerous creeks and rivulets. Bengal foxes, spotted linsangs and honey badgers roam the jungle for prey. Striped hyenas prevail on the southern slopes of the Churia Hills. During a camera trapping survey in 2011, wild dogs were recorded in the southern and western parts of the park, as well as golden jackals, fishing cats, jungle cats, leopard cats, large and small Indian civets, Asian palm civets, crab-eating mongooses and <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>martens.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{giant panda}} {{is the most}} famous species of the reserve. Other typical larger Carnivora are North-Chinese leopards, Ussuri dholes, Asian black bears, Asiatic golden cats, red pandas, hog badgers and <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>martens.</b> Hooved mammals are {{represented}} by Sichuan takins, wild boar, musk deer, mainland serows, Chinese gorals, tufted deer and sambar deer. Other noticeable mammals include golden snub-nosed monkeys, Tibetan macaques, complex-toothed flying squirrels, bamboo rats, and porcupines. Because the reserve comprises different altitudes, it includes tropical and temperate climate zones and harbors species typically for the tropics, like clouded leopards and sambar deer as well as species from temperate regions, like white-lipped deer, snow leopards and Turkestan lynxes.|$|R
50|$|This zone {{is home to}} Humboldt penguins, cranes and flamingos, {{along with}} the Borneo longhouse aviary. The Borneo Longhouse {{walkthrough}} exhibit was opened in 2007 by actor Brian Blessed and the Malaysian High Commissioner, His Excellency Datuk Abd Aziz Mohammed. The exhibit, built to replicate a traditional longhouse, provides a naturalistic environment for the birds which live there, and enables visitors to walk inside the aviary and see first-hand the importance of wetland habitats throughout the world. There are also a number of non-avian species {{to be found in}} the Wet and Wild zone including tapirs, capybaras, <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>martens,</b> bush dogs and prairie dogs.|$|R
5000|$|The first written {{description}} of the <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> in the Western World is given by Thomas Pennant in his History of Quadrupeds (1781), in which he named it [...] "White-cheeked Weasel". Pieter Boddaert featured it in his Elenchus Animalium with the name Mustela flavigula. For a long period after the Elenchus publication, {{the existence of the}} <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> was considered doubtful by many zoologists, until a skin was presented to the Museum of the East India Company in 1824 by Thomas Hardwicke.|$|E
50|$|The species {{occurs in}} {{subtropical}} and tropical forests from the Himalayas to eastern Russia, {{south to the}} Malay Peninsula and Sunda Shelf (Borneo, Sumatra, and Java) to Taiwan. The <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> {{has been reported in}} the northeast Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Himalayan West Bengal and Assam and in Burma. It occurs in central and northeastern China and the Korean Peninsula. The <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> is well distributed, but uncommon throughout mainland Malaya. It also occurs in the central mountain range and the southern areas of Taiwan.|$|E
5000|$|... 10 {{species of}} mammals were {{confirmed}} from this forest type {{within the park}} from camera trap surveys which includes the Bengal tiger, Himalayan black bear and <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The name Tetraophasis is a {{combination}} of the genus name Tetrao (the name Carl Linnaeus gave grouse in 1758), and the modern Latin word phasis, meaning [...] "pheasant". Monal-partridge are close relatives of monals and more distantly related to tragopan. They are boreal adapted species of high altitudes. Like monals they dig in alpine biomes for tubers, rhizomes and invertebrates as well as rodent pups and voles. Monal-partridges are important prey species for raptors, owls and <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>martens.</b> Like monals, monal-partridges are strictly monogamous. The female incubates the eggs until the last 48 hours when the male may take over night time nest brooding. This is a habit documented in blood pheasants, tragopans and monals. Both sexes rear the chicks, which are not fully mature until their second year. Unlike monals the sexes do not separate during winter. Monal-partridges are strong fliers. They evidently compete with koklass as the two are rarely to be heard or seen in the same valleys.|$|R
500|$|Leopards {{are found}} in areas which are {{abundant}} in hills but may also venture into the lowland jungles. Smaller felines include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Other mammals include four kinds of deer (barking, sambar, hog and chital), sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian gray mongooses, otters, <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>martens,</b> bharal, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus monkeys. In the summer, elephants {{can be seen in}} herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurgii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) {{are found in}} the rivers. Butterflies [...] and birds of the region include red Helen (Papilio helenus), the great eggfly (Hypolimnos bolina), common tiger (Danaus genutia), pale wanderer (Pareronia avatar avatar), jungle babbler, tawny-bellied babbler, great slaty woodpecker, red-breasted parakeet, orange-breasted green pigeon and chestnut-winged cuckoo. In 2011, a rare migratory bird, the [...] bean goose, was also seen in the Jim Corbett National Park.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} prey selection, Siberian weasels are midway between small, rodent-eating mustelids {{and the more}} {{polyphagous}} martens. They rarely eat reptiles, invertebrates and plants, preferring instead to prey on rodents of small to moderate size. Water voles are their most frequent prey in their western range, while voles and mice are eaten in their eastern range. Moderate sized rodents targeted by Siberian weasels in the east include Daurian and Alpine pikas, and Siberian zokors. In local areas, chipmunks, muskrats, red squirrels and jerboas are eaten. Fish may be eaten in some areas during certain seasons. In Ussuriland, they may scavenge extensively on the kills of wolves and <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>martens</b> during the winter. Elsewhere, small birds are an important food item. Reptiles and amphibians are typically eaten at {{the periphery of the}} Siberian weasel's range. Plant foods known to be eaten by Siberian weasels include pine nuts and actinidia fruits. They typically eat about 100-120 gm of food daily, and cache excess food. In urban areas in China, Siberian weasels prey extensively on rats. They are capable of single-handedly killing and dragging the largest fowls. In contrast to sables, which are ambush predators, Siberian weasels are active hunters, readily chasing prey through snow, logs, water and people's houses.|$|R
50|$|Blue {{pine forests}} are {{predominantly}} {{found in the}} western part of the park between 2100 m to 3000 m. Only mammal species recorded from this forest types is the <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> holds extensive, but not permanent, home-ranges. It {{actively}} patrols its territory, {{having been}} known to cover over 10 to 20 km {{in a single day}} and night. It primarily hunts on the ground, but can climb trees proficiently, being capable of making jumps up to 8 to 9 meters in distance between branches. After March snowfalls, the <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> restricts its activities up treetops. Estrus occurs twice a year, from mid-February to late March and from late June to early August. During these periods, the males fight each other for access to females. Litters typically consist of two or three kits and rarely four.|$|E
5000|$|... • Carnivores are: Indian jackal (Canis aureus indicus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Himalayan {{black bear}} (Selenarctos thibetanus laniger) (V), <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes flavigula), leopard cat (Felis bengalensis), Indian leopard (Panthera pardus fusca) (V) and snow leopard (Uncia uncia).|$|E
50|$|The main {{attraction}} of Pangot are its birds; around 580 bird {{species have been}} recorded in this area. One can see a variety of Himalayan species along the way such as lammergeier, Himalayan griffon, blue-winged minla, spotted & slaty-backed forktail, rufous-bellied woodpecker, rufous-bellied niltava, khalij pheasant, variety of thrushes etc. Almost 150 bird species have been recorded at Pangot and the surrounding areas. The numerous perennial & seasonal creeks are home {{to a variety of}} flora and fauna including leopards, <b>yellow-throated</b> Himalayan <b>martens,</b> Himalayan palm civets, ghorals, barking deer and sambhar.|$|R
50|$|Birdlife is {{outstanding}} in its {{breadth of}} species; over 350 species may comfortably {{be seen at}} various elevations {{over the course of}} the year, including both endemic species and migratory species from Tibet, Central Asia and Siberia. Quite a few endemic species of pheasants and raptors are among the more charismatic species that can be easily seen. As for wild mammals, leopards transit the area from time to time; their prey are mainly dogs, including strays from Landour-Mussoorie and the neighboring villages. Also present are some jackals, barking deer (muntjac), goral (goat-antelope) and the secretive sloth bear. Among smaller mammals, <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>martens,</b> civets, jungle cats, and Himalayan weasels are seen, and the occasional flying squirrel. Pesky rhesus macaques and Hanuman langurs are as present in Landour as anywhere. Poaching has severely reduced the numbers of the larger wild mammals, though the habitat itself could support larger populations. Of course, most charismatic megafauna had already been wiped out by the British in the 19th century. Unsurprising, given the British penchant for 'blood sport', especially among the soldiery. After all, Mussoorie was first 'discovered' by Captain Young on a shooting expedition from his garrison in Dehradun. The ecology of the area clearly shows that tiger, Himalayan black bear, striped hyena, sambar, serow, Himalayan tahr, gaur and other impressive species (all are now locally extinct) were well represented in Mussoorie-Landour before British colonization; 19th-century writings by British hunters boast of the countless trophies they collected in the area.|$|R
50|$|The <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes flavigula) is an Asian {{species of}} marten which is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern {{due to its}} wide distribution, evidently {{relatively}} stable population, occurrence {{in a number of}} protected areas, and lack of major threats.|$|E
