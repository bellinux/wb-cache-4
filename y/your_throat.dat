Modern fado is popular in Portugal, and has produced many renowned musicians. According to tradition, to applaud fado in Lisbon you clap your hands, in Coimbra you cough as if clearing <b>your</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E

At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E
500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men.

"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)", {{the lead}} single and first {{track of the}} album, was mainly written by Lohan as a letter to her father, Michael Lohan, who was incarcerated in June 2005 after {{surviving}} a car crash {{for which he was}} charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Additional writing and song production was done by Greg Wells and Kara DioGuardi, who revealed, [...] "If you solo the vocals you'll hear race cars, because we brought the studio to [...] trailer on [...] I'm not kidding!

2500|$|A slider is a {{very small}} square {{hamburger}} patty sprinkled with diced onions and served on an equally small bun. According to the earliest citations, the name originated aboard U.S. Navy ships, due to the manner in which greasy burgers slid across the galley grill as the ship pitched and rolled. Other versions claim the term [...] "slider" [...] originated from the hamburgers served by flight line galleys at military airfields, which were so greasy they slid right through you; or because their small size allows them to [...] "slide" [...] right down <b>your</b> <b>throat</b> in one or two bites.|$|E

They also used makeup, apparently quite outrageously. Eubulus, a comic author, offers these courtesans derision: [...] "plastered over with layers of white lead, … jowls smeared with mulberry juice. And {{if you go out}} on a summer's day, two rills of inky water flow from your eyes, and the sweat rolling from your cheeks upon <b>your</b> <b>throat</b> makes a vermilion furrow, while the hairs blown about on your faces look grey, they are so full of white lead".|$|E

2500|$|On {{his final}} {{performance}} {{before heading to}} Niagara for training, Wallenda walked [...] above Baltimore's Inner Harbor. [...] According to Wallenda, {{it was the first}} time anyone had attached a high-wire to a barge; he remarked that the configuration made the walk [...] "a little more unstable" [...] than normal. [...] Near the end of the [...] journey, he had a significant slip, but managed to regain his balance quickly. [...] He called the slip [...] "a wake-up call" [...] for Niagara. [...] "My friend was up in the basket and I started talking to him, and it was just enough of a distraction", he explained. [...] "The wire kind of moved a little bit and I just misstepped. It's why I've trained for so long: you stay on the wire. Your heart jumps up into <b>your</b> <b>throat</b> and two seconds later, you're fine." [...] The May 9 event was sponsored by Ripley's Believe It or Not which was opening a museum on the harbor. [...] When it opened it June, a feature exhibit allowed visitors to walk on a piece of the wire Wallenda had used in Baltimore.|$|E

2500|$|Madame Nhu's brother-in-law, Ngo Dinh Diem, {{had been}} {{appointed}} Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by her mother's distant cousin, Emperor Bảo Đại, after the French had been defeated at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the south. After the French defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, the French wanted {{to hang on to}} a zone of influence in the south by keeping the Emperor Bảo Đại, while the Americans wanted to push the French out by having Diem create a republic [...] Diem in the words of an American diplomat had developed [...] "a blind hatred of the French" [...] and the Americans believed that South Vietnam needed an anti-Communist leader who was not tainted with any associations with the French, which led them to back Diem. Madame Nhu had lobbied Bao Dai to appoint her brother-in-law Prime Minister and believed that it was her influence that led to the appointment. She was deeply shocked to learn the real reason why Bao Dai had appointed Diem Prime Minister was out of the expectation that he would fail in order to neutralize him as the State of Vietnam was in a serious political and economic crisis by 1954 that almost nobody expected Diem to master, and she never forgave either the Emperor or the French for their plot to ruin Diem. In order to ensure American support for Diem, Madame Nhu befriended Americans working at the embassy in Saigon known to be CIA agents. For their part, the French backed General Nguyễn Văn Hinh as Prime Minister, and he in his turn had won the support of the Binh Xuyen crime syndicate that dominated the economic life of Saigon. Giving Madame Nhu an additional reason to intrigue against Hinh was his repeated boasting when he deposed Diem he would make Madame Nhu into another of his concubines. At a party, Madame Nhu confronted Hinh to tell him: [...] "You are never going to overthrow this government because you don't have the guts. And if you do overthrow the government, you will never have me because I will claw <b>your</b> <b>throat</b> out first!" [...] To win support for Diem, Madame Nhu hit upon the idea of enlisting support from the million or so refugees, many of them Catholics who fled to the south after the Geneva accords had partitioned Vietnam, organizing them for a massive pro-Diem demonstration on 21 September 1954. The rally in Saigon led a confrontation on the streets between Madame Nhu and Binh Xuyen gunmen, with Nhu daring the thugs to kill her right then and there, which caused them to demurr, and the rally went on. Emboldened by this triumph, Diem saw a chance to put his puritanical Roman Catholic values into practice and to strike a blow at the Binh Xuyen at the same time by shutting down the brothels, gambling houses and opium dens of Saigon owned by the Binh Xuyen while having pornographic magazines burned on the streets (the Binh Xuyen were the largest producers and sellers of pornography in Vietnam).|$|E
