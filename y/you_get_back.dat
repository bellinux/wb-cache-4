500|$|During {{his brief}} {{career in the}} NFL, Leaf {{appeared}} in 25 games and made 21 starts. He completed 317 of 655 (48.4%) passes for 3,666 yards, with 14 touchdowns and 36 interceptions and a career quarterback rating of only 50.0. After hearing of Leaf's retirement, Rodney Harrison, {{one of his most}} outspoken critics on the Chargers, said, [...] "He took the money and ran.

The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think {{you are in the}} job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the band's {{eventual}} return, Ed Droste noted, [...] "Coming {{back together}} {{to try to}} write and record was like being in junior high again – after you go away for the summer, {{the first couple of}} weeks are slightly awkward when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to school. Then, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the swing." [...] Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "The whole process with this record felt like starting over. We took enough time off that we... I don't know. My head kind of went out of the game or something. Getting back into it was really confusing. It took a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|I've {{always thought}} that Roe v.

2500|$|In January 2012, Ellis {{auditioned for}} the debut series of The Voice UK, a reality {{television}} singing competition. The show saw Ellis giving a blind audition {{in front of}} its four coaches. She sang [...] "Son of a Preacher Man" [...] but it failed to progress her further after none of the coaches turned round to select her {{to be in their}} groups. Her audition aired on BBC One in March; the panel reacted with positive feedback. Tom Jones consoled her: [...] "You seem like you've already made it," [...] referring to her theatrical career, while Danny O'Donoghue stated, [...] "I thought you did a really phenomenal job, I really did. I can't fault that, all I can fault is myself for not turning around. I am looking for a specific type of girl singer and you're not it but you will be for 99% of the UK I am sure." [...] Her name later trended on social networking site Twitter. Ellis affirmed that it was a big risk to take, but added, [...] "this industry is all about taking risks. It was a risk to be publicly said 'no' to, but it's character-building for me and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> on the horse and you carry on." ...|$|E
