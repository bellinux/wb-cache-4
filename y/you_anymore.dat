25|$|Although {{the usage}} of 'not' in {{splitting}} infinitives {{is an issue that}} has not attracted much attention from the English users, contemporary English grammar puts the phrase into the same category as above. This appears to be because the traditional idiom, placing the negation before the marker (I soon learned not to provoke her) or with verbs of desire, negating the finite verb (I don't want to see <b>you</b> <b>anymore)</b> remains easy and natural, and is still overwhelmingly the more common construction in British English. On the other hand, in the case of American English, a search on the corpus of contemporary American English displays a different aspect. Its usage is more commonly found in the American context, where we can find at least 2,200 cases of {{the usage of}} 'not' in splitting infinitives.|$|E
500|$|M. C. Gainey {{first met}} Lost {{producer}} Carlton Cuse {{while working on}} The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. The {{opportunity to work with}} Cuse again was motivation enough to take the part of Tom, even without a script or description of the character. Gainey watches every episode of the series, but admits to not knowing what is happening much of the time. In his first appearance, in the season one finale [...] "Exodus: Part 2", Gainey was credited as [...] "bearded man", and was lovingly called [...] "Gay Tom" [...] in season 4. then in his season two appearances as [...] "Mr. Friendly". In the Official Lost Podcast, Damon Lindelof confirmed Mr. Friendly is not his real name, but is how the producers refer to him internally, because [...] "he's so friendly"; however, his surname was later suggested to actually be Friendly during Comic-Con 2009. He is nicknamed [...] "Zeke" [...] by Sawyer in [...] "The Hunting Party", which led to some critics using this name for him. In the season two finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", his name is revealed to be Tom. On his character's death, Gainey noted that [...] "just because they kill you on this show, don't mean they don't need <b>you</b> <b>anymore</b> 'cause everybody's got a past." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{features}} the first appearance of Cynthia Watros as Libby in Lost since the character {{was murdered in}} the second season. Despite a promise by writer's assistant Matt Ragghianti {{that there would be}} an episode in the second season in which flashbacks would focus on Libby, Watros became the first main cast member to never play the central role in a Lost episode. Following Libby's death, Co-creator/executive producer/writer Damon Lindelof revealed plans to tell her story in the third season. Libby's story was later postponed again—Lindelof stated that her back story would be told through flashbacks of a new character introduced in the fourth season. Executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse further explained that these flashbacks would unfold over multiple episodes. This failed to materialize; however, Watros made a couple of appearances via hallucinations in Michael's flashbacks in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". The writers asserted that while they had yet to shed light on the character's past, they would finally in their fifth year. The writers later made further revisions, with Cuse concluding that Libby's part in the show is [...] "pretty much finished." [...] When Watros returned to Lost for [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", she did not receive the [...] "special guest star" [...] credit, as was customary for former main cast members of Lost. She was instead billed simply as a guest star, although her name appeared with that of frequent guest star M.C. Gainey ahead of the remainder of the episode's guest cast, who were listed alphabetically on-screen. Gainey explained that [...] "just because they kill you on this show, don't mean they don't need <b>you</b> <b>anymore</b> 'cause everybody's got a past." [...] Damon Lindelof said that [...] "it was sort of like a walk down memory lane for the dead", as it not only included Tom and Libby, but also Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) and George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens), two characters from the freighter who had met their demises earlier in the season.|$|E

2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I think {{at this time of year}} you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might not have heard from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to acknowledge that there are people that aren’t with <b>you</b> <b>anymore,</b> so there’s a song that does that.

She called her daughter to ask her if she signed off, and she didn't. Megan was sobbing hysterically. When her mother got home, she was furious that she hadn't signed off. She was shocked at the vulgar language her daughter was firing back. Megan then told her mother, [...] "You're supposed to be my mom! You're supposed to be on my side!"
