D. ABSTRACT: The aim of my work is to explore the junior tennis players' base in the West Bohemia region. Tennis players including girls born between 1988 - 1995 {{are the subject of}} the research. Figures about the players are analysed regarding the numerosity and their performance as well. On the basis of the analysed data a comparison among selected <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> between boys and girls and among years from individual <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> within the junior age brackets from the total <b>of</b> all <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> Acquired results are interpreted and rationalised if possible.

5|$|José de San Martín was {{the fifth}} and last son of Juan de San Martín, an {{unsuccessful}} Spanish soldier, and Gregoria Matorras del Ser. He was born in Yapeyú, Corrientes, an Indian reduction of Guaraní people. The exact year of his birth is disputed, as there are no records of his baptism. Later documents formulated during his life, such as passports, military career records and wedding documentation, gave him varying ages. Most of these documents point to his <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> as either 1777 or 1778. The family moved to Buenos Aires in 1781, when San Martín was {{three or four years}} old.|$|E

Though Leif's birthplace is not accounted for in the sagas, it is likely he was born in Iceland, where his parents met—probably somewhere on the edge of Breiðafjörður, and possibly at the farm Haukadal where Thjóðhild's family {{is said to have been}} based. Leif had two brothers, whose names were Thorsteinn and Thorvaldr, and a sister, Freydís.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{was the son}} of Edward of Wells and {{elder brother}} of Jocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath. Hugh's <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> is unknown, but he was {{probably}} an old man at his death in 1235. The fact that he never left his residence from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age. He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin, the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s. After fitzJocelin's death in 1191, Hugh continued {{in the service of the}} next bishop, Savaric FitzGeldewin. By the end of the 1190s, Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral. Although Hugh's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister, implying that he attended a university, Hugh is never called magister, making it unlikely that he ever received much schooling.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's exact date {{of birth}} is not known, as birth records were not {{traditionally}} kept by the Kikuyu. It is known that he was probably born sometime in the 1890s. The Kikuyu custom {{at the time was}} to divide boys into age groups, in which they would be initiated into manhood together. The older members of Kenyatta's age group are believed to have been born around 1890. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested that his <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> was likely 1890, although a fuller analysis performed by Jeremy Murray-Brown concluded that he was likely born circa 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and religious belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock. When he was ten years old, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition away from childhood.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Piers Gaveston's early years; even his <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> is unknown. He and Prince Edward of Caernarfon (born 25 April 1284) {{were said to be}} contemporaries (coetanei), so it can be assumed that he was born in or around 1284. Though one chronicle claims he {{accompanied}} his father to England in 1297, the first reliable reference to him is from Gascony later that year, when he served in the company of Edward I. In 1300 he sailed to England with his father and his older brother, Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. It was at this time that he {{became a member of the}} household of the young Prince Edward – the future Edward II. The King was apparently impressed by Gaveston's conduct and martial skills, and wanted him to serve as a model for his son. In 1304, the King awarded Gaveston the wardship of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, after the death of Roger's father, on the request of Edward, Prince of Wales. This put Gaveston in charge of Mortimer's possessions during the latter's minority, and served as proof of the King's confidence in his son's companion.|$|E
