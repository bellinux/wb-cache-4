500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the {{best thing that ever happened}} to me in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on <b>your</b> <b>taste,</b> qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
