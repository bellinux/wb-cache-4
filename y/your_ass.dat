5|$|In May 1983, Metallica {{traveled}} to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass,</b> which {{was produced by}} Paul Curcio. The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{conflicts}} with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass,</b> {{the album was}} renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986. Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene. To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven. In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Solanas {{moved to}} New York City in the mid-1960s, {{working as a}} writer. She met pop artist Andy Warhol {{and asked him to}} produce her play, Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass.</b> She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing and/or stealing, {{followed}} by Warhol expressing additional indifference to her play. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, I, a Man, paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the SCUM Manifesto. Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in the spring of 1968.|$|E

5|$|Metallica {{began by}} playing shows in local clubs in Los Angeles. They {{recorded}} several demos to gain attention from club owners, and eventually relocated to San Francisco {{to secure the}} services of bassist Cliff Burton. The group's No Life 'til Leather demo (1982) was noticed by Megaforce label head Jon Zazula, who signed them and provided a small budget of $15,000 for recording. The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in Rochester, New York. It was originally intended to be titled Metal Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass,</b> with cover art featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. The band was asked to change the name because distributors feared that releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success. Metallica promoted the album on the two-month co-headlining Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven in the U.S. Although the initial shipment was 15,000 copies in the U.S., the album sold 60,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} Metallica's Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984.|$|E

500|$|In 1999 Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass</b> was re-discovered and {{produced}} in 2000 by George Coates Performance Works in San Francisco. Coates turned the piece into a musical, starring an all-female cast. Coates learned about Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass</b> while at an exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum, which marked the 30th {{anniversary of the}} shooting. The copy that Warhol had lost was discovered buried in a trunk of lighting equipment that was owned by Billy Name. Coates would consult with Solanas's sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a [...] "very funny satirist" [...] out of Solanas, not just showing her as the attempted assassin of Warhol.|$|E

500|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} Solanas moved to New York City where she {{supported}} herself through begging and prostitution. In 1965 she wrote two works: an autobiographical short story called [...] "A Young Girl's Primer on How to Attain the Leisure Class" [...] and a play titled Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass,</b> {{about a young}} prostitute. According to James Martin Harding, the play is [...] "based on a plot {{about a woman who}} 'is a man-hating hustler and panhandler' and who... ends up killing a man." [...] Harding describes it as more a [...] "provocation than... a work of dramatic literature" [...] and [...] "rather adolescent and contrived." [...] The short story was published in Cavalier magazine in July 1966. Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass</b> remained unpublished until 2014.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to appearing in videos, Black and Gass sang backup vocals on the 2002 Styx album Cyclorama, on the song [...] "Kiss <b>Your</b> <b>Ass</b> Goodbye".

500|$|Metallica's debut album, Kill 'Em All, was {{originally}} intended to inherit {{the name of one}} of their earlier demo releases (predating Burton's participation), which was Metal Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass,</b> but the record company did not like the title and insisted on changing it. After the band learned of the change, Burton said [...] "We should just kill 'em all, man," [...] which gave the band members an idea for the new title. The album was released on July 25, 1983 through Megaforce Records.|$|E

500|$|Gass has {{described}} Tenacious D's comic assertion {{that they are}} the best band as being [...] "ridiculous because it's a matter of opinion". Black characterizes Tenacious D's comic nature as an antidote to [...] "the masculinity of rock", adding [...] "There's also something funny about the macho-ness of rock. Like the bands that are the fucking hardest rocking are like, 'We'll fucking kick <b>your</b> <b>ass,</b> dude... with our rock.'" [...] Russell Brand, All Shall Perish, The Lonely Island, and Kanye West have in turn been influenced by the work of Tenacious D.|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the album was finally {{confirmed}} by MTV as Hard Candy. Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "She loves candy, [...] about the juxtaposition of tough and sweetness, or as Madonna so eloquently expressed: 'I'm gonna kick <b>your</b> <b>ass,</b> but it's {{going to make you}} feel good." [...] The album cover art was also released {{at the same time and}} featured Madonna with short cropped hair in a black leotard with a [...] professional wrestling championship belt across her waist. The belt includes the inscription [...] "Give It to Me", the original {{title of the}} album. The backdrop displayed pink peppermint swirls. The photo was taken during a photoshoot with Klein for Interview magazine's April 2008 issue.|$|E

5000|$|.....Rocks <b>Your</b> Lame <b>Ass</b> is {{the second}} studio album by the American rock band Hagfish, {{released}} in June 1995 on London Records. The album was recorded and produced by Bill Stevenson and Stephen Egerton at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado in 1994.

500|$|While {{living at}} the Chelsea Hotel, Solanas {{introduced}} herself to Maurice Girodias, the founder of Olympia Press and a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her [...] "next writing, and other writings". In exchange, Girodias paid her $500. She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that [...] "everything I write will be his. He's done this to me... He's screwed me!" [...] Solanas intended {{to write a novel}} based on the SCUM Manifesto, and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass</b> script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.|$|E
500|$|The band {{initially}} {{intended to}} title the album Metal Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass</b> with the cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger {{emerging from a}} toilet bowl. However, Zazula convinced them to change this as he thought distributors would not stock it. The final cover featured {{the shadow of a}} hand letting go of a bloodied hammer. Burton was credited with coming up with the name Kill 'Em All—referring to timid record distributors, saying, [...] "Those record company fuckers... kill 'em all!"—as a response to the situation. Ulrich thought Kill 'Em All was a good name, and Zazula agreed. Burton suggested to Gary L. Heard, also responsible for the Metallica photograph on the back cover, to feature a bloodied hammer on the album art. According to Hammett, [...] "Cliff carried a hammer with him everywhere he went. He always had a hammer in his luggage, and he would take it out occasionally and start destroying things." [...] Even though the original title was unused, the band did later release a [...] "Metal Up Your Ass" [...] T-shirt with the proposed artwork. A live bootleg recording of a 1982 performance at the Old Waldorf, titled Metal Up <b>Your</b> <b>Ass</b> (Live), featured the original cover artwork. Original pressings of the album came with an inner sleeve that included pictures and lyrics as well as a silver label on the vinyl. Subsequent pressings had a blank white sleeve and standard album label. The 1988 reissue re-introduced the lyrics and photos. The original release can be distinguished by the words [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] {{at the top of the}} back cover. This was dropped from the reissue. The phrase [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] was dedicated to San Francisco fan Ray Burch, known for his headbanging at the band's early shows.|$|E
