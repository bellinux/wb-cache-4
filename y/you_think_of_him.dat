2500|$|Schaeffer {{argues that}} the main point of de Sade's life and writing was not, [...] "as movie-makers and reviewers alike seem to think [...] to oppose censorship" [...] but [...] "to push the limits - sexual, spiritual, and {{political}} - {{as a means of}} feeling out the limits of his times and of his own mind." [...] Schaeffer criticized that the film [...] "simplifies de Sade into a modern [...] "victim" [...] and over-emphasises his potential as a focus for liberal-political meanings when, in fact, his life and perhaps his literary intentions - if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a satirist - can be seen as an object lesson, warning against the excesses of cultural relativism and nihilism; a very modern lesson, it would seem." ...|$|E
60|$|CHARLOTTE. Ensign Blades {{would be}} pleased to hear, Miss Susan, what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a whole.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What!' said Festus, reddening, 'do {{you mean}} to say that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> seriously--you, who might look so much higher?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It {{may even}} be looked upon as his right'--you hear a gentleman {{speaking}} there?--'but what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> taking <b>him</b> {{with us in the}} boat?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} known more before I let him come here and {{encouraged}} <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> It has been my fault. My dear, will you not forgive me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{come the}} kid," [...] advised Flossie. [...] "If you don't mind {{being talked about}} yourself, <b>you</b> might <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> If Carleton gets hold of it, he's done for." ...|$|R
60|$|Tommy the Song. I don't {{care what}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> I'll back the red; it's {{he has the}} lively eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "And what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him?</b> He is very gentlemanly, I suppose. They {{say he is}} of {{excellent}} family--his relations quite county people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> Bensington? You {{can look}} at this {{business}} with a greater detachment than I can. What am I to do about him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetta {{could hardly}} say {{that her brother}} was {{incapable}} of such love as Marie expected, {{but she knew that}} it was so. 'It is better that <b>you</b> should <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> no more.' ...|$|R
60|$|THE BISHOP. Precisely what <b>you</b> {{ought to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> my dear. Dont apologize.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} do, my dear;--of course you do. How should <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{when he is}} all in all to you? But papa means that it can hardly be called an {{engagement}} yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Theo, who was all truth, said, [...] "Yes, I {{thought of}} him, and was sorry {{he was not}} there; and so did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> Hetty." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before Venetia {{retired to}} rest she {{remained}} {{for a few}} minutes in her mother's room. 'What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> mamma?' she said; 'is he not very changed?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By the bye,' said Martin, 'that reminds me. What's {{your opinion}} of Pecksniff? How did he use you? What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> now?--Coolly, you know, when it's all over?' ...|$|E
6000|$|She made no sign, {{no sound}} of any kind. The {{thorough}} falseness {{of the position}} weighed on them both. But he was the braver of the two. [...] "I dare say. At first. Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> telling <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were happy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's quite {{young enough}} to marry and have a family, and then Annesley will be disinherited. He has stopped his allowance, anyway, and <b>you</b> mustn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> He did {{something}} uncommonly unhandsome the other day, though I don't quite know what." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{your country}} <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{regarding}} <b>him</b> as anything else. Doesn't {{being an artist}} emancipate one from the conventional point of view?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} to you of my brother-in-law," [...] she said. [...] "He has told me of your visit; and I am anxious to know what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Do you like Mr. John Zant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{that where}} the shoe galls?" [...] cried the bowman, and laughed aloud. [...] "I will {{ask you what}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> three months hence, if we be all alive; for sure I am that----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are right!' said he, {{becoming}} rigid {{as if with}} pain. 'He is a child! You {{have not}} yet told me what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> You need not hesitate. No one sees the likeness more plainly than I do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{took him}} by the {{shoulders}} and shook him. [...] "Alexander!" [...] said I. [...] "Do <b>you</b> even <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him?</b> Not <b>you!</b> Look yourself in the face like a brave man, and you'll find you're but a self-deceiver. The wife, the friend, the child, they're all equally forgot, and you sunk in a mere bog of selfishness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How contemptible! Of {{all things}} in the world inconstancy is my aversion. Let me entreat <b>you</b> never to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> again, my dear Catherine; indeed he is unworthy of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{only know}} that the one thing which is carried with us to the other world is love, Sophy, and love that becomes greater than we can yet imagine. If <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>Him</b> who {{redeemed}} and saved your dear Edmund, and who is his happiness, his exceeding great reward, your heart would warm, and, oh! what hope and peace would come!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I feared when I {{saw those}} two red spots {{on his cheeks}} in the evening. I know them well! But how white and thin he looks! I {{want to hear what}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> My father {{considers}} him fully recovered. Do you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not {{joke with}} me. But I {{know you would}} not joke on such a subject. And my {{question}} did not merely go {{to the state of}} his health. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a man generally? Do you call him an honest man?" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss M'Glashan drew along breath. 'In Paris?' she said. 'Well, {{and what}} do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him?</b> - what do ye think of him?' she repeated, with a {{different}} scansion, as Richard, who had not much taste for such a question, kept her waiting for an answer.|$|E
60|$|EDSTASTON [sentimentally]. Don't say that. Don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in that way. After all, he {{was your}} husband; and {{whatever}} his faults may have been, {{it is not for}} <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> unkindly <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> as much <b>of</b> <b>him</b> now as you {{did when}} you promised to marry him?" [...] he asked, {{ignoring}} her reference to himself and all that it implied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you believe}} it! It's a trick to get <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Bert, don't you dare {{to go back}} on me," [...] he cried out, warningly--"don't you dare!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{care how}} good he is; I don't want to know him, because he comes between me and you. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> night and day, ever {{so much more than}} of anybody else; and when you are {{thinking}} of him, I am shut out of your mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' {{said the}} doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned {{the handle of}} a bedroom-door, 'let us hear what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> He has not been shaved very recently, but he don't look at all ferocious notwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see {{that he is in}} visiting order.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, my love,' said Miss Pecksniff, 'it {{would be}} useless {{for me to}} disguise, after what you have seen, that I am about to be united to the gentleman who is walking with your brother. It would be in vain to conceal it. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him?</b> Pray, let me have your candid opinion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am {{jealous of}} this stranger. What is he but a {{short-lived}} half-barbarian {{such as we}} knew in the old days? And yet already <b>you</b> <b>think</b> more <b>of</b> <b>him</b> than <b>you</b> do of me, your father, the divine Oro who has lived a thousand years. At first I helped that physician to save him, but now I think I wish him dead.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall never}} dream {{that you can}} do {{anything}} unkind, dear Mary," [...] replied Mrs. Parsons, stroking the girl's hair. [...] "It's natural that <b>you</b> should <b>think</b> more <b>of</b> <b>him</b> than <b>of</b> us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. But he {{said that}} he felt the danger which lay for him in your generosity. Of course he will write to you about it. Do <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>him</b> for his resolve?" ...|$|R
