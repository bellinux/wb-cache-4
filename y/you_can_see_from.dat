[...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
500|$|Cookery writer Laura Kelley {{notes that}} the 1774 edition {{was one of the}} first books in English to include a recipe for curry: [...] "To make a currey the Indian way." [...] The recipe calls for two small {{chickens}} to be fried in butter; for ground turmeric, ginger and pepper to be added and the dish to be stewed; and for cream and lemon juice to be added just before serving. Kelley comments that [...] "The dish is very good, but not quite a modern curry. As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Epperson, who {{had struck}} up a {{friendship}} with Spacey while writing an early screenplay draft of The Shipping News, was hired to write a new draft for Beyond the Sea. Epperson's script included Darin's penchant for orgies after his divorce with Sandra Dee. Spacey, finding the Epperson script to be overtly dark and morbid, began to rewrite Beyond the Sea, incorporating info from the 1987 Lewis Colick script. Spacey acknowledged he portrayed Darin in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, and decided not to centrally depict {{the darker side of}} Darin's life. [...] "The other scripts made Bobby [...] a rather unlikable figure," [...] he explained. [...] "I was not interested in making a conventional biopic, as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the results. I was interested in making an exuberant celebration of an entertainer {{in a way that would}} be uplifting for an audience." ...|$|E

If you 'look', you reduce the scope of information reaching your consciousness.

2500|$|As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the diagram, {{normal and}} R0 {{together}} imply {{a host of}} other properties, since combining the two properties leads you to follow a path through the many nodes on the rightside branch.

In a somewhat similar fashion, spaces that are both normal and T1 are often called [...] "normal Hausdorff spaces" [...] by people that wish to avoid the ambiguous [...] "T" [...] notation. These conventions can be generalised to other regular spaces and Hausdorff spaces.|$|E

2500|$|During this period, MIT had six {{students}} {{sentenced to prison}} terms, prompting Chomsky to say that MIT's students suffered things that [...] "should not have happened". Despite this, he has described MIT as [...] "the freest and the most honest and has the best relations between faculty and students {{than at any other}} ... quite a good record on civil liberties." [...] Chomsky's differences with student activists at this time led to what he has called [...] "considerable conflict". He described the rebellions across US campuses as [...] "largely misguided" [...] and he was unimpressed by the student uprising of May 1968 in Paris, saying, [...] "I paid virtually no attention {{to what was going on}} in Paris as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> what I wrote - rightly, I think." [...] On the other hand, Chomsky was also very grateful to the students for raising the issue of the war in Vietnam.|$|E
