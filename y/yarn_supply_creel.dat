In order to verify the validity, several experiments were arranged. The results indicate that the yarn tension can be detected, recorded and displayed.

40|$|Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding <b>yarn</b> from <b>supply</b> <b>yarn</b> package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. As the package size varies when winding pirns, the varying balloon effect caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. As a number of pirns can be wound from a single <b>supply</b> <b>yarn</b> package, pirns are wound from different yarn package diameters. A significant change in take off tension takes place from pirn to pirn. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent. However, incorrect timing of compensation and stepwise compensation may create significant tension variations in pirn windings.

The research work was concened with the design of tension compensators for spinning-winding machines {{for the purposes of}} reducing winding tension variation during high speed cone winding. Initially, the research was directed to investigating the 'winding error', i. e. the difference between <b>yarn</b> <b>supply</b> and demand, which was the main cause of winding tension variation. Mathematical models were established to analyse the winding velocity variation and yarn path length variation. Several methods have been investigated to reduce winding tension variation and to develop tension compensators. These include using a servo motor to keep constant winding velocity and using a curved distribution bar to keep constant path length. Two promising tension compensators were selected for detailed investigation. they were a mechanical compensator and a mechatronic compensator. Based on the analysis of 'winding error', A multiple bar mechanism was devised, analysed and optimised to provide tension compensation. Further consideration has been given to a microprocessor controlled mechanism, that works according to predetermined look-up tables and sensor signals to reduce winding tension variation. The computer simulation of yarn winding process, the software design for the optimisation of mechanical compensator and the control of mechatronic compensator, and the results of winding tension experimentation are also presented in the thesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding <b>yarn</b> from <b>supply</b> <b>yarn</b> package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the pirn winding process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of pirns. Hence the balloon effect varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first pirn wound from a package to the last pirn wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in pirn windings. The author attempted to theoretically analyze the tension variation in the yarn path of the pirn winding machine and theoretically model the tension variation with and without deadweight placement on the tensioners. Author also verified the accuracy and the validity of the model developed through the experimental results obtained at different locations along the yarn path. ...|$|R

Moreover, the three companies may be integrated (Taylor 2012). An example is the consolidation by tier 1 companies. The OEMs, frustrated by the increasingly longer lead times and operational constraints, only worked with fabric suppliers with cut and sew operations. Tier 1 companies (e.g. Johnson Controls) have bought out fabric companies and become vertically integrated companies with control of upstream and downstream activities making the full range of products from seats, instrument panels, headliners, etc. With 25 % of the market, Johnson Controls vertical integration captures increasing amount of value along the chain but loses flexibility and speed.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Textile Research Journal and the definitive published version is available at [URL] study investigates the effect of nozzle geometry on the intermingling process. The dimensions of intermingling nozzles with single air inlets extended across {{the width of a}} rectangular yam channel are systematically varied. Nozzles with this cross-sectional shape prove to be easy to manufacture and efficient at intermingling. The performance is evaluated by visually inspecting the intermingled yarns and by measuring the nip fre quency. We have found that the performance of nozzles with large inlet widths is weakly dependent on yam channel geometry. The performance of nozzles with the smallest air inlet widths, on the other hand, is sensitive to yarn channel geometry. The smallest and largest yam channels we have considered give poor intermingling results. Control of the yam path is beneficial for the success and consistency of the intermingling process. Using yam guides to create a diagonal yarn path across the nozzle has the additional advantage of decreasing noise production. Our extended air inlet slot ensures continuous exposure of the <b>yarn</b> to the <b>supply</b> air stream across the entire width of the yarn channel in this arrangement. We also compare our designs with four industrial nozzles under identical process conditions. This study reveals similar trends for nip frequency and power consumption.

Chapter One contrasts technological innovations between urban and rural textile production to show that rural producers found time-saving techniques that also increased output. Chapters Two and Three analyze the relationship between state use of textiles and fluctuation of textile prices on the one hand, and, the relationship between non-state market demand and the distribution system on the other hand. While both tax and price increases pushed peasants towards product specialization, the distribution system that already existed for collecting tax payment and selling fancy silk facilitated the sale of new rural commodities.

500|$|New {{markets in}} Europe and South America {{increased}} {{the demand for}} Britain's cheap cotton goods. Supplies of raw cotton were exported from plantations in the United States to Manchester. From the markets in Manchester, mill owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be processed into <b>yarn</b> and cloth. <b>Supplies</b> were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–65 {{as a result of}} the American Civil War, leading to the formation of the Chadderton Local Board of Health in 1873, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality following the crisis. Despite a brief economic depression, the urban growth of Chadderton accelerated after the famine. The profitability of factory based cotton spinning meant that much of Chadderton's plentiful cheap open land, used for farming since antiquity, vanished under distinctive rectangular multi-storey brick-built factories—35 by 1891. Chadderton's former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a mill town around these factories and a network of newly created roads, canals and railways. The Chadderton landscape was [...] "dominated by mill chimneys, many with the mill name picked out in white brick". Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest and most productive mill town in the world) encroached upon Chadderton's eastern boundary, urbanising the town and surrounds, and forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Royton, Lees and Shaw and Crompton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which at its peak was responsible for 13percent of the world's cotton production. These Victorian era developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton Fold to the major arterial Middleton Road, by Chadderton's eastern boundary with Oldham. Sixty cotton mills were constructed in Chadderton between 1778 and 1926, and 6,000 people, a quarter of Chadderton's population, worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century. Industries ancillary to cotton spinning, such as engineering, coal mining, bleaching and dyeing became established during this period, meaning the rest of Chadderton's population were otherwise involved in the sector. Philip Stott was a Chadderton-born architect, civil engineer and surveyor of cotton mills. Stott's mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom, multiplying the town's industrial capacity and in turn increasing its population and productivity.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, continuous synthetic filament yarns into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. Air-jet texturing has three types based on the <b>supply</b> <b>yarn.</b> Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single filament yarn is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more filaments yarns are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different filament yarns are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R

The air-jet texturing (AJT) and intermingling (INT) processes are two applications of air jets used to modify the structure of synthetic multifilament yarns. The modification is performed by high-speed jets, which are created by purpose designed nozzles. The present work experimentally investigates the interrelation between properties of the yarn produced and air flow and the nozzle geometry {{in order to gain}} an improved understanding of the AJT process. Firstly, a number of industrial AJT nozzles were selected for detailed analysis. undisturbed flows created by these nozzles are investigated by means of total pressure measurements and shadowgraphy. The effect of nozzle geometry on the AJT process is investigated by using a series of systematically designed nozzles. A number of geometrical parameters of cylindrical type AJT nozzles are specified for successful texturing, after assessing performance of the nozzles by stabilising zone tension and the properties of yarns produced. It is found that large exit length and slightly diverging main duct are beneficial for texturing. Also the trumpet shaped exit profile is found to be necessary for adequate texturing. Low tilt angle of air inlet hole is recommended. Effect of wetting on AJT is investigated with special reference to yarn-to-yarn and yarn-to-metal friction. It is found that when the <b>supply</b> <b>yarn</b> is treated with water interfilament friction prior to the nozzle is reduced, but increased slightly in the texturing area. The former may make relative movement of filaments easier. The latter is considered {{to be one of the}} ways through which wetting improves the process, since it assists anchoring the loops in the yarn. Subsequently high-speed cine-photograpy is deployed to visualise the AJT process inside and around exit area of the nozzle. The nozzle used has rectangular cross-section and one glass wall, which allows to see inside the main channel. It is found that for successful texturing loop formation and fixing the loops are both necessary. The INT process is investigated by using again several systematically designed nozzles with reference to correlation between nip frequency and nozzle geometry. Rectangular nozzles are found to be performing adequately, depending on their dimensions. The nozzles with area ratio smaller than unity perform adequate intermingling. It is also found that small aspect ratio is benefical in terms of nip frequency. A better understanding of the INT is achieved by means of SEM, high speed video and cine-photography and yarn tension measurements. The yarn is found to be necessary to run constantly against the incoming flow to reduce missing nips...|$|R
30|$|In the beginning, air-jet {{textured}} yarns were produced by blowing {{a stream of}} air into twisted continuous filament yarns, while they were being overfed to the take-up bobbin (Wray & Entwistle 1968). Studies in the 1960 s by Wray and Entwistle (1969) were followed those by Sivakumar (1975) in the early 1970 s. Since 1980 s, researchers have mainly focused on investigating the effect of process parameters, nozzle geometry, and the air-flow behaviour on yarn texturing. Researchers (Acar 1988; Acar et al. 1986 b; Rangasamy et al. 1990) have studied the effect of filament fineness {{and concluded that the}} filaments with finer linear densities are more suitable for air-jet texturing due to their less bending and torsional stiffness that blow the filaments more easily that enhance the entanglement effectiveness. <b>Supply</b> <b>yarn</b> properties are important for texturing since resultant forces acting on filaments are determined by the fluid forces acting on the filaments (Acar 1991; Acar et al. 1986 b). Further Acar et al. (1986 c) found that the filament cross section also has direct influence on texturing and concluded that the non-circular filament cross sections have better filament texturing due to larger surface areas than the circular filament of equal linear density. Spin finish on filaments has a negative effect on the texturing process due to contamination of the texturing nozzle (Simmen 1987). However, researchers (Acar 1988; Acar & Demir 1987) dispute the above explanation and argued that most of the spin finish blow off from the filament due to the secondary air-low and the new jets are self cleaned. They suggest using a suitable spin-finish for air-jet texturing which removes them in filament wetting that improves the filament flexibility. Feeder yarn wetting was studied by many researchers (Acar & Demir 1987; Acar et al. 1986 d; Acar et al. 1986 a; Demir et al. 1988; Fisher & Wilson 1982; Kothari & Timble 1991) and reported that the feeder yarn wetting before the air-jet nozzle influence the stability of the texturing process as well as the textured yarn properties. Recent studies by Acar et al. (2006) reported that water acted as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the air-jet texturing process. Study by Kothari et al. (1996) attempted to characterise the structure of air-jet {{textured yarns}} in terms of migration parameters. Since air-jet texturing process was developed to feed POY yarns, research were carried out by Sengupta et al. (1989) to understand the influence of drawing variables on the properties of air-jet textured yarns made from POY feeder yarns.|$|R
5000|$|New {{markets in}} Europe and South America {{increased}} {{the demand for}} Britain's cheap cotton goods. Supplies of raw cotton were exported from plantations in the United States to Manchester. From the markets in Manchester, mill owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be processed into <b>yarn</b> and cloth. <b>Supplies</b> were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861-65 {{as a result of}} the American Civil War, leading to the formation of the Chadderton Local Board of Health in 1873, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality following the crisis. Despite a brief economic depression, the urban growth of Chadderton accelerated after the famine. The profitability of factory based cotton spinning meant that much of Chadderton's plentiful cheap open land, used for farming since antiquity, vanished under distinctive rectangular multi-storey brick-built factories—35 by 1891. Chadderton's former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a mill town around these factories and a network of newly created roads, canals and railways. The Chadderton landscape was [...] "dominated by mill chimneys, many with the mill name picked out in white brick". Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest and most productive mill town in the world) encroached upon Chadderton's eastern boundary, urbanising the town and surrounds, and forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Royton, Lees and Shaw and Crompton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which at its peak was responsible for 13 per cent of the world's cotton production. These Victorian era developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton Fold to the major arterial Middleton Road, by Chadderton's eastern boundary with Oldham. Sixty cotton mills were constructed in Chadderton between 1778 and 1926, and 6,000 people, a quarter of Chadderton's population, worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century. Industries ancillary to cotton spinning, such as engineering, coal mining, bleaching and dyeing became established during this period, meaning the rest of Chadderton's population were otherwise involved in the sector. Philip Stott was a Chadderton-born architect, civil engineer and surveyor of cotton mills. Stott's mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom, multiplying the town's industrial capacity and in turn increasing its population and productivity.The boomtown of Chadderton reached its industrial zenith in the 1910s, with over 50 cotton mills within the town limits. A social consequence of this industrial growth was a densely populated metropolitan landscape, home to an extensive and enlarged working class community living in an urban sprawl of low quality terraced houses. However, Chadderton developed an abundance of civic institutions including public street lighting, Carnegie library, public swimming baths and council with its own town hall. The development of the town meant that the district council made initial steps to petition the Crown for honorific borough status for Chadderton in the 1930s. However, the Great Depression, and the First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns and textile goods increased during the mid-20th century, Chadderton's textile sector declined to a halt; cotton spinning reduced dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s and by 1997 only two mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Many of the redundant mills have now been demolished. Non-textile based industries continued on throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, particularly in the form of aircraft and chemical manufacture at plants in south Chadderton and Foxdenton respectively.|$|R
