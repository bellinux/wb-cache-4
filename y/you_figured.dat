Especially, if <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> out {{something that people}} have not <b>figured</b> out before. <b>You</b> don’t need to dress it up, {{you just need to}} work it out. All the rest is dressing. Pompous language, format of summary and text and findings, footnotes, erudite references, carefully marshaled precedents—all those are the trappings of science, the appearance of science, not science itself” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lay aloft {{and loose}} maintopsails! Are <b>you</b> <b>figuring</b> we brought <b>you</b> here {{to admire the}} scenery?" [...] a hoarse voice challenged.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess it's {{fortunate}} you {{got those}} logs away," [...] he said. [...] "It's {{probably a little}} more than the men who turned them loose on <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> you could do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "is easy. Still, have <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> {{how he is}} to be {{gotten into}} the canoe? You are hardly {{going to make him}} {{understand}} what he is to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Grace continued, [...] "it seems familiar--as {{though you}} and I had ridden {{together}} {{through such a}} country once before; I even seem to know those great redwoods well. I--I think I dreamed it, {{but there is another}} intangible memory in which <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now don't take it hard, Professor," [...] Jake tapped. [...] "I ain't {{saying you}} lied. I just say {{you get to}} dreaming and {{figuring}} in the jacket without knowing you're doing it. I know you believe what you say, and that you think it happened; but it don't buy nothing with me. <b>You</b> <b>figure</b> it, but <b>you</b> don't know <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> it--that is something you know all the time, though you don't know you know it until you get into them dreamy, woozy states." ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{of the men}} grinned. [...] "Seems to me it {{was good}} advice. Do <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> any one round here is going to earn those twenty dollars?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We'll get away, all right. Don't {{worry about}} that. But the gang {{will never come}} {{together}} again." [...] This singular man spoke with melancholy. [...] "Slow up a little now," [...] he added. [...] "We don't want to attract attention.... But where is there any one to see us?... Jim, did I have <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> right about the Creede job?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled and}} dropped her hand. [...] "No, no. You've said good-by to the cinch, I can see that. You're {{on the road}} to opera boxes and limousines. What is your plan? What would you advise Wayland to do if you knew I was hard against his marrying you? Come, now, I can see you're a clear-sighted individual. What can he do to earn a living? How will you live without my aid? Have <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> on these things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Andy,' says I, as we strayed {{through the}} smoke along the cinderpath they call Smithfield street, 'had <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> out how {{we are going to}} get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers? Not that I would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment, and work with the olive fork and pie knife,' says I, 'but isn't the entree nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you imagined?' ...|$|E

5000|$|These k {{points are}} the [...] "pieces" [...] of the vote: If {{you know all}} of the points, <b>you</b> can <b>figure</b> out the {{polynomial}} pn (and hence <b>you</b> can <b>figure</b> out how the voter voted). However, if you know {{only some of the}} points, <b>you</b> can't <b>figure</b> out the polynomial. (This is because you need k points to determine a degree-k-1 polynomial. Two points determine a line, three points determine a parabola, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|On November 10, 2010, Donner's {{authorized}} biography You're the Director... <b>You</b> <b>Figure</b> It Out: The Life and Films of Richard Donner by James Christie {{was published}} by BearManor Media. The book features a foreword by actor Mel Gibson.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> it {{out about}} right," [...] said Douglas approvingly. [...] "I thought I'd dodge your British law; for I {{was not sure}} how I stood under it, and also I saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all off my track. Mind you, from first to last I have done {{nothing to be ashamed}} of, and nothing that I would not do again; but you'll judge that for yourselves when I tell you my story. Never mind warning me, Inspector: I'm ready to stand pat upon the truth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{have some}} {{pleasure}} in telling you. Soon {{after the last}} snow fell, two rustlers came up this trail--there were more of them, but they stayed down by the big one. When they went away, three of my horses went with them. Now, who caught those horses and had them ready? It's kind of curious, too, {{that they were the}} pick of the bunch, with good blood in them. The only man round here who could tell them which were worth the lifting is you. Jeff, you don't know enough to run a peanut stand, and yet <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> you were fit to kick against the man who hired you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet I {{can perhaps}} correct a little {{your point of}} view. I think that you {{overestimate}} your indebtedness to the woman whom you have made your wife. Her husband was a weak, dissipated creature {{and he was a}} doomed man long before that unfortunate day. It is even very questionable whether that scene in which <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> had anything whatever to do in hastening his death. That is a good many years ago, and ever since then you seem to have impoverished yourself to find her the means to live in luxury. I consider that you paid your debt over and over again, and that your final act of self-abnegation was entirely uncalled for. What more she wants from you I do not know. Perhaps I can imagine." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bradley Stern of Idolator {{wrote that}} [...] ""Right when I think I finally got <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> out, {{you turn around}} and blow my mind,” the crooner starts above the song’s kicky pulse, giving just {{a little of that}} Prince funkiness in the process.

5000|$|Jeff Giles in the New York Times Book Review is full in his praise [...] "Pobby and Dingan is an {{enormously}} touching, imaginative and unexpected novel that just glows {{in your hands}} ... What's so extraordinary about Rice's novel is how unpredictable it is, how effortlessly it mingles whimsy and gravitas, how its plot races ahead long after <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> it would run out of gas." ...|$|E
5000|$|Siskel & Ebert {{originally}} {{thought they would}} have to miss reviewing the film as they could not get a screening but, as Ebert explained, [...] "... a strange thing started to happen. People started telling me they really liked Val Kilmer's performance in Tombstone, and I heard this every where I went. When you hear this once or twice, it's interesting, when you hear it a couple of dozen times, it's a trend. And when you read that Bill Clinton loved the performance, <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> you better catch up with the movie." [...] Ultimately, Ebert recommended the movie while Siskel did not.|$|E

5000|$|Here {{is how it}} works: {{first you}} decide to treat the object whose {{behavior}} is to be predicted as a rational agent; then <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given {{its place in the}} world and its purpose. Then <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.

5000|$|Gorgon again survived, and was {{approached}} by Jigsaw and Stuart Clarke, who she allowed to alter her appearance and characteristics (like her voice) {{so that she could}} pose as Maria Castle {{as a part of a}} plot to kill the Punisher. Gorgon psychologically tortures the Punisher by pretending to be Maria, and later tries to kill him with a flamethrower in Jigsaw's lair. The Punisher surrenders, unable to fight what he believes to be his wife, until he is informed by his ally, Henry, that the woman is an imposter. In a rage, the Punisher beats and stabs Gorgon to death, while she taunts him by saying, [...] "Guess <b>you</b> <b>figured</b> it out. Gotta wonder... you could be so easily fooled.
