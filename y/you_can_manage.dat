[...] A boy named Folco (Alain Emery), who lives with his fisherman grandfather, watches intently as White Mane escapes, and he dreams of one day handling White Mane. [...] The ranchers once again try to capture White Mane and fail. Folco asks the men if he can have the white horse. [...] Yes, {{says one of the}} men, [...] "but first you have to catch him, but your fish will grow wings before <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>manage</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ivinskaya collaborated {{closely with}} Pasternak on {{translating}} poetry from foreign languages into Russian. While she was translating the Bengali language poet Rabindranath Tagore, Pasternak advised her, to [...] "1) {{bring out the}} theme of the poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not {{at the end of the}} lines; 3) use loose, irregular meters, mostly ternary ones. You may allow yourself to use assonances.". Later, while collaborating with him on a translation of the Czech language poet Vítězslav Nezval, Pasternak told Ivinskaya, [...] "Use the literal translation only for the meaning, but do not borrow words as they stand from it: they are absurd and not always comprehensible. Don't translate everything, only what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>manage,</b> and by this means try to make the translation more precise than the original—an absolute necessity in the case of such a confused, slipshod piece of work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien {{promised to}} renegotiate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and reform to the {{unemployment}} insurance system. In regards to NAFTA, the Red Book pronounced itself {{in favor of}} a North American free trade zone in principle, but went on to accuse Mulroney of having given away too much to the Americans and Mexicans when he signed NAFTA in 1992, and stated that the Liberal government would renegotiate NAFTA on more favorable terms to Canada within six months of taking office. Failing that, the Red Book promised that Canada would renounce NAFTA. The main emphasis in the Red Book was on a promise to spend $6billion on improving infrastructure in a Keynesian move to fight the recession of the early 1990s. As regarding the debt situation, Chrétien promised in the Red Book to reduce Canada's deficit to 3 per cent of GDP (the same deficit to GDP ratio required to enter the European Union) within three years of taking office. Chrétien {{made it clear that the}} 3% deficit to GDP ratio would apply only to the federal government, whereas the Maastricht Treaty of 1991 which set out the 3% deficit to GDP ratio in order to enter the European Union stated that this applied to all levels of government. The Red Book went on to promise that a Liberal government would achieve its goal of reducing the deficit to 3% of the GDP by cancelling the contract to buy the Sea King helicopters and to privatise Pearson airport in Toronto and by eliminating unspecified [...] "waste" [...] in the government. After the 3% target had been achieved within the first three years of taking office, the Red Book promised that the deficit would be eliminated at some unspecified time in the future. Martin, who had been the leader of the team that had produced the Red Book had wanted to promise to eliminate the deficit altogether, but had been overruled by Chrétien, who had wanted to present the Liberals as the [...] "caring" [...] party that would defend social programs, unlike the [...] "heartless" [...] Tories and the Reform Party who Chrétien claimed wanted to eliminate the deficit within two or three years by gutting social programs with no thought for any suffering that this might cause. Chrétien claimed in his campaign speeches that Reform's plans for eliminate the deficit within two or three years of taking office would cause at least a 25% unemployment rate, if not higher, which Chrétien claimed starkly in a series of speeches would cause a bloody [...] "revolution". Chrétien had personally chosen the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP as it made the Liberals seemed fiscally responsible while at the same time promised that the Liberals would not inflict too much economic pain to achieve that fiscal responsibility. One Liberal candidate Herb Dhaliwal recalled that for Chrétien at time of the 1993 election that the national deficit was not a major issue and that: [...] "His attitude was that the deficit is ok as long as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>manage</b> it". To support its economic claims, the Red Book gave costs for each of the Liberals' policy goalsthe first time a Canadian party had gone to such lengths to prove that its proposals were fiscally responsible.|$|E
