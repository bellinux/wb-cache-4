5|$|Criticism over artistic {{matters in}} The Pall Mall Gazette {{provoked}} {{a letter in}} self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885–87. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E

The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. <b>Yet,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E

25|$|Husayn ibn Ali (1669–1740), a cavalry {{officer of}} Greek Cretan origin, came into power in 1705, {{remaining}} in control until 1735. He had won backing from the Tunisian ulama and notables, {{as well as}} from the tribes, for his opposition to Algerian influence which was removed. <b>Yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> succession dispute, his nephew Ali and his son Muhammad fought an divisive civil war, which ended in 1740 with Ali's uncertain victory. This result was reversed in 1756 after ten more years of fighting, but not without meddling by Algeria.|$|E
25|$|The 1720s saw rapidly {{changing}} alliances between the European powers and almost constant diplomatic confrontation, largely over unsolved issues regarding the Quadruple Alliance.

In response Britain, France, and Prussia joined together in the Alliance of Hanover to counter the danger to Europe of an Austro-Spanish hegemony. For the next three years there was the continual threat of war between the Hanover Treaty powers and the Austro-Spanish bloc.|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} for psychopathy in forensic and clinical settings is quite poor, {{with some studies}} reporting that treatment may worsen the antisocial aspects of psychopathy as measured by recidivism rates, though {{it is noted that}} one of the frequently cited studies finding increased criminal recidivism after treatment, a 2011 retrospective study of a treatment program in the 1960s, had several serious methodological problems and likely would not be approved of today. However, some relatively rigorous quasi-experimental studies using more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and other criminal behavior, regardless of PCL-R scores, although none were randomized controlled trials. Various other studies have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse. No study has of <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2013 review examined if the personality traits that form the core character disturbances of psychopathy could be changed by such treatments.|$|E

25|$|This enigmatic {{structure}} stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical {{shape and}} a square base (~ 22 feet in sides), constructed {{in what is}} essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on {{all but one of}} its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square. The structure's roof houses a minimal entablature of a repeating square pattern. The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.|$|E

[...] Jane Grigson wrote of it, [...] "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine is different from any other book by Elizabeth David. <b>Yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sense it includes them, holds them together.

500|$|Dean Saunders, {{appointed}} in January 2013 as Wolves' fourth manager in twelve months, brought Davis into the starting eleven as a holding midfielder alongside Karl Henry for two matches. Those were his last starts until 16 March, {{when he returned}} against Bristol City, only to give the opposition the lead when his backpass went through the legs of goalkeeper Carl Ikeme. Wolves finished as 2–1 winners, but Ikeme was unable to play the second half after punching the tactics board in the dressing-room at half-time and breaking his hand. Two weeks later, he [...] "produced arguably his best display <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Wolves shirt" [...] when involved in all three goals in a 3–2 win away to Birmingham City that took his side out of the relegation positions. His season was cut short when he suffered an ankle injury against Bolton Wanderers on 6 April which ruled him out {{for the rest of}} the campaign, which ended in the club being relegated to League One.|$|E
500|$|Eakin {{was known}} for his {{research}} of animal eyes and photoreceptor cells, especially the parietal eye (the so-called [...] "third eye") and associated pineal gland of vertebrates. He was persuaded to study the parietal eyes of reptiles by his colleague Robert C. Stebbins, and the two published several articles on the parietal eye of western fence lizards. Eakin, alone or with colleagues, published many other papers on the anatomy and function of reptilian parietal eyes and similar structures in amphibians. Eakin's 1973 monograph, The Third Eye, was received as comprehensive and detailed enough for biologists, <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> style approachable to non-scientists or undergraduates. He also studied amphibian development and was recognized as a skilled and early practitioner of electron microscopy. Eakin received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1953, and the Boston Museum of Science's Walker Prize in 1976. He authored or co-authored over 200 scientific papers, was elected president of the Western Society of Naturalists in 1949 and American Society of Zoologists in 1975, and was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences for 52 years.|$|E
500|$|Though not an {{outstanding}} student and composing little, Nielsen progressed well in violin under Valdemar Tofte (1832–1907), {{and received a}} solid grounding in music theory from Orla Rosenhoff (1844–1905), who would remain a valued adviser during his early years as a professional composer. He also studied composition under Gade, whom he liked as a friend but not for his music. Contacts with fellow students and cultured families in Copenhagen, some of whom would become lifelong friends, became equally important. The patchy education resulting from his country background left Nielsen insatiably curious about the arts, philosophy and aesthetics. But, {{in the opinion of}} the musicologist David Fanning, it also left him [...] "with a highly personal, common man's point of view on those subjects". He left the Academy at the end of 1886, after graduating with good but not outstanding marks in all subjects. He then went to stay with the retired Odense merchant Jens Georg Nielsen (1820–1901) and his wife at their apartment on Slagelsegade as he was not <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to pay his own way. While there, {{he fell in love with}} their 14-year-old daughter Emilie Demant. The affair was to last for the next three years.|$|E

500|$|While Nelson was {{apparently}} convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine, most biographers, researchers, and other observers {{have concluded that}} his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic. He told Dobson that [...] "true crime" [...] detective magazines had [...] "corrupted" [...] him and [...] "fueled [...] fantasies ... {{to the point of}} becoming a serial killer"; <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, [...] "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [...] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up." [...] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer. [...] "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. [...] "The problem was Bundy." [...] "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," [...] wrote Rule. [...] "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on himself, but on us." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1938, deHavilland {{began dating}} {{business}} tycoon, aviator, and filmmaker Howard Hughes, {{who had just}} completed his record-setting flight {{around the world in}} 91 hours. In addition to escorting her about town, he gave the actress her first flying lessons. She later said, [...] "He was a rather shy man ... and <b>yet,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> whole community where the men every day played heroes on the screen and didn't do anything heroic in life, here was this man who was a real hero." [...] In December 1939, she began a romantic relationship with actor James Stewart. At the request of Irene Mayer Selznick, the actor's agent asked Stewart to escort deHavilland to the New York premiere of Gone with the Wind at the Astor Theater on December 19, 1939. Over the next few days, Stewart took her to the theater several times and to the 21 Club. They continued to see each other back in Los Angeles, where Stewart provided occasional flying lessons and romance. According to deHavilland, Stewart proposed marriage to her in 1940, but she felt that he was not ready to settle down. Their relationship ended in late 1941 when deHavilland began a romantic relationship with film director John Huston while making In This Our Life. [...] "John was a very great love of mine", she would later admit, [...] "He was a man I wanted to marry." ...|$|E
500|$|Among the salons {{at which}} Offenbach most {{frequently}} appeared {{was that of}} the comtesse de Vaux. There he met Hérminie d'Alcain (1827–1887), the daughter of a Carlist general. They fell in love, but he was not <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> financial position to propose marriage. To extend his fame and earning power beyond Paris, he undertook tours of France and Germany. Among those with whom he performed were Anton Rubinstein and, in a concert in Offenbach's native Cologne, Liszt. In 1844, probably through English family connections of Hérminie, he embarked on a tour of England. There, he was immediately engaged to appear {{with some of the most}} famous musicians of the day, including Mendelssohn, Joseph Joachim, Michael Costa and Julius Benedict. The Era wrote of his debut performance in London, [...] "His execution and taste excited both wonder and pleasure, the genius he exhibited amounting to absolute inspiration." [...] The British press reported a triumphant royal command performance; The Illustrated London News wrote, [...] "Herr Jacques Offenbach, the astonishing Violoncellist, performed on Thursday evening at Windsor before the Emperor of Russia, the King of Saxony, Queen Victoria, and Prince Albert with great success." [...] The use of [...] "Herr" [...] rather than [...] "Monsieur", reflecting the fact that Offenbach remained a Prussian citizen, was common to all the British press coverage of Offenbach's 1844 tour. The ambiguity of his nationality sometimes caused him difficulty in later life.|$|E
