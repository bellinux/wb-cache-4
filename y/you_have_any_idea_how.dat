2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "To be an {{interesting}} actor - hell, to be {{an interesting}} human being - you must be authentic and for you to be authentic you must embrace who you really are, warts and all.

5000|$|It didn't {{take long}} until bull riders {{at the local}} amateurs rodeos refused to take on J-31. Sumner would watch the bull, who was now very smooth and muscular, roam around the hilly pasture near Goltry, Oklahoma. He would say, [...] "Young man, do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> you intimidate the cowboy that draws you?" [...] When Sumner {{realized}} {{he might have a}} major league bull, he contacted his friend Sammy Andrews. Like Bill McCann and Jess Kephart before him, Sumner had no idea just what caliber bull he was passing on. He was purchased by Andrews of the Andrews Rodeo Company, who hauled him and bucked him {{for the rest of his}} professional career. And the yellow bull finally had a name - Bodacious.|$|E
5000|$|Here is {{a lovely}} film about two high school seniors who look, speak and feel like real 18-year-old middle-American human beings. Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> rare that is? They aren't {{crippled}} by irony. They aren't speeded up into cartoons. Their sex lives aren't insulted by scenes that treat them cheaply ... What an affecting film this is. It respects its characters and doesn't use them for its own shabby purposes. How deeply we care about them. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are so there. Being young is a solemn business when you really care about someone. Teller has a touch of John Cusack in his Say Anything period. Woodley is beautiful in a real person sort of way, studying him with concern, and then that warm smile. We have gone through senior year with these two. We have known them. We have been them.|$|E

5000|$|Unlimited Saga was not well-received outside Japan, {{receiving}} mostly low {{to average}} scores from critics. Electronic Gaming Monthly simply declared: [...] "This game sucks. Unlimited Saga exemplifies everything that's wrong with RPGs today {{and throws it}} all together in one deluxe package for all to avoid like the plague." [...] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine largely agreed, stating that the game [...] "ruined the SaGa franchise" [...] with its [...] "excruciating difficulty, obtuse mechanics, a stifling lack of freedom, and a brutal mission structure that punishes you as often as it rewards you." [...] GameSpot called it [...] "simply unpleasant to play", calling the gameplay [...] "irksome" [...] and remarking that [...] "the reel system is interesting in theory, but in practice it's just an annoyance". The website would additionally pan the game's [...] "incredibly nonsensical" [...] story and voice acting that ranges from [...] "decent to really bad." [...] IGN applauded the game's music and presentation, calling the game's audio [...] "Unlimited Saga's most valuable asset", but found {{the rest of the}} game lacking, stating the [...] "production values, character designs, and personable lead protagonists are a plus, but the clunky interface and lack of acceptable functionality hurt it - and hurt it bad." [...] GamePro found the game generally lacking in quality, but declared its biggest hindrance to be its steep learning curve and non-linear story, finding that [...] "even basic navigation is difficult in this game—it will take you an hour or two before <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to get anywhere." [...] RPGamer called Unlimited Saga the [...] "biggest letdown" [...] of 2003 in their annual RPGamer Awards. The game maintains a 52% average score from aggregate review website GameRankings. GamesRadar called it the 25th Worst Game Of All Time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know more}} than you think I do," [...] Wrayson {{answered}} quietly. [...] "I know more indeed than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of. If the end were in hell I should not hold back." ...|$|R
6000|$|A change, {{that seemed}} almost {{the effect of}} actual shadow, came over his face. 'I wish you could stay with me,' he said slowly. 'I don't think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> what--what I go through.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{the kind}} of girl I admire," [...] he declared. [...] "I've been {{watching}} you--more than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of. You're adaptable.

6000|$|... "Collie, I {{never was}} any good," [...] he said. [...] "But I {{want to be}} better. I'll prove it. I'll make a clean breast of everything. I won't marry you with any secret between us. You might find out {{afterward}} and hate me.... Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> where I've been these last three years?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} quickly. [...] "I'd {{like to know}} because I think you've misjudged me. I was really more angry than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of at {{the manner in which}} you talked to Howard.

6000|$|... "You {{distress}} me," [...] he declared. [...] "Perhaps {{it is my}} fault. I {{have not}} made myself sufficiently clear. The knowledge of that word is a necessity to me. Without it I cannot complete my plans. Without it I very much fear, dear Mr. Dunster, that your sojourn among us may be longer than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{of course}} not," [...] said the captain, {{resuming}} his seat. [...] "Well, I'm sorry if it's serious, Jem, but I never dreamt <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> in that quarter. If I had I'd have given old Nugent the best bunk {{on the ship}} and sung him to sleep myself. Has she given you any encouragement?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Aye, {{and even}} in gen-teel families, in high families, in great families," [...] says Mr. Bucket, again gravely eyeing Sir Leicester aside. [...] "I have had the honour of being {{employed}} in high families before, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no idea--come, I'll {{go so far as}} to say not even <b>YOU</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea,</b> sir," [...] this to the debilitated cousin, [...] "what games goes on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed!" [...] sneered the ram, [...] "you like it, do <b>you?</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> {{what you}} look like, all sheared down to your skin?

6000|$|... "I don't say anything, {{except that}} I can't see anybody to make paths here. Indeed, the place seems quite unpopulated, {{and all the}} Orofenans {{told me that they}} never landed on it because if they did they would die. It is a part of their superstitious nonsense.

6000|$|... "I thought," [...] resumed Clara, {{in rather}} lower tones than before, [...] "that I would just look into your room before I {{went to the}} ball, and see that {{everything}} was properly arranged for you, in case <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of writing tonight; I had just time to do this while my aunt, who is going with me, was upstairs altering her toilette. But perhaps you don't feel inclined to write?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{please do}} not {{question}} my instructions any further. So far as regards the pecuniary part of it, I am a richer man than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of, Mr. Pengarth, and for the rest--sentiment unfortunately does not appeal to me. I choose to give the Tredowen estates away, to disappoint my next of kin. That is how you may regard the transaction. We will go {{into the house and}} complete this deed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{told me a}} very {{interesting}} thing about you," [...] she continued slowly, with her eye upon. Austen's profile. [...] "He said that a great many men wanted you to be their candidate for governor of the State,--more than <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of,--and that <b>you</b> wouldn't consent. Mr. Redbrook grew so enthusiastic that he forgot, for the moment, my--relationship to the railroad.

6000|$|... "My advice," [...] said Ben, {{after he}} had waited some time, to give due weight to his words, [...] "is that you clear out from this show {{just as soon as}} you can. This hain't no fit place for a boy of your age to be in, an' the sooner you get back where you started from, an get to school, the better.

6000|$|... "I will {{consider}} the matter," [...] I answered. [...] "In the meantime, I hope <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> inquiries made at once.
