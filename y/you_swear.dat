500|$|Before {{the first}} {{performance}} of Trial by Jury, some material was cut, including two songs and a recitative: {{a song for}} the foreman of the jury, [...] "Oh, do not blush to shed a tear", {{which was to be}} sung just after [...] "Oh, will <b>you</b> <b>swear</b> by yonder skies"; and a recitative for the Judge and song for the Usher, [...] "We do not deal with artificial crime" [...] and [...] "His lordship's always quits", which came just before [...] "A nice dilemma". The melody for [...] "His Lordship's always quits" [...] is known, and it was reused in [...] "I loved her fondly" [...] in The Zoo and later modified into the main tune from [...] "A wand'ring minstrel, I" [...] in The Mikado. [...] A few changes were made to the end of [...] "I love him, I love him!" [...] after the first night. [...] A third verse for [...] "Oh, gentlemen, listen I pray" [...] was sung, at least on the first night, and part was quoted in a review in the Pictorial World.|$|E

2500|$|... 'I made <b>you</b> <b>swear,</b> {{daughters of}} Jerusalem...' this great oath to God {{was that they}} should not arouse the Redemption until that love will be desired and with good will, as it is written 'until I desire,' and our Sages already said that the time of this oath is a {{thousand}} years, as it is written in the Baraita of Rabbi Yishmael in Pirkei Heichalot (in a comment on Daniel 7:25)..., and similarly in the Zohar II:17a...that it is one day of the Exile of the Community of Israel...|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 2010, Shahzad {{was convicted}} and sentenced by federal judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of the Southern District of New York to life {{imprisonment}} {{without the possibility of}} parole. When asked by the judge, [...] "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>swear</b> allegiance to this country?" [...] Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen, replied, [...] "I sweared, but I didn't mean it." [...] Shahzad, wearing a white prayer cap, smiled and said [...] "Allahu Akbar" [...] after hearing his sentence. He said he would [...] "sacrifice a thousand lives for Allah."

2500|$|The Tosefta {{reported}} that Jewish judicial proceedings adopted the oath that Abraham imposed in [...] And Rav Judah said that Rav {{said that the}} judge adjures the witness with the oath stated in [...] "And I will make <b>you</b> <b>swear</b> by the Lord, the God of heaven." [...] Ravina explained that this accorded with the view of Rabbi Haninah bar Idi, who said that Jewish judicial proceedings require swearing by the Name of God. Rav Ashi replied that one might even say that it accorded with {{the view of the}} Rabbis, who said that a witness can be adjured with a Substitute for the Name of God. They concluded that the witness needs to hold something sacred in his hand, as Abraham's servant did when in [...] he put his hand under Abraham's thigh and held Abraham's circumcision. Rava said that a judge who adjures by [...] "the Lord God of heaven" [...] without having the witness hold a sacred object errs and has to repeat the swearing correctly. Rav Papa said that a judge who adjures with tefillin errs and has to repeat the swearing. The law follows Rava, but not Rav Papa, as tefillin are considered sacred.|$|E

He was interrogated by the recently formed High-Value Interrogation Group. Ron Kuby, who has represented a number of terrorism defendants, said: [...] "My experience with ... Islamists, is they love to talk. Their goal isn't to beat the rap when they're caught. Their goal is either to die as a martyr, or commit mass murder". Ken Wainstein, a former U.S. attorney who headed the Justice Department's anti-terrorism efforts, said that a defendant's cooperation is motivated by [...] "just sheer pride in what he's done." [...] Faisal was arraigned on May 18. He is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. On June 17, {{a federal grand jury}} indicted Shahzad on terror charges. Shazad pleaded guilty to the charges. On October 5, 2010, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole by a federal judge in New York. He responded to the sentence by saying that [...] "the defeat of the U.S. is imminent." [...] When asked by the judge, [...] "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>swear</b> allegiance to this country?" [...] Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen, replied, [...] "I sweared, but I didn't mean it." ...|$|E
