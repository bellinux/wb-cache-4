2500|$|On June 19, 1942 O'Hare assumed {{command of}} VF-3, {{relieving}} Lieutenant Commander Thach. He was relocated to Maui, Hawaii, to instruct other pilots in combat tactics. U.S. Navy policy {{was to use}} its best combat pilots to train newer pilots, {{in contrast to the}} Japanese practice of keeping their best pilots flying combat missions. Ensign Edward L. [...] "Whitey" [...] Feightner, who served with O'Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O'Hare passed on to him, was [...] "If you ever jump one of these Zeros and you surprise him, remember, the first thing he's going to do is a loop. Don't follow him into it! By the time you go into it a second time, he'll be behind you. The first thing you should do when he starts up the loop is make a hard right turn and keep turning. You'll come right around, and when he bottoms out of the loop, you'll be right on his tail!" [...] O'Hare also related [...] "First of all, remember, in today's world, whenever <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> and engage the enemy, you're going to be outnumbered. If you want to survive this War, you have to look behind you every chance you get. Even when you pull the trigger, be sure to look behind because there's gonna be someone back there." ...|$|E
60|$|CONJURER. I {{will take}} off my cloak when <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your coat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did--sit down, please--but I {{find myself}} obliged to cut my stay short. Won't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your coat?" [...] he asked, {{taking off his}} own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said Mr. Green. [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>take</b> {{yourself}} <b>off</b> before I put {{the police}} on to <b>you.</b> <b>Take</b> your face <b>off</b> these premises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Your lordship {{would be}} much better if <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> all that flannel—it only serves to inflame the toe,” Harry continued, looking his man full in the face.|$|R
6000|$|... --I {{was just}} telling my friend Wallis what a lark {{it would be}} tonight if <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the rector {{in the part of}} the schoolmaster. It would be a ripping good joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> my shoes, darling?" [...] she said, sinking {{among the}} {{cushions}} of the settee. Leslie kneeled again before her, and she {{bent her head}} and watched him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mind {{you don't}} make her walk too fast,' said the careful Lucy, 'and take care how <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your muslin, Sophy, {{you had better}} go to the nursery for help.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> those confounded {{creaking}} shoes," [...] {{the other}} answered, quite gravely; and Binnie turned away {{to hide his}} jolly round face, which was screwed up with laughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, {{they are}} men of too high rank and too great fashion for a {{hard-working}} poor soldier like me; {{and if you}} continue to live with such, believe me, you will find numbers of us humdrum people can't afford to keep such company. I am here, Mr. Warrington, paying my addresses to an honourable lady. I met you yesterday openly walking with a French ballet-dancer, and <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> your hat. I must frankly tell you, that I had rather <b>you</b> would not <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your hat when you go out in such company." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Daily Oklahoman newspaper. Caption: "If <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> in an {{airplane}} tonight and didn't land until October 1981, you still wouldn't have spent as many airborne hours as James "Butch" Kerr, who estimates he has logged more than 14, 000 hours during his career in aviation. ...|$|R
50|$|One {{interesting}} little quirk to {{the game}} was that, {{it was possible to}} bomb your own ship as <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> from it. If you did this, when you returned it would no longer be there (having sunk, presumably) and being unable to land on it your plane would just continue flying until it ran out of fuel and crashed.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, my dear," [...] went on her visitor, fixing his {{piercing}} eyes {{upon her}} face, [...] "with your permission, we will {{sit down and}} have a little talk together. Won't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your hat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> {{some of your}} wraps, Mary?" [...] {{proceeded}} Mrs. Langford, and her daughter-in-law, with a soft [...] "Thank you," [...] passively obeyed. [...] "And you too, my dear," [...] {{she added}} to Henrietta.|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [with {{a sudden}} rather hard {{brightness}} in her manner]. Won't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your overcoat, Mr Dunn? You {{will find a}} cupboard for coats and hats and things {{in the corner of}} the hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} for you to do, so far as I can see," [...] said the girl, slowly, [...] "is to make {{yourself}} up like a coalie. There are one or two colliers in the harbor, and if <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> your coat--I could send it on afterwards--rubbed yourself all over with coal-dust, and shaved off your moustache, I believe you would escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, that listens fine, {{but poor}} old Eddie's heart is clean busted just the same--me {{thinking}} {{of you and your}} nice complexion and goldie hair and the cute way you talked at our lunch--whenever Hunt shut up and gave you a chance--honest, I haven't forgot yet the way <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> old man--what was it?--the old stiff that ran the commercial college, what was his name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> must <b>take</b> <b>off</b> {{your shoes}} and stockings," [...] said his sister, Nunziata; [...] "we never wear them but on Sundays and holidays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} first man, [...] "I guess we'll take our chances {{and you can get}} into the caboose. You'll find blankets, and a bunk where you can lie down if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your boots. We'll dump you somewheres handy for {{catching}} the next east-bound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgetting your place?" [...] cried Newman. [...] "Why, you are remembering it. This is your place, you know. You {{are already}} in my service; your wages, as housekeeper, began a {{fortnight}} ago. I can tell you my house wants keeping! Why don't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your bonnet and stay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's my best customer," [...] he cried, [...] "and a bum waiter {{comes along}} and beats him up just when {{he is trying to}} have a little {{innocent}} sport on Christmas Eve. <b>You</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your apron, young man, and get your time. I won't have no rough stuff in Feinheimer's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{any time}} you please, Baxter," [...] {{returned}} Dick. [...] "But don't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me <b>off</b> my guard again, or I'll have no mercy on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{as much as}} you," [...] said Speckle. [...] "However, I'm sure I don't {{care how}} soon <b>you</b> <b>take</b> {{yourself}} <b>off,</b> for <b>you</b> <b>take</b> up more room than all the rest put together." ...|$|R
60|$|VERA. Will you {{let these}} men sit down if I give <b>you</b> this? (<b>Takes</b> <b>off</b> her peasant's necklace.) It is all I have; {{it was my}} mother's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Robertson, my chief," [...] Lister said to Barbara, {{and the man}} {{presented}} Lister to his companion, and put {{a machine}} in a box on the floor. [...] "Now there's room; I was pulling out the indicator diagrams," [...] he added. [...] "Won't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your coat, Miss Hyslop, and try Mike's doughnuts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Anne, I noticed {{last night}} that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I can't allow it at all. As soon as <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> any article of {{clothing}} fold it neatly {{and place it on}} the chair. I haven't any use at all for little girls who aren't neat." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{stopped a}} moment with a little wistful smile. [...] "I'm afraid {{this is going to be}} a {{particularly}} lean year for a good many of us. Last year I was busy, though I had a Scandinavian maid, but I shall be single-handed now, and the grocery bill must come down, too. It's quite hard to pare it any closer when everything <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> means extra work, and, with it all, the boys must be fed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pippin hustled {{him along}} the deck. [...] "Come, come, <b>you</b> <b>took</b> me <b>off</b> my guard," [...] he murmured, with a sly, gentle smile, [...] "that's not fair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> can't <b>take</b> <b>off</b> {{your hat}} because you've got some things stowed away in it you don't want seen," [...] said Twing, with an {{immovable}} face.|$|R
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>take</b> {{part of a}} {{twentieth century}} kid who has been {{snatched}} off to this magical world. The idea is that a witch needs a young boy as an ingredient in a rejuvenation potion — you are the unlikely target. Once you get there the witch has <b>you</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> to the dungeons where you are to be held (upside down in manacles) until she {{is ready for the}} spell. The aim of the game is to (surprise) kill the witch and dash back to one's own time. —Ian Sabine, designer ...|$|R
60|$|Come to {{the door}} and look across. Can you see a thin fire very far away down the stream? That is the temple-fire, in the shrine of Hanuman, of the village of Pateera. North, under the big star, is the village itself, but it is hidden by a bend of the river. Is that far to swim, Sahib? Would <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> your clothes and adventure? Yet I swam to Pateera--not once but many times; and there are muggers in the river too.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{that goes}} for a great deal, lad--for a great deal. Not one nurse out of a hundred would carry out my {{instructions}} carefully; not one patient in a thousand {{would be able to}} see that they were carried out. Of course you will keep on with the treatment, but do not push it to extremes; you have pulled yourself down prodigiously, and must not go too far. Do you perceive any change in the odour when <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the blankets?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{hope you}} have been {{attended}} to properly,' said he, 'and that you will enjoy your dinner. My steward will take care you have all you want, and I wish you to do exactly as you please. Oh, by the bye, there is one thing! You notice that soup-tureen {{in the middle of}} the table? Well, be careful on no account to lift the lid. If once <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the cover, there is an end of your good fortune.' Then, bowing to his guests, he left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but as Kate {{was not in}} {{when you}} arrived, and did not come until later, <b>you</b> must <b>take</b> <b>off</b> at least one hour," [...] said Mrs. Hale gayly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Barrington is away, but Miss Barrington and Miss Maud are at home," [...] she said. [...] "Will you {{go forward}} into the morning-room when <b>you</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> your furs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{yourself}}, to be sure," [...] replied Rokens, [...] "an' {{the sooner}} <b>you</b> <b>takes</b> yourself <b>off,</b> an' {{comes to an}} anchor in a loo-natick asylum, the better for all parties consarned." ...|$|R
