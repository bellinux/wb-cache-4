25|$|The {{use of an}} {{infrared}} sensor to detect position can cause some detection problems when other infrared sources are around, such as incandescent light bulbs or candles. This can be easily alleviated by using fluorescent lights around the Wii, which emit little to no infrared light. Innovative users have used other sources of IR light as Sensor Bar substitutes such {{as a pair of}} flashlights and a pair of candles. The Wii Remote picks up traces of heat from the sensor, then transmits it to the Wii console to control the pointer on <b>your</b> <b>screen.</b> Such substitutes for the Sensor Bar illustrate the fact that a pair of non-moving lights provide continuous calibration of the direction that the Wii Remote is pointing and its physical location relative to the light sources. There is no way to calibrate the position of the cursor relative to where the user is pointing the controller without the two stable reference sources of light provided by the Sensor Bar or substitutes. Third-party wireless sensor bars have also been released, which have been popular with users of Wii emulators since the official Sensor Bar utilizes a proprietary connector to connect to the Wii console.|$|E
500|$|Scott Matthewman, {{writing for}} The Stage, gave a mixed {{review of the}} episode. He thought that [...] "pretty much the only {{surprise}} {{in the way the}} humans who made up the Ood Corporation were presented came as PR girl Solana (Ayesha Dharker) escaped with the Doctor and Donna, only to betray their position by calling for the guards," [...] and [...] "the revelation that Ryder (Adrian Rawlins) has been working to infiltrate the Corporation is thrown away... as quickly as it is revealed." [...] However, he thought Donna was becoming [...] "fast... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series’ history", and [...] "there were some nice interpretations of the Ood’s natural development". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was [...] "really really good... – one that will have you staring at <b>your</b> <b>screen</b> and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early on a Saturday night, in my own front room?'". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate [...] "really, really isn’t that bad when she says [...] ". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five. Rawson-Jones opened his review by saying [...] "Doctor Who can occasionally transcend the properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant, beautiful epiphany and greater sense of the world they inhabit," [...] citing Donna's reaction on seeing the uncultivated Ood as the moving part of the episode.|$|E
