She writes {{that she was}} the first to use the term [...] "supermodel" [...] and refers to herself as such. She recounts a particular exchange with her agent Monique Pillard who asked her: [...] "Janice, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> night and day. Who do you think you are, superman?" [...] Dickinson responded: [...] "No, honey. I'm supermodel." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 2005, Electronic Arts {{announced}} that Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, would reprise {{his role as}} Elrond and be the lead voiceover talent in The Battle for Middle-earth II. During his voiceover session, he noted, [...] "I always find voice work really fascinating because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> on one element of your make up as an actor—focusing more intently on one part of your toolbox if you like—in a way so everything seems to go into producing that vocal effect. It really isn’t just an effect, because it actually comes from a source which is a true continuation of that character." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working,</b> you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig that she wore during her first two episodes.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with E! Online, assistant director and producer of Terminator Salvation, Bruce Franklin, {{said it was an}} isolated incident. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> in a very intense scene and someone takes you out of your groove ... It was the most emotional scene in the movie ... and for him to get stopped in the middle of it. He is very intensely involved in his character. He didn't walk around like that all day long. It was just a moment and it passed", Franklin said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1893, the {{distance}} between the pitcher and home plate was extended by nine feet, resulting in a dramatic increase in batting averages. The rule change helped Zimmer statistically, as he compiled a [...]308 batting average, the first of four [...]300 seasons. However, Zimmer bemoaned the rule change's effect on pitchers: [...] "They are making the pitcher a mere automaton. By and by they will make him stand on a cake of ice and pitch. Say what you will, the pitcher is the central figure in the game. People pay their money to see base ball, and the more scientific it is the better. When you put a pitcher out of sight and make a toy of him <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> squarely against the interests of the game, in my opinion." ...|$|E

2500|$|A popular rumor {{circulating}} {{soon after}} the episode alleged that, unaware of being filmed, Caramitru had addressed Dinescu, saying, [...] "Mircea, fă-te că lucrezi!" [...] ("Mircea, pretend you are working!"); this version of events may have started as defamation by political adversaries, {{with the purpose of}} indicating that the Revolution was a carefully staged front for a coup d'état. According to Alex Mihai Stoenescu's research, despite its passing into contemporary folklore, such a phrase was never uttered; instead, the words used were [...] "Mircea, arăţi că lucrezi" [...] ("Mircea, show that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> on something" [...] — while holding Dinescu's booklet in front of camera), to which Dinescu replied [...] "La un apel" [...] (" [...] on an appeal [...] ") — pointing rather to their ill-preparedness and their preoccupation in quickly drafting a proper document.|$|E
2500|$|For {{secondary}} education, Dominic {{had to go}} {{to another}} school and it was decided that he would go to the County School at Castelnuovo, three miles (5km) from his home. (Castelnuovo d' Asti, now Castelnuovo John Bosco, was the birthplace of another contemporary of John Bosco, Joseph Cafasso, also a saint. He was four years the senior of John Bosco, and was Bosco's mentor and advisor.) [...] Now ten years old, Dominic walked daily to and from school. In his biography of Dominic Savio, John Bosco records how a local farmer once asked Dominic, on a hot sunny day, if he was not tired from walking, and received the reply: [...] "Nothing seems tiresome or painful when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> for a master who pays well." [...] Don Bosco also notes that Dominic refused to go swimming with his friends since Dominic considered that in such a situation, it would be [...] "also easy to offend God", he believed that on a previous occasion his friends behaved in, what was to him, a vulgar manner. In his biography Bosco records that Fr. Allora, the head of this school, {{had this to say about}} Dominic: [...] "...Hence it may very well be said that he was Savio (wise), not only in name, but in fact, viz., in his studies, in piety, in conversation and his dealing with others, and in all his actions. ..." ...|$|E
