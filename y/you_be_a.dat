500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
500|$|Peter Horton, {{expressed}} that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson's character, Miranda Bailey, was {{to focus on}} the similarities between her and the actress, noting that [...] "there's not a mean bone in her body, but she's solid and steady, like a rock." [...] Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character's personality, noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past, to a maternal outlook on her interns. She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character, describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers, rather than someone living inside her. Wilson also assessed that being a real-life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character: [...] "She gets to be flawed, she gets to be tired, she can be cranky, she can be grumpy." [...] Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months. Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson's portrayal of her character [...] "sweet and wonderful", naming her a professional: [...] "She makes <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better actor, just by being there." [...] She also described her performance during her character's labor as [...] "heart-breaking, tender, powerful and wonderful", noting how she managed to transform the strong character into [...] "a weak woman, struggling to fight the unusual situation". Fellow cast member James Pickens, Jr. described Wilson's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as [...] "a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively", also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater. Horton also described the production process of the two-part story arc, which he stated to have been planning {{since the beginning of the}} series. He stated that the plot of the episodes had to [...] "fill the demands of the Super Bowl", which was scheduled to air in the same night: [...] "We really wanted something different and Shonda [...] came up with the idea of this bomb, that we found simply outstanding!" [...] Visual effects supervisor Scott Milnex noted how [...] "breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together". He also assessed that the necessity to use Primacord, an element they had been trying to avoid, for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous, and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material. He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor: [...] "When we filmed it, there was a moment, a fraction of a second, when we changed the body with the actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara deduced {{from the}} command of [...] "you shall not bring an abomination into your house, lest <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cursed thing like it," [...] that {{whatever}} one might bring into being out of an idolatrous thing {{would have the same}} cursed status.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Berekiah {{noted that}} in [...] God had already said, [...] "I will bless you," [...] and so asked what God added by then saying, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> blessing." [...] Rabbi Berekiah {{explained}} that God was thereby conveying to Abraham that up until that point, God had to bless God's world, but thereafter, God entrusted the ability to bless to Abraham, and Abraham could thenceforth bless whomever it pleased him to bless.|$|E
2500|$|By most accounts, Selim had a fiery {{temper and}} had very high {{expectations}} of his those below him. Several of his viziers were executed for various reasons. A famous anecdote relates how another vizier playfully asked the Sultan for some preliminary notice of his doom {{so that he}} might have time to put his affairs in order. The Sultan laughed and replied that indeed he had been thinking of having the vizier killed, but had no one fit to take his place, otherwise he would gladly oblige. A popular Ottoman curse was, [...] "May <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> vizier of Selim's," [...] as a reference to the number of viziers he had executed.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] condemns male chauvinism by {{addressing}} hurtful myths about female inferiority, with Madonna commenting on female role-playing in society. During the pre-chorus, Madonna sings: [...] "Strong inside but you don't know it / Good little girls they never show it / When you open up your {{mouth to speak}} / Could <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little weak?", she sings. The Village Voices Phil Dellio found the song [...] "the perfect answer record to The Virgin Suicides (where boys indeed stand {{on the side of}} the street looking uncomprehendingly on girls), thanks in no small part to the gossamer-like synthesizer percolating in the background. Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it [...] "Madonna's quasi-feminist statement," [...] while Eamon Sweeney of Hot Press noted that the song [...] "is similar in tone and texture to the Natalie Imbruglia smash ‘Smoke’." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Yale gained {{supremacy}} in athletics, Murphy's fame spread, and in {{the fall}} of 1889, the Detroit Athletic Club hired him as the physical director and athletic coach for its members. Murphy remained in Detroit for three years, and while there, he developed a reputation for having a [...] "sixth sense" [...] in being able to spot athletic talent. His first discovery in Detroit was John Owen who {{went on to become the}} fastest sprinter in America. One newspaper account described Murphy's discovery of Owen as follows:"John Owen, a member of the club, was playing tennis one afternoon when Murphy, in his methodical way, leaned over to watch the movements of the players. The action of Owen looked promising to Murphy. 'Mr. Owen, why don't <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sprinter?' he asked while the players were wiping off perspiration between acts. 'I?' returned Owen. 'Why, I couldn't run a lick.' But Murphy insisted, and from that seeming guess work selection of a future great was developed John Owen, the first amateur sprinter to cover one hundred yards under ten seconds. Owen's time was 9-4/5 seconds." ...|$|E
