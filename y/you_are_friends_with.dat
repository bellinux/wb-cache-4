When <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> {{somebody}} you always have to transcend differences and I respect Junaid's views. Junaid once told me that his biggest regret was not {{to be a part of}} Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with 'Naya Pakistan', I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all." [...] and further added [...] "it signifies the metaphor for unity as we have to compromise for unity in hope of Naya Pakistan." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{tour was}} first {{announced}} in October 2014, when Chesney was promoting his album on Good Morning America. When {{asked about the}} tour Chesney says, [...] "I've been ready {{to get out there}} for a long time. Now that we're announced I'm fired up! This new music brings a new energy to the show, and it's gonna take what we do to a whole other level. Days after the tour was announced, it was revealed that ten of the shows in the summer would be combined with Jason Aldean's Burn It Down Tour. These ten shows will be played at football stadiums across America. On this ten show merge, Chesney's says; [...] "There aren't a lot of guys out there who can hit it the way Jason does, so I'm glad we're able to bring both of our tours together for 10 nights the summer. I know what me and the guys are bringing in terms of music, and I know Jason can hang with us!" [...] Aldean praised Kenny by saying that he [...] "is the guy everybody in country music looks up to when they think about workin’ hard, building your career out on the road and getting to eventually play stadiums". Chesney also gave Aldean advice when Aldean started playing stadiums {{a few years ago and}} the two [...] "have a real friendship."It was later announced that Chesney will also merge an additional five shows with Eric Church. These shows will also be played at football stadiums. According to Church, he had a good time in his previous tour with Chesney, and that Chesney is [...] "an artist that isn't afraid to let you come full blast and do what you do. It's rare you get to tour with someone you respect and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with.</b> I can't wait to do it again." ...|$|E
40|$|This Peck Hall GLBT Program was {{delivered}} by Joseph Santiago and Morgan Cottrell to residence hall students and RAs. There were 63 people in attendance for this event. Peck Hall GLBT Training Program 2009; Joe santaigao and URI; Joseph Santiago and URI; Morgan Cottrell; -Name -Involvement with the Center -Quick program overview -What does GLBT stand for -Invitation to Celluloid Closet; Stand-Up/Sit-Down Game (5 - 10 minutes) Note to facilitator: Ask everyone to stand. When a statement is read {{that refers to}} them, ask them to sit and remain seated {{for the rest of}} the activity. Ask them to be honest. All items do not have to be read or read in this order. You can pick and choose statements to read based on the type of audience you are speaking to.; You are a man and sit with your legs crossed.  You are a woman and have ever worn a baseball cap.  You are a woman and you play sports aggressively.  You are a man and you wear jewelry (rings, bracelets, necklaces, anklets…)  You are a man and you have your ears pierced.  You identify as a feminist.  You are a woman and you do not shave your legs or under your arms.  You are a man and you enjoy musicals.  You are a woman and you are not wearing any makeup today.  You are a man and you do not play sports.  You are a woman with short hair (chin length or shorter).  You are a man with long hair (chin length or longer).  You have not dated anyone of the opposite sex in the past six months.  <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> someone who is LGBT.  You have a family member who is LGBT.  You are a man and you have been told that you are sensitive.  You are a woman with a low voice.  Majority of your friends are the same gender as you.  You are a romantic man.  You are a man and you polish your toenails or fingernails.  You are a man and you have received professional massages.  You verbally support LGBT issues.  You are a woman and you shop in the men’s section in stores.  You are a man and you color or perm your hair.  You are a woman and you stand up for yourself.  You are a man and you have often been complemented on your sense of style.  You are a woman and went to Lilith Fair.  You are a man and enjoy female music groups.  You are a man and you show affection to other men.  You have another visible part of your body pierced besides your ears.  You are a man and you have spoken out against sexist jokes and comments.; Why’d we do that? Everyone who is now sitting down could be a target for LGBT hate crimes. All the statements we have read off were actual items perpetrators used to target LGBT people. This exercise shows that hate crimes do not have rationales behind them. The reasons people have given to discriminate against the LGBT population are often very arbitrary. For those of you still standing, we have only named a few things people have given to target the LGBT population. It is possible that you may be sitting down if we read additional statements. It is also possible that you have recognized these as reasons people target the LGBT population and have either intentionally or unintentionally avoided behaving according to these statements. This is just some food for thought for you to consider.; Spheres of Influence Activity (10 - 15 minutes) -Break students up into three or four groups of about 4 or 5 people. -Pass out one Spheres of Influence worksheet to each group, and one pen. -Tell students to take 10 - 15 minutes to brainstorms ways they can use their spheres of influence to make this campus more affirming to people on campus who need extra support.; Closing (5 - 10 minutes) -Thank students for participating, and working towards a more positive campus community -Prompt participants to take a schedule, film series schedule, conversation group flier, and book mark -Tell them how to visit our website, join our listserv, and facebook group -Invite them to Celluloid Closet at 7 : 30 at the Center; Change Your World With Your Spheres of Influence; Directions: Each Individual has the power to influence the world in a positive way. Reflect on each sphere of influence you have, and write down ways to use that influence to make the URI Campus more inviting and affirming for GLBT students, or any other community that could use more support.

They are not likely to ask you how many years ago it is, or how big I was then, and will imagine that I was quite a child, and that I belonged to a Spanish ship, for they will not dream of an English vessel having been in these parts.

When he bought his house in Hampstead he asked me what I thought of it. He even came to my wedding. Obviously he used to have parties and stuff and he would invite me to Cannes to watch the Grand Prix. For his birthday he would fly me over on his plane. People who don’t know him might say he’s like this or like that or like his dad, but I’ve never seen that. I looked at him like a friend. He wasn't the best footballer but he did it as a hobby. He's a billionaire but it was something he wanted to do. He wanted to play football, to come in every day and train. And he did it, to be fair. He never expected any special treatment. But obviously there were his bodyguards around. It is very strange for me. People will say to me, 'how can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> this guy?' But you can only judge people on how you see them. He was always nice to me. I never met his brothers or his dad, they must be completely different. It has been weird. He paid for my honeymoon. He asked me what we were doing for it and I told him we hadn’t decided yet. So he said he’d sort something out for me. He paid for us to go to LA for a week and then on to Hawaii. All first-class travel and top hotels. It was very generous. That's the side I see of him. I don’t see the other side. I don’t know it. There's always corruption where there's power, so you never know. His country want him back to prosecute him but they want to kill him apparently. It's all politics and I don’t really know about it. I just know that innocent people should never get hurt." ...|$|R

But I can never be grateful enough for what you said to me that night when you would not come in with me. The words have rung in my ears ever since; they showed that you had faith in him, more faith than I had, and I've made them my rule and my guide. No one has been my refuge from him, and no one ever shall be. And I thank you--yes, I thank you on my bended knees--for making me go into the house alone; it's my one comfort that I had the strength to come back to him, and let him do anything he would to me, after I had treated him so; but I've never pretended it was my own strength. I have always told everybody that the strength came from you!" ...|$|R
