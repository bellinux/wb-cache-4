500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "Saw VI is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the Saw films. It's {{the first one}} that's more or less {{consumed}} by backstory—which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks." [...] He said, [...] "If <b>your</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> do a quick study for a round of Saw Trivial Pursuit, then {{this may be the}} movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time." [...] Rob Nelson of Variety wrote, [...] "Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with Saw VI, a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called 'Saw It Already'. At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition", but added, [...] "Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous Saw pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best...." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN Movies rated Saw VI three out of five and wrote that [...] "while Saw VI certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, Saw Ⅶ will no doubt mark the time to either shake things up or watch this franchise get the ax".|$|E

Thy Dungeonman has two sequels: Thy Dungeonman II, which expands on the features of the original game and can only be found on the Videlectrix site, and Thy Dungeonman III which adds basic graphics and {{can be found on the}} Homestar Runner site.
