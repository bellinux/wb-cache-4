[...] Dunham deemed it as having [...] "One {{of the best}} soundtracks to come along for quite some time", and praised Sammy for keeping the {{original}} voice actors, as did Knutson, which felt it [...] "gives it a 'cooler aura'." [...] Keil and Knutson found the sound effects to be [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "really great" [...] respectively. On the other hand, GamePro described the sound design as the game's [...] "major flaw." [...] EGM remarked [...] "Depending on your tastes, GGX2s pervasive heavy-metal cheesiness might negatively influence <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised {{the choice of}} having Rivers guest star since {{she was able to}} [...] "employ her trademark humor within the world of The Simpsons without hijacking the plot or satire." [...] He also noted that while the Simpson family does not appear heavily, [...] "Krusty is such {{a large part of the}} supporting cast that he carries this episode well. While it may seem a little funny that Castellaneta, who voices Krusty, wrote such a large part for himself, it is also a testament to his empathy for Krusty that this episode both deepens our understanding of Krusty and actually allows him growth as a character in an organic fashion." [...] Ology's Josh Harrison similarly praised [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] for having [...] "some wonderful Krusty the Klown moments and some clutch guest star appearances". He also cited the visual gags in the episode as [...] "clever". Harrison concluded his review by writing that though the episode [...] "wasn't Simpsons gold, it was a great chance to focus on a secondary character and an opportunity for Joan Rivers to, um, be Joan Rivers. I imagine your assessment of the episode may be based largely on <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the guest star. That said? I dug it." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding Joan of Arc, William Wordsworth {{wrote to}} William Matthews, 21 March 1796, claiming: [...] "You were right about Southey, he is {{certainly}} a , and has proved it completely by the preface to his Joan of Arc, an epic poem which he has just published. This preface is indeed a very conceited performance and the poem though in some passages of first-rate excellence is on the whole of very inferior execution." [...] Charles Lamb, in a 10 June 1796 letter to Coleridge, stated, [...] "With Joan of Arc I have been delighted, amazed. I had not presumed to expect of any thing of such excellence from Southey. why the poem is alone sufficient to redeem {{the character of the}} age we live in from the imputation of degenerating in Poetry [...] The subject is well chosen. It opens well [...] On the whole, I expect Southey one day to rival Milton." [...] Coleridge, in a 31 December 1796 letter to John Thelwall, admitted, [...] "I entirely according with <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> Southey's Joan [...] the poem tho' it frequently reached the sentimental, does not display, the poetical, Sublime. In language at once natural, perspicuous, & dignified, in manly pathos, in sooth & sonnet-like description, and above all, in character, & dramatic dialogue, Southey is unrivalled; but as certainly he does not possess opulence of Imagination, lofty-paced Harmony, or that toil of thinking, which is necessary in order to plan a Whole." ...|$|E
