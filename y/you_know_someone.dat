He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>someone</b> who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters.

40|$|Trying {{to reach}} a person {{after several years of}} no contact can be quite time-consuming, since the person may have moved to a {{different}} place and changed occupation. Also, to keep personal addressbooks up-to-date is a tedious task when many people change contact information and fail to tell everybody. A nice solution could be based on a globally unique identifier which never changes. Once <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>someones</b> identifier <b>you</b> would, with that user’s consent, always be able to contact that user and the information would be synchronizable with the internal addressbook of your cellphone, PDA or computer. In this Master’s thesis a new global Internet based addressbook, Hermes, is proposed. Hermes is intended to scale globally and will be accessible from the internal addressbook of cellphones, PDA’s, computers etc. With this system, it will be easy to keep contact details up-to-date even for persons who move abroad and change name and work affiliation...|$|R

5000|$|Schwegel shopped the {{screenplay}} version of Officer Down to Hollywood, but quickly became disillusioned. [...] "In my experience, Hollywood ranks spec scripts {{a few points}} lower than scratch paper. Even if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>someone</b> who knows someone (which I did), the odds don’t fall in your favor." [...] Schrader encouraged her to rewrite the story as a novel, and Schwegel warmed to the expanded possibilities the form offered, later explaining, [...] "In screenwriting, you don’t write about the couch unless the hero has a gun tucked between the cushions and his nemesis has just taken a seat... In a novel, I can describe the couch. I {{can tell you that}} the hero thinks it’s comfortable. I can tell you the hero’s ex-wife insisted on buying the too-expensive couch and now the bad guy is sitting on it, he thinks of her—the woman who got him into this mess… and on and on. In other words, writing for the screen is an action blueprint; writing a novel is custom-building from the action." ...|$|E
