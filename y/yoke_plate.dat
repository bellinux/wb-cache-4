[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Nonlinear simulations {{were used to}} predict and further understand the load transfer between trunnion shafts and yoke plates within a tainter gate trunnion assembly. Traditionally, yoke plates have been sized for an average stress based on the projected bearing area between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate; however, finite element analyses proved that the stress is not uniform across {{the thickness of the}} <b>yoke</b> <b>plate.</b> The non-uniform stress distribution is attributed to the transverse shaft rotations that exist at the supports, concentrating load on the inboard edges of the yoke plates. Further study showed that the installation of either a bronze or composite sleeve between the <b>yoke</b> <b>plate</b> and the trunnion shaft will reduce the magnitude of the stress concentrations. A series of finite element models was developed to investigate the effects that shaft diameter, <b>yoke</b> <b>plate</b> thickness, and sleeve material have on the trunnion shaft to <b>yoke</b> <b>plate</b> load path. The finite element models were developed utilizing solid elements in order to capture the stress distribution across the <b>yoke</b> <b>plate</b> thickness by including multiple solution points across the <b>yoke</b> <b>plate</b> thickness. The analyses showed that a trend can be identified between the magnitude of the edge stress and the L/D ratio (shaft clear span to shaft diameter). As the L/D ratio of the system is increased, the magnitude of the edge stress increases; however, when a sleeve with a lower modulus of elasticity is introduced into the system, it is observed that the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced. The results proved that the reduction in stress is sensitive to shaft diameter, sleeve material, <b>yoke</b> <b>plate</b> thickness and L/D ratio. Typically for a yoke-shaft detail, the L/D ratio is designed to be close to 1. 0 in order to minimize the inboard edge stress; however, trunnion assemblies with larger L/D ratios are desirable from a tainter gate design perspective. Larger clear spans (L) simplify the connection between the strut arms and the trunnion assembly, and small shaft diameters (D) reduce the trunnion pin friction moment demand on the tainter gate strut arms. By installing a low modulus sleeve between the trunnion shaft and the <b>yoke</b> <b>plate,</b> the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced; therefore, the design can accommodate L/D ratios larger than 1. 0 while still keeping the stresses below an acceptable level. The simplified detailing and the reduction in strut arm demand will produce a more cost effective tainter gate design.

40|$|The {{finite element}} model of the 1000 kV Ultra High Voltage (UHV) AC {{transmission}} line porcelain insulator string voltage distribution and grading ring surface electric field distribution calculation has the characteristics of large size, complicated structure and various mediums. To insure the accuracy, related influencing factors should be considered to simplify the model reasonably for improving computational efficiency. A whole model and a simplified 3 D {{finite element model}} of UHV AC transmission line porcelain insulator string were built. The influencing factors including tower, phase conductors, hardware fittings, <b>yoke</b> <b>plate</b> and phase interaction were considered in the analysis. And finally, the rationality of the simplified model was validated. The results comparison show that building a simplified model of three-phase bundled conductors within a certain length, simplifying the tower reasonably, omitting the hardware fittings and <b>yoke</b> <b>plate</b> and containing only single-phase insulator string model is feasible. The simplified model could replace the whole model to analyze the voltage distribution along the porcelain insulator string and the electric field distribution on the grading ring surface, and it can reduce the calculation scale, improve optimization efficiency of insulators string and grading ring parameters. </p...|$|E
50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the depositâ€™s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip <b>yokes</b> are <b>plated</b> with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
