500|$|... "Part of Me" [...] is a dance-pop {{and power}} pop song set {{to a house}} beat. It is {{composed}} in the key of D minor and set in a 4/4 time signature at a tempo of 130 beats per minute. The melody spans the tonal range of D4 to D5, while the music follows the chord progression of Dm–F–Bb-C. Production was done by Perry's frequent collaborator, Dr. Luke. The song begins with Perry's somber and emotional delivery of the line, [...] "Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade." [...] At the bridge, the beat amplifies and Perry's lyrics become more aggressive as she commands [...] "Now Look at Me!", signalling to her ex that she is still strong, regardless of what he tries to do to bring her down. The beat reaches a peak at the chorus, and Perry's tone and the song's lyrics become more aggressive and prominent as she sings, [...] "This is the Part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me." [...] As the song continues, Perry's lyrics become strong and empowered: [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> diamond ring/ It don't mean nothing anyway/ In fact you can keep everything Yeah/ Yeah Except for me". Perry repeats the ending chorus as the beat fades.|$|E

60|$|I {{understand}} your position {{as stated in}} your letter and by General Marcy. To reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive within a month, or even six weeks, is impossible. In addition to that arrived and now arriving from the Potomac (about 10,000 men, I suppose), and about 10,000 I hope you will have from Burnside very soon, and about 5000 from Hunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within a month. Under these circumstances the defensive for the present must be your only care. Save the army first, where you are, if you can; secondly, by removal, if you must. You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which you will attempt, and of the means for effecting it. I but give it as my opinion that {{with the aid of}} the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned above you can hold your present position--provided, and so long as, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> James River open below you. If you are not tolerably confident <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> James River open, you had better remove as soon as possible. I do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as to the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you, yet I do not suppose it can have escaped your attention.|$|E
