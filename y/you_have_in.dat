Those {{were always the}} colors of Portugal, since Afonso Henriques, at Ourique, {{in the defense of}} our land against the Moors, until when D. Manuel II was king and {{maintained}} it against the African rebels in our dominions of Magul, Coolela, Cuamato and many other battles that illustrate our Portuguese army...When in 1910, Portugal abandoned the Blue and White, Portugal abandoned its history! And the people that abandoned their history are those people who fall and die.|$|E

Slayer and Hoglan would play Dark Angel songs during soundchecks, which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel. Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: [...] "He came up to me one day and started giving me his criticisms of the band. He said we needed to be more evil. And then he goes, 'By the way, I'm a better drummer than the guy <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> Dark Angel right now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rajeev Masand {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, calling it [...] "a barrel of non-stop laughs": [...] "It puts the fun {{back into the}} movies. You laugh harder than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> a long time. It’s a film with a one-point agenda – to entertain you while you’re in your seat. It achieves that, no two ways about it." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu noted [...] that Dostana [...] "largely reflects a society in transition and begins to address the issues of acceptance within the Indian framework of marriage": [...] "Dostana is great mass entertainment manipulating the inherent homophobia of a country {{on the threshold of}} change, but what’s significant is that it will bring parents and children together to share laughs over alternative sexuality and related issues that will no longer remain in the closet." ...|$|E

500|$|Henn {{revealed}} that {{he was drawn to}} [...] "Mulan's story [...] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, [...] "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across." [...] In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as [...] "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> any job. It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Warwick {{arrived at}} Le Havre in late October 1562. He was sceptical {{from the start}} as to the chances to hold Le Havre, writing: [...] "I fear [...] are too much abused in the good opinion <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the {{strength}} of this town". Elizabeth soon made it clear that she did not wish his army to engage in any active support for the Huguenot side, the purpose of the English contribution remaining somewhat obscure. In March 1563 the warring French agreed to a peace, while Elizabeth decided to hold on to Le Havre until Calais was returned to the English, as had been agreed with the Huguenot party. The reconciled French, however, turned jointly against the English garrison. Le Havre's fortifications would have needed major expansion and repair to withstand a prolonged siege. Still, Dudley tried his best until the town's walls were crumbling under French bombardment and the Queen permitted him to surrender honourably in July 1563 on account of the plague that was decimating his troops. Ambrose Dudley himself {{had been shot in the}} leg when parleying with the French and returned to England seriously ill. He wrote to his brother that he was happy [...] "rather to end my life upon the breach than in any sickness. ... Farewell my dear and loving brother, a thousand times." [...] Robert Dudley went to welcome him at Portsmouth despite the plague and much to Elizabeth's annoyance.|$|E

500|$|Because Witherspoon's {{father worked}} for the U.S. {{military}} in Wiesbaden, Germany, she lived there for four years as a child. After returning to the U.S., she spent her childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. Witherspoon was raised as an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the [...] "definitive Southern upbringing" [...] which she received. She said that it gave her [...] "a sense of family and tradition" [...] and taught her about [...] "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your life." [...] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected {{as a model for}} a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons. At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. Witherspoon received high grades in school, loved reading, and considered herself [...] "a big dork who read loads of books." [...] On mentioning her love for books, she said, [...] "I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything." [...] She {{has been described as a}} [...] "multi-achiever" [...] and was given the nickname [...] "Little Type A" [...] by her parents. Witherspoon attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader. She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major, [...] but left the school prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was also}} derided by {{opposing}} teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played, {{but also to}} spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribunes Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler {{let it be known}} that any striking players would be suspended. [...] "You will find that the friends that you think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," [...] threatened Chandler. [...] "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another." [...] Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, [...] "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune." ...|$|E

Cavill is the first British and non-American actor to play the character. He was previously cast in , which was ultimately shelved, and was considered for the role in the 2006 film Superman Returns, but lost to Brandon Routh. Cavill stated, [...] "There's a very real story behind the Superman character." [...] He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities – including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that, [...] "He's alone and there's no one like him," [...] referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. [...] "That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, and {{trying to find out what}} makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do you draw from? Where do you draw a limit with the power <b>you</b> <b>have?</b> <b>In</b> itself, that's an incredible weakness." [...] In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 calories a day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Joe Manganiello was considered for the role but could not work out an audition date for the casting director due to scheduling obligations with True Blood. Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9-year-old Clark Kent, and Dylan Sprayberry was cast as the 13-year-old Clark Kent.|$|E

Most women who lose a child would not go out and abduct one," [...] she told the Daily Mirror. [...] "But Ronnie is a soap character {{and she is not}} necessarily representing real life. Soap is based on controversy and sensationalism because bosses are trying to get high ratings and they can't write things like 'Ronnie had a cup of tea'. Otherwise people wouldn't watch it." [...] On 1 August 2011, Ofcom cleared the storyline. The baby swap storyline prompted a huge 1,044 complaints reported to Ofcom. Ofcom also added that many of the complaints were made because the storyline was presented [...] "in an offensive manner" [...] because it [...] "appeared to suggest that a mother who has suddenly and tragically lost a baby through cot death would react by stealing another baby to replace that loss". Kym Marsh supported Ofcom's decision to clear the storyline. Marsh wrote in her magazine section: [...] "Last week, EastEnders was cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom, the media regulator, over its baby swap storyline, and I think that's the right decision. It's just a storyline, like any other. I understand why people got upset about it, but no-one meant to upset anybody. Soaps are supposed to portray real life to a certain extent, but it's meant to be high drama for entertainment purposes. I mean, how many murders can <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> one square?
