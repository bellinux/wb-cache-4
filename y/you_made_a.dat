500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E

As commented by both Becky Bain of Idolator and Jennifer Still of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy, the [...] "powerful [...] emotional" [...] performance [...] "deservedly brought the judges to their feet". Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why I do this. People like you inspire me. <b>You</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> believer out of me. Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A.

500|$|The Victorian all-rounder then top-scored with 123 {{and took}} a total of 4/48 in a nine-wicket win in the {{intervening}} county match against Middlesex at Lord’s, and he retained {{his place in the}} side for the Fourth Test at Leeds. Loxton was not involved in the second inning effort in which the Australians scored 3/404 on the final day, a world record for a successful Test run-chase, but he had taken three of the last four wickets in England’s first innings of 496 and scored a hard-hitting 93 in the first innings, putting on 105 in 95 minutes with Harvey. Their counterattacking partnership helped Australia to halt the English momentum after an early collapse; the score was still 4/189 when Loxton came in to bat. He was particularly severe on Jim Laker, lifting his off breaks into the crowd for four of his five sixes, mostly from lofted drives. With a maiden Test century beckoning, the Victorian swung wildly at a Norman Yardley ball and was bowled. In the dressing room, Sir Robert Menzies, a Prime Minister of Australia well known as a cricket-lover, upbraided him, saying [...] "That was a pretty stupid thing to do. You could have made a century", to which the fallen batsman retorted, [...] "Haven’t <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> few mistakes in your time, too?" [...] Nevertheless, Australia eventually proceeded from 6/329 at the time of Loxton’s departure to end on 458, almost nullifying the effect of England’s strong first innings total.|$|E
500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E

He told Reuters: [...] "There was corruption {{associated with this}} contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior. We said that the company which <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> contract with is not well-regarded internationally {{in the field of}} explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device." [...] Al-Turehi said that the buying process had been [...] "marred by suspicions over the equipment and the efficiency and value of the contracts. There were senior officials involved in these transactions." [...] The initial investigation found that it could detect some bombs and the ministry went ahead with the contract despite al-Turehi's concerns. An unnamed Iraqi officer told the Agence France-Presse that [...] "We know it doesn't work and that it has been banned , but we are continuing to use it. It is bullshit. But still we are lying about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the novel, Lü Boshe was a sworn {{brother of}} Cao Cao's father, Cao Song, so Cao Cao {{regarded}} {{him as an}} uncle. Cao Cao and Chen Gong passed by Lü Boshe's house while {{they were on their}} way to Cao's home after Cao escaped from Luoyang following his failed attempt on Dong Zhuo's life. Lü Boshe gave them a warm reception and instructed his family and servants to treat the guests well while he travelled to town to purchase more items for a feast. During their stay in Lü Boshe's house, Cao Cao overheard the sharpening of knives and a conversation among Lü's servants about whether to [...] "kill or to tie up first". He suspected that Lü Boshe was pretending to be hospitable towards him while actually plotting to harm him. He and Chen Gong dashed out and indiscriminately killed everyone in Lü Boshe's household. Later, they discovered that the servants were actually talking about slaughtering a pig for the feast and that they had killed innocent people. It was too late to regret, so Cao Cao and Chen Gong immediately packed their belongings and left the house. Along the way, they met Lü Boshe, who was returning from his errand. When Lü Boshe asked them to stay, Cao Cao asked him, [...] "Who's that behind you?" [...] When Lü Boshe turned around, Cao Cao stabbed him from behind and killed him. Chen Gong was shocked and he questioned Cao Cao, [...] "Just now, <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> genuine mistake when you killed those people. But what about now?". Cao Cao replied, [...] "If Lü Boshe goes home and sees his family members all dead, do you think he'll let us off? If he brings soldiers to pursue us, we'll be in deep trouble." [...] Chen Gong said, [...] "It's a grave sin to kill someone with the intention of doing so." [...] Cao Cao remarked, [...] "I'd rather do wrong to the world than allow the world to do wrong to me." [...] (寧教我負天下人，休教天下人負我) Chen Gong did not respond and he left Cao Cao that night.|$|E
