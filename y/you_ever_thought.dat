500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following an {{extended}} hiatus, the Yuppie Pricks released their third full-length disc in 2008, Balls, on Chicken Ranch Records, an album where [...] "the irony drips like bacon fat," [...] "to negate everything <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> about punk," [...] and which [...] "recontextualizes classics from punk’s ever-growing classic history (Buzzcocks, Big Boys! etc.) and creates new oil guzzling and FOX news approved republican punk anthems." [...] Once again, the Yuppie Pricks dipped into their decidedly un-punk past to parody the Black Crowes' infamous Amorica album, featuring their own male-enhanced {{take on the}} 70's-era Hustler-inspired cover art, and landing them in the October 2008 issue of Blender Magazine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approval}} {{came after}} nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the {{executive vice president of}} Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. [...] Trevino later recalled: [...] "I went up to Wallenda and said ‘Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> about walking across the falls?’ and he said, ‘ever since I was a little kid,’ and then he asked about the steps involved." [...] Wallenda later remarked [...] "I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously because you just never know [...] ". [...] Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. [...] After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti-stunting laws. [...] Dennis H. Gabryszak co-sponsored the bill, and it passed the State Senate and Assembly nearly unanimously. [...] The bill was signed into law by governor Andrew Cuomo on September 23, 2011.|$|E

This spirit of bondage, this slavish terror, instead of bringing us nearer to God, only drives us farther from Him.
