25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, {{and if there were}} fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay <b>your</b> <b>bill,</b> people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.|$|E
500|$|Undaunted {{by these}} rebukes from {{prominent}} West Virginian politicians, Johnson remained the leading advocate {{for a state}} institution for the blind. With help from friends and other educated blind people, he was granted {{the use of the}} legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates to present an exhibition of [...] "music, [...] recitation, and class drill" [...] with a delegation including his brother James and blind educator Susan Ridenour. Johnson's exhibition attracted a large audience, and after the performance he delivered an impassioned plea to West Virginia lawmakers to establish a state school for West Virginia's blind youth. The exhibition and Johnson's speech were praised by the legislators, most notably Joseph Wheat (who had previously rebuffed his proposal). The day before Johnson's presentation, Wheat declared his opposition to the bill and advocated its defeat; after Johnson's speech he [...] "pressed up to [...] and grasping his hand, said earnestly, 'Johnson, I'll vote for <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> if it costs a hundred thousand dollars.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} inevitably arises: [...] Did the writ subpoena {{develop in}} the Court of Eyre, or in the Court of Chancery? [...] There were writs of a somewhat similar nature {{to be found in}} both courts. [...] Bills (writs of complaints) were the method by which a litigant could make his story known in the courts of 13th and 14th century England. [...] Because novel fact patterns frequently emerged, there was a tendency to become creative in the writing of bills of complaint and writs. [...] Against this novelty, was a strong reaction, wanting to keep the number of writs to a minimum. [...] An example is seen from the time of Edward II of England: [...] in 1310–1311 John Soke, a litigant appearing in person before the Common Bench, exclaimed in great frustration, [...] "For God's sake, can I have a writ to attaint this fraud?" [...] Judge Stanton replied, [...] "Make <b>your</b> <b>bill</b> and you shall have what the court can allow." [...] This illustrates the great flexibility of the writing of writs to conform to the changing fact situations as they varied from case to case. [...] At that time, a plaintiff who sued by bill was not liable to fail for defects {{in the form of a}} bill, provided the bill told an intelligible and consistent story.|$|E
