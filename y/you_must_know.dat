5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>know</b> that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E

2500|$|The art {{historian}} Jean Clay said Ingres [...] "proceeded always from certitude to certitude, {{with the result}} that even his freest sketches reveal the same kind of execution as that found in the final works." [...] Abhorring the visible brushstroke, Ingres made no recourse to the shifting effects of colour and light on which the Romantic school depended; he preferred local colours only faintly modelled in light by half tones. [...] "Ce que l'on sait," [...] he would repeat, [...] "il faut le savoir l'épée à la main." [...] ("Whatever you know, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>know</b> it with sword in hand.") Ingres thus left himself without the means of producing the necessary unity of effect when dealing with crowded compositions, such as the Apotheosis of Homer and the Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian. Among Ingres's historical and mythological paintings, the most satisfactory are usually those depicting one or two figures, such as Oedipus, The Half-Length Bather, Odalisque, and The Spring, subjects only animated by the consciousness of perfect physical well-being.|$|E

2500|$|Gray was a keen {{student of}} medieval history, {{and in time}} came to make a {{particular}} study of the oldest Welsh poetry, though without actually learning the language. [...] Several pages of his commonplace books are devoted to notes on Welsh prosody, and he also mentioned there a legend, now considered quite unhistorical, which he had come across in Thomas Carte's A General History of England (1747–1755). [...] When Edward I conquered Wales, [...] "he is said", wrote Gray, [...] "to have hanged up all their Bards, because they encouraged the Nation to rebellion, but their works (we see), still remain, the Language (tho' decaying) still lives, {{and the art of}} their versification is known, and practised to this day among them". [...] Gray also studied early Scandinavian literature, and found in one Old Norse poem the refrain [...] "'Vindum vindum/ Vef Darradar'", which was to reappear in The Bard as [...] "Weave the warp and weave the woof". [...] In 1755 he began work on The Bard, and by August of that year had completed two thirds of the poem. [...] Initially he worked with a speed and a sense of identification that were both unusual for him. [...] "I felt myself the Bard", he declared. [...] But composing the third and final strophe proved more difficult, and he eventually ground to a halt. [...] For two years the poem remained unfinished, but then in 1757 he attended a concert by John Parry, a blind harpist who claimed that the traditional Welsh harp repertoire went back as far as the druids. [...] Gray was so inspired by this experience that he returned to The Bard with new enthusiasm, and was soon able to tell his friend William Mason, [...] "Mr Parry, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>know,</b> has set my Ode in motion again, and has brought it at last to a conclusion." [...] Gray sold the copyright of this poem and of his [...] "The Progress of Poesy" [...] to the publisher Robert Dodsley for 40 guineas, and Dodsley issued them together under the title Odes by Mr. Gray. [...] The book was printed by Gray's friend Horace Walpole who had just set up a printing press at his home, Strawberry Hill, and who had set his heart on inaugurating the enterprise with Gray's poems. [...] The Odes were published on 8 August 1757 as a handsome quarto, with a print run of 2000 copies priced at one shilling. [...] Walpole prevailed on Gray to add four footnotes to The Bard for the first edition, though Gray told Walpole, [...] "I do not love notes…They are signs of weakness and obscurity. [...] If a thing cannot be understood without them, it had better not be understood at all." [...] These proved, for many readers, inadequate to explain the poem, and Gray complacently wrote to Mason [...] "nobody understands me, and I am perfectly satisfied." [...] Rather against his will, he was persuaded to add a few more notes for the 1768 edition.|$|E
