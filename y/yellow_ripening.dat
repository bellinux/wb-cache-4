40|$|In {{improving}} fishpond water, constructed {{wetlands and}} multi-function ecological system generally are used, these methods improve fishpond water quality by surface flow and need a high cost in facilities’ construction and operation so that affect {{them to be}} widely extended in the production practice. Aiming at the solution, an experimental study was made that paddy field was used for purifying fishpond water, the results showed that: 1) the improvement of aquaculture water by surface flow in the paddy field is related with growth period, effects in water quality improvement are best in the heading stage of rice, weakest in the <b>yellow</b> <b>ripening</b> stage; 2) the removal rate of some nutrients has {{a close relationship with}} their initial concentration in irrigated water from fishpond, the distance and velocity of the water flowing on paddy surface. The most significant efficiency on removal rate is flow path. So when the paddy field surface flow is used for water purification, the flow path should be considered firstly; 3) the paddy field surface flow has an oxygen-enriched function in certain amount of the aquaculture water, which is beneficial for aquaculture...|$|E

5000|$|Guineos (pronounced [...] ) usually {{refers to}} a ripe banana. The term guineo is {{sometimes}} used in reference to its <b>ripened</b> counterpart: the <b>yellow</b> (<b>ripened)</b> banana. Etymology of the word Guineo comes from Guinea, a country in the west of Africa, as {{it is one of}} the places from which bananas originate. Some make a distinction between the two and refer to green bananas as guineos verdes (green bananas) and yellow bananas as guineos (ripe bananas).|$|R

40|$|Rice is main staple crop of the world. Growing rice in flooded water entails methane (CH 4) emission. CH 4 {{is one of}} {{greenhouse}} gases contributing to global warming. The experiment aimed to clarify the influence of fertilizer and water management on total methane emission (TME), methane mitigation and rice yields (RY). The experimental design was a split - split plot with 3 replications taking 2 cultivation in main plots, transplanting (TP) rice and direct-wet seeding (DWS) rice fields; 2 basal fertilizers, 16 - 16 - 8, 20 kg/rai and chicken manure pallet (CMP), 105 kg/rai in sub plots; and 3 top dressing fertilizers 1) none, 2) urea (46 % N), 15 kg/rai and 3) ammonium sulfate (AS, 21 % N), 30 kg/rai in sub-sub plots. It also examined relationship between quantity of paddy-soil water, TME and RY of both cultivations. Methane emission rate (MER) occurred during the whole growth period and was characterized by 2 large peaks: one from after transplanting or broadcasting to maximum tillering stage and the other from flowering to <b>yellow</b> <b>ripening</b> stage. Rapid declines of MER were dictated by soil aeration recognized as 3 - 5 days cracks. In TP rice plot based with CMP, 105 kg/rai, topped with AS, 30 kg/rai, TME decreased to 73. 0 % and RY increased to 14. 7 % over that of untreated plots with top dressing fertilizer, while in that topped with urea, 15 kg/rai, TME decreased to 68. 9 % and RY increased to 16. 9 %. In all of DWS rice plots which were topped with AS or urea, declines of TME ranged from 27. 3 to 56. 4 % and increase of RY ranged from 31. 3 to 47. 9 % over those without top dressing. In both TP and DWS plots, TMEs were closely correlated with the quantity of paddy-soil water (r = 0. 83 and 0. 86, respectively) and with submergence days (r = 0. 94 and 0. 89, respectively). Hence, saturated condition in paddy soil is a primary factor for methanogenesis. Moreover, for TP rice, the relationship between TME and RY was weakly positive (r = 0. 16), whereas that for DWS rice was obviously negative (r = - 0. 65). DWS rice cultivation could provide high RY and mitigated methane emission. In addition to this, the quantity of paddy-soil water was negatively related with RY (r = - 0. 077), indicating that DWS cultivation was able to mitigate methane emission, produce high RY and reduce water use...|$|E

5000|$|The fruit first {{shows signs}} of {{ripening}} by its bottommost scales becoming <b>yellowed.</b> As it <b>ripens,</b> the starch that was stored in the green fruit is converted to sugar, giving it its sweet flavor. This mechanism is comparable to how banana fruits ripen. The strong odor the fruit produces becomes noticeable when it is half-ripe. As time passes and the fruit continues to ripen, the odor becomes stronger. After it becomes fully ripe, however, the scent deteriorates quickly.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{cultivar}} (cultivated variety) of {{the species}} Pyrus communis, {{commonly known as the}} European Pear.
