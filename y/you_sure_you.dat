He stated: [...] "I'm pretty sure the world don't know we actually produced Candy Shop together. I produced it with him (Storch) ... Scott called me like 50 times, 100 times: 'Yo, <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't want to use it? 50 Cent called me. 50 Cent want it.' I {{never had a problem}} with this dude. I was like, 'Go ahead.'" [...] When writing the song, 50 Cent stated: [...] "I attempted to be as sexual as possible, from a male perspective, without being vulgar or obscene".|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{surprised}} at the length of [...] "A Farewell to Arms" [...] and [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent" [...] running over ten minutes, and wondered if their fans would [...] "be able to get their heads around" [...] what the band was doing. Record company Roadrunner Records hesitated the band's decision to open the album with a ten and a half minute song ("Clenching the Fists of Dissent"), and asked the band questions similar to [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don’t want to get into something a little more direct?" [...] The band disregarded the comment and believed the song set the tone musically {{for the remainder of the}} album.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by her divorce from Bush lead singer, Gavin Rossdale; Stefani wrote several songs during these recording sessions to start [...] "a new chapter in her life". In an interview with Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani stated {{that the majority of}} her recent studio work would discuss her breakup with Rossdale. Billboard stated that the lyrics [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> wanna love me? / I know that it's a lot to handle me / But {{it is what it is}} / It's all part of my broken history" [...] were [...] "ultra personal". In his description of the track, Glenn Gamboa of Newsday stated that [...] "'Asking 4 It' strikes at the heart of pop radio" [...] while Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media described [...] "Asking 4 It" [...] as [...] "the album's sole feature atop an unconvincing beat." [...] Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter felt that the album's [...] "sound cools down a little", but that the track [...] "is still easy to dance to".|$|E

On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of KIRO, a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> want to do this?", and said [...] "Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central’s message about feeling afraid." [...] The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the South Park creators, but also to support the {{right to free speech}} under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She also said, [...] "it's a cartoonist's job to be non-PC." [...] On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.|$|E
2500|$|Nikkatsu {{had started}} its SM line of Roman porno films in 1974 with the hits Flower and Snake and Wife to Be Sacrificed both {{featuring}} actress Naomi Tani {{and directed by}} Masaru Konuma. After this first highly successful venture into sexual violence, the studio's output became increasingly rougher. According to director Yasuharu Hasebe, by 1976 the studio {{was looking for a}} new direction, and contacted him to develop films in a new style to be called [...] "Violent Pink". These would be comparable to the U.S. [...] "roughies" [...] film genre, violent and misogynistic, but without the whips, bondage and other traditional accoutrements of the S genre. Hasebe had worked with the studio in the 1960s during their [...] "Nikkatsu Action" [...] era, but was not comfortable with the pink film genre to which the studio had turned with the inception of the Roman porno series in 1971. Reluctant to work in the sex film genre, Hasebe later recalled warning the studio, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> want me?... You must be aware-- my craft is very bloody." ...|$|E

I don't know {{anything}} else about it. So I go to plead into drug court. My dad's in the court room. Judge Barton was on the bench that day instead of Judge Williams. She was gone. My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, [...] "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> want to do this?" [...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.|$|E

2500|$|The {{song was}} then {{reworked}} by Nolan Lambroza who increased its tempo. Initially, {{there was no}} plan for the song to feature another artist. A fan of hip hop, Gomez felt constrained from incorporating the genre and collaborating with rappers on her previous released due to her age and young fanbase. However, for her second album, she reconsidered. Also a fan of R, the singer noticed that [...] "Good for You" [...] shared similarities to the genres, specifically in tempo and {{felt that it was}} the sound the song should have. At the time, she was also a fan of rapper ASAP Rocky's 2015 album At. Long. Last. A$AP — whose love she cited as [...] "influent" [...] in her decision to collaborate with him —, and thought [...] "Good for You" [...] had a vibe that was suited to Rocky's music. The rapper's participation happened organically; Gomez texted Rocky and sent him the song after receiving his contact details through Lambroza and her management. Rocky responded positively, having [...] "literally loved" [...] it and recording a verse the next day at Downtown Studios in New York City, New York. His vocals were produced by frequent collaborator Hector Delgado. This was the first time Gomez had collaborated with a rapper on one of her tracks. She also insisted that Rocky should experiment with the song beyond a rap verse. Consequently, he and Delgado co-produced it and added beats, instruments, as well additional bass and snares. Although this is a pop song, Rocky still used the same production process from his music. In an interview for MTV News, he explained: [...] "You just go in. Go for the kill. I mean, it wasn't the type of song you try to go into... It was just like me telling her, <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> wanna go here with me? I gotta change the beat. I gotta talk my shit. My jiggy shit". Talking about Rocky's contribution, Gomez said: [...] "I was totally prepared for a 'No, I'm good, thank you', it was so great and he changed some of the production of the song, which made it better, and I let him have like full-on freedom with everything, it was really fun".|$|E
