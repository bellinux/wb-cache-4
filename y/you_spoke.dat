500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E

Beginning the procedure, Lois objects to Dr. Hartman's method of embryonic insertion. In response, he replies, [...] "Well, {{perhaps you could}} tell them—if only <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> Hovitos," [...] a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Later, {{in an attempt to}} cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of Grey's Anatomy DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the [...] "Acme Miscarriage Kit", a boxing glove attached to a crossbow. In a reference to the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Peter ultimately ends up missing with the crossbow, causing the glove to bounce and hit a large rock and land inches in front of him as he is standing on a narrow cliff. The ground then drops out from underneath his feet, causing him to fall like Wile E. Coyote.|$|E

2500|$|With Nanavati {{frequently}} away {{on assignments}} {{for long periods}} of time, Sylvia fell in love with Prem Bhagwan Ahuja, a Sindhi friend of Nanavati's. In her testimony in court, Prem's sister Mamie Ahuja, stated that Prem had agreed to marry Sylvia, provided she divorced her husband. However, this was contradicted by the letters written by Sylvia (admitted as Sylvia's testimony), where she expressed her desire to divorce Nanavati and marry Prem, but she doubted whether Prem had the same intentions. In a letter dated 24 May 1960, she wrote [...] "Last night when <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> of your marrying me and the various other girls you might marry, something inside me snapped and I knew I could not bear the thought of your loving someone else…".|$|E
2500|$|The Judge {{noted that}} some people in Norfolk were [...] opposed to the law, and [...] chided her for 'the indiscreet freedom with which <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> of the colored race in general'. 'Such {{opinions}} I regard as manifestly mischievous.' he said. The Church officials, he said, were allowed to instruct the children because [...] religious instruction is necessary for black people. [...] Black literacy, however, is dangerous. [...] He described the law as [...] a [...] "matter of self-defense against Northern anti-slavery agitators who clog the mail with anti-slavery pamphlets. to be distributed among Southern Negroes to induce them to cut our throats," [...] and who [...] "scattered pocket handkerchiefs around with anti-slavery engravings to work upon the feelings and ignorance of our negroes, who otherwise would remain comfortable and happy". [...] He [...] also admonished her for speaking directly and honestly in her own defense [...] instead of hiring an attorney, which would have allowed her case [...] to [...] have been presented in a [...] "far more favorable light'. [...] Her 'bold and open opposition', he said, [...] "is a matter not to be slightly regarded' and [...] "something more substantial is required in this case" [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me, Charlie, {{about that}} uncle of whom <b>you</b> once <b>spoke</b> to me--long ago--in rather disrespectful tones, if not terms. Was he rich?" ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{the general}} He Jin rose {{to power in}} 189 and became regent to the child Emperor Shao, he {{recruited}} over 20 notable members of scholar-gentry background to join the civil service. Xun You was one of them. He was appointed as a [...] "Gentleman of the Yellow Gate" [...] (黃門侍郎) in the imperial capital, Luoyang. However, within the same year, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuch faction led by the Ten Attendants. The warlord Dong Zhuo {{took advantage of the}} ensuing political turmoil to hijack and control the central government. Between 190 and 191, several regional warlords formed a coalition and launched a campaign against Dong Zhuo in the name of saving the emperor. Dong Zhuo ordered Luoyang to be burnt down and relocated the capital to Chang'an. In Chang'an, Xun You secretly plotted with Zheng Tai (鄭泰), He Yong, Chong Ji (种輯) and Wu Qiong (伍瓊) to assassinate Dong Zhuo, who was notorious for his cruelty and tyranny. However, they were discovered and Xun You was arrested and imprisoned. While he was incarcerated, Xun <b>You</b> <b>spoke</b> and behaved normally as though nothing had happened. He was only released after Dong Zhuo was killed in 192. However, the Wei Shu mentioned that Xun You was released after he sent someone to persuade and convince Dong Zhuo to free him.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not. Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately wanted to ask Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted me to help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E

"And yet, sir, I {{know that}} I could be {{faithful}} and true {{to anyone who}} would not treat me like a dog. <b>You</b> <b>spoke</b> kindly {{to me in the}} stable, and gave me a crown. No one had ever given me a crown before. But I cared less for that than for the way <b>you</b> <b>spoke.</b> Then I saw you start, and <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> pleasantly to your men; and I said to myself, 'that is the master I would serve, if he would let me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the {{discretion}} <b>you</b> just <b>spoke</b> of," [...] said the Duchess. [...] "Only I should have {{expected from the}} cause you refer to rather the comic effect." ...|$|R

"That night," [...] {{she murmured}} softly, [...] "you spoke as a hunted man; <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> as one {{at war with}} Society; <b>you</b> <b>spoke</b> as one who proposes almost a {{campaign}} against it. When you took your rooms here and called yourself Peter Ruff, it was rather in your mind to aid the criminal than to detect the crime. Fate seems to have decreed otherwise. Why, I wonder?" ...|$|E
