Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure {{it was not that}} of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in the water of Belstead Brook at Thorpe's Hill, near Hintlesham, {{by a member of}} the public on 2 December 2006. The body, later identified as 25-year-old Gemma Adams, had not been sexually assaulted. Six days later, on 8 December, the body of 19-year-old Tania Nicol, a friend of Adams who had been missing since 30 October, was {{discovered in}} water at Copdock Mill just outside Ipswich. There was no evidence of sexual assault. On 10 December, a third victim, found {{by a member of the}} public in an area of woodland by the A14 road near Nacton, was later identified as 24-year-old Anneli Alderton. According to a police statement, she had been asphyxiated and was about three months pregnant when she died.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often stayed at home. If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. The ideal of the chaste, modest, and pious <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it. This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, the St. Francis was {{the scene}} of Hollywood's first great scandal. The silent film comedian Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle, whose fame at the time rivaled that of Charlie Chaplin, and a number of friends were guests in rooms 1219, 1220 and 1221. On September 5, 1921, they had a party in their suite, with friends and acquaintances from Hollywood. One guest was a young actress from Hollywood named Virginia Rappe. In mid-afternoon Arbuckle summoned a house doctor and {{reported}} that Virginia Rappe was sick, and the <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> taken to another room and put to bed. Arbuckle himself went to a personal appearance at a movie theater, and returned to Hollywood the next day.|$|E
25|$|An interracial {{relationship}} between {{one of the}} Packer rookies and a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to the attention}} of Lombardi by Packer veterans in his first training camp in Green Bay. The next day at training camp, Lombardi, who had a zero tolerance policy towards racism, responded by warning his team that if any player exhibited prejudice, in any manner, then that player would be thrown off the team. Lombardi, who was vehemently opposed to Jim Crow discrimination, let it be known to all Green Bay establishments that if they did not accommodate his black players equally as well as his white players, then that business would be off-limits to the entire team. Before the start of the 1960 regular season, he instituted a policy that the Packers would only lodge in places that accepted all his players. In addition Lombardi refused to assign hotel rooms to players based on their race: by 1967 the Packers were the only team with such a policy. In the all-white Oneida Golf and Riding Country club in Green Bay, of which Lombardi was a member, Lombardi demanded that he should be allowed to choose a Native American caddie, even if white caddies were available. Lombardi's view on racial matters was a result of his religious faith and the prejudice he had experienced as an Italian-American.|$|E

25|$|John's {{marriage}} {{was never a}} happy one. Rumors circulated that {{at the age of}} 25 {{he fell in love with}} Eugênia José de Menezes, his wife's chaperone. She became pregnant, and John was suspected of being the father. The case was hushed up, and the <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> sent to Spain to bear the child. She gave birth to a daughter, whose name is unknown. The mother lived the rest of her life in nunneries and John supported her economically. Historians Tobias Monteiro and Patrick Wilcken write that there are indications that John also had a homosexual relationship as a sexual outlet, given his disastrous marriage, in which he lived apart from his wife, with whom he was together only on ceremonial occasions. His partner in this relationship would have been his favorite manservant, Francisco José Rufino de Sousa Lobato, who, according to these historians, may have regularly masturbated his master. While it may have been out of sheer malice, a priest named Miguel stated that he once stumbled upon the scene and therefore was deported to Angola, but not before leaving written testimony. Regardless of the truth or falsity of the claim, Rufino de Sousa received a variety of honors, accumulating among others the charges of adviser to the king, secretary of the Casa do Infantado, secretary of the Bureau of Conscience and Orders (Mesa de Consciência e Ordens) and governor of the Santa Cruz fortress. He also received the title of Baron and later Viscount of Vila Nova da Rainha.|$|E

[...] Susannah Wells used the opportunity to ask how long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall [...] "They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> brought in". [...] Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. [...] Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held. [...] Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say [...] "Wills or Wells", as did Robert Scarrat, a hartshorn-rasper and previously a servant in nearby Edmonton who had visited Wells's house on previous occasions.|$|E

[...] He noted that the trip to Hokkaido was taken on a whim, and during the trip the team realized that daylight would be {{gone by the time}} they would reach their intended destination, so they exited the train at Asari and took what would become the final shot of the video there.|$|E
