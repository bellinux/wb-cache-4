500|$|Hann {{says that}} when writers deal with [...] "upmarket" [...] readership, they [...] "need {{to be able to}} justify your coverage, and that [...] thinkpieces hailing the {{cultural}} significance of the new pop stars. ... And once you've decided these subjects matter, it's hard to turn round and say: 'Actually, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>This</b> isn't much cop.'" [...] He recalls his experience as music editor for The Guardian, where he has [...] "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one wanted to read about Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, we enter an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russian {{writer and}} philosopher Leo Tolstoy was greatly {{influenced}} by Schopenhauer. After reading Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation, Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and {{a whole series of}} spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer" ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>This</b> is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Master {{caught me}} by the shoulder, held me at arm's length, and still {{addressing}} his brother: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> means?" [...] said he.|$|E

60|$|STREPHON. But <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> {{means to}} me. It {{means that you}} are dying to me: yes, just dying. Listen to me [he {{puts his arm around}} her].|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, sir," [...] {{said the}} man, leaning down {{his head as}} low as {{possible}} from his elevated seat, and speaking in a hushed voice, [...] "you are a real gentleman. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> all <b>this</b> is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> means, Hans," [...] {{answered}} Tom, who {{was bound}} {{to have a little}} fun in spite of the seriousness of the situation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{is silly}} again,' said Frau Ebermann. 'It {{is no good}} for you to wait here. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> place is? You have been to school? It is Berlin, the capital of Germany.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had once," [...] was Edith's reply, [...] "before I {{came to live}} here. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> {{house is}} for me, with its gilded mirrors, its couches, its soft carpets? Do you know what I am, and have been for two years?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{a hero in}} her eyes? I {{was really}} not aware of that fact," [...] said Stangrave, more coldly than ever; for bitter jealousy had taken {{possession}} of his heart. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> then, <b>what</b> <b>this</b> same obligation may be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! is it you, Gervaise?" [...] Harcourt exclaimed, with a {{start of}} surprise. [...] "Why, I did not <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> though I looked hard at you in the torch light.

6000|$|... "I guess <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is," [...] he remarked. [...] "The fuse {{is pretty}} short and there's {{a stick of}} giant-powder {{at the end of}} it.

6000|$|... "'Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is?' he asked. 'Do you {{remember}} what I said to you at Thorpe Ambrose about Allan's Dream?

Umayyah b. Khalaf. The Messenger of God would say to him. [...] "Say: O people, the Messenger of God says, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> month <b>this</b> is?" [...] and they would say, [...] "The sacred month." [...] Then he would say, [...] "Say to them: God has made your blood and your {{property}} sacrosanct until you meet your Lord, like the sanctity of this month of yours." [...] Then he said him, [...] "Say: the Messenger of God says, O people, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> land <b>this</b> is?"

6000|$|After Mr. Longways had finished, he smacked {{his lips}} and set down his glass with a great air.

6000|$|... 'What is it, George? I hope it {{is nothing}} serious.' Madame Voss as she said this looked at Marie, but Marie had turned her face away. George also looked at her, but could not see her countenance. He did not dare {{to ask her to}} give him an {{interview}} alone; nor had he quite determined what he would say to her if they were together. 'Marie,' said Madame Voss, 'do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is about?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Such {{measure of}} {{response}} {{as he had}} good-naturedly given her was the mere frayed edge of a mastering detachment, the copious, impatient range elsewhere of his true attention. Somehow, however, he still seemed kind even while, turning his back upon her, he moved off to {{look at one of}} the several, the famous Dedborough pictures--stray specimens, by every presumption, lost a little in the whole bright bigness. [...] "'Conclude'?" [...] he echoed as he approached a significantly small canvas. [...] "You ladies want to get there before the road's so much as laid or the country's safe! Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> here is?" [...] he at once went on.|$|E

6000|$|By {{the time}} that Wildeve reached her name the blankness with which he had read {{the first half of}} the letter {{intensified}} to mortification.

5000|$|In the 1891 {{postscript}} to The Civil War in France (1872) pamphlet, Friedrich Engels said: [...] "Well and good, gentlemen, do <b>you</b> want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> dictatorship looks like?

6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} {{something}} under my mantle," [...] said Tito, smiling; and throwing off the large loose garment, {{he showed the}} little tabernacle which had been painted by Piero di Cosimo. The painter had carried out Tito's intention charmingly, and so far had atoned for his long delay. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is for, my Romola?" [...] added Tito, taking her by the hand, and leading her towards the cabinet. [...] "It is a little shrine, which is to hide away from you for ever that remembrancer of sadness.

6000|$|... "Look! Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is?" [...] With a {{dramatic}} gesture she flung back {{the left side}} of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge. It was extremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of it--indeed, it would have been fatal for Tuppence's plans, since the badge in question was the device of a local training corps originated by the archdeacon {{in the early days of}} the war. Its presence in Tuppence's coat was due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a day or two before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner of a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert's pocket, and the immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good, and that the fish would rise to the bait.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear fellow,' said Macfarlane, 'what a boy you are! What harm HAS {{come to you}}? What harm CAN come to you if {{you hold}} your tongue? Why, man, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> life is? There are two squads of us - the lions and the lambs. If you're a lamb, you'll come to lie upon these tables like Gray or Jane Galbraith; if you're a lion, you'll live and drive a horse like me, like K-, like all the world with any wit or courage. You're {{staggered}} at the first. But look at K-! My dear fellow, you're clever, you have pluck. I like you, and K- likes you.

"Look here," [...] he said, [...] "you {{all come}} up {{asking the same}} {{question}} and wasting my time answering you all severally. <b>You</b> want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> place means.

6000|$|... "Bushrod," [...] said Mr. Robert, {{in a lower}} voice than {{he usually}} employed, [...] "you have overstepped all bounds.

Why, Coney during Mardi Gras is the {{greatest}} thing on earth. It's a knockout. Just about a million boys and girls having the best time that ever was.
