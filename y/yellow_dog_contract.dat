40|$|The {{three decades}} {{spanning}} the years 1908 to 1937 saw a remarkable {{transformation of the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence concerning the rights of workers to organize. In 1908, the Court held that a federal law prohibiting employers from discharging an employee because of his membership in a labor union violated the liberty of contract secured to the employer by the Fifth Amendment. In 1915, the Court similarly declared a state statute prohibiting the use of 2 ̆ 2 yellow-dog 2 ̆ 2 contracts unconstitutional. In 1937, by contrast, the Court upheld provisions of the Wagner Act prohibiting both discharges for union membership {{and the use of}} yellow-dog contracts. Thus, the doctrine of 2 ̆ 2 liberty of contract 2 ̆ 2 no longer operated as a bar to legislation protecting the rights of workers to organize for purposes of collective bargaining. The tale of the yellow-dog contract is naturally of interest because of its centrality to the development of American labor law and the decline of substantive due process. Beyond this, however, the story {{can be seen as a}} critical chapter in the development of American liberal legalism. The yellow-dog contract provoked something of a crisis in liberal discourse, because it brought into conflict two time-honored liberal values: liberty of contract and freedom of association. Recent scholarship has shown how 2 ̆ 2 liberty of contract 2 ̆ 2 was forged from such diverse liberal resources as Adam Smith 2 ̆ 7 s liberal political economy, Jacksonian liberalism, and the Northern 2 ̆ 2 free labor 2 ̆ 2 ideology that animated the abolitionist movement. Freedom of association enjoyed no less venerable liberal pedigree. Its protection against government infringement enshrined in the First Amendment, the freedom to affiliate with the lawful organizations of one 2 ̆ 7 s choice had been a widely embraced feature of American culture since well before the Civil War. Indeed, the passion of the American people for voluntary associations had attracted the fascination of Alexis de Tocqueville during his journey to the United States in the 1830 s. The yellow-dog contract exposed a tension between these two values of American liberalism. Opponents of the yellow-dog contract contended that the employer was using his constitutionally protected liberty of contract as a means to inhibit his employee 2 ̆ 7 s freedom to associate with his fellow workingmen. In characteristically liberal terms, the answer to this charge would turn on whether the employee was seen as having surrendered his freedom of association voluntarily, or as a product of coercion. The answer to this question would in turn depend upon assumptions about the structure of the labor market, and these assumptions would change over time. Beneath this discourse, I believe, lay concerns about whether labor unions were properly analogized to the other sorts of voluntary associations celebrated by American liberalism. As those concerns became increasingly allayed over time, labor 2 ̆ 7 s advocates could more successfully appropriate the liberal rhetoric of associational freedom. Yet the story of the demise of the <b>yellow</b> <b>dog</b> <b>contract</b> cannot be adequately understood by looking at cultural context alone. In order to understand the voting patterns of the various Justices and the views they expressed in their opinions, one must pay close attention to the development of doctrine. A study of the doctrine pertaining to the yellow-dog contract reveals to us the difficulties with the notion that substantive due process and constitutional federalism were merely convenient weapons in the arsenal of a reactionary Court devoted to the maintenance of financial and industrial elites. Instead, we may see the weblike, interconnected structure of 2 ̆ 2 laissez-faire constitutionalism. 2 ̆ 2 The doctrinal manifestations of Commerce Clause and due process jurisprudence were not simply free-floating rules that could be changed or abandoned without consequences extending beyond the particular doctrine involved. These areas of doctrine were developmentally intra- and interdependent. Modifications of one substantive due process doctrine entailed changes in another; developments in due process and Commerce Clause doctrine produced mutual, synergistic ramifications. In short, doctrinal commitments made by Justices in one area of doctrine entailed corresponding commitments in other doctrinal domains. In order to follow the trail of the <b>yellow</b> <b>dog</b> <b>contract,</b> we must trace these ripple effects across structurally related areas of doctrine...|$|E

5000|$|On January 26, 1921, {{the trial}} of Sid Hatfield for killing Albert Felts began. This trial was in the {{national}} spotlight, and it brought {{much attention to the}} miners' cause. Hatfield's stature and mythical status grew as the trial proceeded. Sid Hatfield posed and talked to reporters, fanning the flames of his own stature and legend. All men were acquitted in the end, but overall the union was facing significant setbacks. Eighty percent of mines had reopened with the importation of replacements and the signing of <b>yellow</b> <b>dog</b> <b>contracts</b> by ex-strikers returning to mines. In mid-May 1921, union miners launched a full assault on nonunion mines. In a short time, the conflict had consumed the entire Tug River Valley. This [...] "Three Days Battle" [...] was finally ended by a flag of truce and the implementation of martial law. From the beginning, the miners perceived the enforcement of martial law as being one-sided. Hundreds of miners were arrested; the smallest of infractions could mean imprisonment, while those {{on the other side of}} this 'law and order' were seen as immune. The miners responded with guerrilla tactics and violence.|$|R

Beginning with the territorial justices and continuing through the late twentieth century, R. Alton Lee covers the dispossession of Native Americans’ land, the growth and impact of labor unions, antimonopoly cases against railroad and mining companies, a nine-year state ban on the movie Birth of a Nation, and implications and effects of desegregation, as well as the shooting of Dr. George Tiller for performing legal abortions.

5000|$|First, in {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century, federal courts used {{injunctions}} to break strikes by unions. For example, after the United States government successfully used an injunction to outlaw the Pullman boycott in 1894 in In re Debs, employers found that they could obtain federal court injunctions to ban strikes and organizing activities of all kinds by unions. These injunctions were often extremely broad; one injunction issued by a federal court in the 1920s effectively barred the United Mine Workers of America from talking to workers who had signed <b>yellow</b> <b>dog</b> <b>contracts</b> with their employers. Unable to limit what they called [...] "government by injunction" [...] in the courts, labor and its allies persuaded the United States Congress in 1932 to pass the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which imposed so many procedural and substantive limits on the federal courts' power to issue injunctions that it effectively prohibited federal court from issuing injunctions in cases arising out of labor disputes. A number of states followed suit and enacted [...] "Little Norris-LaGuardia Acts" [...] that imposed similar limitations on state courts' powers. The courts have since recognized a limited exception to the Norris-LaGuardia Act's strict limitations in those cases in which a party seeks injunctive relief to enforce the grievance arbitration provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.|$|R
40|$|In {{my master}} thesis I {{focus on the}} effect of World War 1 on labour unions power in the United States of America. The goal is to answer these questions: What factors {{influenced}} position of labour unions {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century? How did the position of labour unions change during World War I? World War I was already a second experience with war economy in the history of the USA (remember American Civil War). For the first time, though, labour unions played important role in the American economy. I have decided to analyze the effect of World War I on position of labour unions because I consider it an important one. In Chapter one I will analyze the influence of war inflation on real wages of employees and on the ratio between wages of union workers and non-union workers. Chapter two is dedicated to labour conditions (social programs, safety, unemployment benefits) and to their modifications which took place because of World War I. Chapter three is about labour legislation development (regulation of hours and wages, <b>yellow</b> <b>dog</b> <b>contracts,</b> anti-trust and immigration legislation) and its adjustments during the war years. In the Conclusion I sum up all the evidence and evaluate the influence of the World War I on the labour unions and their members...|$|R
