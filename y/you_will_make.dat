25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E

[...] He [...] predicted another attack would come within days. Others in the French camp felt the campaign was over.|$|E
500|$|The State Department {{appeared}} {{to not be}} well-informed about the action, as Ball cabled Lodge {{a few hours after}} the coup started: [...] "We have so little info on motivations and other factors involved in current crisis that we leave to your judgment how to handle. Meantime we trust <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> very clear that we {{had nothing to do with}} coup. If you consider it advisable and possible there would seem to us to be merit in preserving Minh as head of Government since he appears to have best potentialities for rallying support of people." [...] The Pentagon had opposed the removal of Diệm and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Khánh later reflected: [...] "Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup." ...|$|E

500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. Day {{had become}} a big issue in McCain's home state, with Governor Evan Mecham making {{opposition}} to it his signature stance. [...] McCain had continued {{his opposition to the}} holiday by supporting Mecham's rescinding of the Arizona holiday for King in 1987. [...] In 1988, Mecham was impeached and removed from office due to felony charges. McCain told Mecham, [...] "You should never have been elected. You're an embarrassment to the party." [...] By 1989, McCain reiterated his opposition to the federal holiday, but reversed position on the state holiday, due to the economic boycotts and image problems Arizona was receiving as a result of it not having one. [...] He told Republicans opposing the state holiday, [...] "You will damn well do this. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> this a holiday. You're making us look like fools." [...] In 1990, a state referendum on enacting the holiday was held; McCain persuaded Ronald Reagan to support it.|$|E
500|$|After Thomas G. W. Settle's record {{flight in}} the Piccards Century of Progress, the balloon was again {{returned}} to the Piccards, who decided to fly it to the stratosphere on their own. Jean would concentrate on the science, while Jeannette would pilot the balloon. DeVorkin wrote that, [...] "Energetic and forceful, {{she seemed to have}} a better chance of obtaining a pilot's license than Jean, who was preoccupied with restoring the gondola and balloon and convincing scientists to provide instruments to fly". She studied at Ford Airport in Dearborn, Michigan under Edward J. Hill, a balloonist and Gordon Bennett Cup winner, who agreed to serve as flight director for the Piccards' planned stratospheric flight. Henry Ford offered the use of his hangar and brought Orville Wright (with his brother Wilbur, inventor of the airplane and first human to fly a heavier-than-air powered aircraft) to observe a flight of Jeannette's in 1933. Her son Don was a crew member that day and shook hands with Wright, [...] "I was a little kid and he [...] attention to me." [...] On June 16, 1934, Jeannette flew her first solo flight. Later that year, the National Aeronautic Association made her the first woman licensed balloon pilot in the U.S. Auguste wrote to Jean in June 1934, [...] "Hopefully <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> your flight ahead of other competitors. It would be nice, if the name of Piccard through Jeannette, would once more be placed on the record list of the F.A.I." ...|$|E
500|$|A formal United States Navy {{board of}} inquiry, {{known as the}} Hepburn Investigation, {{prepared}} {{a report of the}} battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. [...] The report recommended official censure for only one officer, Captain Howard D. Bode of the Chicago, for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. Vice Admiral Ghormley was relieved not long afterward. [...] Vice Admiral Fletcher and Rear Admiral Noyes were relieved of their commands. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day. Crutchley was gazetted with the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander) in September 1944. Admiral Yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, [...] "Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization. I expect you to expand your exploits and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle." [...] Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades. [...] Admiral Turner later assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle: ...|$|E

Odoacer, at the time [...] "a young man, of tall figure, clad in poor clothes", learned from Severinus that he would one day become famous.
