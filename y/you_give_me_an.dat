As a general rule, a moderator should pause {{for at least five}} seconds after a participant talks or before beginning to talk. Probes, such as [...] "would you explain that further?" [...] or [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> example?" [...] help to give additional information. Being prepared for the unexpected is one of the abilities of the focus group leaders in order for the efficient functioning of the groups. Some examples of unexpected events are no one showing up (make sure you bring list and phone numbers), only a few showing up (hold group anyway), meeting place is inadequate for the members to reach, the group members get too involved and don't want to leave (have formal ending), bad or hazardous weather (call everyone and cancel). Organization Skills helps focus group leaders to plan the theme for group discussions and also develop a printed outline for the meetings. There may be more productive discussions when every member of the focus group has a copy of the printed agenda before starting the discussion. This allows the member to have some time to review the topics and focus on key relevant issues. The leader should use the counseling skills in order for the discussion to take place effectively.|$|E

6000|$|... "You've {{read the}} letter, I suppose, {{and are now}} {{making fun of me}} for trying to get it? Perhaps you've hidden it yourself--although that isn't likely.

6000|$|... "You cannot {{expect me}} to decide on such a serious matter as this at once," [...] I said. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little time to think?" ...|$|R
