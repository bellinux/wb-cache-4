They satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous for their improvisational comedy in free-form scenarios. A famous early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing chorus girl across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audience's delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, [...] "First time I ever saw a taxi hail a passenger". When Harpo chased the girl back in the other direction, Groucho calmly checked his watch and ad-libbed, [...] "The 9:20's right on time. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>set</b> your watch by the Lehigh Valley." ...|$|E

Together, the changes mean <b>you</b> <b>can</b> add a theme with as many custom colours as you want. Using the parent/child theme structure that already exists in 1.x <b>you</b> <b>can</b> restrict or allow certain usergroups to use these colours and, as they inherit the main stylesheets, they’re very easy to manage. So, there is no longer the need to install a dozen different themes just for a different colour header. Tom Moore, MyBB lead developer ...|$|R
