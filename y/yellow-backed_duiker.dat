5000|$|Duikers {{are very}} {{primitive}} antelope which diverged early in bovid history. The genus Cephalophus contains 16 African bovids {{of which the}} <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> is the largest. Cephalophus refers to the long crest of hair found between their horns.

5000|$|Duikers are {{the most}} heavily hunted species across forested West and Central Africa. It {{is not only a}} vital food source for African people but a vital source of income as well. [...] The animal's flighty, easy-to-scare nature causes the <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> to freeze up in torchlight which makes them very easy to hunt at night. When the animal is stunned by torchlight, hunters can almost walk right up to it. [...] This puts the <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> and its {{relatives}} at major risk for overhunting. Some scientists even project that by the year 2020 they may be at serious risk. IUCN currently puts the yellow-backed duiker's status at near threatened but if current trends continue, [...] "the yellow-backed duiker's distribution will become increasingly fragmented and its status will eventually become threatened." [...] It is thought that the <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> may already be locally extinct in the Oban Sector of the Cross River National Park in the Oban Hills Region of Nigeria. The loss of this species may have many impacts due to the yellow-backed duiker's numerous ecological responsibilities. They not only make up a main source of food for many indigenous peoples, but they also act as seed dispersers for various plants, and prey items for many carnivores.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Yellow-backed</b> <b>duikers</b> {{are mainly}} forest {{dwelling}} {{and live in}} semi-deciduous forests, rainforests, riparian forests, and montane forests. However, they {{can be found in}} open bush, isolated forest islands, and clearings on the savanna as well. [...] Their convex body shape is well-suited for forest living. It allows for quick movement through thick forest and bush and is reflective of ungulates accustomed to diving quickly into the underbrush for cover.

50|$|Monkey Trails showcases {{monkeys and}} other animals from the rainforests of Asia and Africa. Opened in 2005, it {{replaced}} an older exhibit known as the Monkey Yard. Monkey Trails is home primarily to monkeys such as guenons, mangabeys, and mandrills, but it also showcases many other species of animals, such as <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duikers.</b> Pygmy hippos, slender-snouted crocodiles, and many species of turtles and fish {{can be seen in}} a series of water/land exhibits all with underwater viewing areas. In smaller exhibits are many reptiles and amphibians such as pancake tortoises, and many species of arthropods such as Madagascar hissing cockroaches. Monkey Trails utilizes a new method of displaying arboreal animals—by climbing up an elevated walkway throughout the exhibit. Some of the horticultural highlights in Monkey Trails include a ficus tree, cycads, and a bog garden.|$|R

5000|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers. Jentink's duiker {{was classified as}} a giant duiker along with the <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> (C. silvicultor), Abbott's duiker (C. spadix), and the bay duiker (C. dorsalis). In 2012, Anne R. Johnston (of the University of Orleans) and colleagues constructed a cladogram of the subfamily Cephalophinae (duiker) based on mitochondrial analysis. They showed that within the [...] "giant duiker" [...] group, Jentink's duiker formed a clade with the bay duiker, and the zebra duiker is sister to this clade. Similarly, Abbott's duiker and <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> form a clade sister to Sylvicapra. Jentink's duiker and the bay duiker probably evolved during the Pleistocene, less than 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Yellow-backed duikers have a {{convex body}} shape, {{standing}} taller at the rump than the shoulders.

[...] Yellow-backed duikers get their name from the characteristic patch of yellow hairs on their rump, which stand when the duiker is alarmed or feels threatened. <b>Yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> females often grow to be slightly larger than males. Coloration is very similar between sexes and very little sexual dimorphism exists. The head-and-body length is 115 to 145 cm, with a short tail measuring 11 to 18 cm. The <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> weighs in at about 60-80 kg, making it the largest of its genus. It has a large mouth, throat and jaw musculature.|$|E

50|$|The Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix), {{also known}} as minde in Swahili, is a large, forest-dwelling duiker (small antelope) found only in a few {{scattered}} enclaves in Tanzania.

50|$|Comoé National Park has {{the most}} biodiverse savannah {{in the world and}} forms the {{northern}} limit for many animal species, like the <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> and bongo. There are a total of 135 mammal species in the park. This includes 11 species of primates like the olive baboon, green monkey, lesser spot-nosed monkey, Mona monkey, black and white colobus, olive colobus, white collared mangabey and chimpanzee. A total of 17 carnivore species registered, but at least 3 species are believed to have become extinct in the park - cheetah, wild dog (since 1993) and most recently lion (no signs of lions have been found since 2008). There are also 21 species of artiodactyl present in the park including hippopotamus, bushpig, bongo, warthog, buffalo, kob, red-flanked duiker, bushbuck, waterbuck, roan antelope and oribi. Threatened mammal species include the chimpanzee (EN), white-collared mangabey (EN), ursine colobus (VU), African elephant (VU), hippopotamus (VU), giant pangolin (VU), long-tailed pangolin (VU), leopard (VU), African golden cat (VU), Buffon kob (VU), bongo (NT), western hartebeest (NT), Defassa waterbuck (NT), bay duiker (NT), <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> (NT), olive colobus (NT).|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> is can breed {{throughout}} the year, with may breeding two times each year. The female {{gives birth to}} one oro two offspring after a gestation period of 4 to 7 months. The calf remains hidden for first week of life and is weaned at 3 to 5 months after birth. Sexual maturity happens at 12 to 18 months in the male, and at 9 to 12 months in the female.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forests are}} home {{to a variety of}} {{wildlife}} including ungulates such <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker,</b> blue duiker and their predators, as well as other species such as bushpigs. The only two endemic species are a mammal Rosevear's striped grass mouse, and a bird white-chested tinkerbird (Pogoniulus makawai). However the latter has not been actually spotted since 1964 and may in fact be a variant of the common and widespread yellow-rumped tinkerbird (Pogoniulus bilineatus).|$|E
50|$|Duikers can be diurnal, nocturnal or both. Since the {{majority}} of the food source is available in the daytime, duiker evolution has rendered most duikers as diurnal. A study done by Helen Newing in 2001 found that a correlation exists between body size and sleep pattern in duikers. While smaller to medium-sized duikers show increased activity and scavenge for food during the daytime, larger duikers are most active at night. An exception to this is the <b>Yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker,</b> the largest species, which is active during both day and night.|$|E
50|$|They {{were most}} likely mid-sized {{terrestrial}} herbivores not too distantly related to camels, but smaller and low-slung with long and thick tails, and rather generalistic. The climate during their time was warmer than today, and their habitats were probably subtropical or even tropical, with plentiful rainfall and abundant vegetation. Tropical rainforest may at least initially have occurred all over the Anoplotheriidae's range. Ecologically, they may have resembled a large duiker of our time (e.g. the similarly sized <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> Cephalophus silvicultor), foraging in dense growth where their low builds would have been advantageous.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>yellow-backed</b> <b>duiker</b> is Cephalophus sylvicultor. It is the type species of Cephalophus, {{and placed in the}} subfamily Cephalophinae and family Bovidae. The species was first described by English botanist Adam Afzelius in the journal Nova Acta Regiæ Societatis Scientiarum Upsaliensis in 1815. The generic name has possibly originated from the combination of the New Latin word cephal, meaning head, and the Greek word lophos, meaning crest. The specific name silvicultor is composed by two Latin words: silva, meaning wood, and cultus, which relates to cultivation. This refers to its habitat.|$|E
