We therefore shake our heads and say 'Ah! <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> Grimaldi!'" [...] Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by [...] "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [...] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities." [...] The British dramatist James Planché worried, in a rhymed couplet, that Grimaldi's death meant {{the end of a}} genre: [...] "Pantomime's best days are fled; Grimaldi, Barnes, Bologna dead!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{the episode}} was {{received}} positively {{by members of}} the voice cast and their families, who had attended a preview screening at Century 21 Studios. Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son just sat there riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, what have we done? We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it on the wide screen! They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered out into the night, convinced that we were on to a winner." [...] In his DVD commentary, Gerry Anderson praised Saunders' direction.|$|E
500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal {{first made}} the claim in an {{interview}} in the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role {{as if he were a}} spurned homosexual lover. Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and claimed to have suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. Wyler himself said that he did not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, however, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> those boys embrace!" [...] Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1970, Warner Bros. agreed to fund and {{distribute}} the film. The Harlem sequences were the first completed. Krantz intended to release these scenes as a 15-minute short in case the film's funding was pulled; Bakshi was nevertheless determined to complete the film as a feature. Late in November, Bakshi and Krantz screened a presentation reel for the studio with this sequence, pencil tests, and shots of Bakshi's storyboards. Bakshi stated, [...] "You should have seen their faces in the screening room when I first screened a bit of Fritz. I'll remember their faces until I die. One of them left the room. Holy hell, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> his face. 'Shut up, Frank! This is not the movie you're allowed to make!' And I said, Bullshit, I just made it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E

2500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated.

Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations. Vidal further claimed that Wyler took his advice. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. In 1980, Wallace biographers Robert and Katharine Morsberger said that Vidal's contribution to the script remained unclear. Heston has asserted that Wyler felt Vidal did not solve the problem of motivation, and that Wyler shot little of what he wrote or made little contribution to the script. Wyler himself says that he does not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Film critic Gary Giddins also dismisses Vidal's claims, concluding that 80 percent of the script had been written [...] "years before" [...] Vidal came aboard the production. However, Jan Herman, one of Wyler's biographers, asserts [...] "there is no reason to doubt" [...] Vidal's claim, and that Wyler's inability to remember the conversation was just part of the director's notorious caginess. There appears to be some contemporary support for Vidal's assertions. [...] Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday.

2500|$|In the 1950s the Athletics chant of {{the school}} (adapted by the Christian Brothers from their Australian schools) was urangabe, urangabe, urangabe uranga/Woolagalla, woolagalla, rumba/Flay them, beat them, yah mung do!/Christies, Christies, blue, gold, blue. One old boy, at SPC in the mid 1950s, has written that the Christian Brothers (being then [...] "Aussies") were not much {{interested}} in Rugby but {{were more interested in}} cricket, [...] "square-bashing" [...] and athletics. However, John Tamihere, at St Peter's in the 1970s, remembers the Christian Brothers (by then mostly Kiwi) being very enthusiastic about Rugby. He has written that if the Christian Brothers wanted a boy for the First XV, the boy didn't have much say in the matter. [...] "They would walk around the school grounds at lunchtime sizing up" [...] likely candidates to see if they might be any good. They picked out one boy because he looked usefully tall. [...] "I'd rather play soccer", the boy protested, [...] " ... but next minute there he was in the lineout, leaping." [...] Under such pressure, Tamihere played for the college First XV (in 1975 and 1976) although he would have preferred to play Rugby League for the Point Chevalier Pirates and later for the Glenora Bears as his brothers did. He said that the college First XV at that time was composed of [...] " ... not bad players", and they were [...] " ... always competitive". [...] "We didn't win a lot, {{but on the other hand}} we never really got hammered". [...] "St Peter's used to play St Kentigern's, who were led out onto the field by their pipe band. When we played Anglican King's College there was no doubt this was a Catholic versus [...] "Proddy" [...] battle, though some of our toughest games were against other Catholic schools like St Paul's and Sacred Heart. If you think Māori society was tribal, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> those Catholics". There is also strong traditional Rugby rivalry with other schools such as De La Salle College, Auckland Grammar School, Kelston Boys' High School, Mt Albert Grammar School and the North Shore school, Rosmini College (The Battle of the Bridge). An annual senior rugby fixture between Auckland Grammar and St Peter's (The Battle of the Overbridge) is played for the Henry Cooper-Br. Paddy Ryan Rugby Challenge Cup in memory of headmasters in office in 1962 when St Peter's beat Grammar for the first time. [...] Amongst the college's Rugby highlights was winning by the First XV of the New Zealand Secondary School's Top Four Championship and the Auckland Secondary Schools Premiership in 1987. [...] The latter feat was repeated in 1988. The college won the Auckland Championship and the New Zealand First XV Knock out competition undefeated in 2000. The college has held the Moascar Cup (national school 1st XV rugby honour) twice, in 1977 and 2000.|$|E
