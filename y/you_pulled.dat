His wife helped him pull out of that emotional crisis by praising {{his work as a}} songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording. In her honour, he later wrote [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed", explaining that with the Beatles breaking up, [...] "that was my feeling: Maybe I'm amazed at what's going on... Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't you help me understand... Maybe I'm amazed at the way <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> me out of time, hung me on the line, Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you." [...] He added that [...] "every love song I write is for Linda." ...|$|E
2500|$|After he {{got through}} that troubled phase of his career, he wrote [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] in Linda's honour.

2500|$|The {{start of}} World War I in August 1914 {{was a moment}} of deep crisis for Romania. The country was still aligned with the Central Powers, through the Triple Alliance, but the Romanian public was largely {{supporting}} the Entente Powers. Going against the grain, Carp was for honoring the previous commitment, asking for Romania to declare war on the Entente, and therefore on Russia. He and King Carol were the only two statesmen who supported that option during the Crown Council of August 3, where a majority decided in favor of prolonged neutrality. The king and his former minister were saddened by the circumstances of their defeat: when Carp stated that the majority was legitimate but regrettable, Carol shook his hand and called him [...] "a true statesman". During the Council, Carp first made public his belief that the Central Powers were unbeatable, and reprimanded the PNL men who voted for neutrality: [...] "Nice one <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> off. You have wrecked Romania." ...|$|E

I guess you know what he'll do--you're so d--d secretive I can't tell whether you do or not. If <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> out, they'd have their bill on Friday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expect that}} is so. Sometimes, however, {{people are not}} logical. For example, when you thought you had shot Douglas, <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> out." ...|$|E
