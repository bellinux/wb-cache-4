500|$|In his {{interview}} with Spielberg on Inside the Actors Studio, James Lipton suggested Close Encounters had another, more personal theme for Spielberg: [...] "Your father was a computer engineer; <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> a concert pianist, and when the spaceship lands, they make music together on the computer", suggesting that Roy Neary's boarding the spaceship is Spielberg's wish {{to be reunited with}} his parents. In a 2005 interview, Spielberg stated that he made Close Encounters when he did not have children, and if he were making it today, he would never have had Neary leave his family and go on the mother ship.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco from USA Today {{was more}} upbeat, praising the [...] "fine cast" [...] and [...] "humorous script", and calling the show the [...] "most inventive" [...] of new series that year. The New York Times {{said that the}} show was [...] "pleasant to watch" [...] has [...] "potential to improve", but will not [...] "revolutionize" [...] sitcoms or start a pop culture phenomenon. Charlie McCollum of The San Jose Mercury News writes that How I Met <b>Your</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>was</b> a prime {{candidate}} for replacing Friends in the sitcom category, praising the show as [...] "something with real wit and considerable charm". He praised the writers for [...] "giving a fresh spin to {{bits and pieces of}} the sitcom formula" [...] and the cast for [...] "hitting on all cylinders from the very first scene", predicting that the show could be an unexpected creative breakout with audiences.|$|E
500|$|How I Met <b>Your</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} by creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas's idea to [...] "write about {{our friends and}} the stupid stuff we did in New York," [...] where they previously worked as writers for Late Show with David Letterman. The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife. Thomas's wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed {{if they could get}} Hannigan to play her. Radnor and Segel were relative unknowns, but Smulders, another relatively little-known actress, was cast as Robin after [...] Jennifer Love Hewitt turned down the role in favor of Ghost Whisperer. Bays and Thomas commented on her casting by saying, [...] "thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted’s seeing {{her for the first time}}, America’s seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive".|$|E
