40|$|Glomus intraradices and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are two commercially used {{plant growth}} {{promoting}} micro-organisms. They associate with plant roots to facilitate host plants to absorb nutrients, induce resistance against pathogens and pests, and regulate growth through phytohormones. Growth conditions for plants on green roofs are often unfavorable. In order {{to test whether}} growth and development of green roof plants could be enhanced via improving the microbial interface, G. intraradices and B. amyloliquefaciens were inoculated on experimental plots on a green roof {{in the summer of}} 2012. The experimental plots were marked as R (inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens from Rhizocell), M (inoculated with G. intraradices from MYC 4000), and C (control). The green roof was made of sedum-herb-grass mats. The plants included e. g. stonecrops, bluegrasses, <b>yellow</b> <b>rockets,</b> white clover, mullein, pennycress, and moss. The survival and development of G. intraradices and B. amyloliquefaciens were studied respectively from Poa alpina roots and soils in the summers of 2012 and 2013. G. intraradices was not detected in P alpina roots according to root staining and microscopy. Probable reasons for the lacking of G. intraradices include high phosphorus content in the soils, high soil temperature, and low soil moisture. PCR and qPCR were used to detect Bacillus content in green roof soils. The abundance of B. amyloliquefaciens was related to soil water content and soil temperature. During the last two measurements in 2012, 4 weeks of high moisture content in the soil resulted in large increase of B. amyloliquefaciens content in both M and R groups, but then decreased substantially due to drought and heat in 2013. In 2013, Only R group increased from the third to the last measurement, indicating probable resistance of the B. amyloliquefaciens strain from Rhizocell additive. The synergistic effect of B. amyloliquefaciens and G. intraradices might be responsible for the thousand-fold increase of Bacillus content in M group in 2012...|$|R

5000|$|A {{disease of}} cabbage and related plants {{caused by a}} {{bacterium}} (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris). Occurring around the world, it affects primarily the aboveground parts of plants. Vegetables in the crucifer family are susceptible, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, kale, mustard, radish, rutabaga, and turnip. Many weeds may host this pathogen including Shepherd's Purse, wild mustard, and <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket.</b>|$|E

On a leaf stalk, this damages the tissues and results in the formation of a corky gall. The undamaged side of the stalk continues to grow normally which results in twisting and distortion. The growing point can be completely killed and secondary bacterial infections can occur. If the infection occurs in the flowering stage of cauliflower, it causes a stunted, multi-branched, tuft-like appearance of the flower-head.|$|E
40|$|A new {{category}} of horticultural products, this of fresh-cut {{fruit and vegetables}} has arisen the last years. During their processing, many physiological and biochemical alterations are noticed such as: a) increased ethylene and CO 2 production, b) increased transpiration, c) membrane deterioration and d) secondary metabolite production, which lead to browning of the cut surfaces, yellowing, softening etc. and induce faster quality loss of the fresh-cut fruit compared to the intact ones. The purpose of this thesis was to study the postharvest physiology of fresh-cut rocket and peach and also to investigate the various factors that affect their quality. In particular, the factors that were studied in rocket were: a) the leaf age, b) the degree of wounding that {{was determined by the}} different leaf size, c) the storage temperature, d) the presence of ethylene in the storage environment, e) treatment with 1 -MCP, f) treatment with 6 -BA and g) the heat treatment. On the other hand, the factors that were studied in the peach were: a) the cultivar, b) the degree of wounding that was determined by the cutting and/or peeling, c) treatment with 1 -MCP, d) treatment with various chemical compounds (citric acid, ascorbic acid, calcium chloride and oxalic acid) and e) heat treatment. The results showed that chlorophyll degradation was the most important postharvest alteration observed in fresh-cut rocket that resulted in leaf yellowing. During harvest, in young leaves the highest ethylene and CO 2 production were recorded. In addition, they had more soluble solids content (SSC) and total soluble phenols but less nitrates compared to the fully expanded and mature leaves. During storage, in young leaves a significantly higher ethylene production was noticed, but not greater chlorophyll losses were observed after 10 days of storage at 10 oC compared to the fully expanded and mature leaves. The degree of wounding, that was determined by the different leaf size (1 particle of 14 cm or 2 particles of 7 cm each or 4 particles of 3. 5 cm each) had no effect on the CO 2 and ethylene production during storage. After 14 days at 8 oC in MAP, no differences between treatments were observed regarding color, chlorophyll content and chemical composition. Chlorophyll degradation in rocket leaves was prevented significantly during storage in low temperatures. Specifically, the shelf-life of the leaves that were stored at 0 oC was 16 days, but it was reduced (3 days) in the leaves that were stored at 5 oC. The quality of the leaves that were stored at 10 oC was deteriorated very quickly (intense yellow colour) and their shelf-life was only 8 days. The ethylene presence (1 μl l- 1) in the storage environment accelerated significantly the <b>rocket</b> <b>yellowing</b> compared to the leaves that were stored in air and reduced the shelf-life (at 10 oC) from 10 to 8 days. Exposure of the leaves before storage to 1 -MCP (0. 5 μL L- 1 for 4 hours at 10 oC), limited the yellowing effect of the ethylene. Dipping of rocket leaves to a 6 -BA solution (10 μl l- 1) for 30 sec reduced the CO 2 production (by 33 %) and limited the chlorophyll deterioration (by 53 %) compared to the control. In contrast, it had no significant effect on their chemical composition (SSC, ascorbic acid, nitrates, phenols and the total antioxidants). Heat treatment of leaves (dipping in water temperature of 50 oC for 30 sec) reduced significantly the chlorophyll loss from 36 % to 7 %, after being stored in MAP at 8 oC for 10 days. In addition, the heat treatment reduced the weight loss compared to the control from 3. 4 % to 2. 2 %, without affecting the chemical composition (SSC, ascorbic acid, nitrates, phenols and the total antioxidants). ...|$|R

Br.) variety arcuata in different treatments of planting density, host plant age, intercropping, and water stress in 2003 and 2004. P. xylostella laid nearly twice as many eggs per plant in the high planting densities of glossy collards and <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> than in the standard planting densities. Ovipositional preference {{was positively correlated with}} plant age in cabbage, glossy collards, and <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket.</b> Larval survival on cabbage was 1. 9 times higher on 6 -wk than on 12 -wk-old plants, whereas larval survival on collards was 12. 1 times higher on the younger plants.

Intercropping cabbage with either tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., or fava bean, Vicia fava L., did not reduce the number of eggs laid on cabbage. No significant differences in oviposition were found between water-stressed and well-irrigated host plants treatments. Yet, P. xylostella larval survival on water-stressed cabbage was 2. 1 times lower than on well-irrigated cabbage plants. Based on our findings, the effectiveness of trap crops of glossy collards and <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> could be enhanced by integrating the use of higher planting densities in the trap crop than in the main crop and seeding of the trap crop earlier than the main cro...|$|E

The aim of the investigation was to establish the weediness’ dynamics of crops in a six-field crop rotation of an organic farming system. The field was certified as being organic. Crop rotation: 1. triticale/ rye (for green manure in spring), 2. oil radish (for green manure) / rye (for green manure in autumn), 3. potatoes, 4. oats, 5. vetch-oats mix (for green forage) with an undersown mixture of red clover and timothy, 6. red clover and timothy. Conventional soil tillage was done according to the requirements of the crops. The weeds were counted two times during the vegetation period of crops: at the early development stages of crops (for instance, at the tillering of cereals) and before the crop harvesting. The composition of weed flora comprised from 59 species in the crops’ stands. The annual dicotyledonus were dominating groups of the weed flora. The most abundant weeds were lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), quackgrass (Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski), common <b>yellow</b> <b>rocket</b> (Barbarea vulgaris R. Br. p. p.). The significantly smaller amount of weeds among crop rotation links was observed in the link rye/ oil radish/ rye – potatoes – oats. Much worse suppression of weeds was obtained in the crop rotation link red clover and timothy – triticale/ rye – oil radish/ rye. The number of weeds in the fields of crop rotation in the organic farming system is dependent on the cultivated crops, the succession of crops in the crop rotation links and crop cultivation technologies...|$|E
40|$|Broccoli is a cool-season crop. It grows best between 15 ° and 17 ° C. Broccoli can {{withstand}} light frosts. It is primarily grown for its edible buds, high nutritional value and attractive appearance. Broccoli production has been decreasing in recent years. It is grown for fresh market and processing. Fresh market broccoli is of high value {{early in the}} season. Higher quality production occurs in cooler temperatures. The heads are tighter and larger. Higher temperatures cause rapid growth, loose heads and leafy clusters. Cole crops require 1 - 2 acre inches of water a week, {{depending on the size}} and developmental stage of the plant as well as the soil type. Cole crops are also sensitive to wet soil. It is important to grow these crops in well-drained soil. Broccoli grows best on light soils with good moisture-holding capacity and pH values between 6. 0 and 6. 8. Broccoli does well on soils with high organic matter. Large acreage in Oceana county is grown in sandy soils. (21) Broccoli can be grown from seeds (4 / 15 – 7 / 15) or transplanted (4 / 15 – 7 / 15) into fields. Transplants are ready in 4 to 5 weeks. Transplants generally mature earlier. Broccoli can mature in 45 to 60 days after transplanting, 60 to 75 days after direct seeding. Harvesting continues through the season. The rate of harvesting depends on the weather and growth conditions. It is harvested at the bud stage. Broccoli is harvested from June through October in Michigan.
