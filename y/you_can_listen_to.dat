John Watson, who co-manages Gotye with Danny Rogers, {{said of the}} single's success: [...] "We've never seen any song make a deeper or more immediate connection with so many people. It's a really special recording and video". Talking about the overwhelming reception {{and the amount of}} coverage received, Gotye commented that [...] "I don't really feel like it [...] belongs to me anymore." [...] He further explained that [...] "sometimes I feel like I'm a bit sick of it. My inbox, on any given day, has at least five covers or parodies or remixes of it and there's only so many times <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the one song." ...|$|E
500|$|Ito's {{music is}} mainly {{inspired}} by {{images from the}} game rather than outside influences; however, he never played the games themselves. The only video games that he plays are sports games; he has only seen up to the introductory movie {{for most of the}} role-playing games that he has written music for. While many of his pieces are orchestral, he enjoys working in a recording studio and enjoys composing [...] "normal songs" [...] as much as his orchestral works. His favorite video game music from other composers include the music from Star Fox, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Wizardry and Nobunaga's Ambition. Non-video game music that has inspired him includes Japanese popular music and soundtracks to anime works, as well as easy listening music such as Paul Mauriat or Richard Clayderman, especially string music. These influences have led him to wish to create music [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> while you relax". He also wishes to expand his compositions outside video game music and into ballads.|$|E

500|$|Starr's {{creative}} {{contribution to}} music has received praise from other drummers such as Phil Collins, who {{described him as}} [...] "a great musician", and Steve Smith, who commented: [...] "Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature to the songs that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> a Ringo drum part without {{the rest of the}} music and still identify the song." [...] He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Starr, who was previously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Beatle in 1988, was inducted for his solo career in 2015, making him one of 21 performers inducted more than once.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{listed the}} song as the weakest effort on MDNA, adding that [...] "its {{position}} as the album's lead single {{seems to have had}} more to do with showing off the presence of Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. than its featherweight melody." [...] A writer for Virgin Media gave the song three out of five stars, writing: [...] "Like most Madonna singles, it skips along at a furious pace with a gleam in its eye, but the self-references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard." [...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, relegated the track as a [...] "lighter pop morsel". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song, saying that Solveig's production on the track was paired with equally [...] "bland lyrics". Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice declared that the track was [...] "proof that sometimes <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> something many, many times and still not have any idea whether it's any good or not." [...] Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot was disappointed with the song and its lyrics, which he found to be meaningless, while Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald relegated it as [...] "trite and disposable". Alex Macpherson from Fact found the song to be [...] "sheer misconceived awfulness".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{described}} the album as a [...] "fine balancing act" [...] of [...] "emo-edged" [...] tracks and [...] "wallop-packed rockers." [...] Steve Hochman of The Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Those graduating from teen tastes could well turn to this album {{as a first}} step to adulthood." [...] Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine praised the maturity the band showed through the album, noting that it had the capability to attract a wide-ranging audience. Rolling Stone reviewer Barry Walters stated that [...] "Bleed American sports the tender turbulence that insular emo kids have been enjoying in private for years," [...] with the album appealing to fans of Creed and Blink-182 as well as new wave music. Blender gave the album a mixed review, saying that the album's mainstream potential was [...] "undercut by guitars, which are neither as gleefully blaring as Weezer’s nor as cleanly melodic as the Knack’s." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau stated [...] "if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis." [...] Pitchfork, however, gave a much more negative and sarcastic review of the album. Reviewer Ryan Schreiber ended his review with [...] "So do the best <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> your favorite band, bury your head in the sand, before it all begins again.

2500|$|Hotel Cabana is a pop, R, {{soul and}} hip hop music record, {{containing}} [...] "orchestral flourishes" [...] and [...] "Bollywood inflections".

2500|$|Upon its release, {{contemporary}} {{critical reaction}} to Fifth Dimension was somewhat tepid, although Hit Parader {{described it as}} [...] "the third and best album from The Byrds". The Hit Parader review also made reference to the recent controversy surrounding the album's two preceding singles by suggesting [...] "If your friendly neighborhood radio station banned 'Eight Miles High' and '5D' <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> them here and discover that there's nothing suggestive about them. The only danger in this album is that it might addict you to groovy music." [...] However, journalist Jon Landau, writing in Crawdaddy!, was less complimentary about the album and cited the departure of Gene Clark as a contributing factor in its artistic failure. Landau concluded by saying that Fifth Dimension [...] "cannot be considered up to the standards set by The Byrds' first two and basically demonstrates {{that they should be}} thinking in terms of replacing Gene Clark instead of just trying to carry on without him." [...] In the UK, Disc magazine was also critical, bemoaning a lack of energy in the album's contents and commenting: [...] "Here then are those Byrds with the fresh eager exciting music sounding like tired and disillusioned old men looking back on the happy days. This is a sad sound indeed." ...|$|E

"If Elvis Presley {{had never}} made another record after his last Sun session {{in the fall of}} 1955, there seems little {{question}} that his music would have achieved much the same mythic status as Robert Johnson's blues.

Another defining characteristic is their lyrics, which often discuss death, mortality, {{and the end of the}} world but doing so over upbeat and popular dance music.
