500|$|IGN {{rated the}} pilot episode 10th on {{its list of}} the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, writing that [...] "The smooth {{introduction}} to all things Veronica makes <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> her instantly. Anyone wrestling with creating a female character who is multifaceted and real needs only to study Veronica. We see many different sides, and there isn't any stereotyping. They sell her tough exterior so well that even though Veronica has been through a pile of crap, you don't pity her – which is good, because she doesn't want it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} the sound of a finger-picked {{acoustic}} guitar, reminiscent of [...] "More Than Words" [...] (1991) by American rock band Extreme. The composition has an organic arrangement, devoid of any synths and sequencing, and only based on guitars and subdued strings. A number of chord changes happen throughout the song as Madonna sings the lyrics, accompanied by an interval gap after the end of each chorus with the line [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> me". The bridge section portrays a combination between the harmonies and the guitars, as the key changes. [...] "One More Chance" [...] ends with a brief pause of Madonna's solo vocals, couple of guitar chords and then it dissipates with a final strung of a major chord on the instrument.|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought to do if <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the album are {{identical}} to those performed on Garland's 1961 album, Judy at Carnegie Hall, except Wainwright's album included [...] "Get Happy" [...] as a bonus track in the UK and on iTunes in the US. [...] "Hail from a golden era dotted with trolley cars, Cadillacs, and glitzy jazz clubs", the set list included more than 25 American swing tunes, jazz and pop standards, including two Rodgers and Hart classics ("This Can't Be Love", [...] "You're Nearer"), three from brothers George and Ira Gershwin ("Who Cares? (As Long as <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> <b>for</b> Me)", [...] "How Long Has This Been Going On?" [...] and [...] "A Foggy Day"), two from duo Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz ("Alone Together", [...] "That's Entertainment!"), Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, Noël Coward and more. Wainwright performed the songs nearly identically to Garland, even [...] "flubb" [...] the lyrics purposely on [...] "You Go to My Head" [...] to mimic the mistake made by Garland years before.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{characters}} {{include the}} [...] "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the [...] "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the [...] "Sheep", {{who represent the}} exploited. Croskery described the [...] "Sheep" [...] as being in a [...] "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a false consciousness. The [...] "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone {{with no one to}} trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse {{as an example of a}} [...] "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: [...] "You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> me too." [...] However, he also acknowledges that the [...] "Pigs" [...] are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a [...] "Dog" [...] who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.|$|E

[...] "Would <b>you</b> have <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> {{me as much as}} <b>you</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> Richard Newson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You would!" [...] Jack exclaimed, as much {{astonished}} as by his friend's first proposition. [...] "To {{think of}} that now! Why, you have always been with her just as I have. You have never shown that <b>you</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> her, never given her presents, nor walked with her, nor anything. And do <b>you</b> really <b>care</b> <b>for</b> her, Harry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not, at any rate, to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> me as <b>you</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> Amerigo and for Charlotte. They {{were much}} more interesting--it was {{perfectly}} natural. How couldn't you like Amerigo?" [...] Maggie continued.|$|R
2500|$|Dark Eden won the 2013 Arthur C. Clarke Award for {{the best}} science fiction novel {{published}} in the United Kingdom in 2012. Clarke Award judge Andrew M. Butler, noting why the judges gave the award to a new author rather than an established writer, said of the book, [...] "Dark Eden fuses rich biological and sociological speculation. Beckett really makes <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> characters who are stranded light years from an Earth they have never really known." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ford's {{father and}} former lead {{engineer}} at the Janjira nuclear plant until its destruction in 1999. Cranston has said that Edwards' approach to the film and to its characterization is what drew him to the project. He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn. [...] takes the time to really establish who these people are, that you root for them, that you invest in these characters, and that <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> them. That's the best part of it." [...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film. Cranston, despite his positive opinion on the film, would later opine that killing off Joe Brody so early was a [...] "narrative mistake".|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Beast Below" [...] (2010), a Dalek shadow {{can be seen}} during Prime Minister Winston Churchill's {{telephone}} conversation with the Eleventh Doctor. In [...] "Victory of the Daleks" [...] (2010), it is revealed that a Dalek ship survived its previous encounter with the Doctor, and fell back through time to 1941. The ship appears to be badly damaged, with only three surviving Daleks on board, [...] "at the end of [...] rope". The surviving Daleks discovered that a Progenitor, a small capsule containing pure Dalek DNA, had also fallen back though time. The Daleks retrieved it, planning {{to create a new}} race of Daleks, but were unable to activate the capsule, as it couldn't recognise these Daleks and, according to the Eleventh Doctor, saw them as [...] "impure". To solve this problem, they set a trap for the Doctor. This trap consists of building an android who believes himself to be human working undercover for the war cause. He claims to have invented the Daleks, calling them [...] "Ironsides". With Dalek blueprints and multiple Daleks painted in British Army Khaki, Winston Churchill uses them as war weapons, although they are mostly seen to be carrying around files and asking staff, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> some tea?" [...] The Eleventh Doctor is surprised as these khaki Daleks appear to have forgotten their own purpose. This is all part of their plan, however: he proclaims, [...] "I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!" [...] which the Daleks back on the ship use as a testimony to activate the progenitor. The five New Paradigm Daleks that appear then exterminate their predecessors with no resistance, as they were deemed inferior. Each Dalek is a different colour and each represents a specific place in Dalek Hierarchy — Drone, Scientist, Strategist, Eternal and Supreme. The Daleks activate a time corridor, and escape into the future, delaying the Doctor by threatening to destroy Earth. Amy Pond doesn't recognise the Daleks when she first meets them, despite the Daleks' invasion of Earth and the planets appearing in Earth's sky, which the Doctor says is not possible. In [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] (2010), the Eleventh Doctor theorises that the cracks in the universe caused the events to be unwritten.|$|E
