Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E

The group held rehearsals with Zander Schloss, though after a few days they decided he was not the right fit either.
