In addition, the process is graphically illustrated using four diagrams <b>of</b> the <b>reference</b> transaction and provides a top-level perspective of the process. n this article, the author proposes that the process of question answering, technically called the reference transaction in the field of library and information science, be defined as a face-to-(inter) face process involving an inquirer and a librarian, or surrogate, within an informationseeking environment (i. e., a library-like setting).

A desirable scenario is to utilize raw materials to their fullest potential, to minimize waste and to gain competitiveness.

A warehousing method that supports a vast amount of articles is required to push this ideal state whilst simultaneously offer flexibility to try out new articles in order to pursuit a competitive product. Stora Enso Packaging experienced that they were limited in their possibility to approach this state due to limitations in their warehousing regarding diversity in articles. The purpose of this report was to identify factors that prevented Stora Enso Packaging from increasing their number of supplied articles and to present solutions resulting in higher flexibility.

If identity is a relation at all, is it a relation between objects or between the names and signs representing these objects? The proposition a=a is necessarily true, whereas a=b is not. If this was merely a relation between objects, the two propositions would not differ in nature. Obviously, it is a relation between signs, but one whose existence depends on the signs having a referent. a=b merely expresses that we attach two different names to the same object...|$|R
