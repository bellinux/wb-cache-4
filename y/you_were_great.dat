Hugo himself was in the audience. The next day, he sent her a note: [...] "Madame, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> and charming; you moved me, me the old warrior, and, at a certain moment when the public, touched and enchanted by you, applauded, I wept. The tear which you caused me to shed is yours. I place it at your feet." [...] The note was {{accompanied}} by a tear-shaped pearl on a gold bracelet.|$|E

If you take me to Cortez, and tell him that, years ago, a ship was wrecked {{on the coast of}} Tabasco, and that all were drowned except a little white boy; and that he was brought up at Tabasco, and that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> friends with him, until he was sold to some Mexican traders--they will think that I have altogether forgotten my native language. They are not likely to ask you how many years ago it is, or how big I was then, and will imagine that I was quite a child, and that I belonged to a Spanish ship, for they will not dream of an English vessel having been in these parts. When you introduce me to Cortez, you must tell him that I have quite forgotten the language, save a few words--for I picked up a few sentences when in their ports." ...|$|E

How can I express the bliss of finding myself {{enclosed}} with you in this sweet old security, this really unimagined sanctity? Nothing's more charming than suddenly to come across something sharp and fresh after we've thought there was nothing more that could draw from us a groan. We've supposed we've had it all, have squeezed the last impression out of the last disappointment, penetrated to the last familiarity in the last surprise; then some fine day we find that we haven't done justice to life. There are little things that pop up and make us feel again. What MAY happen is after all incalculable. There's just a little chuck of the dice, and for three minutes we win. These, my dear young lady, are my three minutes. You wouldn't believe the amusement I get from them, and how can I possibly tell you? There's a faint divine old fragrance here in the room--or doesn't it perhaps reach you? I shan't have lived without it, but I see now I had been afraid I should. You, on your side, won't have lived without some touch of greatness. This moment's great and you've produced it. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> when you felt all you COULD produce.

I {{would have liked to have}} experienced the delights and comforts of life, which I now appreciate twice as much, with you all, with my friends and fellow sportsmen, after the war. The times I had with <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>great,</b> and I lived on them during my incarceration, and wished back that wonderful time. Sadly fate has now decided differently, after a long time of suffering. But I know that I have found a place in all your hearts and in the hearts of many sports followers, a place where I will always hold my ground. This knowledge makes me proud and strong and will not let me be weak in my last moments.|$|E
5000|$|I {{came up for}} [...] "Bird Song", {{and after}} the set was over, I said, 'Thanks for letting me play, guys.' And they're like, 'No, no, stay! Play {{the second half of}} the show. We'll do [...] "Dark Star".' That had no {{significance}} to me. I'm like, '"Dark Star"? Okay. What is it?' 'Oh, you're gonna love it. It's free, it's out.' 'Great, I can play out.' They start playing that lick, and the audience goes fucking bananas. Later, I started getting these phone calls on my private number: 'Man, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>great</b> last night. Thanks for getting them to play [...] "Dark Star". They haven't played it in six months.' I'm like, 'Who are these people?'...There was almost nothing Grateful Deadcouldn't play—and make the shit sound authentic. When they played a song by the Band or Bob Dylan, they played it with the same spirit as the Band or Dylan. They didn't feel the need to write their own arrangement of it. They were all listeners. There is a point where musicians who establish themselves stop listening to music and start listening to their own rhetoric. The Dead didn't do that. It was obvious in the way they approached a song. Branford Marsalis ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Pink, {{the sixth}} and title track, [...] "I'm Not Dead", is her first [...] "subtle" [...] and [...] "poetic" [...] self-written song: [...] "Usually it's very much more cartoon-y and blunt, the way I write songs. I don't really know {{diplomacy}} or subtlety." [...] The song was inspired by how Pink and producer Billy Mann felt {{about the end of}} their working relationship: [...] "We were scared to move on from each other, after seeing how much that little bit of time together changed us, and how scary change is." [...] In [...] "'Cuz I Can", Pink says she plays by her own rules boasts about her [...] "bling", a contrast to the anti-consumerist content of [...] "Stupid Girls". Referring to the song, she called herself [...] "a walking contradiction" [...] and [...] "a hypocrite sometimes." [...] This theme is echoed in [...] "Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)", which deals with contradictory feelings about a relationship; Pink said [...] "That's how I live my life. I'm a walking conflict." [...] She called the song [...] "a funny take on 'I love you' ... I get really cramped ... But, every girl needs her space". [...] "U + Ur Hand", the ninth track, is a kiss-off song addressed to a man who is trying to seduce Pink; it became a fan favorite before the release of the album, when it was leaked to the internet. Pink said of song such as [...] "Runaway" [...] that [...] "It's been especially hard for parents hearing me write about things they never knew about ... My mom's like, 'Were you really that angry? Was I really that in denial? Was I really that bad a parent?' 'No, Mom - <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>great.</b> You didn't try to run me over with your car. I made it up.' But by writing all of it down and sharing it with the world, I've broken with most of it." [...] "The One That Got Away" [...] is, as Pink puts it, [...] "the classic 'Is this the one? Or is the grass really greener?'" [...] Pink described track thirteen, [...] "Conversations with My 13 Year Old Self", as a [...] "huge therapy session" [...] that addresses her [...] "pissed-off, complicated" [...] younger self. She said of writing the song, [...] "I needed a hug, and I get it ... now. If I tried to hug my 13-year-old self, she'd try to kick my ass, and then she'd collapse and cry." [...] "Fingers" [...] is about her videotaping herself masturbating. She said she probably didn't need to add to the number of songs about masturbation, but she couldn't help herself. The final song on the album, the hidden track [...] "I Have Seen the Rain," [...] was written by and features Pink's father, James T. Moore. He wrote it when he was a soldier in the Vietnam War, but according to Pink [...] "it's still relevant today. It's a soldier's cry." [...] She had always wanted to record it with him and learnt to harmonize with it. She said of its recording, [...] "He was so nervous, it was the most adorable experience for a father and daughter to share." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} profiled {{the school}} counselors ' beliefs about implementing their schools intervention plan and counseling staff {{and students in}} times of crisis. The study {{took place in the}} fall of 2002. All school counselors in a small Midwestern School District were asked to participate by returning a twelve-question survey presented to them at a district-wide pupil services meeting. The information obtained from the counselors measured perceptions on their preparedness to counsel during crisis and implement their schools ’ crisis plans. The outcome of this research project was made available to the school counselors involved in the survey. i ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Mom and Dad- my cup runneth over.
