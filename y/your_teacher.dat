F*ck: A Documentary and Profanity as a Teaching Tool in the Communication Classroom", by Miriam Sobre-Denton of Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Jana Simonis. Sobre-Denton and Simonis discussed the documentary's use for communication studies students studying university-level intercultural relations. Their research incorporated interviews with Steve Anderson, students and data from graduate-level classes in language and culture. Sobre-Denton and Simonis' conclusions correlated taboo words with social forms of power, rebelliousness, professionalism and gender roles.|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Up", {{the opening}} track, is a mid-tempo number backed by dance, pop and {{electronic}} beats, and has [...] "a more mature pop-techno sound" [...] than Duff's previous work. Its instrumentation includes a guitar, bass and drums. Kelefa Anneth of The New York Times {{noted that the}} song contains musical influences of The Go-Go's. The lyrics of the song speak about having fun. Duff initially sings {{about the consequences of}} her fame and how people think they know [...] "everything about [...] " [...] ("There's people talking / They talk about me / They know my name / They think they know everything / But they don't know anything about me"). As the chorus draws near, the song takes on a [...] "party anthem" [...] approach, where Duff discusses the [...] "struggle" [...] for joy and self-confidence: [...] "I know I make mistakes / I'm living life day to day / It's never really easy but it's OK..." [...] According to Duff, the song [...] "makes you want to forget about all the pressure of dealing with your boss, or <b>your</b> <b>teacher,</b> or your mom, or ," [...] and lyrically discusses [...] "getting out and not forgetting to have some fun." [...] Duff has also said the song also [...] "talks about being in all [...] favorite places in the world, which is Tokyo and Paris and London and New York." [...] "Beat of My Heart", the third track on the album, is inspired by the new wave genre. The song also draws influences from the bubblegum pop and dance genres. It carries a [...] "soft electronic pop" [...] sound and has the heart beat sound as its base. According to Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine, the word 'beat of my heart' is repeated forty-four times in the song.|$|E
