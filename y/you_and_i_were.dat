500|$|The {{first song}} on the album, the title track [...] "Thrive", has been {{described}} as having a folk pop sound [...] similar to Mumford and Sons or Phillip Phillips. The banjo and mandolin are used in its arrangement in addition to electric guitars and backing vocals. [...] "All You've Ever Wanted" [...] is led by a piano riff, and displays an adult contemporary sound similar to {{much of the rest of}} the band's discography. [...] "Just Be Held" [...] also incorporates adult contemporary elements, with one critic comparing the song's string arrangement to those on Downton Abbey, while [...] "You Are the Only One" [...] is a worship song. [...] "Broken Together", described as [...] "Coldplay pop", is a piano ballad; the song's protagonist [...] "smashes the facade of a fairy-tale relationship, forgoing the happy ending with the realization that 'maybe <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> never meant to be complete'".|$|E

[...] According to Latter Day Saint witness Reed Peck, when Smith {{was told that the}} Mormons would be expected to leave the state, he replied that [...] "he did not care" [...] and that he would be glad {{to get out of the}} [...] "damnable state" [...] anyway. Smith and the other leaders rode with Hinkle back to the Missouri militia encampment. [...] The militia promptly arrested Smith and the other leaders. [...] Smith believed that Hinkle had betrayed him, but Hinkle maintained his innocence and claimed that he was following Smith's orders. [...] To William Wines Phelps, a fellow Latter-day Saint and witness to the events, Hinkle wrote: [...] "When the facts were laid before Joseph, did he not say, 'I will go'; and did not the others go with him, and that, too, voluntarily, so far as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> concerned?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
