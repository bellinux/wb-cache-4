[...] "When I was there <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> it was five men in bowties who talked about the war and The Goons...it was so male dominated." [...] However, some things remained the same: [...] "The important things haven't changed, though. The BBC still provides an environment that allows you the freedom to create the best shows possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Rosberg was booed by the crowd, mirroring a similar incident towards {{him at the}} previous race in Belgium. Hamilton later told the press {{that he did not}} feel comfortable about the fans behaving in such a manner: [...] "I've had it here, <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and it's great personally for me to have such great support, from the Ferrari fans and the Mercedes fans. But when I was up there, it was awkward for me to hear them booing Nico because I just don't like that in sport." [...] Wolff affirmed that booing should not be heard on the podium but acknowledged Formula One is an emotional sport for its fan base while also saying: [...] "It's a sport and sport should unite." [...] When asked about the booing in the press conference, Rosberg replied while it was [...] "not nice" [...] he hoped over time the fans would forgive him for his past actions. In the podium interviews, conducted by former driver Jean Alesi, Massa expressed his happiness on standing on the podium and was certain luck was beside him and that there was [...] "a lot more to come." ...|$|E

25|$|With about 100000-year history, the Furnas volcano is the {{youngest}} of the active volcanoes of São Miguel. The rock and mineral deposits are divided into three groups, consisting essentially of trachyte materials, constituted by pyroclastic deposits and flows resulting from explosive eruptions, lava flows and surges. The inferior layer includes most pyroclastic materials and volcanic products {{in the formation of the}} Povoação Ignimbrite (some 30000 <b>years</b> <b>ago).</b> The intermediate layer includes material produced between 30,000 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 5,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> (reaching the Fogo A depoists).
