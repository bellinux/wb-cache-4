Fourth, sixth and eighth-order homogeneous polynomials are considered. For the computation of the coefficients of the fourth-order polynomial an improved set of analytic formulas is proposed. For sixth and eighth-order polynomials the identification uses optimization. Simple constraints on the optimization process are shown to lead to real-valued convex functions. A general method to extend the above plane stress criteria to full 3 D stress states is also suggested. Besides their simplicity in formulation, {{it is found that}} polynomial <b>yield</b> <b>functions</b> are capable to model a wide range of anisotropic plastic properties (e. g., the Numisheet&# 8217; 93 mild steel, AA 2008 -T 4, AA 2090 -T 3).

40|$|A general {{asymmetric}} <b>yield</b> <b>function</b> {{is proposed}} with {{dependence on the}} stress invariants for pressure sensitive metals. The pressure sensitivity of the proposed <b>yield</b> <b>function</b> {{is consistent with the}} experimental result of Spitzig and Richmond (1984) for steel and aluminum alloys while the asymmetry of the third invariant is preserved to model strength differential (SD) effect of pressure insensitive materials. The proposed <b>yield</b> <b>function</b> is transformed in the space of the stress triaxaility, the von Mises stress and the normalized invariant to theoretically investigate the possible reason of the SD effect. The proposed plasticity model is further extended to characterize the anisotropic behavior of metals both in tension and compression. The extension of the <b>yield</b> <b>function</b> is realized by introducing two distinct fourth-order linear transformation tensors of the stress tensor for the second and third invariants, respectively. The extended <b>yield</b> <b>function</b> reasonably models the evolution of yield surfaces for a zirconium clock-rolled plate during in-plane and through-thickness compression reported by Plunkett et al.
