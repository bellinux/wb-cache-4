2500|$|Jack DeVries of IGN {{gave the}} game a 5.5/10 and stated [...] "Disney's Think Fast {{has a nice}} {{presentation}} that combines some classic and popular Disney franchises. And while it's not original, the Buzz games are decent games to copy for a license title. However the overly simple questions limit the game to only very young children. More importantly the game repeats questions and has delayed controls that mess up {{the very nature of}} a quiz game. If there are some major Disney movie fans in <b>your</b> <b>household</b> this game might be entertaining for a round or two, but you're way better off getting something like the Disney branded Scene It or Trivial Pursuit games." [...] Austin Light of GameSpot, who gave the game a 5/10, stated [...] "This family-friendly trivia game is fun while it lasts, but its mostly easy questions are repeated far too frequently." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Emilius," [...] said he, [...] "I had {{understood}} that <b>your</b> <b>household</b> was the best-ordered in Rome. What is amiss with you this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish to {{ask your}} ladyship whether you propose to {{recognize}} me {{in the presence of}} <b>your</b> <b>household</b> as the late Colonel Roseberry's daughter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he added, [...] "I grieved to {{hear that}} you and <b>your</b> <b>household</b> were so much exposed to the witchcrafts of that same woman, sir." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What is {{your child}} to me? What are the {{fortunes}} of affections of man or woman, at such an hour as this?' cried the Pagan, as he stood by Numerian, with features horribly animated by the emotions of fierce delight and triumph that were raging within him at the prospect he beheld. 'Dotard, look from this window! Listen to those voices! The gods whom I serve, the god whom you and your worship would fain have destroyed, have risen to avenge themselves at last! Behold those suburbs, they are left desolate! Hear those cries--they are from Roman lips!
