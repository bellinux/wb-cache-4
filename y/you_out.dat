Lee Barron, in his essay The Seven Ages of Kylie Minogue: Postmodernism, Identity, and Performative Mimicry, noted that the song [...] "further established Minogue's cultural and commercial relevance in the new millennium." [...] He remarked that the song [...] "with its hypnotic ’la la la’ refrain and the deceptively uncomplicated, catchily repetitive beats and synth-sound, marked yet another clearly defined image transformation from the camp-infused Light Years to an emphasis upon a cool, machine-like sexuality, a trait clearly identifiable within the promotional video for ’Can’t Get <b>You</b> <b>Out</b> of My Head.’" [...] Similarly, Everett True from The Guardian wrote that the song continued the [...] "change in the marketing and public perception of Kylie" [...] and her transition from the [...] "homely girl-next-door" [...] to [...] "a much more flirtatious, sophisticated persona" [...] that started with the release of [...] "Spinning Around" [...] in 2000. True also felt that the success of [...] "Can't Get <b>You</b> <b>Out</b> of My Head" [...] was one of the motivating factors behind [...] "manufactured" [...] pop music gaining a [...] "new postmodern respectability" [...] and marked a [...] "clear shift in attitude towards pop music among the 'serious' rock critic fraternity: the idea that (manufactured, female) pop music might well be the equal of (organic, male) rock music after all, that each has their high points and their low." [...] In 2011, Minogue's official website posted a special article marking the song's 10th anniversary on 8 September, the release date of [...] "Can't Get <b>You</b> <b>Out</b> of My Head" [...] in Australia. [...] "Can't Get <b>You</b> <b>Out</b> of My Head" [...] is recognised as Minogue's signature song.|$|E
