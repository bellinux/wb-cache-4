500|$|Wintour {{is often}} {{described}} as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. [...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says. [...] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to," [...] agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.|$|E
500|$|Zaillian {{discussed}} many of {{the themes}} in Larsson's Millennium series with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers. Fincher {{was familiar with the}} concept, from projects such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Zaillian commented, [...] "A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they get off on destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different." [...] The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly misogyny. [...] "We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But at the same time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed." [...] Instead of the typical three-act structure, they reluctantly chose a five-act structure, which Fincher pointed out is [...] "very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

'If you're in no {{particular}} hurry,' said Joe after a short silence, 'and will bear with the pace of this poor jade, I shall be glad to ride on with you to the Warren, sir, and hold your horse when you dismount.

50|$|With {{the traffic}} {{and all the}} pollution, I keeps saying cars ought to be abolished. With a car you can't feel the wind on your face or the sky like you can on a bike.

6000|$|She {{looked at}} me earnestly, and, {{although}} there was a certain solicitude in her gaze, I could also see there signs of great relief.

5000|$|At {{the transit}} camp the British soldier {{normally}} made his acquaintance with the kite-hawk black kite, known familiarly as the 'shite-hawk'. 'There {{used to be}} thousands of them,' remembers Charles Wright. 'When one drew one's food from the cook-house and went to take it across {{to the dining room}} to eat at the tables underneath the sheds, these kite-hawks would swoop down and take the lot off your plate if you weren't careful. So <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> waving your arms above the plate until you got it under cover.' Charles Allen ...|$|R

60|$|I {{was in one}} of {{the proud}} two-storied houses in the place, and could have shaken hands with my friends without from the upper windows. To get out of doors <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> upstairs. The outlook was a sea of snow fading into white hills and sky with the quarry {{standing}} out red and ragged to the right like a rock in the ocean. The Auld Licht manse was gone, but had left its garden-trees behind, their lean branches soft with snow. Roofs were humps in the white blanket. The spire of the Established Kirk stood up cold and stiff, like a monument to the buried inhabitants.|$|R

60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, I was back within the week. Rocky Todd, the pal I went to stay with, is a rummy sort of a chap who lives all alone {{in the wilds of}} Long Island, and likes it; but a little of that sort of thing goes a long way with me. Dear old Rocky is one of the best, but after a few days in his cottage in the woods, miles away from anywhere, New York, even with Motty on the premises, began to look pretty good to me. The days down on Long Island have forty-eight hours in them; you can't get to sleep at night because of the bellowing of the crickets; and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> two miles for a drink and six for an evening paper. I thanked Rocky for his kind hospitality, and caught the only train they have down in those parts. It landed me in New York about dinner-time. I went {{straight}} to the old flat. Jeeves came out of his lair. I looked round cautiously for Rollo.|$|E

60|$|All {{along the}} Champs Elysees were urns of plaster-of-Paris destined to contain funeral incense and flames; columns {{decorated}} with huge flags of blue, red, and white, embroidered with shining crowns, eagles, and N's in gilt paper, and statues of plaster representing Nymphs, Triumphs, Victories, or other female personages, painted in oil {{so as to}} represent marble. Real marble could have had no better effect, {{and the appearance of}} the whole was lively and picturesque in the extreme. On each pillar was a buckler, of the color of bronze, bearing the name and date of a battle in gilt letters: <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> through a mile-long avenue of these glorious reminiscences, telling of spots where, in the great imperial days, throats had been victoriously cut.|$|R

5000|$|Before E3, game {{publishers}} went {{to other}} trade shows to display new or upcoming products; {{these include the}} Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and the European Computer Trade Show. As the game industry grew rapidly during the early 1990s, industry professionals felt that it had outgrown the older trade shows. According to Tom Kalinske, CEO of Sega America, [...] "The CES organizers used to put the video games industry way, way in the back. In 1991 they {{put us in a}} tent, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> past all the porn vendors to find us. That particular year it was pouring rain, and the rain leaked right over our new Genesis system. I was just furious with the way CES treated the video games industry, and I felt we were a more important industry than they were giving us credit for." [...] Sega did not return to the CES the following year, and several other companies exited from further CES shows.|$|R

6000|$|And {{who remembers}} the renown'd New York [...] "Tabernacle" [...] {{of those days}} [...] "before the war"? It was {{on the east side}} of Broadway, near Pearl street--was a great turtle-shaped hall, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> back from the street {{entrance}} thro' a long wide corridor to get to it--was very strong--had an immense gallery--altogether held three or four thousand people. Here the huge annual conventions of the windy and cyclonic [...] "reformatory societies" [...] of those times were held--especially the tumultuous Anti-Slavery ones. I remember hearing Wendell Phillips, Emerson, Cassius Clay, John P. Hale, Beecher, Fred Douglas, the Burleighs, Garrison, and others. Sometimes the Hutchinsons would sing--very fine. Sometimes there were angry rows. A chap named Isaiah Rhynders, a fierce politician of those days, with a band of robust supporters, would attempt to contradict the speakers and break up the meetings. But the Anti-Slavery, and Quaker, and Temperance, and Missionary and other conventicles and speakers were tough, tough, and always maintained their ground, and carried out their programs fully. I went frequently to these meetings, May after May--learn'd much from them--was sure to be on hand when J. P. Hale or Cash Clay made speeches.|$|R
