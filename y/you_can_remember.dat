[...] In his reply, Pound pointed out that Hemingway had only lost [...] "the time it will... take you to rewrite the parts <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember...</b> If the middle, i.e., FORM, of the story is right then one {{ought to be able to}} reassemble it from memory... If the thing wobbles and won't reform... then it never wd. have been right." [...] Critics are uncertain whether he took Pound's advice and re-created existing stories or whether everything he wrote after the loss of the suitcase was new.|$|E
500|$|SF writer Alfred Bester, {{an editor}} of Holiday Magazine and a {{sophisticated}} Manhattanite, recounted at some length his [...] "one demented meeting" [...] with Campbell, a man he imagined from afar to be [...] "a combination of Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford." [...] The first thing Campbell said to him was that Freud was dead, destroyed by the new discovery of Dianetics, which, he predicted, would win L. Ron Hubbard the Nobel Peace Prize. Campbell ordered the bemused Bester to [...] "think back. Clear yourself. Remember! <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> when your mother tried to abort you with a button hook. You've never stopped hating her for it." [...] Bester commented: [...] "It reinforced my private opinion {{that a majority of}} the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles." ...|$|E
500|$|In revisiting {{the film}} in the 1970s, Arthur Schlesinger noted that Hollywood films {{generally}} age well, revealing an unexpected depth or integrity, {{but in the case}} of Gone with the Wind time has not treated it kindly. Richard Schickel posits that one measure of a film's quality is to ask what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> of it, and the film falls down in this regard: unforgettable imagery and dialogue are simply not present. Stanley Kauffmann, likewise, also found the film to be a largely forgettable experience, claiming he could only remember two scenes vividly. Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this down to it being [...] "badly written", in turn describing the dialogue as [...] "flowery" [...] and possessing a [...] "picture postcard" [...] sensibility. Schickel also believes the film fails as popular art, in that it has limited rewatch value—a sentiment that Kauffmann also concurs with, stating that having watched it twice he hopes [...] "never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs". Both Schickel and Andrew Sarris identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being [...] "created" [...] or [...] "directed", but rather having emerged [...] "steaming from the crowded kitchen", where the main creative force was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible.|$|E

These {{are some of}} the experiences we had as children that connected us with the natural environment. While they may not be part of our conscious thought as adults they are significant nonetheless in shaping who we are and our values about the natural environment. Chawla (1990 p 18) poetically describes these experiences as "radioactive jewels buried within us, emitting energy across the years of our life". Sebba (1991 p 395) suggests that the natural landscapes of childhood become the inner landscapes of adulthood. What we explored as children in the natural environment is carried within us throughout life. If experiences with the natural environment are of such great import in our lives, we must question where these experiences are in the lives of children today. Every Australian early childhood educator has observed the increasing busyness of children's lives and an orientation away from nature towards the latest toy, electronic gadget o...|$|R
