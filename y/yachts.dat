5|$|In the Grand Banks of Canada, {{the threat}} of the {{hurricane}} prompted fishing boats to venture back to port. In the Bay of Fundy, foggy conditions drove an ocean liner aground. Across Nova Scotia, rough seas washed a boat near Dartmouth, a schooner near Halifax, four <b>yachts</b> in Chester, and another three boats in Shelburne ashore. In addition, eleven <b>yachts</b> in Chester sank during the storm. The seas flooded a coastal road and nearby field in Prospect, destroying a garage. In Cow Bay, a man drowned after falling off of a yacht. Rough seas halted ferry service between Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, as well as between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; other ferry service across the region were delayed.|$|E
