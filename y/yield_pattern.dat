Average yield data from seven irrigated maize fields were used to study the <b>yield</b> <b>pattern</b> considering the distance of plants to flow accumulation lines. It was found that there is a significant correlation between average yield and distance to flow accumulation lines (DFL). This correlation is best represented by a polynomial function. The most common shape of the <b>yield</b> <b>pattern</b> curve considering the distance to flow accumulation lines shows that there is an increase in average yield with DFL from 0 to 12. 5 – 17. 5 m. Near the flow lines the average yield presents lower values due to drainage problems causing plant growth problems. It was also observed higher yield variability near the flow lines. For higher distances from the flow lines there is a continuous decrease in average yield due to less water availability and other variations of soil properties...|$|E

The optimum process design provides refiners with the flexibility to move up or down the optimal economic range of the propylene yield curve as shown in Fig.  3. From Fig.  3, it can be seen that higher propylene production comes at the expense of gasoline. For traditional refiners, maximizing gasoline yield is more important than the propylene yield, while for those interested in petrochemical applications, the target is operating at maximum propylene yield.|$|E

The conditions required for this process have been examined in terms of the parameters for adiabatic expansion from high temperature and density. There have been many developments regarding core-collapse supernova and neutron star merger models of the r-process. Meteoritic data and observations of metal-poor stars have demonstrated the diversity of r-process sources. Stellar observations have also found some regularity in r-process abundance patterns and large dispersions in r-process abundances at low metallicities. This review summarizes the recent results from parametric studies, astrophysical models, and observational studies of the r-process.

40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the mechanisms driving spatiotemporal yield variability in rice systems is insufficient for effective management at the sub-field scale. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential of precision management for rice production. The spatiotemporal properties of multiyear yield monitor data from four rice fields, representing varying soil types and locations within the primary rice growing region in California, were quantified and characterized. The role of water management, land-leveling, and the spatial distribution of soil properties in driving yield heterogeneity was explored. Mean yield and coefficient of variation at the sampling points within each field ranged from 9. 2 to 12. 1 Mg ha - 1 and from 7. 1 to 14. 5 %, respectively. Using a k-means clustering and randomization method, temporally stable <b>yield</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified in three of the four fields. Redistribution of dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, potassium and salts by lateral flood water movement was observed across all fields, but was only related to yield variability via exacerbating areas with high soil salinity. The effects of cold water temperature and land-leveling on yield variability were not observed. Soil electrical conductivity and/or plant available phosphorus were identified as the underlying causes of the within-field <b>yield</b> <b>patterns</b> using classification and regression trees. Our results demonstrate that while the high temporal yield variability in some rice fields does not permit precision management, in other fields exhibiting stable <b>yield</b> <b>patterns</b> with identifiable causes, precision management and modified water management may improve the profitability and resource-use efficiency of rice production systems. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

These values point to performance at or near ‘Collapse Prevention’.

The former showed continuous fruit set (four to five fruits/plant/week), whereas the latter showed fluctuations in fruit set. Fluctuations in weekly fruit set, expressed as the ratio between standard deviation of weekly fruit set and the mean of weekly fruit set (CV), were much lower for the cultivars with small fruits (0. 44 to 0. 49) than for the cultivars with large fruits (1. 1 to 1. 6). Fluctuations in weekly fruit yield varied between 0. 51 and 0. 77 for cultivars with small fruits and between 1. 04 and 1. 45 for cultivars with large fruits. Fluctuations in fruit yield were significantly positively correlated (Pearson R = 0. 87) with fluctuations in fruit set.

40|$|Sweet pepper {{production}} {{is characterized by}} large fluctuations in fruit yield per week. Synchronization of yield patterns between nurseries in response to weather conditions leads to variations in market supply and affects price formation. In order to improve supply chain efficiency, auctions and wholesalers require nurseries to supply production forecasts several weeks in advance. At the nursery level, yield prediction is helpful for efficient labour planning. Because the dynamics of sweet pepper production are complex, growers {{find it difficult to}} understand and effectively control the production process. A model can be useful to assist growers in making efficient decisions with regard to crop and climate management.
