40|$|Background: Girls {{adopted from}} {{developing}} countries often have early or precocious puberty, requiring treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. During such treatment, decreased growth velocity is frequent. Aim: To study whether {{the addition of}} growth hormone (GH) to GnRH analogue treatment improves final height in girls with early or precocious puberty. Methods: Forty-six girls with early or precocious puberty (age {{less than or equal}} to 9. 5 <b>y)</b> <b>adopted</b> from developing countries were randomized for treatment for 2 - 4 y with GnRH analogue, or with a combination of GH and GnRH analogue. Results: During treatment, the mean growth velocity in the GH/GnRH analogue group was significantly higher compared to the control group. Combined GH/GnRH analogue treatment resulted in a higher final height: 158. 9 cm compared to 155. 8 cm in the GnRH analogue-treated group. Three out of 24 girls (13 %) in the combined group and nine of the 22 girls (41 %) treated with GnRH analogue alone attained a final height below - 2 standard deviation scores (SDS). Conclusion: The difference between the two groups is statistically significant, and possibly of clinical importance. A future challenge is to identify a subgroup with clinically significant advantage of GH addition to GnRH analogue treatment. Being very short on arrival in Sweden and being short and young at start of treatment are possible indicators...|$|E

These fibrils are composed of monoclonal light chain protein secreted from an abnormal proliferation of bone marrow plasma cells. We previously reported that amyloidogenic light chain protein AL- 09 adopts an altered dimer while its germline protein (κI O 18 /O 8) forms a canonical dimer observed in other light chain crystal structures. In solution, conformational heterogeneity obscures all NMR signals at the AL- 09 and κI O 18 /O 8 dimer interfaces, so we solved the nuclear magnetic resonance structure of two related mutants.

Both Y and Nb cat-ions substitute for Zr in the cation network but maintain rather different local oxygen coordination from Zr. In tetragonal zirconia solid sol$ons, <b>Y</b> <b>adopts</b> a YO, structure with a bond length of 2. 32 A. This {{is the same as}} the struc-ture found in Zr 0,-Y,O, solid solutions, confirming our previous conclusion that Y is not associated with oxygen vacangies.

The strong Nb- 0 coordination increases the bonding dis-parity between Zr- 0 layers, thus increasing tetragonality. This is similar to the trend previously established for Zr 0,-GeO, solid solutions. Severe distortion of neighboring cat-ions around the undersized Nb, similar to that previously found for undersized Fe 3 + and Ga 3 +, is also observed.

Using data mining of the protein data bank (PDB), we have collected statistics connecting the propensity between the protein sequence and the secondary structure. This new tool has enabled us to evaluate new structures {{as well as a}} family of structures. A comparison of the wild type staphylococcal nuclease to various mutants using the proposed tool has indicated long-range conformational deviations spatially distant from the mutation point. The energetics of protein unfolding has been studied in terms of the forces observed in molecular dynamics simulations. An adaptive integration of the steered molecular dynamics is proposed to reduce ground state dominance by the rare low energy trajectories on the estimated free energy profile. The proposed adaptive algorithm is utilized to reproduce the potential of mean force of the stretching of decaalanine in vacuum at lower computational cost. It is then used to construct the potential of mean force of this transition in solvent {{for the first time as}} to observe the hydration effect on the helix-coil transformation. Adaptive steered molecular dynamics is also implemented to obtain the free energy change during the unfolding of neuropeptide Y and to confirm that the monomeric form of neuropeptide <b>Y</b> <b>adopts</b> halical-hairpin like pancreatic-polypeptide fold.

Boron ''stuffed'' phases were subsequently heated at 1750 K within a high-frequency furnace. Crystal structures were determined for both binary and ternary series of compounds from single-crystal X-ray data: hexagonal symmetry, space group P 63 /mcm, Z ¼ 2. Boron insertion in the host binary silicides results {{in a very small}} decrease of the unit cell parameters with respect to those of the binaries. According to X-ray data, partial or nearly full boron occupancy of the interstitial octahedral sites in the range 0. 6 - 1 is found. The magnetic properties of these compounds were characterized by the onset of magnetic ordering below 100 K. Boron insertion induces a modification of the transition temperature and yp values in most of the antiferromagnetic binary silicides, {{with the exception of the}} ternary phase Er 5 Si 3 Bx which was found to undergo a ferromagnetic transition at 14 K. The electrical resistivities for all binary silicides and ternary boron-interstitial phases resemble the temperature dependence of metals, with characteristic changes of slope in the resistivity curves due to the reduced electron scattering in the magnetically ordered states. Zintl-Klemm concept would predict a limiting composition RE 5 Si 3 B 0. 6 for a valence compound and should then preclude the stoichiometric formula RE 5 Si 3 B.

40|$|Poster Presentation: P 72 Protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination, play {{important}} roles in many aspects of cellular mechanisms. Its defective regulation results in diseases that range from developmental abnormalities to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L 1 (UCH-L 1) is a protein of 223 amino acids, which is highly abundant in brain, constituting up to 2 % of total brain proteins. Although it was originally characterized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, recent studies indicate that it also functions as a ubiquitin ligase and a mono-Ub stabilizer. Down-regulation and extensive oxidative modifications of UCH-L 1 have been observed in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Of importance, I 93 M and S 18 Y point mutations in the UCH-L 1 gene {{have been reported to}} be linked to susceptibility to and protection from PD respectively. Hence, the structure of UCH-L 1 and the effects of disease associated mutations on the structure and function are of considerable interest. Our circular dichroism studies suggest that the S 18 Y point mutation only slightly perturbs the structure while a significant decrease in the α-helical content is observed in the I 93 M mutant. We have determined the solution structure of S 18 Y and mapping its interaction with ubiquitin by chemical shift perturbation approach. The electrostatic surface potential analysis reveals that the interaction between ubiquitin and UCH-L 1 -S 18 Y is primarily electrostatic in nature, with negatively charged residues on the surface of UCH-L 1 -S 18 Y interacting with the positively charged residues on the basic face of ubiquitin. Although the active site and the L 8 loop in UCH-L 1 -S 18 <b>Y</b> <b>adopts</b> conformations similar to that observed in the crystal structure of UCH-L 1 -WT, both the altered hydrogen bond network and surface charge distributions have demonstrated that the S 18 Y substitution could lead to profound structural changes. In particular, the difference in the dimeric interfaces of the wild-type and the S 18 Y mutant has shown that mutation can significantly affect the distribution of the surface-exposed residues involved in the dimeric interface. Such observed difference might weaken the stability of the UCH-L 1 dimer and hence may explain the reduced dimerization-dependent ligase activity of UCH-L 1 -S 18 Y in comparison to UCH-L 1 -WT. postprin...|$|R

In these Ce-Ca oxyfluorides, F- anions have a great affinity for Ca 2 + cations leading to an increase of the F amount with the Ca content. The absence of FCe 4 environment is explained from a steric standpoint: the F-Ce bond lengths in the network are too short to accept fluorine ions in the vicinity of four Ce 4 + cations.

ANITA finds (rightly) that [...] "1 sandwich and 3 biscuits cost 3d.," [...] and proceeds [...] "therefore 1 sandwich = 1-1/2d., 3 biscuits = 1-1/2d., 1 lemonade = 6d." [...] DINAH MITE begins like ANITA: and thence proves (rightly) that a biscuit costs less than a 1d.: whence she concludes (wrongly) that it must cost 1/2d. F. C. W. is so beautifully resigned to the certainty of a verdict of [...] "guilty," [...] that I have hardly the heart to utter the word, without adding a [...] "recommended to mercy owing to extenuating circumstances." [...] But really, you know, where are the extenuating circumstances? She begins by assuming that lemonade is 4d. a glass, and sandwiches 3d. each, (making with the 2 given equations, four conditions to be fulfilled by three miserable unknowns!). And, having (naturally) developed this into a contradiction, she then tries 5d. and 2d. with a similar result. (N.B. This process might have been carried on through {{the whole of the}} Tertiary Period, without gratifying one single Megatherium.) She then, by a [...] "happy thought," [...] tries half-penny biscuits, and so obtains a consistent result. This may be a good solution, viewing the problem as a conundrum: but it is not scientific. JANET identifies sandwiches with biscuits! [...] "One sandwich + 3 biscuits" [...] she makes equal to [...] "4." [...] Four what? MAYFAIR makes the astounding assertion that the equation, s + 3b = 3, [...] "is evidently only satisfied by s = 3/2, b = 1/2"! OLD CAT believes that the assumption that a sandwich costs 1-1/2d. is [...] "the only way to avoid unmanageable fractions." [...] But why avoid them? Is there not a certain glow of triumph in taming such a fraction? [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, the fraction now before you is one that for years defied all efforts of a refining nature: it was, in a word, hopelessly vulgar. Treating it as a circulating decimal (the treadmill of fractions) only made matters worse. As a last resource, I reduced it to its lowest terms, and extracted its square root!" [...] Joking apart, let me thank OLD CAT for some very kind words of sympathy, in reference to a correspondent (whose name I am happy to say I have now forgotten) who had found fault with me as a discourteous critic. O. V. L. is beyond my comprehension. He takes the given equations as (1) and (2): thence, by the process [(2)-(1)] deduces (rightly) equation (3) viz. s + 3b = 3: and thence again, by the process [x3] (a hopeless mystery), deduces 3s + 4b = 4. I have nothing to say about it: I give it up. SEA-BREEZE says [...] "it is immaterial to the answer" [...] (why?) [...] "in what proportion 3d. is divided between the sandwich and the 3 biscuits": so she assumes s = l-1/2d., b = 1/2d. STANZA is one of a very irregular metre. At first she (like JANET) identifies sandwiches with biscuits. She then tries two assumptions (s = 1, b = 2/3, and s = 1/2 b = 5/6), and (naturally) ends in contradictions. Then she returns to the first assumption, and finds the 3 unknowns separately: quod est absurdum. STILETTO identifies sandwiches and biscuits, as [...] "articles." [...] Is the word ever used by confectioners? I fancied [...] "What is the next article, Ma'am?" [...] was limited to linendrapers. TWO SISTERS first assume that biscuits are 4 a penny, and then that they are 2 a penny, adding that [...] "the answer will of course be the same in both cases." [...] It is a dreamy remark, making one feel something like Macbeth grasping at the spectral dagger. [...] "Is this a statement that I see before me?" [...] If you were to say [...] "we both walked the same way this morning," [...] and I were to say [...] "one of you walked the same way, but the other didn't," [...] which of the three would be the most hopelessly confused? TURTLE PYATE (what is a Turtle Pyate, please?) and OLD CROW, who send a joint answer, and <b>Y.</b> <b>Y.,</b> <b>adopt</b> the same method. Y. Y. gets the equation s + 3b = 3: and then says [...] "this sum must be apportioned in one of the three following ways." [...] It may be, I grant you: but Y. Y. do you say [...] "must"? I fear it is possible for Y. Y. to be two Y's. The other two conspirators are less positive: they say it [...] "can" [...] be so divided: but they add [...] "either of the three prices being right"! This is bad grammar and bad arithmetic at once, oh mysterious birds! ...|$|R
40|$|As {{clothing}} {{is the most}} visible type of consumption, what we wear often {{says a lot about}} who we are. We buy what we consider in line with our identity and avoid what we consider as not. Our consumption is influenced by a number of factors, whether internal or external and throughout the years we adopt a certain way of style. As our style evolves, on it depended fashion consumption is also going through a major change. In this master thesis, we present a study of young women from Generation <b>Y,</b> which <b>adopted</b> a style based on their personal needs, desires, and reflections on own body, and decided not to show their femininity in a predictable manner. Opinions on what is considered feminine vary across regions but in this research, we take an interest in Western culture consumers born and located in Europe. By adopting the modest style, women interviewed {{for the purpose of this}} study are perceived as challenging the stereotypical views of the female body, which is in the contemporary society and media often shown as an object of male desire, by wearing unisex, oversized, loose fit, deconstructed and even menswear garments. By the method of personal interviews, we asked nine young women about their opinions and reflections on their fashion consumption and views on communicating their self-identity and femininity through their individual take on the modest style. The research has, in addition to literature introducing symbolic consumption and the concept of the self, its foundation in framework discussing feminine identity and relation of the dress and the body. Based on the findings, the thesis presents an analysis of young women’s construction of feminine identity through modest style and reasons and clues influencing their fashion consumption. Through adaptation of modest style, young women purchase garments closely in line with their values and needs and are rarely influenced by opinions of their social groups. By dressing modestly, they demonstrate their femininity in an alternative way and priority in their fashion consumption is given to durable and timeless garments of high quality. In conclusion, we can see that participants are not only modest in their style, but also in the way they consume. Abandoning the presumption that Generation Y was “born to shop”, they are likely to invest in brand concepts with added value in form of appealing brand aesthetics, inspiring retail environment, outstanding personal approach or sustainable production of garments. By repairing or reselling their garments, buying them in second hand or from brands that produce their garments in an ethical way, today’s young women show that they are aware of environmental and political impacts of fashion, and their motivation to buy certain products is highly influenced by individual preferences and deeply rooted in their self-identity...|$|R

The series of eight 5 -(TeY) - 6 -(SePh) acenaphthenes (Y = Fp (2), Tol (3), An-p (4), An-o (5), Tp (6), Mes (7), Tip (8), Nap (9)) were prepared and structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography, solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT/B 3 LYP) calculations. All members of the series, except 5, adopt a BA type configuration comparable to the parent compound 1 (Y = Ph), aligning the Te-CY bond along the mean acenaphthene plane and promoting a nonbonded Se [...] . Te-CY 3 c- 4 e type interaction to form to stabilise the molecule (G-dependence). 5 (<b>Y</b> = An-o) <b>adopts</b> a BC type conformation in the solid but DFT calculations show this optimises to BA. Indication of strong through-space peri-interactions between Te and Se are observed in the Se- 77 and Te- 125 NMR spectra, with J(Te, Se) spin-spin coupling constants (SSCCs) in the range - 688 to - 748 Hz. Evidence supporting the presence of this interaction was also found in solid-state NMR spectra of some of the compounds which exhibit an indirect spin-spin coupling on the same order of magnitude as observed in solution. In order to quantify the steric bulk of the aryl groups (Y), we introduce the crystallographic steric parameter (theta), the cone angle measured from the furthest H atoms lying on the edges of the cone to the Te atom located at its vertex. Modification to Y has no apparent influence over the conformation of the molecule, the degree of molecular distortion occurring in the acenaphthene backbone or the extent of 3 c- 4 e interaction; peri-distances for all eight compounds are within 0. 08 angstrom and no apparent correlation is observed between the steric bulk of Y (theta) and the Se- 77 chemical shifts or J(Te, Se) SSCCs. In contrast, a good correlation is found between theta and Te- 125 chemical shifts. DFT calculations performed on all members of the series confirm the comparable covalent bonding between Te and Se in the series, with WBIs of ca. 0. 1 obtained. Natural bond orbital analysis shows a noticeable donor-acceptor interaction between a p-type lone pair on Se and a sigma*(Te-C) antibonding orbital, confirming the onset of 3 c- 4 e type bonding.

40|$|In Kenya, rarely {{are cases}} {{concerning}} data security breaches on commercial banks reported or documented. This does not however {{mean that there}} are no such cases or that the information systems used by the commercial banks are completely secure. In as much as due diljgeoce d gross assessment of usage, vulnerability, security and recovery of the systems <b>adopted</b> <b>y</b> these banks is done before their adoption, it is worth to note that the human brain has remained superior to computers, implying therefore that the information stored within these information systems is not fool proof and that there do exist risks of manipulation of their data by rogue and systematic users. Further, limited study has been carried out to determine factors that influence data security in the Information systems used by the banks. Occurrence of a breach in data security is unpredictable and as such, informed defence against their occurrence is critical. It is against this backdrop that this study seeks to establish the factors that influence data security in commercial banks. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the factors that influence data security in the management information systems used by commercial banks in Nairobi, Kenya. The study will adopt a cross-sectional survey in which different banks will be studied. Primary data was collected using a questionnaire while an extensive literature review has been done using various secondary sources. The target population was the information security staff working in the headquarters of commercial banks located in Nairobi. A census for all the banks in Nairobi was carried out and the study targeted two respondents per bank, at two strata; one senior IT manager and a general IT technician. Questionnaires were distributed at all the bank's headquarters and collected after a period of seven days. Introduction correspondence were done through email to all the bank's human resource department which were requested to allocate two random respondents. The data collected was thereafter coded andentered into SPSS and analysed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation. Out of 86 questionnaires distributed 66 were successfully completed and refilmed by respondents from 34 commercial banks, giving questionnaire response rate of 76. 721 - : The results indicates thattype of data increases chances of breach attempts. The amount of data is strongly positively correlated with data integrity and network security. The study also established that customers have contributed to cases of fraud due to poor handling of their data. Majority of respondents indicated that their organization have experienced frauds through use of hostile technology e. g. ATM skimming. From the research findings, it can be concluded that type and size of data, user knowledge and hostile technology does influence data integrity and network security. The research therefore concludes that both sufficient financial and human resources should be deployed by the commercial banks to deal with data security. This study identifies key factors in banks data that might compromise data security with a view to educating the stewards of banks influencing their direction of designing systems to guarantee banks data integrity and network security. The research recommends that for the integrity of the data and network security the top management should support effective training,skill up-grading and awareness mechanisms to bank employees that would respond and continuously adapt to emerging technological challenges in the bank's MIS infrastructure.
