500|$|Yellow fever is {{the most}} notorious disease caused by a flavivirus. The last major {{epidemic}} in the US occurred in 1905. During {{the building of the}} Panama Canal thousands of workers died from the disease. Yellow fever originated in Africa and the virus was brought to the Americas on cargo ships, which were harbouring the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus. The first recorded epidemic in Africa occurred in Ghana, in West Africa, in 1926. In the 1930s the disease re-emerged in Brazil. Fred Soper, an American epidemiologist (1893–1977), discovered the importance of the sylvatic cycle of infection in non-human hosts, and that infection of humans was a [...] "dead end" [...] that broke this cycle. Although the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{is one of the most}} successful ever developed, epidemics [...] continue to occur. In [...] 1986–91 in West Africa, [...] over 20,000people were infected, 4,000 of whom died.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{immunogenicity}} of three <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccines</b> from WHO- 17 D and Brazilian 17 DD substrains (different seed-lots). METHODS: An equivalence trial {{was carried out}} involving 1, 087 adults in Rio de Janeiro. Vaccines produced by Bio-Manguinhos, Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were administered following standardized procedures adapted to allow blocked randomized allocation of participants to coded vaccine types (double-blind). Neutralizing <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> antibody titters were compared in pre- and post-immunization serum samples. Equivalence {{was defined as a}} difference of no more than five percentage points in seroconversion rates, and ratio between Geometric Mean Titters (GMT) higher than 0. 67. RESULTS: Seroconversion rates were 98 % or higher among subjects previously seronegative, and 90 % or more of the total cohort of vaccinees, including those previously seropositive. Differences in seroconversion ranged from - 0. 05 % to - 3. 02 %. The intensity of the immune response was also very similar across vaccines: 14. 5 to 18. 6 IU/mL. GMT ratios ranged from 0. 78 to 0. 93. Taking the placebo group into account, the vaccines explained 93 % of seroconversion. Viremia was detected in 2. 7 % of vaccinated subjects from Day 3 to Day 7. CONCLUSIONS: The equivalent immunogenicity of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccines</b> from the 17 D and 17 DD substrains was demonstrated {{for the first time in}} placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trial. The study completed the clinical validation process of a new vaccine seed-lot, provided evidence for use of alternative attenuated virus substrains in vaccine production for a major manufacturer, and for the utilization of the 17 DD vaccine in other countries...|$|R

We did a per-protocol analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 10 % for poliovirus seroprevalence and measles, rubella, and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> seroconversion, and (1 / 3) log 2 for log 2 -transformed antibody titres. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01847872. Findings: Between July 10, 2013, and May 8, 2014, we assessed 1662 infants for eligibility, of whom 1504 were enrolled into one of seven groups for vaccine interference and one of four groups for fractional dosing and alternative route of administration. The rubella and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> antibody titres were reduced by co-administration but the seroconversion rates achieved non-inferiority in both cases (rubella, − 4 · 5 % [95 % CI − 9 · 5 to − 0 · 1]; <b>yellow</b> <b>fever,</b> 1 · 2 % [– 2 · 9 to 5 · 5]). Measles and poliovirus responses were unaffected (measles, 6 · 8 % [95 % CI − 1 · 4 to 14 · 9]; poliovirus serotype 1, 1 · 6 % [– 6 · 7 to 4 · 7]; serotype 2, 0 · 0 % [– 2 · 1 to 2 · 1]; serotype 3, 0 · 0 % [– 3 · 8 to 3 · 9]). Poliovirus seroprevalence was universally high (> 97 %) after vaccination, but the antibody titres generated by fractional intradermal doses of IPV did not achieve non-inferiority compared with full dose. The number of infants who seroconverted or had a four-fold rise in titres was also lower by the intradermal route. There were no safety concerns. Interpretation: The data support the future co-administration of IPV, measles–rubella, and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccines</b> within the Expanded Programme on Immunization schedule at 9 months. The administration of single fractional intradermal doses of IPV by needle and syringe or disposable-syringe jet injector compromises the immunity generated, although it results in a high post-vaccination poliovirus seroprevalence.

40|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccines</b> (YF- 17 D- 204 and 17 DD) are {{considered}} to be among the safest vaccines and the presence of neutralizing antibodies is correlated with protection, although other immune effector mechanisms are known to be involved. T-cell responses are known {{to play an important role}} modulating antibody production and the killing of infected cells. However, little is known about the repertoire of T-cell responses elicited by the YF- 17 DD vaccine in humans. In this report, a library of 653 partially overlapping 15 -mer peptides covering the envelope (Env) and nonstructural (NS) proteins 1 to 5 of the vaccine was utilized to perform a comprehensive analysis of the virus-specific CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T-cell responses. The T-cell responses were screened ex-vivo by IFN-γ ELISPOT assays using blood samples from 220 YF- 17 DD vaccinees collected two months to four years after immunization. Each peptide was tested in 75 to 208 separate individuals of the cohort. The screening identified sixteen immunodominant antigens that elicited activation of circulating memory T-cells in 10 % to 33 % of the individuals. Biochemical in-vitro binding assays and immunogenetic and immunogenicity studies indicated that each of the sixteen immunogenic 15 -mer peptides contained two or more partially overlapping epitopes that could bind with high affinity to molecules of different HLAs. The prevalence of the immunogenicity of a peptide in the cohort was correlated with the diversity of HLA-II alleles that they could bind. These findings suggest that overlapping of HLA binding motifs within a peptide enhances its T-cell immunogenicity and the prevalence of the response in the population. In summary, the results suggests that in addition to factors of the innate immunity, "promiscuous" T-cell antigens might contribute to the high efficacy of the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although liver {{diseases}} transmissible among {{human populations}} were identified {{early in the}} history of medicine, the first known hepatitis with a viral etiological agent was Hepatitis A, in the picornaviridae family.

These vaccines contained HBV-infected human serum as a stabilizing agent. HBV was identified as a new DNA virus in the 1960s, followed a couple of decades later by the discovery of the flavivirus Hepatitis C.

Okell (7) found that a vaccine of the same general type lost its immunizing power rapidly on storage, and this would explain the failures to immunize persons far from {{the place where the}} vaccine was prepared.
