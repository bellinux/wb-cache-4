Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from thousands of <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had {{to be wary of}} larger and more dangerous carnivores. Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that they have come to fear. Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before.|$|E

Homo floresiensis also {{lived in the}} area up until 12,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> became extinct. Austronesian people, who form {{the majority of the}} modern population in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, and the Philippines, may have migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan.

Archaeologists refer these people as Deutero-Malays, whom are more advanced in farming techniques and metal knowledge than their indigenous counterpart, the Proto-Malays.|$|E
25|$|The Ch’ols of Chiapas {{migrated}} to the northwest of the state starting about 2,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were concentrated in Guatemala and Honduras. Those Ch’ols who remained in the south are distinguished by the name Chortís. Chiapas Ch’ols {{are closely related to}} the Chontal in Tabasco as well. Choles are found in Tila, Tumbalá, Sabanilla, Palenque, and Salto de Agua, with an estimated population of about 115,000 people. The Ch’ol language belongs to the Maya family and is related to Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Lacandon, Tojolabal, and Yucatec Mayan. There are three varieties of Chol (spoken in Tila, Tumbalá, and Sabanilla), all mutually intelligible. Over half of speakers are monolingual in the Chol language. Women wear a long navy blue or black skirt with a white blouse heavily embroidered with bright colors and a sash with a red ribbon. The men only occasionally use traditional dress for events such as the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This dress usually includes pants, shirts and huipils made of undyed cotton, with leather huaraches, a carrying sack and a hat. The fundamental economic activity of the Ch’ols is agriculture. They primarily cultivate corn and beans, as well as sugar cane, rice, coffee, and some fruits. They have Catholic beliefs strongly influenced by native ones. Harvests are celebrated on the Feast of Saint Rose on 30 August.|$|E

The success and wide community support for the National Science Foundation (NSF) CubeSat Program combined with the increasing number of NASA proposals that utilize CubeSats, and other large government organizations that have started funding CubeSats, demonstrates the maturation of the CubeSat platform. The natural gain provided by the large diameter UHF-, X- and S-Band Groundstations enables high data rates (e. g. 1. 5 Mbit, 150 times the typical 9. 6 Kbit for CubeSats over UHF). Government funded CubeSats using amateur radio frequencies violate the intent of the amateur radio service and it is a violation of National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) rules for a government funded ground station to use amateur radio frequencies to communicate with CubeSats. The NSF has led the charge in finding a suitable government frequency band for CubeSats. Although amateur frequency licensing is really easy and fast to obtain, it limits downlink data rate capability due to narrow spectrum bandwidth allocation. In addition to limited bandwidth allocation, using unencrypted and published downlink telemetry data, easily accessible by any receiver, has not satisfied the needs of universities, industry and government agencies.

As a familiar form factor we encounter in everyday life {{in the shape of}} strings, tapes or wires, the form of line provides various tangible interactions, including knotting, wrapping, tying, and connecting. Lines are also used to represent abstract information, from the original drawings using line from thousands of <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> to now <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are used to compose digital geometrical models through wireframe or Bézier data. The customization capability is another characteristic of line; strings or tape can be cut and rearranged to create various shapes and configurations. In this thesis, we will introduce "LineFORM, a novel concept for shape changing interfaces which uses physical lines to bridge the dynamic digital environment and the tangible physical world. Utilizing the versatile characteristics of lines mentioned above, we explore and define the design space for interactions with actuated curve interfaces. We implement two major versions of prototypes based on serpentine robotics technology to demonstrate a wide range of applications. For the applications, both digital and physical environment-based applications are being proposed. The system design and the implementation of LineFORM are evaluated through preliminary technical evaluation, and the limitations and future works are discussed. Through this initial design and technical exploration of actuated curve interfaces for interaction design, we envision the future where the adaptability and dynamism of digital environment will be seamlessly woven into our daily life. by Ken Nakagaki.

The best way to sum up the series is that it’s made up of little books on big topics. They are all short (100 to 150 pages of text). They all have the same subtitle—as in Architecture: A Very Short Introduction (a work I’ve come to rely on in my research on Shanghai, whenever I’m trying to keep straight which treaty-port era landmarks should be called “neo-classical,” which “art deco”) and Globalization: A Very Short Introduction (a book I wrote about for Newsweek International–fittingly enough, given the brevity of the book, in a mini-review that was only about 100 words long). And each VSI (easy to remember, rhymes with CSI: I’m not sure whether the publisher or the TV producers got there first with the abbreviation) is issued in the same attractive, shrunk-down format. They are just the right size to slip into the back pocket of your jeans. Unfortunately in one sense (but fortunately for my health and the health of my research account, lest I be tempted to squander too much of it on VSIs), I generally get to and from work by bike, so consuming them en route isn’t an option (though I suppose if they came as podcasts…). Having grown fond of the series and liking Mitter’s earlier books, The Manchurian Myth and A Bitter Revolution, I was eager to get my hands on an advance copy ofModern China, but then found myself feeling a bit anxious about reading it once it arrived. After all, it seemed possible (maybe even probable) that I’d come away disappointed, less enamored of the series than I had been.
