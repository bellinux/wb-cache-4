In his memoir, {{he said he}} hit upon using this less common variant for Dillon – a surname he had considered adopting – when he unexpectedly saw some poems by Dylan Thomas. Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked, [...] "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call <b>yourself</b> <b>what</b> {{you want to call}} yourself. This is the land of the free." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yoh's friend. He has a {{part-time}} job at a restaurant and, like Fumiya, he is calm and caring (fortunately, he has some common sense and is not as dense as Fumiya). Yoh says that ninety percent of what Asaoka says is out of kindness and that whoever goes out with him would be happy {{because of all the}} kind words he says. He once went on a date with Haruna to make Yoh jealous. When Yoh finally appears at the date Yui tells her that he was acting. He hides his true feelings in jokes, but when Mami tells him [...] "You're always deceiving yourself by passing things off as a joke, so...now you don't even know <b>yourself</b> <b>what</b> your true feelings are." [...] After that he told Haruna that he likes her, but she thought that he just was acting.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2008, Hirst {{contacted}} the Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS) demanding {{action be taken}} over works containing images of his skull sculpture For the Love of God made by a 16-year-old graffiti artist, Cartrain, and sold on the internet gallery 100artworks.com. [...] On {{the advice of his}} gallery, Cartrain handed over the artworks to DACS and forfeited the £200 he had made; he said, [...] "I met Christian Zimmermann [...] who told me Hirst personally ordered action on the matter." [...] In June 2009, copyright lawyer Paul Tackaberry compared the two images and said, [...] "This is fairly non-contentious legally. Ask <b>yourself,</b> <b>what</b> portion of the original–and not just the quantity but also the quality–appears in the new work? [...] If a 'substantial portion' of the 'original' appears in the new work, then that's all you need for copyright infringement... Quantitatively about 80% of the skull is in the second image." ...|$|E

2500|$|Simeona's {{version is}} {{influenced}} by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and Edgar Cayce. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative karma, saying that [...] "you have to experience by <b>yourself</b> <b>what</b> you have done to others." [...] But {{that you are the}} creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as [...] "things we had brought with us from other lifetimes." [...] Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in all of life and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly [...] "to release unhappy, negative experiences in past reincarnations, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'." [...] Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that [...] "(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness". Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages. She did not use mantras or conditioning exercises.|$|E
