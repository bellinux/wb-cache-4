5|$|During the Labour {{leadership}} campaign, {{he described}} himself as a socialist, and spoke out against some of the actions of the Blair ministry, including criticising its record on civil liberties and foreign policy. Though he was not <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> MP {{at the time of the}} 2003 vote, Miliband was a strong critic of the Iraq War. He backed UK military action and intervention in Afghanistan and Libya respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. <b>Yet,</b> <b>an</b> even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, {{the first}} edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the {{definitive}} reference for the language, as there was not <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> official standard. The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.|$|E
25|$|Taylor's theorem {{is named}} after the {{mathematician}} Brook Taylor, who stated a version of it in 1712. <b>Yet</b> <b>an</b> explicit expression of the error was not provided until much later on by Joseph-Louis Lagrange. An earlier version of the result was already mentioned in 1671 by James Gregory.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} that the main point is accurate, that Huxley was not {{effective}} in speaking to the large audience. He was not <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> accomplished speaker and wrote afterward that he had been inspired as to the value of oration by what he witnessed in that meeting.|$|E
50|$|Inexplicable, <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> Fact (Russian: Необъяснимо, но факт, often {{abbreviated}} as ННФ and {{has also}} been translated as Inexplicable, but Factual) was a popular TV show on TNT (Russian TV channel). Inexplicable, <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> Fact is among the earliest pseudo-documentary projects on the Russian television and has influenced several similar projects on other Russian TV channels: Fantastical Stories (REN TV), Cannot Be! (STS (TV channel)), X Files (DTV), and others. The series has begun shortly after Syfy's Ghost Hunters, possibly influenced {{by the success of}} the series, and before Discovery Channel's <b>A</b> Haunting. Inexplicable, <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> Fact, as well as the aforementioned pseudo-documentaries, root in Chariots of the Gods (film), with Inexplicable, <b>yet</b> <b>a</b> Fact heavily using the footage and ideas from the film in several episodes.|$|R

25|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>an</b> {{unresolved}} issue {{concerns the}} Christianity of independent Berbers after Roman rule, both Catholic and Donatist, i.e., Berber Christianity under the Vandals, Byzantines, and Arabs. Christianity never completely supplanted the ancient pagan beliefs of Berbers, mixed and augmented by Punic practices and later Greco-Roman. Nor did Christianity among the Berbers attain an enduring unity among its diverse and conflicting believers.|$|E
25|$|He is also {{a member}} of the UK Conservative Party and has {{expressed}} a desire to foment stronger links with the United Kingdom Conservative Party. A spokesman for the UK Conservative Party stated that Mr. Pearce, whilst not <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> official representative of the Conservative Party, had approached the party expressing an interest in re-establishing the Channel Islands branch of Conservatives Abroad and that he had been invited to talks in London.|$|E
25|$|One {{characteristic}} of creative people, {{as measured by}} some psychologists, is what is called divergent production. Divergent production {{is the ability of}} a person to generate a diverse assortment, <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. One way of measuring divergent production is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the musical}} plays were {{recorded}} and video-taped. Eighteen {{of them have been}} officially released on audio CD, two on DVD (Mais el Reem and Loulou). An unauthorized version of Petra and one such live version of Mais el Reem in black and white exist. Ayyam al Hassad (Days of Harvest) was never recorded and Al 'Urs fi l’Qarya (The Marriage in the Village) has not yet been released (<b>yet</b> <b>an</b> unofficial audio record is available).|$|E
25|$|Trochanteric {{fractures}} are {{subdivided into}} either intertrochanteric (between the greater and lesser trochanter) or pertrochanteric (through the trochanters) by the Müller AO Classification of fractures. Practically, {{the difference between}} these types is minor. The terms are often used synonymously. An isolated trochanteric fracture involves one of the trochanters without going through the anatomical axis of the femur, and may occur in young individuals due to forceful muscle contraction. <b>Yet,</b> <b>an</b> isolated trochanteric fracture may not be regarded as a true hip fracture because it is not cross-sectional.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Thomas Binney, to whom I brought {{letters from}} Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, {{received}} me most kindly. Mrs. Binney {{acted as if}} we had been acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, being the first London lady with whom I had the pleasure of acquaintance, I saw in her what I have since seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E

25|$|Since De Latino Sine Flexione {{had set the}} {{principle}} to take Latin nouns either in the ablative or nominative form (nomen was preferred to nomine), in 1909 Peano published a vocabulary in order to assist in selecting the proper form of every noun, <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> essential value of Peano’s Interlingua was that the lexicon might be found straightforward in any Latin dictionary (by getting the thematic vowel of the stem from the genitive ending, that is: -a -o -e -u -e from -ae -i -is -us -ei).|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} straightforward to parallelize {{a number of}} steps in ABC algorithms based on rejection sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods. It has also been demonstrated that parallel algorithms may yield significant speedups for MCMC-based inference in phylogenetics, which may be a tractable approach also for ABC-based methods. <b>Yet</b> <b>an</b> adequate model for a complex system is very likely to require intensive computation irrespectively of the chosen method of inference, and {{it is up to}} the user to select a method that is suitable for the particular application in question.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{a federal}} Member of Parliament and not <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> MLA, Douglas was elected {{the leader of}} the Saskatchewan CCF in 1942 after {{successfully}} challenging the incumbent leader, George Hara Williams, but did not resign from the House of Commons until 1 June 1944. He led the CCF to power in the 1944 provincial election, winning 47 of 53 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, and thus forming the first democratic socialist government in not only Canada, but all of North America. As premier, Douglas attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.|$|E

25|$|As <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> {{alternative}} set {{of rules}} that takes this into account has not been fully developed. Most {{progress has been made}} based on the notion that stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to facetting, whereby parts are removed from a polyhedron without creating any new vertices. For every stellation of some polyhedron, there is a dual facetting of the dual polyhedron, and vice versa. By studying facettings of the dual, we gain insights into the stellations of the original. Bridge found his new stellation of the icosahedron by studying the facettings of its dual, the dodecahedron.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, {{deuterium}} is {{the most}} common nuclide used in nuclear fusion reactor designs, especially in combination with tritium, because of the large reaction rate (or nuclear cross section) and high energy yield of the D–T reaction. There is an even higher-yield D– fusion reaction, though the breakeven point of D– is higher than that of most other fusion reactions; together with the scarcity of , this makes it implausible as a practical power source until at least D–T and D–D fusion reactions have been performed on a commercial scale. However, commercial nuclear fusion is not <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> accomplished technology.|$|E
25|$|A {{year later}} {{he agreed to}} allow the principality to join the Swiss Confederation, then not <b>yet</b> <b>an</b> {{integrated}} federation, but a confederacy, as a full member. Thus Neuchâtel became {{the first and only}} monarchy to join the otherwise entirely republican Swiss cantons. This situation changed in 1848 when a peaceful revolution took place and established a republic, in the same year that the modern Swiss Confederation was transformed into a federation. King Frederick William IV of Prussia did not give in immediately and several attempts at counter-revolution took place, culminating in the Neuchâtel Crisis of 1856–57. In 1857, Frederick William renounced his claims on the area.|$|E
