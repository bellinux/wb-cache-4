It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but <b>you</b> <b>hurt</b> me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how <b>you</b> <b>hurt</b> me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E

2500|$|The show's creators {{were both}} Londoners, {{but when they}} {{researched}} Victorian squares, they found massive changes in areas they thought they knew well. However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly {{what they had been}} searching for: a real East End spirit—an inward looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as [...] "Hurt one of us and <b>you</b> <b>hurt</b> us all".|$|E
2500|$|When Mandisa {{presented}} {{herself to}} the judges prior to the final cut-down to the season's 24 semi-finalists, she told Cowell: [...] "What I {{want to say to}} you is that, yes, <b>you</b> <b>hurt</b> me and I cried and it was painful, it really was. But I {{want you to know that}} I've forgiven you and that you don't need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody. I figure that if Jesus could die so that all of my wrongs could be forgiven, I can certainly extend that same grace to you." [...] Cowell told Mandisa that he was [...] "humbled" [...] and apologized to her immediately.|$|E

2500|$|This {{game was}} Michigan's worst defeat since 1968 when they lost 50 to 14 at Ohio State. Dennis Dixon {{accounted}} for 368 {{yards and a}} career-high 4 touchdowns. Three touchdowns were thrown to three different receivers for 85, 61, and 45-yard scoring passes on Dixon's way to 292 throwing yards. [...] Dixon also rushed for 76 yards and one touchdown. [...] The Ducks led by 25 at halftime, and faced little opposition in the second half. [...] According to Oregon coach Mike Bellotti the game was a [...] "good win because I think there were some questions about how Michigan was going to bounce back, and whether we would be competitive. [...] I think our players took that to heart." [...] With this game Michigan opened the season with two home losses, {{the first time that}} had happened since 1959. [...] It also gave them a losing streak of four games, the most in four decades. [...] Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr said [...] "We have good kids and they're hurting.

2500|$|Miriam forces Annabel {{to confront}} her own fear of {{entering}} the tennis court, and when Annabel tries to return indoors, {{she finds a}} soaking scarf that belonged to Alice. Miriam then forces a now hugely stressed Annabel to tell her own [...] "ghost story" [...] of her marriage, insisting she needs to know now. So Annabel talks of how they met at a sales conference; how they saw films together, her liking romantic comedies, him liking violent blockbusters; how they started sleeping together and got married to formalise the arrangement; how one day he snapped over something trivial and hit her; how sweet {{he was when he}} apologised afterwards; how distant he grew the rest of the time; how she ended up provoking him to get his attention this way. Miriam asks if she enjoyed being hit, adding that she doesn't know any more if she enjoyed what happened to her. She muses the people <b>you</b> <b>hurt</b> most are the people you love, and before returning indoors, says to Annabel: [...] "I love you".|$|E

2500|$|Several {{months later}} in July {{of the same}} year, it was {{revealed}} that Ciara would be reuniting with L.A. Reid by signing to his Epic Records label. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace at the start of her career, and played a role in executively producing her debut album Goodies (2004).
