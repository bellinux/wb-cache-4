25|$|If <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> my would-be Sherlock Holmesian {{assessment}} of Professor Moriarty's – sorry , Professor Illingworth's – plan {{to recapture the}} Ashes, you will remember {{that it is in}} Sydney, in the Fourth Test, that this cricketing chess player is due to strike and then retire to the corner of his web and seal off reprisals. Those who command the condition of Sydney Cricket Ground and its accessories gave him just the pitch he needed. By this time, I fancy, they were nauseated by negation and demanded a win at any price – even at the price of Australian defeat.|$|E
25|$|On it, {{there will}} be such {{information}} as the contact person’s name, address, and phone number, a proposed scenario for the crime and, all relevant details on the crime scene, {{as well as the}} last time the deceased was seen alive; as <b>you</b> <b>recall,</b> this is all information found in the initial contact notes. Other relevant information is a list of all evidence collected, including specimens and all identification and rearing procedures performed, a PMI estimate, and a summarized conclusion based on all the findings. Copies of this report are submitted to the contact officer, the forensic entomologist, and as a courtesy, to the medical examiner. If throughout the course of the investigation, any manipulation of the specimens occurred (i.e. dissecting, rearing, then a copy of the specimen disposition and identification form should also be included in the report).|$|E
2500|$|Faulkner {{became a}} futures trader {{in the early}} 90's {{as a way to}} apply his NLP-based models for peak performance. He {{encouraged}} fellow traders who were breaking into the industry to use positive statements when journaling. Otherwise, a trader may wind up unconsciously setting in negative trading patterns. He said in a Futures (magazine) article, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> something, you reinforce it." ...|$|E
6000|$|General Chouardin {{also got}} up and put himself between the two armed men. [...] "Put up your sword, Bourbotte," [...] whispered he, leading him off to the further window of the room; [...] "you are no match for him here: if Barrère chooses he will have <b>you</b> <b>recalled</b> to Paris, and your neck will then not be worth a month's purchase." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. <b>You</b> will <b>recall</b> that Mr. Travers's fear of burglars {{has caused}} him to have stout bars fixed to all the windows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{could not}} contain my astonishment at your memory, Mr. King, which has enabled <b>you</b> to <b>recall</b> {{a name that}} you {{probably}} never before heard!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The V60/V70/V80 mostly {{shared a}} common architecture. They had thirty-two 32-bit {{general-purpose}} registers, although the last three of these were commonly used as stack pointer, frame pointer and argument pointer. The V60 and V70 had a 119-instruction set, slightly extended to 123 instructions for the V80. The instructions have variable-length between one and 22 bytes, and they take two operands, both {{of which can be}} memory locations. After studying the V60's reference manual, Paul Vixie described it as [...] "a very vax-ish arch, with a V20/V30 emulation mode (which, if <b>you</b> <b>recall,</b> means it can run Intel 8086/8088 software)".|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "Goodbye to Love" [...] {{had been}} released, attitudes towards the duo changed slightly. Ken Barnes, writing in Phonograph said [...] "It's {{certainly}} less than revolutionary to admit {{you like the}} Carpenters these days – in 'rock' circles, if <b>you</b> <b>recall,</b> it formerly bordered on heresy. Everybody must be won over by now." [...] Since then, the group's [...] "saccharine" [...] image has softened and musicians have cited the Carpenters as a key influence. In 1995, Rolling Stones Sue Cummings wrote that the 1990's acceptance of the duo's work was [...] "a renewed ironic appreciation", adding that listeners [...] "had loved the veneer, then hated it, then found it even more compelling, on a second look, for the complexity in {{the places where the}} darkness cracked through".|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then, tell me. Can <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> any {{conversation}} between yourself and Mr. Keegan {{since the death}} of Captain Ussher, relative to this trial?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Now {{you call}} me “your dear little cricket”, true? But do <b>you</b> not <b>recall</b> when, to banish me from your house, you threw a mallet at me?"- chapter XXXVI ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} what I wished you to tell Mr. Hebblethwaite," [...] Norgate remarked, nodding pleasantly. [...] "I just want <b>you</b> to <b>recall</b> the {{circumstances}} of my first visit here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perchance <b>you</b> can <b>recall,</b> lord, that, {{moved to}} it by love and pity, {{on the night of}} the {{sacrifice}} you helped that daughter to escape the fangs of the Snake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And sorrows also," [...] quoth the other. [...] "I {{have some}} sad {{memories}} of the land. Can <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> that which befell us at Libourne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel," [...] replied Brent, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> {{the rough}} and uncouth young citizen who came over here from Cincinnati, as clerk on the Vicksburg?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{name was}} John Caldwell," [...] {{continued}} Hazel. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> him? He {{said that he}} met you in America. He is an Englishman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still less worth {{mentioning}} {{than any of}} those other little circumstances <b>you</b> have <b>recalled,</b> John Spatter," [...] said I; [...] "for I was, and am, sensible of your merits and my deficiencies." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We, the {{citizens}} of the Northern Territory, [...] implore <b>you</b> to <b>recall</b> the Administrator, Dr. Gilruth, in the interests of life and property, as his autocratic administration is fast reaching a grave crisis." ...|$|R
6000|$|His hostess {{raised her}} head. [...] "She {{does want to}} see you, I know; but <b>you</b> must <b>recall</b> the sequel to that bad hour at Dedborough--when {{it was you who}} {{declined}} to see her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. If <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> me, I'll {{come back}} at once; if not, I'll go on with a lighter heart, knowing that I can safely stay away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> {{anything}} that might help us?" [...] Gross asked. [...] "Anything that would give us {{a clue as to}} what he might have in mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> how I then swore myself your {{knight and}} ever your champion? Little did we dream how the honour that I sighed for {{was to be}} mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That were {{scarcely}} a soothing subject; but {{we might find}} calm in something less agitating and more familiar. Perhaps <b>you</b> can <b>recall</b> something too firmly imprinted on your memory to be disturbed by these emotions." ...|$|R
50|$|Declarative memory uses your medial {{temporal}} lobe and enables <b>you</b> to <b>recall</b> the telephone number at will. Procedural memory activates the telephone number {{only when you}} are at the telephone, and uses your right-hemisphere's skill, pattern recognition.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Magor," [...] {{continued}} Tarzan, addressing another, [...] "do <b>you</b> not <b>recall</b> {{your former}} king--he who slew the mighty Kerchak? Look at me! Am I {{not the same}} Tarzan--mighty hunter--invincible fighter--that you all knew for many seasons?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>recall,</b> Kenneth," [...] he said slowly, almost sorrowfully, [...] "the {{story that}} I {{told you that}} night in Worcester, when we sat waiting for dawn and the hangman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Vane. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> me, I'll {{come back}} at once; if not, I'll go on with a lighter heart, knowing that I can safely stay away." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{yet again}} <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> yourself, and {{distinguish}} one purpose from the rest, as a grand one (p. 222). And {{that is to}} receive Christ as Lord, {{as well as a}} Saviour.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} {{remember}} doing anything, Ned? <b>You</b> cannot <b>recall</b> that <b>you</b> went anywhere {{and got a}} rope and fastened it across the road {{with the idea of}} upsetting his gig on the way back from the mill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if," [...] said Milly, [...] "if {{your memory}} should {{one day be}} restored, as we will hope and pray it may be, {{would it not be}} a blessing to <b>you</b> to <b>recall</b> at once a wrong and its forgiveness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I confess that, {{when there}} was this delay in your coming here, I {{sometimes}} feared something might have happened to <b>you.</b> I <b>recall</b> mentioning it to the young lady who recently did me the honour to promise to become my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{he lives}} in Dalton Street, if <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> {{what kind of a}} place that is" [...] (she nodded), [...] "and he is known from one end of it to the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly {{he withdrew}} {{his hand from}} mine. [...] "And now <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?" [...] said he, after a {{considerable}} pause.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented Tarzan, and then, after a pause, [...] "Mr. Philander, do <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> any of {{the details}} of the finding and burying of three skeletons found in my cabin beside that African jungle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think! Think! He'll be hanged if <b>you</b> don't <b>recall</b> {{something}} to identify him. He deserves a chance. Holderness's crowd are thieves, murderers. But two were not all bad. That showed the night {{you were at}} Silver Cup. I saved Nebraska--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} told my name when I had the honor of being {{presented}} to you at Rome," [...] he said, [...] "and at any chance mention <b>you</b> might <b>recall</b> it. I prefer to tell it to you, and rely upon your honor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{situation}} was so little desperate that I {{had offered to}} effect the rescue both of your mother and yourself without asking any guerdon. Your miserable treasure alone it was {{that had to be}} sacrificed. <b>You</b> will <b>recall</b> that the bargain was of your own proposing." ...|$|R
