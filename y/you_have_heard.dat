500|$|The {{conductor}} John Eliot Gardiner describes Grainger as [...] "a true original {{in terms}} of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation", whose terseness of expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th-century Second Viennese School and the [...] Italian madrigalists of the 16th and 17th centuries. [...] Malcolm Gillies, a Grainger scholar, writes of [...] Grainger's [...] style [...] that [...] "you know it is 'Grainger' when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> about one second of a piece". The music's most individual characteristic, Gillies argues, is its texture – [...] "the weft of the fabric", according to Grainger. Different textures are defined by Grainger as [...] "smooth", [...] "grained" [...] and [...] "prickly".|$|E
500|$|Breaking Benjamin's musical {{style is}} {{primarily}} classified as hard rock and alternative rock, more specifically post-grunge and alternative metal, and has commonly been {{noted for its}} consistency. Corey Apar felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin are nothing if not consistent", and Alex Young felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin {{is one of the}} few modern rock bands on the radio that, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> any song in its catalog prior, could be immediately recognized." [...] Despite a complete lineup change prior to the release of Dark Before Dawn, Dan Marsicano stated, [...] "Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony. They have had an established sound since their breakout We Are Not Alone – hard-edged riffs with emotional upheaval – and that isn't tampered with on Dark Before Dawn." ...|$|E
500|$|You, King Gelon, {{are aware}} the Universe {{is the name}} given by most astronomers to the sphere the center {{of which is the}} center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the {{straight}} line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, {{as a consequence of the}} assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{is portrayed as}} having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game [...] bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] and often gives the farewell, [...] "This is the day you will always remember as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!" [...] which is sometimes humorously cut off. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of me." [...] In a deleted scene from The Curse of the Black Pearl Sparrow ponders being [...] "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow", and during At World's End he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns {{it can be a}} terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being [...] "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," [...] as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.|$|E

2500|$|Inglis draws {{parallels}} between Rajbun's journey of discovery {{and that of}} nursery-rhyme or folk-tale characters Pinocchio, Dick Whittington and Dorothy Gale, in that he [...] "has a 'quest' that awaits him". On this journey, Harrison sings of Rajbun's adversaries, one of which warns him: [...] "You may think that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the last of Katman / … I'll be watching you 'round ev'ry bend you'll take …" [...] Inglis writes that Rajbun must face his quest [...] "without 'fears' [...] or 'tears'" [...] and cites the verse-one lines [...] "Bunbury stands for freedom / Being young and having fun" [...] {{as evidence of the}} song's [...] "overwhelmingly positive" [...] message.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1952, Harvey was {{a friend}} of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. [...] Harvey would often submit [...] "advance copies of his radio script for comment and approval." [...] It is {{believed}} that Harvey's friendship with Hoover helped Harvey escape criminal charges relating to his trespassing at Argonne National Laboratory. Nevertheless, Paul Harvey was happy to defend his friend, and spoke of him on his show of April 25, 1963, saying: [...] "God help the United States without John Edgar Hoover. ... (FBI) Director Hoover is not retiring. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> otherwise, somebody's sinister wish was the father of that thought. It is not so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Levi {{addressed}} {{the question that}} [...] raises: [...] "Did ever a people {{hear the voice of}} God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> and live?" [...] ( [...] in turn, refers back to the encounter at Sinai reported at [...] and after.) Rabbi Levi taught that the world {{would not have been able}} to survive hearing the voice of God in God's power, but instead, as [...] says, [...] "The voice of the Lord is with power." [...] That is, the voice of God came according to the power of each individual – young, old, or infant – to receive it.|$|E
2500|$|On August 24, 1997, at {{a concert}} at Wolf Trap, Vienna, Virginia, Bob Dylan {{had this to say}} about Lomax, who had helped {{introduce}} him to folk music and whom he had known as a young man in Greenwich Village:There is a distinguished gentlemen here who came … I want to introduce him – named Alan Lomax. I don’t know if many of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of him [...] Yes, he’s here, he’s made a trip out to see me. I used to know him years ago.

2500|$|I have {{discovered}} that {{the public in the}} Holy Land does not fully believe the terrible horror that has befallen our nation in exile. Sadly, the bitter truth is many, many times worse than anything <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard.</b> All that is known in the free world is but a drop in the ocean of massacres battering European Jewry. To all those doubters, I can bear witness from my own personal experience that all current descriptions are as nothing compared with the awful truth. On leaving Hungary, I saw with my own eyes wagonloads of Italian Jews being transported to their death in Poland. Elderly, women, young children, pushing their shrunken hands through the bars, begging for [...] "Water! Water!" [...] But the Gestapo troops did not allow anyone to approach the death train and assist the captives. I saw prisoners crazed from thirst attacking each other and biting their flesh.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Jedi Mind Tricks {{released}} their seventh studio album Violence Begets Violence. It is {{the first}} JMT album without the production help of Stoupe The Enemy Of Mankind because Vinnie Paz and Jus Allah grew tired of waiting. Paz stated; [...] "By now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> that this {{is the first}} Jedi Mind Tricks album we've made without Stoupe handling the production. The bottom line is that at some point after making our last album, A History of Violence, Stoupe lost his passion for making Hip Hop and wanted to try new things. Through our career, we've always waited on him to get inspired to make a new album, but this time around we got tired of waiting out his creative drought. He tried to produce some things for this new album, but we could tell early on that his heart wasn't in making JMT records anymore. He's moved on as a producer to work in other genres with his side-projects, Dutch and Vespertina, and we've moved on with a new crop of talented producers to make the hardcore Hip Hop we've always been known for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
