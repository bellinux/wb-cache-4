Hickok grew angry and jealous at {{perceived}} slights, and demanded more time alone, which Roosevelt was unable to give; at other times, she attempted unsuccessfully to separate herself from Roosevelt. Though the pair remained friends throughout their lives, they continued to grow apart {{in the years that}} followed. In 1937, Roosevelt wrote to Hickok that [...] "I never meant to hurt <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way, but that is no excuse having done it [...] [...] [...] I am pulling back from all my contacts now [...] [...] [...] Such cruelty & stupidity is unpardonable when you reach my age." ...|$|E
500|$|Beth Twitty has alleged in {{televised}} {{interviews and}} a book that Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers know more about Holloway's disappearance than they have told authorities, and {{that at least one}} of them sexually assaulted or raped her daughter. On July 5, 2005, following the initial release of the Kalpoes, Twitty alleged, [...] "Two suspects were released yesterday who were involved in a violent crime against my daughter," [...] and referred to the Kalpoes as [...] "criminals". A demonstration involving about two hundred Arubans took place that evening outside the courthouse in Oranjestad in anger over Twitty's remarks, with signs reading [...] "Innocent until proven guilty" [...] and [...] "Respect our Dutch laws or go home." [...] Satish Kalpoe's attorney threatened legal action over Twitty's allegations, which he described as [...] "prejudicial, inflammatory, libelous, and totally outrageous." [...] On July 8, 2005, Twitty read a statement that said her remarks were fuelled by [...] "despair and frustration" [...] and that she [...] "apologize to the Aruban people and to the Aruban authorities if I or my family offended <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way." ...|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way, call me." ...|$|E

500|$|Braid {{has been}} {{considered}} a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation {{and the need to}} understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if [...] "years of gaming blinders have been ripped away." [...] Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were [...] "elaborate and formidable", but [...] "impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was [...] "the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you {{to come to terms with}} its mature tale the next". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not [...] "feel immature" [...] as it [...] "expects [...] much" [...] of the player as any other form of media and [...] "doesn't short <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> respect". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork [...] "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were [...] "eye-catching but never distracting". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids [...] "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision", and that [...] "the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to rewind time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's [...] "core challenges".|$|E
2500|$|Adventure Gamers' Cameron Urquhart scored it 4 out of 5. He praised how {{the game}} used factual {{historical}} information in its fictional narrative, {{and was also}} impressed with the graphics, sound and voice acting. He was also complementary of the puzzles; [...] "Rather than being loaded down with contrived puzzles for padding, Dracula 3 relies heavily on inventory puzzles, yet you are never resigned to trying everything on everything. The hotspots are almost always necessary, while puzzles are logical and accessible and never feel out of place." [...] He concluded [...] "The game rarely wows <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> one way, and the pace can drag at times in dry subject matter, but overall it's both logical and accessible, with [...] interesting approach to vampire lore and deftly crafted storyline." ...|$|E

In her {{capacity}} {{as chair of the}} Library of Michigan board, Didier also served {{as a member of the}} Library of Michigan Foundation board of directors. In 2004, Didier was elected to the board of directors of the Association of College and Research Libraries, a division of the American Library Association that serves as a professional association of academic librarians and other interested individuals. In September 2004, Didier was one of three finalists seeking the position of director of the Grand Rapids Public Library system. However, Didier withdrew before the interviews for the public library position after learning that the position of director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum was available due to the retirement of former director Dennis Daellenbach. Four months later, Didier was named as the director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum. On the first day of her job, U.S. President Gerald Ford told Didier that, [...] "I stand ready to assist <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way," [...] for which Didier thanked him and asked about the museum's collection of footballs signed by former Ohio State coach Woody Hayes.|$|E
