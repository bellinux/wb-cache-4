5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes <b>your</b> <b>personal</b> responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

5|$|On 14 July 1960, in {{response}} to requests by Prime Minister Lumumba, the UN Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. This called upon Belgium to remove its troops and for the UN to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the Soviet Union {{if they did not}} leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use the UN troops to subdue Katanga by force. Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, 'From these texts it is clear that, contrary to <b>your</b> <b>personal</b> interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.' Secretary General Hammarskjöld refused. To Hammarskjöld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. Disagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.|$|E

It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into <b>your</b> <b>personal</b> bank accounts. There's no challenge." [...] Rowling maintains {{that she had no}} role in choosing directors for the films and that [...] "nyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' [...] him [...] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced."

He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} <b>your</b> <b>personal</b> journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough."

500|$|Competing at {{his first}} Olympic Games, Julius Mutekanga {{qualified}} for the London Games via qualification standards because his fastest time of one minute, 46.30 seconds, recorded at the 2011 Ninove Memorial Geert Rasschaert, met the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 800 metres.

As long as you’re running faster and faster, that’s the ultimate goal." [...] Mutekanga took part in the first round's seventh heat on 6 August, finishing fifth out of eight athletes, with a time of one minute and 48.41 seconds. He ranked ahead of Moise Joseph from Haiti (one minute and 48.46 seconds) and Equatorial Guinea's Benjamín Enzema (one minute and 57.47 seconds) in a heat led by Duane Solomon of the United States (one minute and 46.05 seconds). Overall Mutekanga finished 35th out of 52 athletes, and was 2.06 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his heat who advanced to the semi-final and, therefore, {{that was the end of}} his competition.|$|E

500|$|The {{standard}} of Rutherford's accommodation {{and his personal}} conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses in the 1930s. Walter F. Salter, the Society's former branch manager in Canada, wrote a public letter to Rutherford in 1937, the month he was expelled from the group, claiming that Rutherford had exclusive use of [...] "luxurious" [...] and [...] "expensive" [...] residences (in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Germany, and San Diego), {{as well as two}} Cadillacs and alleged that {{on more than one occasion}} he had purchased for Rutherford cases of whiskey, brandy, beer and other liquors, and 'go from [...] "drink to drink"'. In July 1939 Olin R. Moyle, legal counsel for the Society, wrote an open letter of resignation to the president, in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society, including Rutherford himself, that he considered excessive and inappropriate. Moyle mentioned California when discussing [...] "the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and <b>your</b> <b>personal</b> attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren." [...] Moyle also accused Rutherford of [...] "unkind treatment of the staff, outbursts of anger, discrimination and vulgar language" [...] and condemned his allowing the [...] "glorification of alcohol" [...] at Bethel. Penton notes that Moyle was a [...] "teetotaller" [...] and [...] "puritanical", but claims Rutherford's drinking habits were [...] "notorious" [...] and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to inebriation.|$|E
