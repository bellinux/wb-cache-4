Change of signal intensities (SI) across an ICAS on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may reflect its hemodynamic severity. In-patients with a symptomatic single ICAS detected on 3 D time-of-flight MRA {{were recruited from}} 2 hospitals. Baseline and 1 -year follow-up data were collected. Signal intensity ratio (SIR) [ =  (mean post-stenotic SI -mean background SI) /(mean pre-stenotic SI - mean background SI) ] was evaluated on baseline MRA to represent change of SIs across an ICAS. Acute infarct volume was measured on baseline diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Relationships between SIR and baseline characteristics as well as 1 <b>y</b> <b>outcomes</b> were evaluated. Thirty-six subjects (86. 1 % males, mean age 55. 0) were recruited. Overall, mean SIR was 0. 84 ± 0. 23. Mean SIRs {{were not significantly different}} between the 23 (63. 9 %) anatomically severe stenoses and the 13 (36. 1 %) anatomically moderate stenoses (0. 80 ± 0. 23 versus 0. 92 ± 0. 21, p =  0. 126). SIR was significantly, linearly and negatively correlated to acute infarct volume on DWI (Spearman correlation coefficient - 0. 471, p =  0. 011). Two patients (5. 6 %) had recurrent ischemic strokes at 1 y, not related to SIR values. Change of signal intensities across an ICAS on MRA may reflect its hemodynamic and functional severity.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 213 cases of intermittent exotropia who underwent surgery between 2008 and 2010. The patients were grouped into BLR group and RR group. Motor outcomes {{were divided into}} three groups {{on the basis of}} the angle of deviation after surgery:overcorrection (esotropia/phoria ＞ 5 △), orthophoria (esotropia/phoria ≤ 5 △ to exotropia/phoria ≤ 10 △), and undercorrection/recurrence (exotropia/phoria＞ 10 △). Titmus test was used to evaluate stereoacuity, the stereoacuity ＜ 800 s of arc meaned the patients had stereopsis. Surgical outcome including motor criteria and sensory status were compared at postoperative 6, 12, 24 mo and at 36 mo examination between groups. RESULTS: At 12, 24 mo after surgery, the motor outcomes had no difference (P ＞ 0. 05) between groups. However, the motor outcomes at 6, 36 mo were signally different in each group, indicating the success rate in RR group at 6 mo was higher than that in BLR group (83. 02 % vs 82. 24 %, P ＜ 0. 05) but the result was contrary at the 3 y examination (60. 75 % vs 43. 40 %, P ＜ 0. 05). No statistical significance were found in the sensory outcomes between the groups at mean of 3. 7 y follow-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To date no {{comparative}} {{trials have}} been done, to our knowledge, of fixed-dose artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) {{for the treatment}} of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy. Evidence on the safety and efficacy of ACTs in pregnancy is needed as these drugs are being used increasingly throughout the malaria-affected world. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of artemether-lumefantrine, the most widely used fixed ACT, with 7 d artesunate monotherapy in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: An open-label randomised controlled trial comparing directly observed treatment with artemether-lumefantrine 3 d (AL) or artesunate monotherapy 7 d (AS 7) was conducted in Karen women in the border area of northwestern Thailand who had uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The primary endpoint was efficacy defined as the P. falciparum PCR-adjusted cure rates assessed at delivery or by day 42 if this occurred later than delivery, as estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Infants were assessed at birth and followed until 1 y of life. Blood sampling was performed to characterise the pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine in pregnancy. Both regimens were very well tolerated. The cure rates (95 % confidence interval) for the intention to treat (ITT) population were: AS 7 89. 2 % (82. 3 %- 96. 1 %) and AL 82. 0 % (74. 8 %- 89. 3 %), p = 0. 054 (ITT); and AS 7 89. 7 % (82. 6 %- 96. 8 %) and AL 81. 2 % (73. 6 %- 88. 8 %), p = 0. 031 (per-protocol population). One-third of the PCR-confirmed recrudescent cases occurred after 42 d of follow-up. Birth outcomes and infant (up to age 1 <b>y)</b> <b>outcomes</b> did not differ significantly between the two groups. The pharmacokinetic study indicated that low concentrations of artemether and lumefantrine were the main contributors to the poor efficacy of AL. CONCLUSION: The current standard six-dose artemether-lumefantrine regimen was well tolerated and safe in pregnant Karen women with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but efficacy was inferior to 7 d artesunate monotherapy and was unsatisfactory for general deployment in this geographic area. Reduced efficacy probably results from low drug concentrations in later pregnancy. A longer or more frequent AL dose regimen may be needed to treat pregnant women effectively and should now be evaluated. Parasitological endpoints in clinical trials of any antimalarial drug treatment in pregnancy should be extended to delivery or day 42 if it comes later.

The cognitive profile of the large and growing population of older adults with prior TBI {{who do not have}} a diagnosis of dementia, however, has not been well described. Our aim was to describe the cognitive profile associated with prior TBI exposure among community-dwelling older adults without dementia-an understudied but potentially vulnerable population. In this population-based cohort study, we studied 984 community-dwelling older adults (age 51 y and older and their spouses) without dementia who had been randomly selected from respondents to the 2014 wave of the Health and Retirement Study to participate in a comprehensive TBI survey and who either reported no prior TBI (n = 737) or prior symptomatic TBI resulting in treatment in a hospital (n = 247). Mean time since first TBI was 38 ± 19 <b>y.</b> <b>Outcomes</b> assessed included measures of global cognitive function, verbal episodic memory, semantic fluency, and calculation as well as a measure of subjective memory ("How would you rate your memory at the present time?"). We compared outcomes between the two TBI groups using regression models adjusting for demographics, medical comorbidities, and depression. Sensitivity analyses were performed stratified by TBI severity (no TBI, TBI without loss of consciousness [LOC], and TBI with LOC). Respondents with TBI were younger (mean age 64 ± 10 y versus 68 ± 11 y), {{were less likely to be}} female, and had higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and depression than respondents without TBI. Respondents with TBI did not perform significantly differently from respondents without TBI on any measure of objective cognitive function in either raw or adjusted models (fully adjusted: global cognitive function score 15. 4 versus 15. 2, p = 0. 68; verbal episodic memory score 4. 4 versus 4. 3, p = 0. 79; semantic fluency score 15. 7 versus 14. 0, p = 0. 21; calculation impairment 22 % versus 26 %, risk ratio [RR] [95 % CI] = 0. 86 [0. 67 - 1. 11], p = 0. 24). Sensitivity analyses stratified by TBI severity produced similar results. TBI was associated with significantly increased risk for subjective memory impairment in models adjusted for demographics and medical comorbidities (29 % versus 24 %; RR [95 % CI]: 1. 26 [1. 02 - 1. 57], p = 0. 036). After further adjustment for active depression, however, risk for subjective memory impairment was no longer significant (RR [95 % CI]: 1. 18 [0. 95 - 1. 47], p = 0. 13). Sensitivity analyses revealed that risk of subjective memory impairment was increased only among respondents with TBI with LOC and not among those with TBI without LOC. Furthermore, the risk of subjective memory impairment was significantly greater among those with TBI with LOC versus those without TBI even after adjustment for depression (RR [95 % CI]: partially adjusted, 1. 38 [1. 09 - 1. 74], p = 0. 008; fully adjusted, 1. 28 [1. 01 - 1. 61], p = 0. 039). In this population-based study of community-dwelling older adults without dementia, those with prior TBI with LOC were more likely to report subjective memory impairment compared to those without TBI even after adjustment for demographics, medical comorbidities, and active depression. Lack of greater objective cognitive impairment among those with versus without TBI may be due to poor sensitivity of the cognitive battery or survival bias, or may suggest that post-TBI cognitive impairment primarily affects executive function and processing speed, which were not rigorously assessed in this study. Our findings show that among community-dwelling non-demented older adults, history of TBI is common but may not preferentially impact cognitive domains of episodic memory, attention, working memory, verbal semantic fluency, or calculation...|$|E
