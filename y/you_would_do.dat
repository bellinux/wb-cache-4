500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] is an urban-pop ballad with {{a length}} of four minutes and two seconds. According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing [...] "that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready {{to let go of}} just yet". The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I put myself in that place again where <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Marc Cherry {{was in a}} {{precarious}} financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, [...] "I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously concerned about my future. I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if I {{was one of those}} deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary." [...] While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry turned to her and asked, [...] "Can you imagine being so desperate that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> that to your children?" [...] to which his mother replied, [...] "I've been there." [...] Cherry was intrigued by the idea that a [...] "perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being a wife and mother... and still have moments of insanity;" [...] he began writing the pilot episode soon after. Cherry originally developed the concept as a half-hour comedy. However, after his agent was arrested for embezzlement, Cherry signed with Paradigm Talent Agency, where he was advised to rewrite the script as a soap opera. Cherry completed the first draft of the pilot in April 2002 and pitched the script to CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, Showtime, and Lifetime, all of which turned it down.|$|E

500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2012, he {{released}} {{a collection of}} short stories entitled This Is How You Lose Her. The collection was named a finalist for the 2012 National Book Award on October 10, 2012. In his review of the book on online arts and culture journal Frontier Psychiatrist, Editor-In-Chief Keith Meatto wrote, [...] "While This is How You Lose Her will surely advance Diaz's literary career, it may complicate his love life. For the reader, the collection raises the obvious question of what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if your lover cheated on you, and implies two no less challenging questions: How do you find love and how do you make it last?" ...|$|E

A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the aphorisms which conclude Dialectic of Enlightenment, Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's fiftieth birthday that would later be published as Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life. These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of Nietzsche, treated issues like emigration, totalitarianism, and individuality, as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling and the impossibility of love. In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of Charlie Chaplin and became friends with Fritz Lang and Hanns Eisler, with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, the visual aspect of films. Additionally, Adorno assisted Thomas Mann on his novel Doctor Faustus after the latter asked for his help. [...] "Would you be willing," [...] Mann wrote, [...] "to think through with me how the work—I mean Leverkühn's work—might look; how <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it {{if you were in}} league with the Devil?" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1870s {{and through the}} 1880s, Richard D'Oyly Carte had earned great success by {{producing}} the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] By the late 1880s, perhaps encouraged by the operas produced by Carl Rosa, Carte aspired to do for grand opera {{what he had done}} for comic opera, with the assistance of Arthur Sullivan, who had long yearned to compose more serious works. [...] In May 1888, Sullivan noted in his diary that, after a performance of his cantata The Golden Legend given at Albert Hall by command of Queen Victoria, the queen said to him, [...] "You ought to write a grand opera – <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it so well!" [...] Carte began building the Royal English Opera House in December 1888, and he commissioned Sullivan to write the venture's inaugural work. [...] George Bernard Shaw wondered, in August 1889, about the wisdom of building a new opera house when the three existing ones (Royal Opera House, Her Majesty's Theatre and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane), were underutilised. [...] During 1890, Carte contacted several composers, including Frederick Cowen, asking them to compose operas to succeed Ivanhoe in the new house.|$|E
