500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say <b>you</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E
2500|$|Gayle remade a track {{previously}} recorded {{track for}} her album Crystal, [...] "Ready for the Times to Get Better", as her first single after [...] "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue". Although the single became her fourth number-one Country hit, {{it failed to}} reach the Pop Top 40 (number 52). Gayle's next album, When I Dream, yielded three Top 3 Country hits – the No. 1 songs [...] "Talking in Your Sleep" [...] and [...] "Why Have <b>You</b> <b>Left</b> <b>the</b> One You Left Me For" [...] {{as well as the}} number 3 title track. [...] "Talking In Your Sleep" [...] returned Gayle to the pop Top 20 (number 18). Gayle left United Artists for Columbia Records in 1979 for her next album, Miss the Mississippi. She returned again to the pop Top 20 with that album's first single, [...] "Half the Way" [...] (number 15 pop, number 2 country, number 9 adult contemporary) which became her last solo Top-20 pop hit. Gayle also appeared in the second episode of the fourth season of The Muppet Show.|$|E

I've been pretty {{comfortable}} since <b>you</b> <b>left,</b> though <b>the</b> wolves got so friendly last night that I thought I'd better shift my camp a bit to-night. I didn't allow you could get back before to-morrow, and I knew I'd hear you shout if <b>you</b> did. I <b>left</b> <b>the</b> other fire burning as a beacon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since <b>you</b> <b>left,</b> <b>the</b> {{police have}} paid me another visit. They asked some rather strange questions, besides inquiring where you were." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All this," [...] I said, [...] "is {{exceedingly}} clear, and, although ingenious, still {{simple and}} explicit. When <b>you</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Bishop's Hotel, what then?" ...|$|E
