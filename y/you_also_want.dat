50|$|As another example, suppose you're at a {{convention}} of foreign ambassadors, each of which speaks English and also various other languages. You want to make an announcement {{to a group of}} them, but because you don't trust them, you don't want {{them to be able to}} speak among themselves without you being able to understand them. To ensure this, you will choose a group such that no two ambassadors speak the same language, other than English. On the other hand <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> to give your announcement to as many ambassadors as possible. In this case, the elements of the set are languages other than English, and the subsets are the sets of languages spoken by a particular ambassador. If two sets are disjoint, those two ambassadors share no languages other than English. A maximum set packing will choose the largest possible number of ambassadors under the desired constraint. Although this problem is hard to solve in general, in this example a good heuristic is to choose ambassadors who only speak unusual languages first, so that not too many others are disqualified.|$|E
50|$|ElectricalThis is cabling {{installed}} {{from the}} electrical switchboard {{to the light}} fitting or any other device {{that is to be}} controlled by the automation system. For example, if you have four down lights in a room and you wish to control each light individually, then each light will be wired back using electrical cabling back to the electrical switchboard. This means you will have four electrical cables installed from the electrical switchboard to the location where the light fittings will be installed. Each cable will be a three core active, neutral and earth cable.If in that room you also have a free standing lamp plugged into a power point and <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> to control this from your automation system, you will need to have that power point individually wired back to the electrical switchboard.So if you want to individually control every light fitting and every power point or power outlets then each one of these devices must be individually wired back to the electrical switchboard.

5000|$|Opponents {{say that}} net {{neutrality}} {{would make it}} more difficult for Internet service providers (ISPs) and other network operators to recoup their investments in broadband networks. John Thorne, senior vice president and deputy general counsel of Verizon, a broadband and telecommunications company, has argued that they will have no incentive to make large investments to develop advanced fibre-optic networks if they are prohibited from charging higher preferred access fees to companies that wish to take advantage of the expanded capabilities of such networks. Thorne and other ISPs have accused Google and Skype of freeloading or free riding for using a network of lines and cables the phone company spent billions of dollars to build. Marc Andreessen states that [...] "a pure net neutrality view is difficult to sustain if <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> to have continued investment in broadband networks. If you’re a large telco right now, you spend on the order of $20 billion a year on capex expenditure. You need to know how you’re going to get a return on that investment. If you have these pure net neutrality rules where you can never charge a company like Netflix anything, you’re not ever going to get a return on continued network investment — which means you’ll stop investing in the network. And I would not want to be sitting here 10 or 20 years from now with the same broadband speeds we’re getting today." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Julian Assange has {{described}} the film as a [...] "massive propaganda attack", he did discuss the film with Benedict Cumberbatch, with Cumberbatch claiming that he's [...] "personally supportive" [...] of the organization. Cumberbatch stated that, [...] "No matter how you cut it, he's done us a massive service, to wake us up to the zombielike way we absorb our news." [...] Since Assange has been living inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London under diplomatic asylum, he and Cumberbatch reportedly communicated via email during filming. “Our view is that a $US40 million advertising budget promoting WikiLeaks around the world, and actors like Cumberbatch speaking about it, {{is a good thing}} for the popularisation of WikiLeaks” —WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, on the film On September 21, 2013, a script, allegedly the film's screenplay, was released by WikiLeaks, along with commentary labeling the film as [...] "fiction masquerading as fact". Both Assange and WikiLeaks have stated that neither DreamWorks nor Disney approached them for any consultation on the film. Assange elaborated on the matter, [...] "I don't think we are in a situation anymore where an organization like DreamWorks or Disney can succinctly decide that it is going to produce a movie about living people, and living political refugees, and people who are embroiled in a grand jury proceeding in the United States, and just smear, without the cost." [...] He (Assange) called me one day during the making of the DreamWorks movie, when I was in a supermarket in Camberwell. ‘I’ve got an idea,’ he said. ‘They’ll want you as a consultant on this film. Why don’t you say yes to that, and split the fee with me?’‘Because I’m not interested in that,’ I said, ‘and if you want to oppose the film, why would <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> to make a profit from it?’‘Why not?’ he said. —Writer Andrew O'Hagan, recalling Assange's reaction on the film In October 2013, WikiLeaks published a personal letter that Assange wrote to Cumberbatch in January of that year, in which he commended the actor's talent and good intentions, but requested him to reconsider his involvement with the film, which Assange negatively labeled as [...] "a project that vilifies and marginalises a living political refugee to the benefit of an entrenched, corrupt and dangerous state." [...] WikiLeaks described Cumberbatch's reply to Assange as [...] "courteous and considered". Cumberbatch also admitted his reservations with the early drafts of the film's script, believing that it portrayed Assange as an antagonistic person. In regard to his continued involvement with the film, Cumberbatch stated [...] "I wanted to create a three dimensional portrait of a man far more maligned in the tabloid press than he is in our film to remind people that he is not just the weird, white haired Australian dude wanted in Sweden, hiding in an embassy behind Harrods. But a true force to be reckoned with, achieved the realization of the great ideal." [...] In an interview with George Stephanopoulos' show This Week, Assange stated that [...] "Cumberbatch tried to ameliorate the script but unfortunately with limited success... though I'm pleased he tried." ...|$|E
