500|$|In July 2011, Scott {{said that}} he was filming Prometheus with both adult-oriented R and more {{accessible}} PG-13 film ratings in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience. When asked about the rating, Scott said, [...] "the question is, do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> the PG-13, or do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference... essentially it's kinda R... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful." [...] Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could, while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating. On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made. According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would {{be the only way to}} gain a lower one. A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role. Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{spent some}} time considering the creature's appearance. Justman suggested to Gene Roddenberry {{that it could be}} some sort of [...] "terrifying, young lady" [...] with a similar appearance to the green skinned Orion slave girl seen in [...] "The Cage", but blue skinned and with orange hair. While Roddenberry thought that the idea was good, he already had an agreement with NBC that it would be an animal. Johnson envisaged the creature as a refugee with [...] "ashen skin" [...] wearing [...] "gunnysack clothing". Daniels had some apprehension about using a monster-of-the-week format, asking [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> cheap thrills or a more intelligent approach?" [...] He said that the crew decided to [...] "treat everything as if it were real" [...] in order to help the audience buy into it.|$|E

Voigt did exactly that and with [...] to race until {{the finish line}} he launched an attack {{that would not be}} nullified. He crossed the line in Avila Beach solo, registering his first victory of the year. The large group of escapees he was part of came in 6 seconds later, and the whole peloton a minute and seven seconds in arrears. The general classification was reshuffled, with Van Garderen taking the lead from Acevedo and Michael Rogers going from fifth to second. 41-year-old veteran Voigt said in his typical good humored fashion when interviewed after his victory: [...] "I just did the same move I've been doing since the ice age, and I couldn't believe they let me go. Once I get 20 seconds, I'm gone. I looked back and said, 'I can't believe they're giving me 20 seconds, don't they know?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|GM (Genetically modified) grains are {{not allowed}} in South Australia, where some grain {{producers}} have called for the moratorium to be lifted. [...] They argue the GM technology would help them tackle weeds and other pests, and that farmers {{should be able to}} choose how they run their enterprises {{and whether or not they}} wanted to grow the 'premium products' described by Leon Bignell, the South Australian (SA) Agriculture Minister. Producers have also said their GM-free grain is not translating to higher profits. Bignell conceded more work needed to be done to market produce as GM-free but said he was confident producers would see higher financial returns in the near future. [...] In March 2015, Bignell told farmers they should not use GM but should instead rely upon what he called [...] 'God's gifts'. [...] He said the [...] "amazing" [...] results of the Government's 'New Horizons' [...] soil improvement program [...] "prove," [...] in his view, that grain producers [...] "do not need genetic modification technology." [...] He said that [...] "Instead of using the top five centimetres of the soil, you go down to 50cm or even deeper. You put clay in it when it's needed, you put organic matter where it's needed as well." [...] Bignell said the trials had strengthened his view that South Australia should maintain a moratorium on GM technology, which he said gave the state's produce a [...] "market edge". [...] Bignell also said he believed results of the New Horizons program could be replicated in all grain growing areas of the state. Bignell added that [...] "If you look at GM and the promises around increases of about seven per cent in yields, why would <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> seven per cent when you can get 50 to 100 per cent increases in yield without having to use genetically modified seeds?" ...|$|E
2500|$|When she wasn't writing, Allen and {{her husband}} were among the most visible of Manhattan's theater crowd. She would spend her later years as a script doctor and observing {{particularly}} salacious crime trials from the benches in Manhattan Criminal Court. Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production. Big money elements – directors, actors – are pay or play. There is a shooting date. The shit is in the fan. And that's where writers like me come in. Writers who are fast and reliable. We are nicely paid to do these production rewrites[...] [...] and we love these jobs. Without credit? Never with credit. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job where you have to completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape. Besides, no one but the writer ever knows how much trouble any one piece of work will be. Only the writer knows that. Only the writer. So I take what looks to me like something that is in good enough shape, yet which I can contribute to and make it worth the pay they are going to give me[...] [...] There are more than one of us out there. These jobs are quick, sometimes they're even fun, and you don't have to take the terrible meetings. They're not breathing on you. They're just desperate to get a script. I've never taken anything that I knew I couldn't help. They pay good money." ...|$|E
