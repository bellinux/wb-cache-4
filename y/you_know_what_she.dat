6000|$|... "Allan," [...] said my guardian, [...] "take from me {{a willing}} gift, the best wife that ever man had. What more can I say {{for you than}} that I know you deserve her! Take with her the little home she brings you. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> will make it, Allan; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has made its namesake. Let me share its felicity sometimes, and what do I sacrifice? Nothing, nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, Zuly?" [...] {{returned}} her father, after a pause, {{which turned out}} to have been a long, silent laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Cecil, {{proceeding}} to narrate the proposed election; {{and in her}} need of sympathy she even told its sequel, adding, [...] "Rosamond, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{which case}} both are lost. [...] Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> like? Have <b>you</b> ever met her? [...] It's strange she doesn't {{want to speak}} to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She wouldn't mind if she did," [...] {{explained}} Joan. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> like! How can one {{think what}} one's saying with that silly, goggle-eyed face {{in front of}} one always." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would n't}} admire her, if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wrote here about you," [...] said Fanny, whose eyes had strayed to the written page opposite, and lingered there {{long enough to}} read {{something}} that excited her curiosity.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're being {{took care}} of," [...] replied his wife, with spirit. [...] "Aunt Emma's minding 'em for you--and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is. H'sh! Alf! Alf! I'm {{surprised}} at you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{now that}} <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is," [...] cried Mr. Worthington, rising and smiting {{the pile of}} letters on his desk, [...] "why do you keep her there an instant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does!" [...] {{the girl}} replied {{as with a}} sudden drop of {{interest}} in the question. She turned at the moment to the opening of the door.|$|E
5000|$|Fi's Parents Fi's mother phoned her once, {{not making}} an appearance, {{worrying}} about Fi's father's sudden illness, {{which turned out}} to be not serious. As Fi said, it was [...] "just my mum worrying. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and I also {{remember}} sending you word {{not to show}} that <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing; but {{to wait and see}} if she turned her knowledge of writing to account, and took or sent any letters to the post. You informed me, in your regular monthly report, that she nearer did anything of the kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, {{she says}} you'll {{be glad to}} see her when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> come about. She's quite a common girl, sir. Very common indeed. I should have sent her away, only I thought perhaps you wanted her to talk into your machines. I hope I've not done wrong; but really you see such queer people sometimes--you'll excuse me, I'm sure, sir-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you may suppose, I {{particularly}} inquired. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had {{the cheek}} to tell me?" [...] Owen asked. [...] "She didn't better it much: {{she said she}} meant that it's excessively unnatural." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, John!--I doubt I {{can hardly}} {{tell you what}} she said. But <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said. Did she not write {{and tell you that}} because of her health it cannot be as you would have it." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS BRIDGENORTH. Certainly not. Reginald: {{you were}} not asked to come; and I have asked you to go. You know how fond I am of Leo; and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would feel if she came in and found you here.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would have}} come to life again in time to enjoy the [...] "coup de theatre". I had some {{thoughts}} of trying an overdose of opium; but I thought Dr. Mayerne would have found me out. I tell you, because it is fair I should have the credit; for, Guy, if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was {{to me all the}} winter, you would perceive my superhuman generosity in not receiving you as my greatest enemy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You make me tired with Sylvia," [...] she said. [...] "It's {{about time}} <b>you</b> did <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> like. She's just the commonplace, short-tempered, disagreeable-if-she-doesn't-get-her-own-way, {{unreasonable}} woman. Only more so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Besides, Sept, ask {{yourself}} {{what he would}} be without his sister. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> an influence <b>she</b> has over him; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a capacity <b>she</b> has; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that whatever he reads with you, he reads with her. Give her her fair share of your praise, and {{how much do you}} leave for him?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, she patronised us," [...] said Lady Sophie, laughing. [...] "She did, indeed! And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was. Her {{father was}} just a common builder at Loring, who made some money by a {{speculation}} in bricks and mortar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She won't {{believe that}} {{business}} has {{brought him back}} at nine o'clock on a Saturday night," [...] argued Dick; [...] "you think that Little Mother hasn't any sense. She'll see there's something up, and ask a hundred questions. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sunshine {{paused to}} pick a tiny worm from a leaf. [...] "Well," [...] said he, [...] "she found our nest just after we had {{finished}} it and before Mrs. Sunshine had {{had a chance to}} lay an egg. Of course <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{should have}} been bored and bothered into being {{regularly}} good- for-nothing. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> really like. She's nicer than anyone—-as jolly as any fellow, and yet a lady all over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beatrice is {{just going}} to be married, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that, doctor." [...] The doctor said that he did know it. [...] "And it will be so {{pleasant}} that Mary should make one of us. Poor Beatrice; <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has suffered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a {{revolver}} here," [...] said I. [...] "You should be armed." [...] I slipped {{a couple of}} cartridges into it {{and held it out}} to him. [...] "We can't afford to take chances. How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> friends <b>she</b> may have?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Muriel {{was silent}} for a few moments, and then remarked: [...] "Self-denial such as you practised deserves a reward, and I met Mrs. Dalton while you were away. She asked me to bring you over when you came back. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But yes. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is. You {{know the}} ideals she has formed. It wounds her that {{at such a}} time--whilst you are here {{for the purpose of}} wooing her--you should at the same time be {{pursuing}} this affair with that chit of a Binet girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am one of}} them!" [...] she said. [...] "Pity me. If Helena {{looks at}} me--if Helena speaks to me--if I only see Helena by accident--do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does? She tempts me! Tempts me to do dreadful things! Tempts me--" [...] The poor child threw her arms round my neck, and whispered the next fatal words in my ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter Townley. He {{held the}} mortgage. And {{all the old}} {{furniture}} was sold too, and that most killed Aunt Sally. But do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> fretting over most of all? She and Uncle Tom will have been married fifty years in a fortnight's time and Aunt Sally thinks it's awful to have to spend their golden wedding anniversary in the poorhouse. She talks {{about it all the}} time. You're not going, Lovell"--for Lovell had risen--"you must stop with us, since your old home is closed up. We'll scare you up a shakedown to sleep on and you're welcome as welcome. I haven't forgot the time you caught Mary Ellen just as she was tumbling into the well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but <b>you</b> must <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> likes," [...] {{continued}} Guss; [...] "I'm for this," [...] and she, {{displayed a}} pattern showing forth two gorgeous macaws--each with plumage {{of the brightest}} colours. [...] "The colours are so bright, and the feathers will work in so well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are saying," [...] he cried. [...] "Come away, Antoinette, <b>you</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has done--you cannot realize <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will depend}} upon whether you tell her. She's {{prepared}} for it, and do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> counts upon for her defence? On your believing that I lie. Perhaps you do; don't make yourself uncomfortable to hide it. Only, as it happens this time, I don't. I've told plenty of little idiotic fibs, but they've never hurt any one but myself." ...|$|E
60|$|As for Agnes, Mr. Dickens, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{always makes}} me think of? You will not mind my saying?--the woman one reads about. Frankly, I don't believe in her. I do not refer to Agnes in particular, but the woman of whom she is a type, the faultless woman we read of. Women have many faults, but, thank God, they have one redeeming virtue--they are none of them faultless.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} hasn't. For {{what do you}} suggest that I suppose her to take you? But you've been with her every day, you've seen her freely, you've liked her greatly--I stick to that--and you've made your profit of it. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has been through as well as you know that she has dined here to-night--which must have put her, by the way, through a good deal more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is one {{of those}} girls <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would be at. She's full of romance and nonsense, and isn't half as fond of telling the truth as she ought to be. She made my life a burden to me while she was with us, and I don't think she would be any better for Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jack rose, {{laid the}} {{magazine}} down, settled his white waistcoat with both hands, and lounged towards his friend with audacious but slightly veiled and shining eyes. [...] "They sort of sing themselves to you," [...] he said, quietly, leaning beside the editor's desk, and looking down upon him. After a pause he said, [...] "Then <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To the {{bottomless}} pit {{with your}} plans!' replied his accomplice; 'you have planned {{me out of}} ship, cargo, and life; and I dreamt this moment that Meg Merrilies dragged you here by the hair and gave me the long clasped knife she used to wear; <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said. Sturmwetter! it will be your wisdom not to tempt me!' ...|$|R
