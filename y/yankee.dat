Coincidentally, David Cone was the last <b>Yankee</b> pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999.|$|E

Despite the lack of championships, the rivalry between the teams did have some memorable highlights. <b>Yankee</b> left-hander Dave Righetti threw a no-hitter against the Red Sox at <b>Yankee</b> Stadium. One of the game's greatest hitters, Wade Boggs, struck out to end the game. This was the first no-hitter thrown by a left-hander at <b>Yankee</b> Stadium and the first no-hitter by a <b>Yankee</b> since Don Larsen's perfect game against Subway Series rival Brooklyn Dodgers in Game five of the 1956 World Series and the first regular no-hitter by a <b>Yankee</b> since 1951.|$|E

They were both experimental and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, but later became more so due to inflation and large increases in coal and oil prices. He was critical of over-regulation and protracted hearings, which meant that by the 1980s similar boiling-water or pressurized-water plants took almost twice as long to build in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2014, Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda was {{believed}} to have been using pine tar in a Yankee-Red Sox game at <b>Yankee</b> Stadium.

On April 23, 2014, at a <b>Yankee</b> Red Sox game in Fenway Park, John Farrell noticed that Pineda was using pine tar again. Farrell walked to the home plate umpire and got Pineda ejected from the game in the 2nd inning.|$|E

5|$|Stengel {{also participated}} in Old-Timers' Day {{at a number of}} ballparks, including, regularly, Shea Stadium.

5|$|The Yankees would however receive {{one notable}} moment of glory against the Red Sox during this era.

5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release <b>Yankee</b> Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking.

Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced <b>Yankee</b> Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E
