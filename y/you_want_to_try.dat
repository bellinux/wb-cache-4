On 8 June 2009, media {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of the}} year. Speaking of her decision to quit, Lister stated: [...] "It's scary but also very, very exciting. I think three years in a soap is enough to do and you get to a point where you either make a decision that this is what you do or <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> something different." [...] She also revealed that she had been planning to leave the series one year prior to announcement. Lister's decision to quit matched that of co-star Loui Batley (Sarah Barnes). Hollyoaks officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Lister and Batley would leave towards the end of the year in a storyline that would see [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", later revealing that either Sarah or Zoe would be killed off in a dramatic storyline. Lister also revealed in an interview with Heat magazine that she was [...] "nervous", but [...] "very excited" [...] about leaving the show.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934 McGee Airways {{obtained}} the first airmail contract to deliver mail to the Bristol Bay area of southwest Alaska. He hired Roy Dickson to fly the new mail route. Dickson had brought a B-1 Ryan airplane to Alaska in March, 1934, and flew the summer mining season for Alaska Exploration & Mining Company out of Cantwell. McGee approached him in the Parsons Hotel in Anchorage with a proposition. [...] "It's a new project, never been tried before, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it?" [...] Dickson was anxious to get on McGee's payroll so he could bring his family to Alaska from the states. His Ryan {{was in need of}} an overhaul, and he had been paid mostly in company stock rather than cash for his summer's work. He accepted McGee's offer, sold the Ryan to Bowman Airways, and sent for his family. Dickson flew the mail route until late 1935, when he founded his own company Bering Sea Airways.|$|E

2500|$|In July and August, {{the band}} went on tour with Killswitch Engage and Santa Sangre. After being planned for release in July, Last Night in Town was {{released}} on August 14 through Ferret Music. Chris Gramlich of Exclaim! called the artwork [...] "striking" [...] and it said it featured the band [...] "decked out Reservoir Dogs-style, beating the tar out of some poor jerk". Buckley said it was [...] "really dark, [...] really sarcastic". A music video was released for [...] "The Logic of Crocodiles", which featured wrestler Matt Cross. The band subsequently went on tour with Killswitch Engage, Poison the Well, American Nightmare and Eighteen Visions. In October, the band went on tour with Martyr A.D.. For November and December, Novack drummed for Martyr A.D. due to their drummer being absent. In December 2001 and January 2002, the band went on tour with Bloodlet. For a show with Shai Hulud on January 11, 2002, the band performed as a four-piece with Buckley on bass. During the show, the band reportedly said [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out to be our permanent bass player, talk to us at the merch table." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April 2013, Nicolas Maduro won {{the presidential}} {{election}} with 50.6% of the vote, ahead of the 49.1% of candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, surprisingly close compared to previous polls. Opposition leaders made accusations of fraud shortly after the election and Capriles {{refused to accept the}} results, alleging that voters had been coerced to vote for Maduro and claiming election irregularities. The National Electoral Council (CNE), which conducted a post-election audit of a random selection of 54% of the votes, comparing electronic records with paper ballots, claimed to find nothing suspicious. Capriles initially called for an audit of the remaining 46% of the votes, asserting that this would show that he had won the election. The CNE agreed to carry out an audit, and planned to do so in May. Later Capriles changed his mind, adding demands for a full audit of the electoral registry, and calling the audit process “a joke”. Before the government agreed to a full audit of the vote, there were public protests by opponents of Maduro. The crowds were ultimately dispersed by National Guard members using tear gas and rubber bullets. President Maduro responded to the protests by saying, “If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to oust us through a coup, the people and the armed forces will be waiting for you.” [...] The clashes resulted in 7 people killed and dozens injured. President Maduro described the protests as a [...] "coup" [...] attempt, and blamed the United States for them. Finally, Capriles told protesters to stop and not play the [...] "government's game," [...] so {{there would be no more}} deaths. On 12 June 2013 the results of the partial audit were announced. The CNE certified the initial results and confirmed Maduro's electoral victory.|$|E
