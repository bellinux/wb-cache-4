40|$|Sustainable Intensification of {{agricultural}} production systems will require changes in farm practice. Within arable cropping systems, reducing {{the intensity of}} tillage practices (e. g. reduced tillage) potentially offers one such sustainable intensification approach. Previous researchers have tended to {{examine the impact of}} reduced tillage on specific factors such as yield or weed burden, while, by definition, sustainable intensification necessitates a system-based analysis approach. Drawing upon a bio-economic optimisation model, ‘MEETA’, we quantify trade-off implications between potential <b>yield</b> <b>reductions,</b> reduced cultivation costs and increased crop protection costs. We extend the MEETA model to quantify farm-level net margin, in addition to quantifying farm-level gross margin, net energy, and greenhouse gas emissions. For the lowest intensity tillage system, zero tillage, results demonstrate financial benefits over a conventional tillage system even when the zero tillage system includes yield penalties of 0 - 14. 2 % (across all crops). Average <b>yield</b> <b>reductions</b> from zero tillage literature range from 0 - 8. 5 %, demonstrating that reduced tillage offers a realistic and attainable sustainable intensification intervention, given the financial and environmental benefits, albeit that <b>yield</b> <b>reductions</b> will require more land to compensate for loss of calories produced, negating environmental benefits observed at farm-level. However, increasing uptake of reduced tillage from current levels will probably require policy intervention; an extension of the recent changes to the CAP (‘Greening’) provides an opportunity to do this...|$|R
