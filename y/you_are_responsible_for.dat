2500|$|In 1991, Horne {{was sentenced}} to three years for {{possession}} of explosive substances. His attitude appeared to harden while in jail. In June 1993, {{he wrote in the}} Support Animal Rights Prisoners Newsletter: [...] "The animals continue to die and the torture goes on in greater and greater measure. Peoples' answer to this? More vegeburgers, more Special Brew and more apathy. There is no longer any Animal Liberation Movement. That died long ago. All that is left is a very few activists who care, who understand and who act ... If you don't act then you condone. If you don't fight then you don't win.

60|$|I {{have been}} {{listening}} to what was said here, and there is in it a lesson of citizenship. You created the police, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> them. One must pause, therefore, before criticising them too harshly. They are citizens, just as we are. A little of citizenship ought to be taught at the mother's knee and in the nursery. Citizenship is what makes a republic; monarchies can get along without it. What keeps a republic on its legs is good citizenship.|$|E

Know then, {{the infamous}} dogs are very weak, and terrified {{at the news}} of your progress: one, whom I think they call Jabaster, has {{departed}} with {{the great majority of}} the people into the interior of the desert, about seven hundred strong. I heard so; but mind, I do not know it. The young man, whom you call Alroy, being wounded in a recent conflict, could not depart with them, but remains among the ruins with some female prisoners, some treasure, and about a hundred companions hidden in sepulchres. He gave me my freedom on condition that I should fall in with you, and assure you that the dogs, full five thousand strong, had given you the go-by in the night, and marched towards Hamadan. They wanted me to frighten you; it was a lie, and I could not tell it.

6000|$|A boy's {{life is not}} all comedy; much of {{the tragic}} enters into it.

[...] I was not responsible for it, for I had meant him no harm, but only good, when I let him have the matches; but no matter, mine was a trained Presbyterian conscience, and knew but the one duty--to hunt and harry its slave upon all pretexts and on all occasions; particularly {{when there was no}} sense or reason in it. The tramp--who was to blame--suffered ten minutes; I, who was not to blame, suffered three months.|$|E
6000|$|... "And of all unmitigated immoral gouges, your {{destruction}} of the closed-shop principle was the limit. You know how it was done. You bought out Farburg, the last president of the old American Federation of Labour. He was your creature--or the creature of all the trusts and employers' associations, {{which is the same}} thing. You precipitated the big closed-shop strike. Farburg betrayed that strike. You won, and the old American Federation of Labour crumbled to pieces.
