Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife.

40|$|At {{the climax}} of Kazuo Ishiguro’s 2005 novelNever Let Me Go, as the facts of her {{circumstance}} are being revealed to her, the narrator asks, “Why did <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> a thing like that? Did someone think we didn’t have souls?” (260). That the existence of her soul {{should be taken to}} be self-evident has come to constitute something of a commonplace among commentators on the novel. That her soul’s existence might be considered a question at all arises from {{the fact that she is}} a clone. To suggest that this clone, Kathy H., and the many others who populate the novel may be something other than fully human, that they may lack “souls”—to suggest, indeed, that one might “have to prove a thing like that”—lands the critic in an uncomfortable alliance with the clearly cruel society that emerges in the negative space of the narrative. The novel seems to demand that the reader endow the clones with humanity, lest she find herself on the wrong side of an ethical divide, aligned with a social logic that would authorize the cultivation of populations of human clones for the sole purpose of harvesting their organs. Needless to say, one would be wise to think twice before taking this leap, and it is a leap few critics have seen fit to take...|$|E

There is lots of legal regulations associated with fishery. In the Czech Republic, all the rivers are state. If {{you like to}} manage a fishery, {{you will have to}} win in the intimately defined selection. Fishing-office lays down species and numbers of fish, which you have to regulary stock (they negotiate it with you). You can get the authorisation for management of the fishery for 10 years. But in fact, nowadays all riverine fisheries are under the management of the Czech Fishing Union and there is no chance for another applicat because the Czech Fishing Union holds older authorisation which has no limited validity. Fishing-office can take away the authorisation if you don't keep the rules. If you want fishing, you must have a fishing licence. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> some knowledge. Czech people {{have to go to a}} course, foreign people have to show a licence from their country.

40|$|Disabled youth {{transition}} from the education system into the labour market is usually considered {{not only in the}} field of sociological researches but also {{in the context of the}} social policy. Moreover, the phenomenon of school-to-work transition of the disabled youth includes different institutional, structural, economical, ideological, etc. contexts. The aim of the dissertation is to explore the phenomenon of the school-to-work transition in Lithuania. The research of this dissertation is based on the Systematic Grounded Theory (GT) as developed by A. Strauss and J. Corbin. The Field theory (1983) as developed by P. Bourdieu was used for the theoretical framing of empirical data. The developed GT “(Self-) empowerment of the Disabled: <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> constantly that you can” allows to understand and explain the emergence of self-empowerment during the {{transition from}} the education system to the labour market of the disabled youth by using individual factors (education, health condition, professional dispositions, job searching strategies and professional experience) as well as the way external structures (external factors) act as structuring (restricting) or enabling factors affecting the school-to-work transition (the employment policy for disabled people, the structure of the labour market demands, the employers’ attitudes towards disability and people with disabilities and the working conditions of the disabled staff). The stigma of disability can be seen as an epiphenomenon in the analysis of the school-to-work transition which is incorporated into the young disabled people’s habitus and their tactics of disability disclosure. All of the above mentioned factors are determinants of the (self-) empowerment for young people with disabilities influencing the positive or negative outcomes of the transition from education to the labour market and the relevant positive or negative estimates, i. e. the position in the structure of the labour market which can be characterized by employing the concepts of “ability” and “disability” as well as by distinctive transition trajectories...|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} decade, the biggest {{question}} in trademark law has been how to prove dilution. This is a clear sign of something. Can no smart attorney, judge or social scientist figure out what dilution is and how to prove it? Dilution {{has proven to be}} a 2 ̆ 2 dauntingly elusive concept, 2 ̆ 2 according to the Fourth Circuit. Even the Supreme Court does not 2 ̆ 2 get 2 ̆ 2 dilution. In oral arguments in Moseley v. V. Secret Catalog, nearly all of the questions from the Justices were seeking to simply understand what dilution is. Other courts either do not get dilution, or else they just do not like it. Courts that have ruled in dilution cases have read additional restrictions into the act. What these courts are doing can be characterized as 2 ̆ 2 judicial nullification. 2 ̆ 2 These courts seem to be uncomfortable with the apparent breadth of the new right and are seeking to reign it in with additional limitations. The Supreme Court in the V. Secret case also evidenced some distaste for dilution, but admirably tried to wrestle it down nonetheless. The Court ultimately failed to define dilution and acknowledged this by holding that whatever dilution is, at least <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> it. Trademark owners desire a likelihood of dilution standard rather than an actual dilution standard because they cannot prove actual dilution. They cannot prove actual dilution because there is no such harm. The Supreme Court could not provide guidance because they could not articulate the harm that needed to be proved. The trademark bar takes it on faith that dilution exists and would like it to be presumed. The main problem with dilution law is that it provides a remedy without a supportable theorization of the harm. It is not a strong sense of harm that is motivating the push for dilution protection. Instead, it a strong reaction to a perceived sense of the bad faith on the part of defendants. When defending dilution, proponents frequently state that defendants in dilution cases can only have bad faith intentions to use these famous marks. So dilution protection is desired not so much to protect famous trademark owners 2 ̆ 7 property, but instead to protect against others 2 ̆ 7 free rides. If dilution is really about preventing the unfair advantage that results from the non-confusing use of a famous mark, then this really is unfair competition legislation. But an unfair competition right without strict boundaries could easily become a right in gross for the trademark owner...|$|E
