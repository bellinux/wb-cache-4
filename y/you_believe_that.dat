25|$|In {{his review}} (collected in The Present as History, 1953) Marxist Paul Sweezy joked that Hayek would have <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{if there was}} an {{over-production}} of baby carriages, the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, Designing Freedom – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, some {{media outlets}} were criticized for lionizing Reagan without paying equal {{attention}} to more controversial decisions made during his administration. Thomas Kunkel, {{dean of the}} University of Maryland, College Park's journalism college, wrote in A magazine that the coverage [...] "would have <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Reagan was a cross between Abe Lincoln and Mother Teresa, with an overlay of Mister Rogers." [...] Howard Kurtz, The Washington Posts media columnist, said Reagan was [...] "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest." [...] The Nation ran {{a series of articles}} about the many controversies of his presidency.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, then you will have to agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E

500|$|Some critics, however, were displeased {{with the}} film's long running time {{and lack of}} action scenes. [...] "The film gets mired in the {{inevitable}} red tape of police investigations," [...] wrote Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, who also felt that the film [...] "stumbles to a rather unfulfilling conclusion" [...] and [...] "seems to {{last as long as}} the Oscars." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer felt that [...] "Mr. Fincher's flair for casting is the major asset of his curiously attenuated return to the serial-killer genre. I keep saying 'curiously' with regard to Mr. Fincher, because I can't really figure out what he is up to in Zodiac – with its two-hour-and-37-minute running time for what struck me as a shaggy-dog narrative." [...] Christy Lemire wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that [...] "Jake Gyllenhaal is both the central figure and the weakest link... But he's never fleshed out sufficiently to make <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he'd sacrifice his safety and that of his family to find the truth. We are told repeatedly that the former Eagle Scout is just a genuinely good guy, but that's not enough." ...|$|E
500|$|A workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a {{vacation}} or left England during the forty {{years before he}} died. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, {{similar to those of}} Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, and J. D. Salinger. Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on Full Metal Jacket, who knew him well, considers his [...] "reclusiveness" [...] to be myth: [...] "e was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people... {{he was one of the}} most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone." [...] Lo Brutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was because he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was because for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles, and had thought London a superior film production center to New York.|$|E
500|$|Journalists and pundits {{reviewing}} the final praised Liverpool's tenacity; radio commentator Alan Green {{wrote in his}} News Letter column of 14 May 2001: [...] "Simply, they never give up {{and when you have}} a player like Michael Owen within your ranks <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> any situation can be rescued, {{as it was in the}} magnificent Millennium Stadium." [...] The Guardian correspondent David Lacey declared [...] "The Owen of France '98 was reborn in Cardiff," [...] while Hugh McIlvanney of The Sunday Times called Owen [...] "the master executioner of English football." [...] McIlvanney felt over the 90 minutes the Arsenal team were [...] "unlucky to lose," [...] lauding Vieira's show in midfield. James Lawton's match report in The Independent was not as empathetic; although in praise of Henry's performance his indecision compared to Owen, demonstrated how [...] "effect, not style, is everything" [...] in football. Clive White of The Herald criticised Henry's lack of end product, using the final and Arsenal's European failure against Valencia to demonstrate how he would never be considered a [...] "natural goalscorer". Ron Atkinson, writing in his tactics column for The Guardian noted Liverpool's winning goal only came about because of Arsenal's eagerness to attack, which left gaps in defence.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} distributed under the title Cop Killer, named for {{the song of the}} same name, which criticizes violent police officers. During the production of the album, Warner Bros. executives were aware of the potential controversy that the album and song could cause, but supported it. At a Time-Warner shareholders' meeting, actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song [...] "KKK Bitch" [...] to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action. Sire responded by changing the title to Body Count, but did not remove the song. In an article for the Washington Post, Tipper Gore condemned Ice-T for songs like [...] "Cop Killer," [...] writing that [...] "Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South's continuation of slavery. Ice-T's financial success cannot excuse the vileness of his message [...] Hitler's anti-Semitism sold in Nazi Germany. That didn't make it right." [...] The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. CLEAT called for a boycott of all products by Time-Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. Ice-T asserted that the song was written {{from the point of view}} of a fictional character, and told reporters that [...] "I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. But I never did it. If <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut," [...] in reference to Bowie's song [...] "Space Oddity".|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard later {{referred}} to his concept of choosing yourself as the single individual in The Concept of Anxiety, June 17, 1844, and then in his , August 31, 1844, and once again in Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, 1847. William James echoed Kierkegaard in his lecture on The Sick Soul where he wrote, [...] "the man must die to an unreal life before he can be born into the real life." [...] You are outside yourself and therefore cannot do without the other as opposition; <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> only a restless spirit is alive, and all who are experienced believe that only a quiet spirit is truly alive. For you a turbulent sea {{is a symbol of}} life; for me it is the quiet, deep water. Either/Or Part II p. 144, HongAnxiety is a qualification of dreaming spirit, and as such it has its place in psychology. Awake, the difference between myself and my other is posited; sleeping, it is suspended; dreaming, it is an intimated nothing. The actuality of the spirit constantly shows itself as a form that tempts its possibility but disappears as soon as it seeks to grasp for it, and it is a nothing that can only bring anxiety. More it cannot do as long as it merely shows itself. The concept of anxiety is almost never treated in psychology. Therefore, I must point out that it is altogether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom’s actuality as the possibility of possibility. For this reason, anxiety is not found in the beast, precisely because by nature the beast is not qualified as spirit. The Concept of Anxiety, Nichol p. 42 ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{also used}} without a {{predicate}} nominative, which is not very common in Koine Greek, thus some interpret it as Jesus' own self-declaration as God. In [...] Jesus states: [...] "For unless <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I am, you will die in your sins", and later the crowd attempts to stone Jesus {{in response to his}} statement in : [...] "Before Abraham was, I am.". Many other translations including the ASV have rendered John 8:24 as something like [...] "... For unless <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I am , you will die in your sins.". Some consider the phrase in John 8:58 to be grammatically different from that in John 8:24, as the copulative verb can be used with any predicative expression and not only a predicate nominative, such as in [...] "ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἦτε" [...] ("where I am, you also may be") in [...] [...] "πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι" [...] ("before Abraham was") can be taken as a predicative prepositional phrase, thus [...] "ἐγώ εἰμὶ" [...] ("I am") in John 8:58 does not grammatically require a predicate nominative, however it is rather unusual for a present tense verb to be used with a temporal adverb like πρὶν in a declarative statement, though there are rare exceptions outside the New Testament. Thus explanations of John 8:58 generally depend on theology and not Greek grammar.|$|E
