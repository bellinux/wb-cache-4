5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>my</b> own principles will be maintained.|$|E

500|$|An 'It Girl' to me {{is someone}} who is selfless, someone who's always {{thinking}} about others before she thinks about herself. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>my</b> mom is a very charitable woman, so I'd want someone who {{is in line with}} that kind of thought process. I also like a girl who's polite. I feel like that's a lost art, and just saying 'please' and 'thank you' goes a very long way with me. That's just so lost these days. So, ladies, it's OK to say 'thank you.' ...|$|E

500|$|... "Cosas De La Vida" [...] (Things of Life) is {{a romantic}} {{tropical}} bachata ballad, infused with R rhythms: [...] "They {{are the things}} of life, don't ask me for an explanation, our love is first, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> heart is yours. For the sake of us two, fight for our love against temptation". The track features Queen and Dominican bachata singer Frank Reyes; she expressed her love for the song (and bachata in general), calling it a genre where [...] "men express themselves with women". The minor-key [...] "Cansada" [...] (Tired) showcases Queen's rapping skills, featuring techno synthesizers. Frances Tirado of Primera Hora described it as [...] "pegajosa" [...] ("addictive").|$|E
500|$|Mars {{claims that}} his work with other artists has {{influenced}} his musical style: [...] " [...] Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's Just the Way You Are. If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> story, you know I love all different genres of music." [...] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: [...] "In Hawaii {{some of the biggest}} radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first." ...|$|E

He eventually decides to spend it on people who are in need of money and holds interviews. In one of these interviews, Frink introduces Grampa to his latest invention, the Death Ray, claiming that [...] "it is just a prototype. With proper funding I’m confident this little baby could destroy {{an area the size of}} New York City!" [...] Grampa responds with [...] "But I want to help people, not kill ‘em!", to which Frink replies [...] "Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> wife will be happy, she’s hated this whole Death Ray thing from day one." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, it is a [...] "mutating, episodic dance-floor track, [...] {{the singer}} {{presents}} {{herself as the}} goddess of love in the 'seashell bikini' painted by Botticelli [...] ". The lyrics of [...] "Venus" [...] are space-themed, name-checking the planets in the Solar System, with references to the planet's mythical counterpart, Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. The extraterrestrial themes drew comparisons to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] (2011) in the Entertainment Weekly review of the track. John Walker from MTV News noted that [...] "During Gaga's futuristic ballroom emcee moment, where she channels something straight out of Paris Is Burning she utters the line 'Uranus!/ Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> ass is famous!?' That's like, the greatest version of 'Don't You Know Who I Am!?' that we've ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow: Rightful {{captain of}} the Black Pearl, Jack fell victim of mutiny from his crew under the {{direction}} of his first-mate Hector Barbossa. Left for dead, marooned on a deserted island, Sparrow is back in search of his ship and those who betrayed him. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name [...] "Jack Sparrow"; however, he was not well known outside his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, [...] "a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate." [...] At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards, who would later appear as Jack's father in [...] Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, [...] "He's ruining the film!" [...] Depp answered back, [...] "Look, these are the choices I made. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> work. So either trust me or give me the boot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of Olga's beauty, British novelist George Moore was unimpressed. As {{he commented}} to an admiring artist friend, [...] "By Jove, you're all after the girl, a fine Mélisande for the stage, with her {{beautiful}} hair {{down to her}} heels. She's paintable, I admit, but as to one's daily use, I should rather have the mother than the child. Too slender for me ... <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> tastes." ...|$|E

[...] To which Merman replied [...] "Ah, honey, how much will it cost {{me to tell you}} to go fuck yourself?!".|$|E
2500|$|With this {{painting}}, Munch met his {{stated goal}} of [...] "the {{study of the}} soul, {{that is to say}} the study of my own self". Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again." ...|$|E
2500|$|His only opera, Genoveva, Op. 81, {{was written}} in 1848. In it, Schumann {{attempted}} to abolish recitative, which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on Richard Wagner; Schumann's consistently flowing melody {{can be seen as}} a forerunner to Wagner's Melos). The subject of Genoveva – based on Ludwig Tieck and Christian Friedrich Hebbel –was not an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: Nibelungen, Lohengrin and Till Eulenspiegel.|$|E

2500|$|Reform of {{the office}} is usually only {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a New Zealand republic. Helen Clark, when defending Dame Silvia Cartwright following a political controversy over prison sentences, stated [...] "ne of the challenges for us is we clearly are no longer a dominion of Britain where the Governor-General is exactly like the Queen. I think we need to consider how the role of governor-general might evolve further. As <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>my</b> view is that one day there will be a president fulfilling the kind of role the governor-general does." [...] Others, such as Professor Noel Cox have argued that the Governor-General's role needs to be updated, rather than reforming the office. Some constitutional academics expressed concern that the process of electoral reform could result in the Governor-General having greater political influence. In 1993, the then Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard caused controversy by suggesting that under the proposed Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system, the Governor-General may have to use their reserve powers more often. Following the adoption of MMP at a referendum later in 1993, Prime Minister Jim Bolger suggested at the opening of parliament in 1994 that one reason New Zealand might move to a republic was that the Governor-General would have more influence under the new electoral system.|$|E
