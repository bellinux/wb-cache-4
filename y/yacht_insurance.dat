Many of these vessels rely upon cutting edge technology, innovative design and state of the art communications systems. Built by a growing number of specialist yacht builders, managed, crewed and operated by superyacht professionals, the superyacht industry has in recent years evolved as a distinct and separate industry alongside mainstream shipping, but with subtle differences of approach and traps for the non-specialist.
