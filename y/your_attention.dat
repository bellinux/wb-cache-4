This you should comply with immediately. Every (local) union should have a rifle club. I strongly advise you to provide every member with the latest improved rifle, which can be obtained from the factory at a nominal price. I entreat you to take action on this important question, so that in two years we can hear the inspiring music of the martial tread of 25,000 armed men in the ranks of labor.|$|E

'Talent borrows, genius steals,' [...] "Let's see how many other clichés I can throw in there. That's exactly it. I was only hinting early on, but then I tell it like it is. It's like, now that I have <b>your</b> <b>attention,</b> I have a few things to tell you." ...|$|E

500|$|Edward Gertler, {{author of}} Keystone Canoeing, writes that Loyalsock Creek's [...] "exciting whitewater, above Forksville, {{has long been}} a {{favorite}} of paddlers who are quick and tolerant enough to endure its fickle water levels and weather". This is the stretch of the creek in and near the park, whose [...] "long, steepening, and complex boulder patch and ledgy rapids demand <b>your</b> <b>attention...</b> A boater's chute through the middle of the swimming area dam at Worlds End State Park climaxes this run".|$|E
500|$|... "Longshot {{does have}} one major saving grace, {{and that is}} the penciling of Arthur Adams. I'm going to once again go out on my prophetic limb and predict that Art will soon become a fan favorite. He has a dynamic style that grabs <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> and won't let go. To be sure, he {{exhibits}} some of the weaknesses of any young artist, the occasional awkward pose or crude drawing--but as a first effort this is incredibly impressive. In fact, this limited series should be worth buying simply to watch the progress Adams makes from issue to issue.|$|E
500|$|Wario World {{received}} {{criticism for}} its length, with some reviewers {{stating that the}} game was shorter than the average console title. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer compared Wario World to Luigi's Mansion, a game also criticized for its length, {{and said that the}} game was like Luigi's Mansion [...] "all over again". GameSpy stated that Wario World [...] "offers little above and beyond the standard 3D platform romp, and what is offered turns out to be very short and repetitive". GameSpot commented that [...] "the final product is too short and simplistic to hold <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> for more than a day".|$|E

500|$|Hugh Cott's 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals {{introduced}} ideas such as [...] "maximum disruptive contrast". This uses {{streaks of}} boldly contrasting colour, which paradoxically make animals or military vehicles less visible by breaking up their outlines. Cott explains that in ideal conditions, background colour matching together with countershading would [...] "suffice to render an animal absolutely invisible against a plain background", but at once adds that conditions are hardly ever ideal, {{as they are}} constantly changing, as is the light. Therefore, Cott argues, camouflage has {{to break up the}} perceived continuous surfaces of an object and its outlines. In Cott's own words, [...] "for effective concealment, it is essential that the tell-tale appearance of form should be destroyed." [...] Cott draws an analogy with a pickpocket who carefully distracts <b>your</b> <b>attention,</b> arguing that: ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2005, McAdams starred with Sarah Jessica Parker and Diane Keaton in the {{seasonal}} family comedy-drama The Family Stone, which gave McAdams {{an opportunity to}} play a dishevelled and sardonic sister, rather than the usual [...] "obvious" [...] girlfriend or wife roles. She was eager to work with Keaton and remarked, [...] "It's never about line counts for me. It's about the people I get to work with." [...] Justin Chang of Variety noted that [...] "a deglammed but still radiant McAdams proves once again that she's the real deal, delivering a deliciously feisty performance". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt that her [...] "engaging screen presence holds <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> and sympathy despite the handicap presented by her character's personality." [...] The film was a commercial success: it cost $18 million to make and grossed over $92 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|For {{his role}} as an enigmatic master thief in Dhoom 2 (2006)—an action sequel co-starring Aishwarya Rai, Bipasha Basu and Abhishek Bachchan—Roshan won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The film critic Rajeev Masand called him [...] "the heart, the soul, {{and the spirit of}} the film", and praised his stunts, {{concluding}} that he [...] "holds the film together and even manages to take <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> away from its many flaws". Bored by playing the [...] "good guy", Roshan was excited to play a villain for the first time. At the request of the film's producer Aditya Chopra, Roshan lost [...] for the role, and learned skateboarding, snow boarding, rollerblading and sand surfing. With earnings of , Dhoom 2 became the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, a distinction it held for two years. In the 2007 melodrama Om Shanti Om, he made a cameo alongside several Bollywood stars.|$|E

500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{was written}} by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in {{collaboration}} with Henrik Jonback. In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E
500|$|Loud was {{recorded}} in various recording studios worldwide including the Larrabee Sound Studios, The Village and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, Platinum Sound Recording Studios, and Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and The Bunker Studios in Paris. In September 2010, during a webchat with her fansite Rihannadaily.com, Rihanna announced that the album would be called Loud, saying [...] "get Loud everybody, get crazy, get excited, because I'm pumped. I'm just gonna be me, because that's what you guys love the most, and that's what makes me feel best. Just being normal, normal for me is Loud! Sassy, fun, flirty, energetic." [...] While Rihanna was filming Battleship, she explained {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Tonight, [...] "Loud is, the word, the name of the album definitely reflects the attitude of it, it's really sassy and flirty and it grabs <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> and that's why I enjoy it. It takes you through a really really interesting ride. So colorful the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Kotaku {{gave the}} release a {{generally}} positive rating, praising the redone visuals, tweaked gameplay and expanded content, but also noting the game's age is still palpable. Game Informer gave the collection an 8.25 out of 10, stating [...] "The {{core of this}} collection is the excellent original game, and that’s where <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> should be. The other two lowly offerings are inessential bonus features." [...] Joystiq gave a positive, unscored review, saying the collection [...] "captures that early era of the franchise at its purest simplicity. It's a trip down memory lane for long-term fans, while the visual overhaul and back-to-beginnings story should make it a welcoming entry point for newcomers." [...] GameSpot gave the HD remake a 7 out of 10, saying, [...] "Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix presents {{a couple of the}} earliest games in the beloved series in their best light and makes a revealing cinematic experience out of a third one. The three experiences complement one another with unique elements and welcome context that is a treat for longtime fans and newcomers alike." ...|$|E

500|$|Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today {{commented that}} [...] "I've heard lead singer Mac Powell {{and the others}} say that they put more blood and sweat into their tenth studio album than any {{previous}} effort. It's not just hyperbole, it's a Revelation, and it ranks with their best albums so far", but noted that the album is [...] "briskly paced with 13 songs in just 43 minutes; only the radio single [...] "Call My Name" [...] runs over 4 minutes. That's a good thing in that the album easily holds <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> from one lean song to another, but it deprives Third Day the opportunity to delve into longer instrumental jams or deeper lyrics about the conversations we share with God during the darker times in life". Graeme Crawford of Cross Rhythms gave the album {{nine out of ten}} stars and opined that [...] "the newly slimmed down band deliver a quality record that all Third Day fans will enjoy" [...] and that it [...] "should be investigated by anyone with even a passing interest in rock music".|$|E
500|$|Peckham {{often was}} in {{conflict}} with his subordinate bishops, mainly because of his efforts to reform them, but Peckham's own attitude and handling of his clergy contributed to the problem. He once wrote to Roger de Meyland, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield [...] "These things need <b>your</b> <b>attention,</b> but you have been absent so long that you seem not to care. We therefore order you, on receipt of this letter, {{to take up residence}} in your diocese, so that—even if you are not competent to redress spiritual evils—you may at least minister to the temporal needs of the poor." [...] The historian Richard Southern says that Peckham's disputes with his suffragan bishops were [...] "conducted in an atmosphere of bitterness and perpetual ill-will", which probably owed something to a [...] "petulant strain in Peckham's character". Peckham's conflicts started because his own ideals were those of a Franciscan, but most of his clergy were concerned with more mundane and materialistic affairs. These strains between the archbishop and his subordinates were intensified by clashes over ecclesiastical and secular authority, as well as Edward's great need for income.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{performances}} of the lead pair, their chemistry, {{the music and the}} production design, particularly the re-creation of 1960s Mumbai, but were disappointed with the story's predictability. Calling the film [...] "uncomplicated and charming", Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Not the usual romantic fare, this one presents three different stories in three different eras without getting theatrical or melodramatic. Thanks to its innovative storytelling, it comes across as the perfect date movie, holding tremendous appeal for the Facebook Gen. Teri Meri Kahaani is pleasurable and fascinating in equal measures." [...] He said that the chemistry between the lead actors was what made the film work, and noted the production design as [...] "impressive" [...] and the cinematography as [...] "top notch". Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5 stars, concluding, [...] "Teri Meri Kahaani holds <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> whether it's the writing, storytelling, or the technical aspect. It's a popcorn cruncher, but that's also fairly intelligent and hearty." [...] She added that the two leads [...] "sparkle with earnestness and zing," [...] with Kapoor [...] "sure to increase his fan-following several fold" [...] and Chopra [...] "easily slipping in-and-out of the layered characters with dexterity." ...|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Noting it as a [...] "a very good success, especially so {{since it has}} melody at its base", Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the album a rating of 4 out of 5, writing, [...] "Sajid-Wajid and Prasoon Joshi can be rest assured that their music would {{reach out to the}} masses in a big way and find very good appreciation." [...] Hindustan Times gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, praising its [...] "youthful fervour" [...] and adding that [...] "the album manages to capture the essence of three different periods on which the film is premised." [...] The Times of India gave it 3 out of 5, also commenting on its fresh and youthful feel, and calling it [...] "another hit album" [...] despite the fact that [...] "it falls short in some songs". Koimoi gave the [...] "good album" [...] 3 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "as a package it has enough ingredients in it that would ensure that the songs do catch <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> when they are played on screen." [...] BBC identified the album as [...] "A crowd pleaser featuring the cream of the industry’s playback singers." ...|$|E
500|$|Aadisht Khanna from Mint praised Tripathi's {{portrayal}} of Shiva in the book, complimenting {{the fact that}} he was able to successfully deliver the humane side of his characters, and their emotions and motivations. He also pointed out that Tripathi's experimentation with Indian Scriptures, has been successful in transforming an otherwise mundane genre, [...] "long overdue in popular literature, especially by an Indian author". However, he was disappointed in the weak dialogue and the grammatical errors scattered throughout the book, especially the inclusion of [...] "glaringly out-of-place world" [...] words, thus having too many anachronism in the book. Rito Paul from Daily News and Analysis shared Khanna's opinion, while saying that the book [...] "is impressive in its conception. But it is executed poorly. [...] "We're thrust into the narrative, mid-action, exactly from where the first book ended. And the breathless pace of the action hardly ever lets up... There are more twists and turns than in a Gordian knot, and at least two revelations of the 'Luke-I-am-your-father' variety... And it really rankles, because there is so much scope for flair, adventure and wonder in the world Tripathi has imagined... The Secrets is not a bad book. The plot holds <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> and the story races along, but the writing veers between the pedestrian and the ridiculous. Tripathi is an excellent story-teller. But he is a poor writer." ...|$|E
500|$|To avert {{a republican}} backlash, Ouro Preto {{exploited}} the ready credit available to Brazil {{as a result}} of its prosperity. He made available massive loans at favorable interest rates to plantation owners and lavishly granted titles and lesser honors to curry favor with influential political figures who had become disaffected. He also indirectly began to address the problem of the recalcitrant military by revitalizing the moribund National Guard, by then an entity which existed mostly only on paper. As the Count of Nioac, a noted politician, remarked: [...] "I call <b>your</b> <b>attention</b> especially to the reorganization of the National Guard, in order to possess this force with which in past times the government suppressed military revolts. If we had had the National Guard reorganized, the Deodoros and other ignorant military men would have been quiet." [...] Pedro II also asked Salvador Mendonça, who was leaving to the U.S. to represent Brazil at the First International Conference of American States, to carefully study the U.S. Supreme Court with the goal of creating a similar tribunal in Brazil and transferring his constitutional prerogatives to it. This would have made the monarch a mere figurehead. It is not known if he intended to constrain his daughter's powers as empress and make her thus more palatable to the politicians, or whether he had something else in mind.|$|E

You have done wonders already {{in the way of}} misleading the Doctor. There is only one objection to that girl at the theater--I hear she is so pretty that she may possibly displease the Princess. In other respects, she is just in the public position which will make <b>your</b> <b>attentions</b> to her look like the beginning of a serious intrigue. Bravo, Mr. Ernest--bravo!" ...|$|R
