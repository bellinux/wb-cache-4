25|$|By modern {{standards}} CP/M was primitive, {{owing to}} the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there was no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. Starting with 1.1 or 1.2 this danger was reduced: if one changed disks without reading the new disk's directory, and tried to write to it, the operating system would signal a fatal error, avoiding overwriting but requiring a reboot (which took {{no more than a}} few seconds, but entailed losing whatever data <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> save).|$|E

No health professional should be put on trial for looking after injured and dying people." [...] The U.K.-based Royal College of Nursing wrote to the Bahraini government on the health workers' behalf, as well as sending them a direct video message of support in which General Secretary Peter Carter said, [...] "All you were doing was your job. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> care for people." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{difficult}} and unforgiving gameplay frustrated critics. Game Revolution explained that, while in previous Tomb Raider games [...] "instant death came about if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> rush through an area {{and you did}} something stupid", every step in Tomb Raider III [...] "is a potential threat of instant death, no matter how careful you're trying to be." [...] The publication {{went so far as}} to call Tomb Raider III [...] "a marketing concept", stating that the game is so difficult that it is impossible to beat without buying a strategy guide. Similarly, Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the game for being rushed and highly frustrating, noting that it has [...] "too many instances of cheap deaths." [...] The magazine also remarked that the stealth elements in the Nevada levels were ineffective, especially when compared to Konami's 1998 hit Metal Gear Solid.|$|E

500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, what is it that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, {{and was one of the}} reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Colón Sánchez {{expressed}} {{her desire}} to run for a seat as Councilwoman. She {{was supported by the}} Democratic town committee; and endorsed by the mayor, several councilmen, and the Hispanic Democratic Reform Club. Despite all of this support for Colón Sánchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead. Carbone may have been prejudiced against Colón Sánchez's physical appearance and made her feel that she just wasn't ready. According to a statement made by Carbone when she ran for the school board:“We ran María for the school board and she spoke broken English. She wasn't an attractive woman, she was heavy, so where would you take her? How did you sell her? How did you get people to vote for her? And how did you get over the prejudice that she spoke with a thick accent? So we didn't take her into a lot of neighborhoods... You had to be practical as <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get her on the school board.” ...|$|E
