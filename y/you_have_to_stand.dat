500|$|In November 2017, Stephenson {{received}} a Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement, presented {{to him by}} Lenny Henry, who said: [...] "It is a well-known saying that to achieve greatness <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> {{on the shoulders of}} giants. You really are a giant. So without you, there wouldn’t be any black or Asian politicians." [...] The judges' citation said: [...] "Thanks to Paul’s courage, principles and determination, Britain is a more open and tolerant place today. He has changed the way we all live for the better, and his story reminds us that the battle for civil rights was not confined to America." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's lyrics {{explore a}} variety of {{political}} and personal themes related to race, culture, and discrimination. Critic Neil Kulkarni said it appraises [...] "the broken promises and bloody pathways {{in and out of}} America's heartland malaise", while Matthew Phillips from Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that the record offers [...] "dialectical account {{of the relationship between the}} constantly-emerging revolutionary consciousness of black culture and the bare materialism and institutionalization that threaten to destroy it". In an interview with MTV, Kendrick discussed the meaning behind the tracks [...] "Wesley's Theory" [...] and [...] "King Kunta". The album's opening track, [...] "Wesley's Theory", is a reference to Wesley Snipes and how the actor was jailed for tax evasion. In the interview Lamar stated that [...] "no one teaches poor black males how to manage money or celebrity, so if they do achieve success, the powers that be can take it from right under them". He continues by elaborating that [...] "King Kunta" [...] is concerned with the [...] "history of negative stereotypes all African-Americans have to reconcile". The interviewer finishes by asking about Lamar's criticism of rappers who use ghostwriters on [...] "King Kunta", after which Lamar reveals that he came to prominence as a ghostwriter, therefore having respect for writers, but says that [...] "as a new artist, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> behind your work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} spoilt, Osgod, by {{a year of}} {{sleeping}} softly I marked more than once how thickly the rushes were strewn in that corner in which you always slept. How will it be when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> the hardships of a soldier's life?" ...|$|E
50|$|People {{were doing}} the {{original}} Kickflips, where you hook your foot over the side, and the set-up was so rotten. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> parallel a skier. People tried that trick on banks, and rolled in standing like that and fell straight back. I understood that this trick needed no set-up, and it’d be an important move—for me, at least. I knew {{it gave me a}} whole new doorway to go through.|$|R
500|$|Tonelli {{returned}} to Alabama after the Olympics and intensified his training regimen, He recalled that [...] "The coach really supplied {{me with the}} environment to improve. I got used <b>to</b> pressure. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up and race in dual meets almost every other weekend, {{no matter how you}} felt. In Australia you are lucky if you get two top meets a year." [...] In 1977, he won the 100m backstroke at the US Open Championships at Mission Viejo, becoming one of the few Australians to win a US title.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear boy, no, I have an {{assistant}} already," [...] and he sighed, {{this time with}} genuine emotion. [...] "If you come here <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> upon your own legs." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment. [...] "First of all, I {{want to say}} I'm sorry I went by that day without {{answering}} your whistle. Merril had worked me up against you, and since I get a bonus on results, every dollar's worth of freight you picked up was so much out of my pocket. Still, you're not going to remember that against me now. We both earn our bread at sea, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> by me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{give me one}} of the borers--that {{one about}} two and a half feet long. I will hold it, and you strike to begin with, Dias, only mind my fingers. Keep your eye fixed on the top of the borer, and take one or two gentle strokes to begin with; then, when you know the {{distance}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> from it, do your best. You needn't really be afraid of striking my fingers. I shall hold the drill at least a foot from the top." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down on {{the sofa}} and I'll tell you," [...] said Miss Duncan; [...] "I've done it all from your face, too. I've made you a very poor girl brought up by peasants, only you are really of a great family, {{although}} nobody knows it. A rich duke sees you one day when he is hunting and falls in love with you, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> a lot of suffering and persecution because of it, and say nothing. I believe you could do that," [...] added Janet, looking critically at Cynthia's face.|$|E
6000|$|... "An idea just {{popped into}} my head," [...] said the so-styled poet. [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> asked me, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> for it." [...] And in a deep voice he commenced: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Certainly not. You are a boxer without employment, whom I am showing what to hit. In {{such a case}} {{as yours}} the Society would be {{represented}} by a third party, whose decision would be final. As an interested person <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> aside." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{you recall}} the Americans {{in the nineteenth}} century who wrote books that lived forty-two years you will have to begin with Cooper; you can follow with Washington Irving, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Edgar Allan Poe, and there you have to wait a long time. You come to Emerson, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> still and look further. You find Howells and T. B. Aldrich, and then your numbers begin to run pretty thin, and you {{question}} if you can name twenty persons in the United States who--in a whole century have written books that would live forty-two years. Why, you could take them all and put them on one bench there [pointing]. Add the wives and children and you could put the result on, two or three more benches.|$|E
5000|$|Fretter also {{attempted}} to bill its stores as superstores, with a marketing strategy {{similar to that}} of Circuit City and Best Buy. However, the smaller size of its Silo and Fretter's units (10,000 to 15,000 square feet, as opposed to 35,000 square feet or more for a typical Circuit City store), made this an untenable strategy. According to one analyst, [...] "Fretter was vanilla. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> for something. They were so price-conscious that they never even thought about a personality. That's what our arguments with them were always about: <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> for something in the consumer's mind. You can't just live on price alone, or you'll go out of business." ...|$|E

50|$|Yarn: Illusions can be {{made using}} any smooth yarn in two {{contrasting}} colours. The same chart will work equally well in fine or chunky yarn though the thicker yarn will create a much bigger piece of knitting and <b>you</b> may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> further back <b>to</b> get the best effect.|$|R

Thats the story. Walter Scott as I saw him was a good bottom dealer, a second dealer and could riffle the cards very well." [...] " ...|$|E
5000|$|Campbell defended himself, saying [...] "I {{will not}} regret doing that. At times <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> {{up for what}} you believe", and also that he was {{concerned}} about youngsters ending up the same situation. He also defended his links with Christie, stating that he would not have remained with Christie if he thought he had cheated.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was said}} {{about him that}} among New Zealand novelists, he was the 'wild card'. In an {{interview}} with Philip Matthews in 2010 (Weekend, 26 June 2010), he said: [...] "I've always been an outsider, and I'm quite comfortable with that. To retain your critical sense in a small society like New Zealand, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> apart".|$|E
6000|$|... "What the {{mischief}} are {{you getting}} at?" [...] Fenn demanded hotly. [...] "And what right <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> there and cross-question me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, confess more, sir!--Confess {{that to a}} poet a seat unoccupied--the {{chair of}} Banquo--has more charms than if it were filled even as an {{alderman}} would fill it.--What if 'the Dark Ladye'[I-14] should glide in and occupy it?--would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> courage <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> the vision, Mr. Tyrrel?--I assure you the thing is not impossible." ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{darkness}} he could but vaguely {{see the great}} mass of the Cathedral: he hated it {{now because of the}} irksomeness of the long services which he was forced to attend. The anthem was interminable, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> drearily while it was being sung; you could not hear the droning sermon, and your body twitched because <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sit still when you wanted to move about. Then philip thought of the two services every Sunday at Blackstable. The church was bare and cold, and there was a smell all about one of pomade and starched clothes. The curate preached once and his uncle preached once. As he grew up he <b>had</b> learned <b>to</b> know his uncle; Philip was downright and intolerant, and he could not understand that a man might sincerely say things as a clergyman which he never acted up to as a man. The deception outraged him. His uncle was a weak and selfish man, whose chief desire it was to be saved trouble.|$|R
5000|$|Lynn Bradach, {{mother of}} Marine Cpl. Travis Bradach-Nall, who {{died from a}} land mine {{explosion}} in Iraq {{during the summer of}} 2004, travelled from Portland, Oregon to Crawford to join Sheehan in her vigil.

5000|$|For Labor Day weekend, Christy Miller is on a {{houseboat}} at Lake Shasta. What {{could be}} better? She’s {{about to find}} out! Before they know it, both Christy and her best friend, Katie, are receiving some unexpected male attention. But somehow these best friends are at odds just {{when they should be}} having the most fun together. Christy soon realizes that sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> back and let people make their own decisions, even when they’re headed for a fall. And although life is never perfect, this is definitely a time to cherish.|$|E
5000|$|Norman cites his grandfather’s murder at {{the hands}} of the Nazis in Auschwitz as a major {{influence}} on his actions and character and continues to have a ‘holocaust’ mentality, where nothing in one's life should be taken for granted. [...] "I was brought up by a father who was gravely affected by the Holocaust, because his own father was murdered at Auschwitz. I learned the hard way that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up and be counted, not be scared to show that you're Jewish, and be ready to fight for your independence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, I think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{good cause}} <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> on your defence, and I cannot <b>have</b> <b>you</b> grieve over it. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> shown an unshaken {{steadiness}} under trial since, such as ought indeed to be compensation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Devine, drily. [...] "If Slocum <b>had</b> swindled <b>you,</b> {{it would}} <b>have</b> been different, but {{you made a}} foolish deal, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up <b>to</b> it. Nobody {{was going to stop}} you {{surveying}} that land before you bought it, or getting a man who knew its value to do it for you. I'm offering you the option of working for those six thousand dollars. Do you take it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Watcher-by-Night, is it thus you {{greet her}} <b>to</b> whom <b>you</b> <b>have</b> given {{strength}} <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> once more beneath the moon? Come hither and tell me, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> no kiss for one from whom you parted with a kiss?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Simba {{was framed}} for this terrible murder, {{and on the}} one hand you can say it wasn’t his fault, but he wasn’t a {{stand-up}} guy, so {{a little bit of the}} theme of the movie is <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up for yourself if you know you’re right. So that idea of redemption, that idea of that day in your life that you have to take responsibility for yourself, that you’re no longer a child, you’re an adult, all those themes resonated with us when we were making the movie and, thankfully, the audience appreciated them, as well. — Producer Don Hahnon Simba's role in the film.|$|E
50|$|Jones is {{the author}} of <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Stand</b> for Something, or You'll Fall for Anything, a {{collection}} of autobiographical essays published in 1998. Her second book, Shine: A Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Journey to Finding Love (2006), detailed changes she made to reshape her life, including her marriage and dramatic weight loss. She released a third book in March 2011, Satan's Sisters, a roman à clef about a fictional television talk show featuring five women of clashing temperaments.

50|$|During the 1980s {{almost all}} pitches {{on the islands}} were covered with {{artificial}} grass, and {{now more than ever}} the pitches are the public playground (outside training and match hours) for the kids in particular. Many of the grounds aren't real stadiums, as several of them have no seats for the supporters, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up under no cover, often in harsh weather conditions and watch the matches, which usually attract approx. 300 to 1,000 people in the top division. The first official competitive match against Austria was played in Sweden, because there was no suitable grass pitches in the Faroe Islands at that time. Most teams played on artificial pitches, but a few still played on sand pitches.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, take my advice: fight {{your own}} battles, but never {{interfere}} to fight other people's, {{unless you are}} absolutely convinced {{that they are in}} the right. If you are, stick by them as long as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a leg <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> upon." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{shows in}} Australia {{received}} moderate praise from music critics. Noel Mengel (The Courier-Mail) stated the {{shows at the}} Brisbane Entertainment Centre, [...] "restore his faith in modern rock 'n' roll", He says, [...] "Matchbox pursue the middle path {{and they are very}} good at it. But after two hours of it, it seems {{the only one in the}} room who feels like smashing a guitar is me". For the two shows in Sydney, George Palathingal (The Canberra Times) gave the shows two and a half out of five stars. He explains, [...] "… the songs follow such a similar pattern [...] - big, promising opening guitar riffs lead to anthemic-but-generic soft-rock choruses, with Thomas's over-emoted vocals on top - that the set soon gets tiresome. Most in the room probably did 'have a good time tonight'. But that big finish was scant reward for those of us who just want better music throughout a headlining set". In Perth, the concert was deemed [...] "an impressive evening" [...] by Courtney Pearson (The West Australian). She says [...] "They came back for an encore with synth-driven 'Put Your Hands Up' and 1997 hit 'Push', Thomas' voice so arresting <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> still and watch".|$|R
5000|$|Weissenbruch's {{early work}} showed the strong {{influence}} of the romantic painter Andreas Schelfhout. Schelfhout's influence {{can be seen in}} Weissenbruch's early landscapes, painted in precise detail. His magnificent, cloudy skies show his admiration for the seventeenth-century artist Jacob van Ruisdael, whose work he saw at an early age in the Mauritshuis in The Hague. When he was invited to take lessons from this very celebrated artist, his older friend, Bosboom, advised him not to accept. 'I can't simply say [...] "no, thank you" [...] to Schelfhout!" [...] sputtered Weissenbruch. Whereupon Bosboom said: [...] "you should do that, Weiss! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> on your own and see through your own eyes." [...] In 1847, Weissenbruch first exhibited at the exhibition of Living Masters, and {{he became one of the}} founders of the Pulchri Studio.|$|R
