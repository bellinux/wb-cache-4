GameShark.com {{described}} the first two hours of the game as [...] "some of the most boring hours you will ever play in a video game." [...] XenGamers.com {{also pointed out that}} in order to play the game, the player needs [...] "the patience of a rock". Game Informer even went as {{far as to say that}} [...] "four million Japanese can be wrong", referring to the game's immense popularity in Japan. Because of the game's delay in being developed, its release was after the PlayStation 2's release, which created some negative feedback, particularly about the game's graphics. IGN commented on this, calling the game [...] "a game that makes only a bare minimum of concessions to advancing technology, but more than makes up for this with its deep gameplay, massive quest, and sheer variety." [...] GameSpot called the graphics [...] "not good" [...] and warned readers that if the [...] "most rewarding things" [...] they [...] "got out of Final Fantasy VII were the full-motion video interludes, <b>you</b> <b>definitely</b> won't be wowed by anything you see in Dragon Warrior VII." ...|$|E

He played photographer Victor [...] "Animal" [...] Palotti in Godzilla (1998). Godzilla was one of Azaria's first starring roles in a blockbuster film. Its five-month shoot was the longest of his career to date, but he considered it {{a good chance to}} boost his profile. He noted, [...] "I'm so used to melding into every character I play. Even people in the business think the guy who did Birdcage, Quiz Show and Great Expectations are three different actors—which in a way makes me proud, but in another way is very frustrating. It's the curse and blessing of the character actor". The shoot's physical challenges, and the film's critical failure, led Azaria to later describe it as [...] "tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one <b>you</b> <b>definitely</b> chalk up and say, 'That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time'." [...] In 1999, he starred in the drama Mystery, Alaska as Charles Danner, and the comedy superhero film Mystery Men, as the faux-British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja.

On a more negative view, Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, considering that [...] "as fun as this episode can be, there are some places were it just doesn’t quite add up", criticizing writing elements such as the lack of resolution, the explanation for the Flukeman's origins, and the [...] "heavy-handed" [...] introduction of X. A writer from the Vancouver Sun listed [...] "The Host" [...] {{as one of the best}} stand alone episodes of the show, saying that it broke the [...] "B-movie fun at best" [...] quality of most X-Files standalone episodes, saying that [...] "thanks to its cinema-grade made-up effects, claustrophobic sets and chilling subject matter, this Chris Carter-penned episode not only took the show to new heights of horror and suspense, it offered a fresh alternative on network television". [...] "The Host" [...] was later picked for the 2008 DVD The X-Files: Revelations, with eight episodes Chris Carter considered [...] "essential grounding" [...] for the film [...] The plot for the episode was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin.|$|E
