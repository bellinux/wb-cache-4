5|$|The {{story that}} the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's {{meteoric}} rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two <b>years.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>his</b> 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol {{at the height of}} the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist who had lived, {{performed}} and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw Russia as a musical desert compared to Paris, Berlin and Leipzig, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their art. With a similar ideal in mind for Russia, he had conceived {{an idea for a}} conservatory in Russia <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} parents, Mao {{lived at home}} with his {{paternal}} grandfather, Mao Enpu, until the latter's death when Mao was ten. Mao's paternal grandmother, Liu, had died in 1884, nine <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> birth. When Zedong was two years old, his mother gave birth to her fourth child, Mao Zemin, with a further son, Mao Zetan, being born when Zedong was eleven.

5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico {{since the death of}} Luis Mu√±oz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised {{by the size of the}} crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Complicating the picture, Reagan {{suffered}} {{an episode of}} head trauma in July 1989, five <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year. Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia. Reagan's one-time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is possible, but not certain, that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.|$|E
5|$|Despite his severe manner Stevenson was {{extremely}} sociable, {{and he was}} often the centre of a lively crowd at the bar of the Garrick Club, {{of which he was}} a member. His home on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area had been known by that name for many <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> arrival. Following his retirement Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was Granada Television's six-part series The Bounds of Freedom, broadcast in 1979.|$|E

5|$|His {{youngest}} sister Princess Amelia {{was conceived}} {{in the months}} after Alfred's death, born almost exactly a year after he died. The first of George III and Queen Charlotte's children to die, Alfred died nearly seventy five <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> older sister Mary, who was the last survivor of George III and Queen Charlotte's fifteen children. Alfred is also unique among their first fourteen children for never being an older sibling while he was alive, as the only child younger than him was born after his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, {{during the}} Haitian Revolution, Dermide {{arrived on the}} island-colony of Saint-Domingue with his parents, {{as part of the}} Saint-Domingue expedition. After his father's death of yellow fever later during the year, Dermide and Pauline were brought back to France. In 1803, Pauline remarried, this time to Italian nobleman Camillo Borghese, and she took up residence, along with her husband and son, in Rome. Always a frail child, Dermide died of a fever at the age of six, three months after his uncle became Emperor and two <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> mother's {{proclamation}} as Duchess of Guastalla.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{invasion}} threat from France had passed and a lasting peace {{was made in}} 1558; government concerns shifted away from the south coast towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England. By 1569, when Thomas Carew was serving as Hurst's captain, there were less than ten guns but the same size of garrison to that seven <b>years</b> <b>before.</b> <b>His</b> son, Sir Thomas Gorges, became captain in turn, and in 1593 he reported that the castle's gun platforms were in serious need of repair.|$|E

Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.|$|E
