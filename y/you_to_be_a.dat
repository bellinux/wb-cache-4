500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character you want, and then do the things you want. We would never have a [...] force <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> certain character or go down a certain path." ...|$|E

[...] Marbury warned that for every soul damned {{by the lack of}} adequate preaching, the guilt [...] "is on the bishops' hands." [...] To this Aylmer replied, [...] "Thou takest upon <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> preacher, but there is nothing in thee. [...] Thou art a very ass, an idiot, and a fool." ...|$|R

2500|$|Harris {{says the}} idea of free will [...] "cannot be mapped on to any {{conceivable}} reality" [...] and is incoherent. According to Harris, science [...] "reveals <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> biochemical puppet." [...] People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, [...] "emerge from background causes {{of which we are}} unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." [...] Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change {{the way we think about}} some of the most important questions in life.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2003, at the {{suggestion}} of Victor Gao, the Winklevosses and Narendra approached Mark Zuckerberg about joining the HarvardConnection team. The previous HarvardConnection programmers had reportedly made progress on coding front-end pages, the registration system, a database, back-end coding, and a way users could connect with each other, which Gao called a [...] "handshake". In early November, Narendra emailed Zuckerberg saying, “We’re very deep into developing a site which we would like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of and ... which we know will make some waves on campus.” Within days, Zuckerberg was talking to the HarvardConnection team and preparing to take over programming duties from Gao. On the evening of November 25, 2003, the Winklevosses and Narendra met with Zuckerberg in the dining hall of Harvard's Kirkland House, where they explained to Zuckerberg the HarvardConnection website, the plan to expand to other schools after launch, the confidential nature of the project, and the importance of getting there first. During the meeting, Zuckerberg allegedly entered into an oral contract with Narendra and the Winklevosses and became a partner in HarvardConnection. He was given the private server location and ...|$|E

500|$|Hillman {{also had}} a hand in writing the album's opening track, [...] "So <b>You</b> Want <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star". [...] With its satirical and sarcastic lyrics, the song <b>was</b> <b>an</b> acerbic, but good-natured swipe at the success of {{manufactured}} pop bands like The Monkees. [...] However, Tim Connors has stated that [...] "So <b>You</b> Want <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] also suggests certain ironies due to pre-fabricated aspects of the Byrds' own origin, including drummer Michael Clarke having been initially recruited for his good looks, rather than for his musical ability. [...] As a result of this, music journalist David Fricke has noted that some fans have mistaken [...] "So <b>You</b> Want <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] for an autobiographical song. [...] Hillman's driving bassline and McGuinn's chiming twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar riff form the core of the song, with the production being rounded off by the sound of screaming teenage fans, which had <b>been</b> recorded at <b>a</b> Byrds' concert in Bournemouth during the band's 1965 English tour. [...] South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela contributed the trumpet solo featured in the song, which represented the first use of brass on a Byrds' recording. [...] Masekela and the Byrds would later perform [...] "So <b>You</b> Want <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] together at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967.|$|R
