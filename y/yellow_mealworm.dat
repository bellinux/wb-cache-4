40|$|A {{protocol}} for extraction of <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae proteins was established, conditions were evaluated {{and the resulting}} protein extract was characterised. The freeze-dried <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae contained around 33 % fat, 51 % crude protein and 43 % true protein on a dry matter basis. The true protein content of the protein extract was about 75 %, with an extraction rate of 70 % under optimised extraction conditions using 0. 25 M NaOH, a NaOH solution: ethanol defatted worm ratio of 15 : 1 mL/g, 40 degrees C for 1 h and extraction twice. The protein extract was {{a good source of}} essential amino acids. The lowest protein solubility in distilled water solution was found between pH 4 and 5, and increased with either increasing or decreasing pH. Lower solubility was observed in 0. 5 M NaCl solution compared with distilled water.

40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{environmental}} impact of animal production systems is due to the production of feed. Insects are suggested to efficiently convert feed to body mass and might therefore form a more sustainable food and/or feed source. Four diets were composed from by-products of food manufacturing and formulated such as to vary in protein and fat content. These were offered to newly hatched Argentinean cockroaches, black soldier flies, <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms,</b> and house crickets. The first two species are potentially interesting as a feed ingredient, while the latter two are considered edible for humans. Feed conversion efficiency, survival, development time, as well as chemical composition (nitrogen, phosphorus, and fatty acids), were determined. The Argentinean cockroaches and the black soldier flies converted feed more efficiently than <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms,</b> and house crickets. The first two were also more efficient than conventional production animals. On three of the four diets <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms</b> and house crickets had a feed conversion efficiency similar to pigs. Furthermore, on the most suitable diet, they converted their feed as efficiently as poultry, when corrected for edible portion. All four species had a higher nitrogen-efficiency than conventional production animals, when corrected for edible portion. Offering carrots to <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms</b> increased dry matter- and nitrogen-efficiency and decreased development time. Diet affected survival in all species but black soldier flies, and development time was strongly influenced in all four species. The chemical composition of Argentinean cockroaches was highly variable between diets, for black soldier flies it remained similar. The investigated species can be considered efficient production animals when suitable diets are provided.

40|$|Scope. Due to the {{imminent}} {{growth of the}} world population, shortage of protein sources for human consumption will arise in the near future. Alternative and sustainable protein sources (e. g. insects) are being explored {{for the production of}} food and feed. In this project, the safety of Yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.) for human consumption was tested using approaches as advised by the European Food Safety Authority for allergenicity risk assessment. Methods and results. Different <b>Yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> protein fractions were prepared, characterised, and tested for cross-reactivity using sera from patients with an inhalation or food allergy to biologically related species (House dust mite (HDM) and crustaceans) by immunoblotting and basophil activation. Furthermore, the stability was investigated using an in vitro pepsin digestion test. IgE from HDM- and crustacean allergic patients cross-reacted with <b>Yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> proteins. This cross-reactivity was functional, as shown by the induction of basophil activation. The major cross-reactive proteins were identified as tropomyosin and arginine kinase, which are well known allergens in arthropods. These proteins were moderately stable in the pepsin stability test. Conclusion. Based on these cross-reactivity studies, there is a realistic possibility that HDM- and crustacean allergic patients may react to food containing <b>Yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> proteins...|$|E
40|$|Insects have {{potential}} as a novel source of protein in feed and food production in Europe, provided {{they can be used}} safely. To date, limited information is available on the safety of insects, and toxic elements are one of the potential hazards of concern. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential accumulation of cadmium, lead and arsenic in larvae of two insect species, Tenebrio molitor (<b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm)</b> and Hermetia illucens (black soldier fly), which seem to hold {{potential as a}} source of food or feed. An experiment was designed with 14 treatments, each in triplicate, per insect species. Twelve treatments used feed that was spiked with cadmium, lead or arsenic at 0. 5, 1 and 2 times the respective maximum allowable levels (ML) in complete feed, as established by the European Commission (EC). Two of the 14 treatments consisted of controls, using non-spiked feed. All insects per container (replicate) were harvested when the first larva in that container had completed its larval stage. Development time, survival rates and fresh weights were similar over all treatments, except for development time and total live weight of the half of the maximum limit treatment for cadmium of the black soldier fly. Bioaccumulation (bioaccumulation factor > 1) was seen in all treatments (including two controls) for lead and cadmium in black soldier fly larvae, and for the three arsenic treatments in the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae. In the three cadmium treatments, concentrations of cadmium in black soldier fly larvae are higher than the current EC maximum limit for feed materials. The same was seen for the 1. 0 and 2. 0 ML treatments of arsenic in the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae.

T. molitor larvae were grown on wheat flour naturally contaminated with mycotoxins among which deoxynivalenol (DON) was predominant (4. 9 mg/kg), wheat flour spiked with 8 mg/kg pure DON, and uncontaminated wheat flour. Larval survival and weight gain on the three diets were compared. Survival was high for larvae on all dietary treatments (> 98 %) and no difference in weight gain was observed when comparing larvae grown on uncontaminated control diet with larvae grown on contaminated diets (P= 0. 091). Presence of mycotoxins in larvae and larval faeces was analysed using LC-MS/MS. No DON or DON-derivatives were detected in T. molitor after harvest of the larvae, pointing to degradation by the larvae.

A well-known cyanobacterial secondary metabolite (microcystin-LR) which is the dominant cyanotoxin variant in South African surface waters was tested for its adverse effect on the macrophyte plant Spirodela punctata (duckweed) and the insects Periplaneta americana (American cockroach), Tenebrio molitar (<b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm),</b> Gryllus bimaculatus (common cricket) as well as the crustacean zooplankton (Artemia salina). In this study Gryllus bimaculatus and Artemia salina LD 50 body weight values were calculated as 0. 45 µg/animal and 0. 1 µg/animal, respectively, within the first 48 h after exposure to microcystin-LR. These values obtained indicate that sensitivities of G. bimaculatus and A. salina to low concentrations of microcystin-LR were comparable to the mouse bioassay. No mortalities of P. americana and T. molitar were observed after 48 h of exposure to different concentrations of synthetic microcystin-LR (0. 5, 1. 0, 5. 0 µg/L).

The {{configuration of the}} new C–C double bond is mainly (E) when the reaction is performed at – 78 °C and (Z) when it is carried out at higher temperatures (0 °C). A high level of transfer of the chirality in the new stereocentre, corresponding to a stereospecific anti attack onto the cyanophosphate, is observed. Enantiomerically enriched (E) -γ-alkylated α,β-unsaturated esters are prepared after subsequent methanolysis in a three-step sequence from the corresponding α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. In addition, the synthesis of (R) - 4 -methylnonan- 1 -ol, {{also known as the}} sex pheromone of the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> Tenebrio molitor L, and its (S) enantiomer have been carried out in a four-step route from (E) -oct- 2 -enal. This work has been supported by the DGES of the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (MEC) (CTQ 2004 - 00808 /BQU), the Generalitat Valenciana (CTIOIB/ 2002 / 320, GRUPOS 03 / 134 and GV 05 / 144) and the University of Alicante...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} interest in insect-based bioactive products, the biological activities {{of these products}} are rarely studied adequately. Larvae of Tenebrio molitor, the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm,</b> have been eaten as a traditional food and provide many health benefits. Therefore, we hypothesized that T. molitor larvae might influence adipogenesis and obesity-related disorders. In the present study, we investigated the anti-adipogenic and antiobesity effects of T. molitor larvae in vitro and in vivo. The lipid accumulation and triglyceride content in mature adipocytes was reduced significantly (up to 90 %) upon exposure to an ethanol extract of T. molitor larvae, without a reduction in cell viability. Exposure also resulted in key adipogenic and lipogenic transcription factors. Additionally, in adipogenic differentiation medium the extract induced phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) -activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Daily oral administration of T. molitor larvae powder to obese mice fed high-fat diet attenuated body weight gain. We {{also found that the}} powder efficiently reduced hepatic steatosis as well as aspartate and alanine transaminase enzyme levels in mice fed a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that T. molitor larvae extract has an antiobesity effect when administered as a food supplement and has potential as a therapeutic agent for obesity...|$|E
40|$|Two {{problems}} were studied: a) Whether a lower titre of the corpus allatum hormone {{had a different}} influence on the tissues of an adult insect with a diapause mechanism than on those of one without a diapause. b) Whether the metabolic effects of the corpus allatum hormone were caused mainly by its indirect influence upon an organ, e. g. the ovary, or by general influence on the metabolism as a whole. For the research two adult Coleoptera were used: the Colorado beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) with a diapause mechanism and the <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> beetle (Tenebrio molitor L.) without such a mechanism. By tracing the influences of allatectomy or of castration on the respiration {{it was concluded that}} in both species the hormone had a gonadotropic influence in females and in♂and♀Colorado beetles also a general influence on the metabolism (direct on the basal resting respiration of active insects and probably indirect on their respiration by forced action through the central nerve system). Further hypotheses were drafted about the location of the diapause mechanism (the flight muscles and the fat body?) and the function of the corpus allatum in the fat metabolism (probably mainly to speed the making of fatty acids unsaturated) ...|$|E
40|$|The highly {{purified}} alpha-amylase from Tenebrio molitor L. larva (<b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm)</b> reversibly combines {{with two}} closely related homogeneous glycoprotein inhibitors, one dimeric (termed 'inhibitor 0. 19 ') and one monomeric (termed 'inhibitor 0. 28 '), from wheat flour. As established {{by means of}} difference spectroscopy and kinetic studies, molar combining ratios for the amylase [...] inhibitor- 0. 19 and amylase-inhibitor- 0. 28 complexes were 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 respectively. Two amylase [...] inhibitor- 0. 19 complexes with slightly different retention volumes on Bio-Gel P- 300 and only one amylase [...] inhibitor- 0. 28 complex were observed. Dissociation constants of the amylase [...] inhibitor- 0. 19 and amylase [...] inhibitor- 0. 28 complexes were 0. 85 nM and 0. 13 nM respectively. A strong tendency of both complexes to precipitate under an ultracentrifugal field was observed; the minimum molecular weight calculated for the two complexes under such conditions was approx. 95 000. The two complexes showed difference spectra indicating involvement of structurally related or identical tryptophyl side chains in the binding of inhibitors 0. 28 and 0. 19 to the amylase. A model summarizing the main features of the inhibition of the insect amylase by the two wheat protein inhibitors is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Crops {{contaminated}} with fungal mycotoxins such as aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) are often downgraded or {{removed from the}} food chain. This study aimed to evaluate the tolerance and accumulation of AFB 1 in two insect species {{to determine whether they}} could be used to retain condemned mycotoxin contaminated crops in the food chain. First, instar black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens, BSF) and <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> (Tenebrio molitor, YMW) were fed poultry feed spiked with AFB 1 and formulated to contain levels of 0. 01, 0. 025, 0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 25, and up to 0. 5 mg/kg dry feed. Poultry feed without any additions and feed with only the solvent added served as controls. The AFB 1 in the feed did not affect survival and body weight in the BSF and YMW larvae (p > 0. 10), indicating a high tolerance to aflatoxin B 1 in both species. Furthermore, AFB 1 and aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) were below the detection limit (0. 10 µg/kg) in BSF larvae, whereas the YMW had AFB 1 levels that were approximately 10 % of the European Union’s legal limit for feed materials and excreted AFM 1. It is concluded that both BSF larvae and YMW have a high AFB 1 tolerance and do not accumulate AFB 1...|$|E
40|$|Extruded cereals made {{of wheat}} flour and grinded <b>Yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae (Tenebrio molitor) were {{produced}} {{to investigate the}} effect of insect inclusion (0 %, 10 %, 20 %) and processing conditions (barrel temperature and screw speed) on their nutritional content, microstructure, texture and digestibility. Snacks enriched with 10 % mealworm powder shifted their macronutrient composition towards a protein content high enough to claim the food as “source of protein” according to European food regulation. At 10 % of enrichment, the adoption of high barrel temperature and screw speed significantly improved the microstructure, in terms of expansion and pore structure, delivering acceptable textural qualities. At 20 % substitution, snacks showed poor expansion properties, mainly due {{to the presence of}} fat in the larvae. Starch and protein digestibility of were correlated with microstructure properties as a function of porosity, pore size and wall thickness. Interestingly, mechanical forces generated in extrusion likely improved the digestibility of T. molitor proteins which are tightly bound and sclerotized to the exoskeleton. Tailoring processing conditions and formulation insect ingredients can be successfully incorporated into extruded cereal snacks. Industrial relevance This study evaluated the nutritional and technological properties of extruded cereal snacks enriched with an edible insect powder (T. molitor). Results suggested that edible insects can be used as novel ingredient in extruded snacks and pointed out how processing conditions can modulate snack digestibility. </p...|$|E
40|$|Growth {{in world}} {{population}} will inevitably leads to {{increased demand for}} protein for humans and animals. Protein from insects and blood plasma are being considered as possible alternatives, but more research on their nutritional quality and health effects is needed. Here, we studied the effect of dietary protein source on metabolism and metabolic amine profiles in serum and urine of mice. Groups of mice were fed semi-purified diets containing 300 [*]g/kg of soybean meal, casein, partially delactosed whey powder, spray-dried plasma protein, wheat gluten meal, and <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm.</b> Feed and water intake as well as body weight gain were measured for 28 [*]days. After 14 and 28 [*]days, serum and urine samples were collected for measurement of a large panel of amine metabolites. MetaboAnalyst 3. 0 was used for analysis of the raw metabolic data. Out of 68 targeted amine metabolites, we could detect 54 in urine and 41 in blood serum. Dietary protein sources {{were found to have}} profound effects on host metabolism, particularly in systemic amine profiles, considered here as an endophenotype. We recommend serum over urine to screen for the amine metabolic endophenotype based on partial least squares discriminant analysis. We concluded that metabolites like alpha-aminobutyric acid and 1 -methylhistidine are sensitive indicators of {{too much or too little}} availability of specific amino acids in the different protein diets. Furthermore, we concluded that amine metabolic profiles can be useful for assessing the nutritional quality of different protein sources...|$|E
