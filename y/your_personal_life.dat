And if you’ve undergone chemotherapy and come out the other side, it’s very real to you.

Our {{goal is to}} make it easier and more efficient for caregivers to assess and diagnose their patients, and we do that by applying innovative technologies that help frontline practitioners work more effectively, efficiently, and empathetically with their patients at the point of care. And to stay competitive, the company I work for is continuously changing. Demands from consumers forcing costs down and pressures from the workforce to diversify policies, our success are fully dependent on customer and employee satisfaction and our ability to implement change. Work life balance initiatives are needed to help adjust our culture to working towards a cohesive future for all concerned.

40|$|Negotiation is a {{valuable}} skill {{in every part of}} your life. When carried out effectively negotiation can produce an outcome that is mutually beneficial for both parties. Negotiation is most enjoyable when both parties think they have gained something and when both parties have developed a positive working relationship. Since many of your negotiations at work and at home involve people you will be in close contact with for a long time, the long-term benefits of building a mutually respectful relationship are as important as the short-term gains that might result from any given negotiation. Successful and skillful negotiation requires empathy, good listening skills, and compromise. Although you will not always get what you want just by asking, {{it is highly unlikely that}} you will get what you want if you do not ask at all.
