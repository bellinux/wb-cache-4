40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Difficulties {{have been}} {{encountered}} in gluing some Southeast Asian woods using phenolic resin. Extractives in veneers from the trade groups yellow, white, and red meranti (Shorea, Parashorea, and Pentacme spp.), keruing (Dipterocarpus spp.), and kapur (Dryobalanops spp.) were suspected {{to be able}} to modify resin cure and to cause inferior gluelines. The average extractive content for veneers of each trade group was determined by sequential extraction with benzene, ether, ethanol, and water. <b>Yellow</b> <b>meranti</b> had the greatest quantity of extractives (15. 6...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} Shorea mujongensis P. S. Ashton was {{investigated}} {{in order to ensure}} this species belongs to <b>yellow</b> <b>meranti</b> group. Such study is very important since this species is already listed in the red list of IUCN and classified as critically endangered species. The microscopic slides were prepared according to the Johansen 2 ̆ 7 s method, while the anatomical features observed according to the IAWA List. The results show that S. mujongensis wood exhibit brown heartwood, light brown sapwood, rough texture, straight grain sometimes interlocked and somewhat rough. The main microscopic characters are growth rings indistinct; vessel diffuse, mostly solitary, rounded to oval; simple perforation plate and alternate intervessel pits; parenchyma scanty paratracheal to thin vasicentric; axial intercellular canals in long tangential line, radial intercellular canal and vasicentric tracheids present; rays uniseriate and multiseriate, prismatic crystal in procumbent cells; fiber length 1, 294 µm, diameter 26 µm and wall thickness 4 µm. Macroscopic and microscopic observation of S. mujongensis wood confirms the species belongs to <b>yellow</b> <b>meranti</b> group. The assesment on fiber dimensions and derived values of the wood fibers classified the wood into class quality II. It indicates that this species is moderately favorable as raw material for pulp and paper manufacture...|$|E
40|$|Meranti (Shorea spp.) is an {{important}} commodity {{which is one of}} the major timber producing commercial plants in Indonesia. In worldwide trading, meranti group is divided into four major groups, namely: group of red meranti, <b>yellow</b> <b>meranti</b> group, white meranti group and group of turvy meranti. Purpose of the implementation of this study was to determine the availability, amount, and regeneration dominance of meranti (Shorea spp.) as well as a tree diagram in the profile Riau University Arboretum area. Techniques of data collection is done by using the method purposive sampling or transect lines. Entire observation contains regeneration sample plots, namely regeneration meranti much as 9 rods (2. 76 %) while the 317 rods (97. 24 %) are type of non meranti. Meranti Shorea parvistipulata Heim and Shorea parvifolia were found. INP at a rate of 0 % seedling, sapling rate of 2. 28 %, 15. 20 % for poles and tree level of 57. 03 %...|$|E
40|$|Timber-concrete {{composites}} {{are becoming}} increasingly used in both rehabilitation of ancient wooden floor and new structures. Up till now, metal fasteners and indentation {{have been used as}} the connecting systems between the two materials. In order to investigate the bonding performance system by using an adhesive, a laboratory test is undertaken. In this study, timber-concrete composite beams which are use <b>Yellow</b> <b>Meranti</b> and Sikadur- 30 as bonding agent between timber and concrete materials. A total of four beams over 1. 0 m with 150 x 220 mm in width and height respectively were used. The objectives of this research are to determine the existence of the slip interface of glued timber-concrete composite beam under applied load, to investigate the relationship between moisture content and strength of the timber-concrete composite beam and to examine the mode of failures in composite beam. The test result shows the higher moisture content will give maximum slippage and moisture content at 50 % can be considered as optimum moisture content since it give the highest ultimate loa...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{hard wood}} species written at TABLE 1, mainly from East-South Asia, were {{examined}} with light microscope, {{scanning electron microscope}} and by the ashing method. Woods were maintained at the Laboratory of Wood Science, Kyushu University and used as experimental materials. Results were revealed the fundamental information of wood identification listed up in TABLE 2 and others as follows: 1) Cell inclusives founded by light microscope and electron microscope were different but these were attributable to treatment methods. 2) Ashing method was useful to examine the presence of crystal in cell and to test the chemical reaction which indicates silica or calcium salt. 3) Generally wood contained different shapes of crystal in ray parenchyma and axial parenchyma. Sometimes same tissue contained a few kinds of crystal shape. 4) The crystal presenting in parenchyma was an important key for identification of experimental woods. 5) The species belonging to the DIPTEROCARPACEAE possessed the vertical intercellular canal but in other species, they were absent. 6) Jongkong and Rengas possessed the radial intercellular canal. Rose wood and Jelutong possessed the laticifer. Crystalliferous cell did not present in Jongkong and Jelutong. 7) In Ramin, Durian, Rose Wood, <b>Yellow</b> <b>Meranti</b> and Kapur, crystalliferous cell presented in both tissues of axial parenchyma and ray parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|LVL (Laminated-Veneer Lumber) {{has many}} {{advantages}} and economic values, {{which is important}} for wooden boat construction. The recovery of veneer, the main material of LVL, are higher than sawn-timber and their drying process are faster. LVL produced with a continuous press has been approved as an engineered material with reliable strength and stiffness. In a wooden boat processing, the easy forming into a curve shape and strength are main factor, because of the streamline shape of boats. LVL material is able to meet those requirements. As an endless-length LVL is made from a log limited-length hence LVL always contain joints. Butt joint have numerous drawbacks, but they are inherently simple and less time to manufacture than other joints types. The purposes of this experiment are to investigate the basic characteristics of LVL which are important for deck and hull planking in the wooden boat constructions. <b>Yellow</b> <b>meranti</b> and red meranti were peeled by a veneer lathe and phenol formaldehyde adhesive were used. Result of experiment indicated that at the position 0 o (β), the flexibility and strength of LVL up to proportional limit increased with increasing number of layer and spacing of butt-joint (d/t). LVL at the position 45 o and 90 o (β), all types of LVL had lower flexibility and strength than the standard value for deck and hull planking. In bending experiment test speciment at position 45 ° with direction of grain, maximum width of LVL equal to the spacing of frame and at position 90 ° equal to the width of hull planking in wooden boat. Based on the interpretations of the above results, {{it can be concluded}} that (1). LVL of 9, 6 and 4 plies with upside (inside) veneer butt-joint is appropriate for deck and hull planking in wooden boat manufacturing, (2). LVL of 9, 6 and 4 plies with spacing of butt-joint (d/t) more than 20 is appropriate for deck and hull planking in manufacturing wooden boat...|$|E
