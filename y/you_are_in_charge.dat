When it is fixed to a vehicle it is often called [...] "the national standard." [...] A flag is considered [...] "cased" [...] when it is furled and placed in a protective covering. If your duties allow, you should take part in morning or evening colors ceremonies, but do not sacrifice your vigilance by doing so. For example, if your assignment requires that you watch a certain area and the national ensign is being hoisted in a different direction, you should stand at attention and salute but do not face the colors; keep looking in the direction you are supposed to be watching.|$|E
50|$|One's {{assessment}} of a given situation can be dimininished by exhibition of cognitively emotional decisions. Say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the investigation into Pizzagate. Everyone knows that pedophiles exist, {{and there is a}} lot of reputable, easily sourced evidence to suggest that a pedophilia ring/child trafficking is currently operating in our society. Therefore the implementation of logic can easily bring you to a conclusion that further investigation is likely required. However, when the narrative is also conflated with propaganda and disinformation (IE: allegations of child sacrifice, satanic rituals and spirit cookings, etc), one is left in a state of disbelief at the seemingly outrageous, far-fetched scenario being put forward. This then serves only to invoke cognitive dissonance in those trying to form an accurate opinion on the said child abuse by detracting from the credibility of the allegations and making the probability of such a scenario portray itself as far less likely, on the basis that Satan isn't something we contend with in the course of a functioning reality. Logic is superior, an emotionally-based decision at this point becomes the delivery method of propaganda and misinformation. This is basic social engineering, and is specifically designed to help ensure the protection of perpetrators of child sexual abuse. Apply Trevor's Axiom to the information you have for further clarification.|$|E

40|$|The {{two most}} common {{offences}} prosecuted {{in the courts}} in Ireland to do with drink and driving are sections 49 and 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.
