Migré often criticized the {{new ways of}} writing TV fiction, especially the over-long series of episodes driven by good ratings and other economical factors alone: [...] "In the 60s, telenovelas lasted 22 half-hour episodes; it was <b>a</b> delight, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan,</b> developed the story with a rhythm and precise guidelines and then you went on to think of another story." [...] He was also a vindicator {{of the role of}} the creative screenwriter: [...] "Current TV is not for me, since it is not what I was taught: I learned that the author was the foundation upon which the whole project was built.

During the off-season, the New York Rangers of the NHL invited Daavettila to participate in a development camp for their recent draftees and other prospects.

One of the themes of the episode 76 was a pious Muslim singer that came to Faruk's studio to record a few religious songs (with Faruk and other characters pretending to share the singer's religious zeal to get his business) and him almost eating english ham which was made in 1931 and which was passed as turkey. In episode 77 Izet and Đuro {{were trying to get}} a cow, but they got a pig, which died in a trunk of Izet's car.

Afterwards, Meretskov was promoted to rank of army general and made Deputy Commissar of Defense. From August 1940 to January 1941 he was Chief of the General Staff.

Shortly before the race {{it was announced that}} an interest in the horse had been bought by Lane's End and that Liam's Map would be retired to the Versailles, Kentucky-based stud for the 2016 season. In the Dirt Mile, Liam's Map started 1/2 favourite against ten opponents headed by Lea, with the others including Red Vine, Wicked Strong, Bradester (Monmouth Cup), Tapiture (runner-up in the race in 2014), War Envoy (Britannia Stakes), Mr Z (Ohio Derby) and Valid. Castellano tracked the leaders as Bradester set the pace before switching out to make his challenge in the straight. Liam's Map overtook Lea inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a half lengths. Lea took second, three and a quarter lengths ahead of Red Vine who was in turn three and a quarter lengths clear of Wicked Strong in fourth. Castellano explained that he had intended to lead from the start and had to change his tactics when the colt did not break as quickly as expected. He commented [...] "In this game <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Plan</b> B. I think the key was patience. He waited behind horses and it was phenomenal. He showed great skill.

[...] Brodie was also responsible, along with Michael Howard and Peter Paret, for making the writings of Carl von Clausewitz more accessible to the English-speaking world.
