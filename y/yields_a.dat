5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state <b>yields</b> <b>a</b> solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E
5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily <b>yields</b> <b>a</b> colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|Since their inception, U2 have {{developed}} and maintained a distinctly recognisable sound, {{with emphasis on}} melodic instrumentals and expressive, larger-than-life vocals. This approach is rooted partly in the early influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite {{at a time when}} the band was not known for musical proficiency. The Edge has consistently used a rhythmic echo and a signature delay to craft his distinctive guitar work, coupled with an Irish-influenced drone played against his syncopated melodies that ultimately <b>yields</b> <b>a</b> well-defined ambient, chiming sound. Bono has nurtured his falsetto operatic voice and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social, political, and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting. In addition, the Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band.|$|E

Lijphart suggested calculating the informal threshold as the mean of these.|$|R
5|$|Sintering powders of {{samarium}} oxide and boron, in vacuum, <b>yields</b> <b>a</b> powder containing several samarium boride phases, {{and their}} volume ratio {{can be controlled}} through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580°C), SmB4 (about 2300°C) and SmB66 (2150°C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB6.|$|E

It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that age range. The DAS-II <b>yields</b> <b>a</b> General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like an IQ score with the median standard score set at 100 and 15 standard score points for each standard deviation up or down from the median.

5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale <b>yields</b> <b>a</b> product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} nuclear reactions which generate nucleogenic neon isotopes {{start from}} 24Mg and 25Mg, which produce 21Ne and 22Ne, respectively, after neutron capture and immediate emission of an alpha particle. The neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary spallation reactions from alpha particles, in turn derived from uranium-series decay chains. The net result <b>yields</b> <b>a</b> trend towards lower 20Ne/22Ne and higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites. 21Ne {{may also be}} produced in a nucleogenic reaction, when 20Ne absorbs a neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test <b>yields</b> <b>a</b> p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E
