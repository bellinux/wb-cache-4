25|$|The chroniclers of the First Crusade {{documented}} the chance interception {{of a message}} warning the duke of Caesarea of {{the coming of the}} Crusader armies when a carrier pigeon was felled by a hawk over a Crusader military encampment in May 1099. The message, written in Arabic, read as follows:Greetings from the king of Acre to the duke of Caesarea. A generation of dogs, a foolish, headstrong, disorderly race, has gone through my land. If <b>you</b> <b>value</b> your way of life, you and others of the faith should bring harm to them, since you can easily do what you wish. Transmit this message to other cities and strongholds. Carrier pigeons were regularly used in this period. For example, Edward Gibbon notes that during the siege of Acre (1189–1191) by the Crusaders, the inhabitants of the besieged city kept a regular correspondence with the Sultan's forces by way of carrier pigeon.|$|E
500|$|Æthelstan was a noted {{collector}} of relics, {{and while this}} was a common practice at the time, he was marked out by the scale of his collection and the refinement of its contents. The abbot of Saint Samson in Dol sent him some as a gift, and in his covering letter he wrote: [...] "we know <b>you</b> <b>value</b> relics more than earthly treasure". Æthelstan was also a generous donor of manuscripts and relics to churches and monasteries. Indeed, his reputation {{was so great that}} some monastic scribes later falsely claimed that their institutions had been beneficiaries of his largesse. He was especially devoted to the cult of St. Cuthbert in Chester-le-Street, and his gifts to the community there included Bede's Lives of Cuthbert. He commissioned it especially to present to Chester-le Street, and out of all manuscripts he gave to a religious foundation which survive, it is the only one which was wholly written in England during his reign. This has a portrait of Æthelstan presenting the book to Cuthbert, the earliest surviving manuscript portrait of an English king. In the view of Janet Nelson, his [...] "rituals of largesse and devotion at sites of supernatural power... enhanced royal authority and underpinned a newly united imperial realm".|$|E

2500|$|The {{two largest}} protest actions in December 2011 {{took place on}} Bolotnaya Square (10 December) and Academician Sakharov Avenue (24 December), and another major protest action is planned on Bolotnaya on 4 February 2012. This {{resulted}} in the campaigners being dubbed the [...] "Bolotnaya-Sakharov opposition", or {{taking into account the}} root meanings, the [...] "swampy-sugar opposition." [...] Former Speaker of Russia's State Duma and a leader of the United Russia party Boris Gryzlov advised Russians to [...] "keep away of all those swamps", alluding to the phrase from the Russian film adaptation of Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles ("As <b>you</b> <b>value</b> your life or your reason keep away from the moor" [...] in the original book).|$|E
2500|$|While some of Taylor's fellow racers {{refused to}} compete with him, others resorted to intimidation, verbal insults, and threats to {{physically}} harm him. While racing in Savannah, Georgia in the Winter of 1898, he received a written threat saying [...] "Clear out if <b>you</b> <b>value</b> your life"; the previous day Taylor had challenged three riders together to a race after {{one of them had}} said they [...] "didn't pace niggers." [...] Taylor recalled that ice water had been thrown at him during races and nails were scattered in front of his wheels. Taylor further stated in his autobiography that he had been elbowed and [...] "pocketed" [...] (boxed in) by other riders to prevent him from sprinting {{to the front of the}} pack, a tactic at which he was so successful.|$|E

30|$|Experienced {{lifetime}} {{stress was}} assessed with the {{valid and reliable}} Life Event Inventory (Tennant and Andrews 1976). This scale is comprised of two subscales, Lifestyle Change (the magnitude of stressor-related change in the participant’s life) and Distress (the distressing quality of stressors). Participants endorsed any of the 66 stressors they had experienced (e.g., “Something <b>you</b> <b>valued</b> or cared for greatly was stolen or lost”). Each item had two weightings, one for each subscale. Weightings were summed where greater weightings represented greater distress or change. The current study demonstrated acceptable reliability for each subscale (α’s = . 77).|$|R

50|$|Many {{think that}} this poem stands for one's {{reflection}} on their past life. The poem questions whether <b>you</b> <b>valued</b> your life over death or, worse, never having been born. Did you in fact see life {{for all of its}} beauty or do you view your life as a waste? The poem asks you to analyze your life, to question whether every decision you made was for the greater good, and to learn and accept the decisions you have made in your life. One Answer to the Question would be simply to value the fact that you had the opportunity to live.|$|R
