500|$|She was a {{prolific}} painter who generated over 1,500 canvasses in three decades. [...] Moses initially charged $3 to $5 for a painting, depending upon its size, and as her fame increased her works were sold for $8,000 to $10,000. Her winter paintings {{are reminiscent of}} some of the known winter paintings of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, although she had never seen his work. A German fan of her work said, [...] "There emanates from her paintings a light-hearted optimism; the world she shows us is beautiful and it is good. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home in all these pictures, and you know their meaning. The unrest and the neurotic insecurity of the present day make us inclined to enjoy the simple and affirmative outlook of Grandma Moses." ...|$|E
500|$|God Hates Us All {{was to be}} {{recorded}} in a Hollywood studio; however, the band relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia due to the availability of cheaper studio time. Hyde recommended a studio to the band—The Warehouse Studio (owned by Bryan Adams) as he had previously worked there. The studio was altered to make it [...] "feel like home" [...] for Slayer; {{as opposed to the}} setting for, in King's words, the [...] "lightweight Canadian pop singer". This consisted of adding incense burners, candles, dimmed lights and pornography on the walls. Two banner flags of two middle fingers were also hung up. Vocalist Tom Araya says [...] "that was basically the attitude of Slayer in the studio. We had a red devil head on one of the speakers. We had a skull on another. That's the kind of shit we put up. Spooky stuff that makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home." ...|$|E

Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's [...] "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to {{number one in}} the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, [...] "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home, in his home... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it {{at the end of the}} hall for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding." [...] Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart – [...] "Devil's Radio", [...] "This Is Love" [...] and [...] "Cloud 9".|$|E

However, he praised the graphics, character animations, level design and the tactical aspects of combat, concluding [...] "The Settlers 3 is the best game in the Settlers series, and the new benchmark in the city-building genre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics also {{reviewed}} the single's two other tracks. CDJournal described [...] "Spoon to Ase" [...] as folk and electro blended together, {{and called the}} song's [...] "wonderful sound fantasy-like", feeling that the quiet acoustic guitar backing [...] "drifted in sorrow". They felt that even though Yamaguchi's [...] "low energy" [...] vocals gave [...] "the impression of ennui", the lyrics [...] "hid a quiet strength" [...] that added to the song. Kenji Sasaki of Skream! found the song's acoustic sound and mysterious backing track blended together well to create a song with a [...] "curious" [...] feeling. For the Rei Harakami remix of [...] "Native Dancer", CDJournal felt that this version had a [...] "floating, light sound that makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> ease", {{and that there was}} something nostalgic about the remix that matched the song's lyrics on transience well, while Sasaki described the remix as [...] "beauty and strangeness twist and fight each other, while being wrapped up in Yamaguchi's lyrics." ...|$|E
