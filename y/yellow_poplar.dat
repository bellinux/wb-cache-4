25|$|The Allegheny and Cumberland Plateaus of West Virginia are {{predominantly}} covered by hardwood forests, but along the Ohio River and its principal tributaries, the valuable timber {{has been removed}} and considerable areas have been wholly cleared over the centuries for farming and pasture lands. Among the most prevalent trees of this region are the chestnut oaks, the walnut, the <b>yellow</b> <b>poplar,</b> and the cherry. Southern West Virginia contains the largest reserve supply of timber. In the Ridge-and-Valley region of the Appalachian Mountains, the Eastern Panhandle and Potomac Highlands have a forest covering {{similar to that of}} the plateau region, however between these two areas of hardwood there is a long belt where spruce and white pine cover the mountain ridges. Other trees common in the state are the persimmon, sassafras, and, in the Ohio and Potomac Valley regions, the American sycamore. Hickory, chestnut, locust, maple, beech, dogwood, and pawpaw are widely distributed throughout the state as well. Among the state's common shrubs and vines are the blackberry, black and red raspberry, gooseberry, huckleberry, hazel, and wild grape. Ginseng is an important medicinal plant that is harvested primarily in West Virginia's southern regions. Wild ginger, elder, and sumach are common, and deep in the mountainous areas, rhododendrons, mountain laurel, and azaleas grow in abundance.|$|E
500|$|The virgin {{forests of}} what became Quehanna Wild Area were {{different}} in composition and quality {{than those of}} today. Eastern white pine and eastern hemlock were more common, often found on shady slopes and damp areas on plateaus. Chestnut oak and pitch pine favored slopes that were sandy or rocky, and the forest had a mixture of hardwoods, including ash, beech, birch, chestnut, maple, and <b>yellow</b> <b>poplar.</b> Each [...] of these virgin forests could produce up to [...] of white pine and [...] of hemlock and hardwoods. For comparison, the same area of forest today produces a total of [...] on average. The virgin forests cooled the land and streams.

60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I {{have been}} three days {{at a place called}} Grez, a pretty and very melancholy village on the plain. A low bridge of many arches choked with sedge; great fields of white and <b>yellow</b> water-lilies; <b>poplars</b> and willows innumerable; and about it all such an {{atmosphere}} of sadness and slackness, one could do nothing but get into the boat and out of it again, and yawn for bedtime.|$|R
500|$|Plant life {{along the}} trail is varied. The trail passes through several {{different}} biomes from south to north, and the climate changes significantly, particularly dependent upon elevation. In the south, lowland forests consist mainly of second-growth; nearly the entire trail has been logged {{at one time or}} another. There are, however, a few old growth locations {{along the trail}}, such as Sages Ravine straddling the Massachusetts-Connecticut border and atop higher peaks along the trail {{on either side of the}} same border, the Hopper (a glacial cirque westward of the trail as it traverses Mt. Greylock in Massachusetts), and [...] "The Hermitage", near Gulf Hagas in Maine. In the south, the forest is dominated by hardwoods, including oak and tulip trees, also known as <b>yellow</b> <b>poplar.</b> Farther north, tulip trees are gradually replaced by maples and birches. Oaks begin to disappear in Massachusetts. By Vermont, the lowland forest is made up of maples, birch and beech, which provide spectacular foliage displays for hikers in September and October. While the vast majority of lowland forest south of the White Mountains is hardwood, many areas have some coniferous trees as well, and in Maine, these often grow at low elevations.|$|E

60|$|He {{looked at}} her, with a faint, unhappy, bitter smile, {{but he said}} nothing. He seemed far off from her. A wild {{unhappiness}} beat inside her breast. She went down the corridor, away from him, to avoid this new agony, which after all was not her agony. She listened to the chatter of French and Italian in the corridor. She felt the excitement and terror of France, inside the railway carriage: and outside she saw white oxen slowly ploughing, beneath the lingering <b>yellow</b> <b>poplars</b> of the sub-Alps, she saw peasants looking up, she saw a woman holding a baby to her breast, watching the train, she saw the excited, yeasty crowds at the station. And they passed a river, and a great lake. And it all seemed bigger, nobler than England. She felt vaster influences spreading around, the Past was greater, more magnificent in these regions.

60|$|At {{the hotel}} on the terrace under our balcony we found on our return a party of Spanish ladies and gentlemen taking tea, or {{whatever}} drink stood for it in their custom: no doubt chocolate; but {{it was at least}} the afternoon-tea hour. The women's clothes were just from Paris, and the men's from London, but their customs, I suppose, were national; the women sat {{on one side of the}} table and talked across it to the men, while they ate and drank, and then each sex grouped itself apart and talked to its kind, the women in those hardened vowels of a dialect from which the Andalusians for conversational purposes have eliminated all consonants. The sun was setting red and rayless, with a play of many lights and tints, over the landscape up to the snow-line on the Sierra. The town lay a stretch of gray roofs and white walls, intermixed with <b>yellow</b> <b>poplars</b> and black cypresses, and misted over with smoke from the chimneys of the sugar factories. The mountains stood flat against the sky, purple with wide stretches of brown, and dark, slanting furrows. The light became lemon-yellow before nightfall, and then a dull crimson under pale violet.|$|R

6000|$|Sept. 1.--I {{should not}} take either the biggest or the most picturesque tree to {{illustrate}} it. Here {{is one of my}} favorites now before me, a fine <b>yellow</b> <b>poplar,</b> quite straight, perhaps 90 feet high, and four thick at the butt. How strong, vital, enduring! how dumbly eloquent! What suggestions of imperturbability and being, as against the human trait of mere seeming. Then the qualities, almost emotional, palpably artistic, heroic, of a tree; so innocent and harmless, yet so savage. It is, yet says nothing. How it rebukes by its tough and equable serenity all weathers, this gusty-temper'd little whiffet, man, that runs indoors at a mite of rain or snow. Science (or rather half-way science) scoffs at reminiscence of dryad and hamadryad, and of trees speaking. But, if they don't, they do as well as most speaking, writing, poetry, sermons--or rather they do a great deal better. I should say indeed that those old dryad-reminiscences are quite as true as any, and profounder than most reminiscences we get. ("Cut this out," [...] as the quack mediciners say, and keep by you.) Go and sit in a grove or woods, with one or more of those voiceless companions, and read the foregoing, and think.|$|E

60|$|The {{rain that}} pelted sharply into the puddle before the station at Granada was {{snow on the}} Sierra, and the snow that fell farther and farther down the mountainsides {{resolved}} itself over the Vega into a fog as white and almost as cold. Half-way across the storied and fabled plain the rain stopped and the fog lifted, and then we saw by day, as we had already seen by night, how the Vega was plentifully dotted with white cottages amid breadths of wheat-land where the peasants were plowing. Here and there were fields of Indian corn, and in a certain place {{there was a small}} vineyard; in one of the middle distances there spread a forest of Lombardy <b>poplars,</b> <b>yellow</b> as gold, and there was abundance of this autumn coloring in the landscape, which grew lonelier as we began to mount from the level. Olives, of course, abounded, and there were oak woods and clumps of wild cherry trees. The towns were far from the stations, which we reached at the rate of perhaps two miles an hour as we approached the top of the hills; and we might have got out and walked without fear of being left behind by our train, which made long stops, as if to get its breath for another climb. Before this the sole companion of our journey, whom we decided to be a landed proprietor coming out in his riding-gear to inspect his possessions, had left us, but at the first station after our descent began other passengers got in, with a captain of Civil Guards among them, very loquacious and very courteous, and much deferred to by the rest of us. At Bobadilla, where again we had tea with hot goat's milk in it, we changed cars, and from that on we had the company of a Rock-Scorpion pair whose name was beautifully Italian and whose speech was beautifully English, as the speech of those born at Gibraltar should rightfully be.|$|R
