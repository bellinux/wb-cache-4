25|$|Hipparchus {{also studied}} {{precession}} in On the Length of the Year. Two kinds of year {{are relevant to}} understanding his work. The tropical <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> length of time that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes {{to return to the}} same position along the ecliptic (its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The sidereal <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was 365+1/4−1/300 days, or 365.24667 days (Evans 1998, p.209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was 365+1/4+1/144 days (Toomer 1978, p.218). By giving a minimum rate he may have been allowing for errors in observation.|$|E
