500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{the lyrics of}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] make it a simple love song, with Madonna exhorting the women in her {{audience}} not to go for second-best, to express their feelings and get their men to express theirs. Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, described them as a [...] "feminist call-to-arms", with Madonna dismissing the satin sheets and gold baubles of material pleasures. As she said in the interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "the lyrics are my way of saying if it doesn't work, then you're better off on your own. Quite possibly there were some personal feelings mixed in the lyrics as well." [...] Subtexts are employed throughout the song, especially in the line [...] "What {{you need is a}} big strong hand, to lift <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> higher ground", where the [...] "big strong hand" [...] is implied as one's own hand, and not the typical male helping hand.|$|E

[...] Ebert and his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] rating on their syndicated television program, Siskel and Ebert and the Movies. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised the film's director, writing that [...] "Glimcher shows an epicure's taste in his choice of both cast and crew. The look of [...] "The Mambo Kings" [...] is doubtless richer than the text, which is, however, strengthened by Glimcher's nostalgia for the teenage, eager America of the 1950s." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The Mambo Kings is most fun when it practically dares you to swoon. It's a movie you don't have to believe to enjoy." [...] Betty Goodwin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's visual style: [...] "The innocence of the pre-MTV '50s mambo scene is expressed through meticulously real details and honest styling." ...|$|E

500|$|On January 10, 1956, Presley {{made his}} first {{recordings}} for RCA in Nashville. Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Chet Atkins, and three background singers, including first tenor Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, {{to fill out the}} sound. The session produced the moody, unusual [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", released as a single on January 27. Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance, on January 28, introduced by disc jockey Bill Randle, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem [...] "Blue Suede Shoes". In February, Presley's [...] "I Forgot to Remember to Forget", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, {{reached the top of the}} Billboard country chart. Neal's contract was terminated and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager. Gladys Presley was worried about how the fans were reacting to Presley and had hardly been to any of her son's performances because she was worried he was going to get hurt, she remarked to him repeatedly: [...] "Elvis, the Colonel is going to work <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> death. It ain't right." ...|$|E
500|$|She also {{performed}} a disco-styled {{version of the}} song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The stage was decked in Mylar curtains and glittering disco balls. The performance began with a distorted voice claiming [...] "I'm gonna {{take you to a}} place you've never been before". Afterwards, Madonna descended from the ceiling on a giant disco ball, wearing a blond afro wig, 1970's style halters and royal blue bell-bottom pants. Then her two back-up dancers appeared on the stage and the three women started singing the song together. The end of the performance was connected to the next song, [...] "Deeper and Deeper". According to Guilbert, Madonna was inspired by actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1932 film Blonde Venus for the performance. It was included on The Girlie Show – Live Down Under home video release, recorded on November 19, 1993, at Sydney, Australia. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was included in the military segment of the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, with the opening line altered to [...] "Come on boys!". She and her dancers were dressed in military gear and performed a rifle choreography, with Madonna acting as a sergeant. As Drew Sterwald from News Press noted, the song in its military version was talking about both personal love, as well as patriotic love. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the song was contravened as cynical, when Madonna sang the line, [...] "What you need is a big, strong hand/To lift <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> higher ground", and raised a rifle above her head. Author Dirk Timmerman pointed out that [...] "in the context of the show, with [...] performances like 'American Life' and 'Imagine', it added to the anti-war message of the tour." [...] In 2008, during the Sticky & Sweet Tour, she performed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the request song in some of her shows, including the show at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman {{taught that}} the Sages instituted the {{tradition}} that Jews drink four cups of wine at the Passover seder in {{allusion to the}} four cups mentioned in [...] which says: [...] "‘Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.'
