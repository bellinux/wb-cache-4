If you want fighting, return to your villages; you will have plenty of it there. The Blackfeet warriors have {{hitherto}} made war upon you as children. They are now coming as men.

It'll often send its hero to convert your mines, to draw your units away from <b>your</b> <b>town</b> to chase {{him back to his}} city hall, while other units invade your area. It'll send minor units to hack at your buildings, and it is very good at hiding its numbers using the Fog of War. At the start of a campaign, the {{computer}} is pretty much a pushover, but as the game progresses, you'll often find your hands full." ...|$|E

Sue, his wife, drives their car to Florida, where she leaves it to be loaded up with drugs, then Lance flies down and drives it back. Sue flies back after she drops the car off in Florida. May 3 she is driving down there again and the car back he has the trunk loaded with over $100,000.00 in drugs. Presently they have over $100,000.00 worth of drugs in their basement. They brag about the fact they never have to work, and make their entire living on pushers. I guarantee, if you watch them carefully you will make a big catch. They are friends with some big drug dealers who visit their house often." ...|$|E
