500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Sale el Sol received an average score of 89 based on 5 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Carlos Quintana from About.com praised Shakira's experimentation with merengue and rock sounds on the album, noting that her [...] "never ending innovative style giving us {{an indication of}} her artistic evolution and current musical interests", and that Sale el Sol [...] "shows again why Shakira {{is one of the}} top Latin Pop artists in the world". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it a very positive review, complimenting Shakira's versatility in her [...] "pan-global approach", and praising the album's simple and [...] "breezy" [...] nature, saying it [...] "never once sounds disparate or overworked -- it's sunny and easy, its natural buoyancy disguising Shakira's range and skill -- but listen closely and it becomes apparent that nobody makes better pop records in the new millennium than she does". The Billboard review of the album was also extremely positive, noting that its composition is [...] "infinitely more memorable and unique than the singer's baffling 2009 set, She Wolf", and that it [...] "manages to bridge the divide between the old and new Shakira with a spark that keeps <b>you</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the very end".|$|E

My own {{experience}} answered me, and said, No. [...] "Bear in mind what I have told you," [...] Mr. Playmore proceeded. [...] "And now let us get on to your own position in this matter, and to the interests that you have at stake.

It is one thing to be morally convinced (as I am) that Miserrimus Dexter is the man who ought to have been tried for the murder at Gleninch; and it is another thing, at this distance of time, to lay our hands on the plain evidence which can alone justify anything like a public assertion of his guilt. There, as I see it, is the insuperable difficulty in the case. Unless I am completely mistaken, the question is now narrowed to this plain issue: The public assertion of your husband's innocence depends entirely on the public assertion of Dexter's guilt. How are you to arrive at that result? There is not a particle of evidence against him. You can only convict Dexter on Dexter's own confession. Are <b>you</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> me?" ...|$|E

And tell him that I am steadfast in my religion as he is in his, and that he may depend on me to the death. (He turns to go, and meets the eye of the sergeant, who looks a little suspicious. He considers a moment, and then, turning roguishly to Judith with something of a smile breaking through his earnestness, says) And now, my dear, I am afraid the sergeant will not believe that you love me like a wife unless you give one kiss before I go.|$|E

50|$|Well, every writer, at the {{beginning}} of his career, is influenced by somebody. Surely it's true that the ragtime rhythms of Langston Hughes and the order of Countee Cullen, his devotion to the church, have influenced me. But you know if <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Bach and then <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the early Haydn you can see a cross between the two--you can see that Bach was influenced by Haydn.

And if <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the greatest Beethoven and then <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the early Brahms, you can see that the early Brahms was influenced by the later Beethoven. Then he became his own style. He got his own idea of life. You admire your father, and you imitate his gestures and his stance--the way he talks, the way he holds his glass, the way he kisses his wife. There is something about him that influences you. But then as you grow older, you begin to get your own style, your own class, your own idea of what is going on. Oh, yes, it's true that Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen influenced me.|$|R
