2500|$|Zillur Rahman, {{the then}} {{regional}} director of Radio East Pakistan, forwarded a paper to Sufia Kamal to sign with the statement [...] "In 1971 no massacre took place in Bangladesh." [...] When Sufia Kamal refused, Rahman threatened, [...] "If you don't give <b>your</b> <b>signature</b> then it might create a problem both {{for you and your}} son-in-law Kahar Chowdhury." [...] She told him that she didn't care for her life. She said, [...] "I would rather die than put my signature on the false statement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruce McLaren's {{team was}} the last front-running team to produce a 4WD car in 1969, a brand new chassis {{designed}} by Jo Marquart and designated the M9A. The car, complete with distinctive [...] "tea tray" [...] rear wing, was completed in time for Derek Bell {{to use in the}} British Grand Prix alongside the standard M7s, where he retired with suspension failure. After McLaren himself tested the car he compared driving it to [...] "trying to write <b>your</b> <b>signature</b> with someone constantly jogging your elbow" [...] and the car was never raced again.|$|E

"My {{reasons for}} feeling so {{strongly}} on the matter," [...] he continued, [...] "will be appreciated by you, Captain Bannister, {{as a man}} of position and in society"--Captain Bannister bowed--"when I tell you that my future son-in- law, Mr. Walmsley, M.P., has proposed me for membership in two of the most exclusive clubs in London. This affair, therefore, must be killed beyond any manner of doubt. I am handing over to you four thousand pounds, which is a very considerable sum; but in return for it I desire that my future immunity be purchased by <b>your</b> <b>signatures</b> to this document." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you wish," [...] he agreed. [...] "It is interesting, if {{only as a}} curiosity. The {{imitation}} of <b>your</b> <b>signature</b> is almost perfect." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Whoever {{gave the}} titles, I should say that, as {{the bank had}} no claim {{whatever}} on the property, if the transfer was a forgery, the sale would be declared void and the loss would fall on the purchaser. This would, {{in the case of}} anyone but Brander, have been very hard, but would, in his, be in strict accordance with justice. However, this is a matter for which, of course, you will require the best legal opinion, but all that is for after consideration. The great difficulty, and I grant that I don't see how it is to be got over, is to prove that <b>your</b> father's <b>signature</b> to the transfer was a forgery. The first step is to ascertain whether the attesting witnesses were actually present as they should have been when <b>your</b> father's <b>signature</b> was affixed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Hall, tremblingly searching in {{his vest}} pocket. [...] "I brought it with me. It isn't {{much of a}} note, but there's <b>your</b> <b>signature</b> plain enough." ...|$|E

6000|$|A roar of {{laughter}} and approval followed, but was silenced again by the quiet, unimpassioned voice of the stranger. [...] "If, on the other hand," [...] he went on calmly, [...] "you all feel that this news is the fitting culmination and consecration of the hopes, wishes, and plans of this meeting, you will assert it again, over <b>your</b> own <b>signatures,</b> to Colonel Starbottle at this table." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I {{call upon}} you to assert, under your own name and [...] with <b>your</b> own <b>signature,</b> what are <b>your</b> {{intentions}} with [...] reference to Margaret Mackenzie.

6000|$|PRINCE PAUL. Count Rouvaloff is {{the typical}} spendthrift, Sire; {{he is always}} giving away what he needs most. (Lays papers before the CZAR.)

5000|$|The Fontamaresi, {{are more}} often than not, exploited.

Cav. Pelino lies to them, saying [...] "There are new authorities in office now, who hold the peasants in high esteem and wish to give consideration to their views. So i appeal to you to give me <b>your</b> <b>signatures.</b> Show <b>your</b> appreciation of the honor that the authorities have done you in sending an official here to discover your wishesAt the beginning of the story The famous story of the donkey and the priest was the most disgraceful hoax of all of the many that have been played on the Fontamaresi. They thought that a new priest would be coming to Fontamara and cleaned the church, mended the road, put up an arch and decorated the village in his honour. However it turns out that instead of a priest, they were given a donkey adorned with coloured paper to represent sacred vestments. Therefore our first thought was that the diversion of the stream was a practical joke tooBerardo says Every government always consists of thieves. But if a government consists of a single thief instead of five hundred its better for the cafoni, of course, because the appetite of a big thief, however big it may be, will always be less than that of five hundred small and hungry thieves.|$|R
