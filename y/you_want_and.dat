You should then employ the proper magical invocation in order to get into your circle just the one spirit you want. It is comparatively easy to do this. A few simple instructions are all that is necessary, and I shall be pleased to give these, free of charge, to any one who cares to apply.|$|E
25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>and</b> still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E

500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> <b>and</b> then do the things you want. We would never have a [...] force you to be a certain character or go down a certain path." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as a state of mind, which allows you to see what <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> <b>and</b> how you want to see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>and</b> I can give them to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E

2500|$|... "Take what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>and</b> pay for it, says God" [...] is {{referred}} to as an [...] "old Spanish proverb" [...] by Elsa.

2500|$|During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called [...] "old-school" [...] and [...] "crotchety"—had {{disputes}} over filming. With {{a background in}} independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most {{of the elements of}} the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who felt that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look. Kurtz stated that [...] "In a couple of scenes [...] rather than saying, 'It looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [...] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way I think it should be—tell me what's the effect that <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> <b>and</b> I'll make a judgment {{about what to do with}} my lights.|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{decision}} to make the music for Tame Impala in the studio by himself {{is a result of}} Parker liking [...] "the kind of music that is the result of one person constructing an awesome symphony of sound. You can layer your own voice 700 times for half a second if <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> <b>and</b> I just love that kind of music." [...] However, Parker has to translate his music to a live setting with the band, and the band doesn't play the songs until they have been recorded. [...] "The only jamming that's done as a band is done a long time after the song is recorded {{for the sake of the}} live environment. It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom." ...|$|E

2500|$|Well, {{they passed}} him over, {{and there was}} a hell of a roar on the Hill.

[...] And I said, [...] "I...agree with you." [...] So I went to Bob Anderson, the Secretary of the Navy, and I said, [...] "There is machinery in the law which is very strict about the promotion and the Secretary can't dictate, but there is a way that you can write in a precept a certain qualification that <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> <b>and</b> we can write it so strongly that they can't accept anybody but Rickover." [...] So I wrote a precept for a board of 6 line [...] and 3 EDOs and...tied it up so that the qualification was such that only Rickover could qualify.|$|E
