500|$|Stravinsky's autobiographical account {{refers to}} many [...] "painful incidents" [...] between the ballet-master and the dancers during the {{rehearsal}} period. By {{the beginning of}} 1913, when Nijinsky was badly behind schedule, Stravinsky was warned by Diaghilev that [...] "unless <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> immediately... the Sacre will not take place". The problems were slowly overcome, and when the final rehearsals were held in May 1913, the dancers appeared to have mastered the work's difficulties. Even the Ballets Russes's sceptical stage director, Serge Grigoriev, was full of praise for the originality and dynamism of Nijinsky's choreography.|$|E

He {{chose to be}} a quarterback for the Washington State Cougars instead after head coach Mike Price, who had coached longtime New England Patriots starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe, called {{him on the phone}} while Leaf was watching the Rose Bowl, and told him [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> we're going there" [...] even though Washington State had not reached the Rose Bowl since 1931. Leaf told Sports Illustrated that he immediately knew he wanted to accept a scholarship and play for Price.|$|E

2500|$|Petrelis {{launched}} {{the effort in}} Concord, New Hampshire on December 10, 1991, when he disrupted conservative commentator Pat Buchanan's announcement of his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. Two minutes into Buchanan's speech, broadcast on the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN), Petrelis started screaming, [...] "Act up, fight back, fight AIDS!" [...] Off camera, senior Buchanan campaign officials tackled Petrelis and dragged him from the hall, while Buchanan advised, [...] "Be gentle. Be gentle with him." [...] Standing over Petrelis outside, the campaign officials were heard to threaten, [...] "Every time <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> this is what you're going to get. Tell your friends." [...] Petrelis filed an assault complaint with the New Hampshire State Police against the two campaign officials, Paul Nagy and Chris Tremblay.|$|E
2500|$|It's not ill-conceived to look {{at certain}} people and {{question}} {{when they come out}} here what they bring with them ... We have strict quarantine laws and it should be the same when it comes to cultures that do not want to integrate. We should be very careful about where certain Muslims come from and what they believe. If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> you should behave yourself – it's as simple as that... If people come and live in any country and their way of life is so different they need their own special laws, then possibly they have to pick somewhere else to live. The idea of any Muslim being photographed for a passport or a licence with one of those shrouds on – sorry, it just can't happen.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing you do is you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role {{two or three times}} and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{was highly}} intelligent, erudite, {{sensitive}} and sentimental, but {{to protect himself}} in the cutthroat atmosphere of Hollywood he cultivated {{the image of a}} [...] "tough, two-fisted, hard-drinking Irish sonofabitch". One famous event, witnessed by Ford's friend actor Frank Baker, strikingly illustrates the tension between the public persona and the private man. During the Depression, Ford—by then a very wealthy man—was accosted outside his office by a former Universal actor who was destitute and needed $200 for an operation for his wife. As the man related his misfortunes, Ford appeared to become enraged and then, to the horror of onlookers, he launched himself at the man, knocked him to the floor and shouted [...] "How dare <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> like this? Who do think you are to talk to me this way?" [...] before storming out of the room. However, as the shaken old man left the building, Frank Baker saw Ford's business manager Fred Totman meet him at the door, where he handed the man a cheque for $1,000 and instructed Ford's chauffeur to drive him home. There, an ambulance was waiting to take the man's wife to the hospital where a specialist, flown in from San Francisco at Ford's expense, performed the operation. Some time later, Ford purchased a house for the couple and pensioned them for life. When Baker related the story to Francis Ford, he declared it the key to his brother's personality: ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} at Indian Affairs was the 1969 White Paper, {{a proposal to}} abolish the Indian Act. The paper was widely opposed by First Nations groups, and later abandoned. It was the 1969 White Paper that first brought Chrétien to widespread public attention in English Canada. At a press conference announcing the White Paper, Chrétien openly clashed with Indian activists with one First Nations women asking Chrétien [...] "When did we lose our identity?", to which the minister replied [...] "When you signed the treaties", which prompted boos and jeers. Another women from the Iroquois reserve at Brantford asked Chrétien [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and ask us to become citizens, when we were here long before you?", noting the Crown had granted the Grand River valley to Joseph Brant in 1784, to which Chrétien had no reply. The Cree activist Harold Cardinal in his bestselling 1969 book The Unjust Society attacked Chrétien and Trudeau for the White Paper, accusing them of [...] "cultural genocide" [...] against the First Nations. To counteract such criticism, Chrétien during a 1970 visit to the Northwest Territories adopted from the local orphanage in Inuvik an Inuit boy, whom he named Michel, whose mother was an alcoholic prostitute and whose unknown father {{had been one of}} her johns. As Indian Affairs Minister, Chrétien {{fell in love with the}} far north of Canada, whose beauty moved him, and he vacationed in the north every summer during his time while holding the Indian Affairs portfolio.|$|E
