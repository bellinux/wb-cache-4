500|$|The {{focal point}} of {{criticism}} was Storm of Zehirs story. [...] Critics considered its focus on trade and economics shallow compared to the epic adventures presented in Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer. [...] GameSpy referred to the storyline as a [...] "boringly generic adventure", and GameSpot said [...] "The quests reflect this mundane storyline. <b>You</b> <b>run</b> <b>a</b> lot of lame errands to kill specific monsters and recover lost or stolen merchandise, and you clean out a bunch of formulaic dungeons, caves, graveyards, and the like". Other complaints included the presence of random encounters on the overland map, which were considered excessive, as well as long load times.|$|E

You {{may look}} with admiration, admitting, however {{question}} {{of right and}} wrong,[266] at Van Eyck, Holbein, Perugino, Francia, Angelico, Leonardo da Vinci, Correggio, Vandyck, Rembrandt, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Turner, and the modern Pre-Raphaelites.[267] You had better look at no other painters than these, for <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>a</b> chance, otherwise, of being led far off the road, or into grievous faults, {{by some of the}} other great ones, as Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Rubens; and of being, besides, corrupted in taste by the base ones, as Murillo, Salvator, Claude, Gasper Poussin, Teniers, and such others. You may look, however, for examples of evil, with safe universality of reprobation, being sure that everything you see is bad, at Domenichino, the Caracci, Bronzino, and the figure pieces of Salvator.|$|E
60|$|Some points may {{be taken}} as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at. In this case, as in most others, what {{may be taken}} as certain in advance is rather vague. The study of any topic is like the {{continued}} observation of an object which is approaching us along a road: what is certain to begin with is the quite vague knowledge that there is SOME object on the road. If you attempt to be less vague, and to assert that the object is an elephant, or a man, or a mad dog, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>a</b> risk of error; but the purpose of continued observation is to enable you to arrive at such more precise knowledge. In like manner, {{in the study of}} memory, the certainties with which you begin are very vague, and the more precise propositions at which you try to arrive are less certain than the hazy data from which you set out. Nevertheless, in spite of the risk of error, precision is the goal at which we must aim.|$|E
60|$|I {{know they}} {{say that if you}} meddle with {{literature}} you are less qualified to take your part in practical affairs. <b>You</b> <b>run</b> <b>a</b> risk of being labelled a dreamer and a theorist. But, after all, if we take the very highest form of all practical energy--the governing of the country--all this talk is ludicrously untrue. I venture to say that in the present Government [1887], including the Prime Minister, there are three men at least who are perfectly capable of earning their bread as men of letters. In the late Government, besides the Prime Minister, there were also three men of letters, and I have never heard that those three were greater simpletons than their neighbours. There is a Commission now at work on that very important and abstruse subject--the Currency. I am told that no one there displays so acute an intelligence of the difficulties that are to be met, and so ready an apprehension of the important arguments that are brought forward, and the practical ends to be achieved, as the chairman of the Commission, who is not what is called a practical man, but a man of study, literature, theoretical speculation, and university training.[1] Oh no, gentlemen, some of the best men of business in the country are men who have had the best collegian's equipment, and are the most accomplished bookmen.|$|E

[...] "Hullo! here we are on the nice soft grass! and, oh, my gracious! there's a bank running down into a hollow! I can't stand that, you know.
