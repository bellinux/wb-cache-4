2500|$|No direct {{orders to}} commit atrocities by Milošević {{have ever been}} discovered, though little or no effort was made by Milošević to punish people deemed {{responsible}} for such atrocities, including Ratko Mladić who, after being accused of allowing atrocities to occur against Croats in Vukovar, was sent to lead the Army of the Republika Srpska, in which capacity Mladić was accused of ordering atrocities, including the murder of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica. Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milošević refused to accept that Mladić {{was responsible for the}} crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, {{who was a member of}} the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milošević that Milošević had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladić's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milošević: 'Mr. President, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> so much influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it then, if you have such influence, that you allowed General Mladić to kill all those people in Srebrenica?' with Milošević answering: 'Well, General Clark... I warned Mladić not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No; {{you look}} as if you {{could take care of}} yourself." [...] Mr. Sumner rubbed his chin. [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no {{prospects}} ahead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MEPH. (insinuatingly): One moment. Did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{prepared}} {{this book}} during the term? Afraid I'm {{a little hard}} of hearing. Eh, what? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. We go by Sutton Leigh: so make haste, maidens." [...] Then, {{turning to}} his mother, [...] "Didn't I hear <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} {{to send to}} Elizabeth, ma'am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MAGGIE. Did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> lost, John? Of {{course you}} {{would lose the}} first time, dear John. Six years. Very well, we'll begin another six to-night. You'll win yet. [Fiercely] Never give in, John, never give in! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I only wonder then, M. Chapeau, why {{you want}} the English to come and help you, if, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> conquered all the {{republicans}} yourselves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How delicious!' she said. 'How sweet the {{honeysuckle}} is, {{dear old}} thing! <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known it all your life, {{and yet it}} is fresh as ever.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. But {{a little}} misery, at times, makes one {{appreciate}} happiness more. Tell me, Phony, {{what is this}} record like, which <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> on tap?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he died of}} {{apoplexy}} {{nearly a}} year ago. I remember hearing <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to pay money for him; and he left his daughters badly off; {{one of them is}} under-teacher at Miss Firniss's, where I've been to school, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Trembling, {{and in a}} great flutter, Morgiana put on her bonnet and gloves, {{and went}} towards the door. [...] "It's a fine morning," [...] said Mr. Walker, looking out: [...] "a walk will do <b>you</b> good; and--Morgiana--didn't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a couple of guineas in your pocket?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} yet told me what your good action was. Or did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done more than one?" [...] asked his companion, as he spilt into his plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries, and through a {{perforated}} shell-shaped spoon snowed white sugar upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "What talk is this?" [...] said Father Abram. [...] "You {{said that}} you {{remember}} your parents. Why do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no name? I do not understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To your face," [...] said Cynthia, who {{got more}} {{self-controlled}} {{as he grew}} angry. [...] "I believe that that consent, which <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> given freely, was wrung from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} looked upon her aghast. Then a generous current poured along his veins. ‘That is all one,’ he said. ‘If you be all <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the greater need of me.’ ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. PEARCE. If you please, sir, the trouble's {{beginning}} already. There's a dustman downstairs, Alfred Doolittle, {{wants to}} see <b>you.</b> He <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> his daughter here.|$|R
60|$|Alon. I know it, sir; but spare {{yourself}} the trouble, I'll speak for you; <b>you</b> would <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> it {{from some other}} hand; I believe it, sir.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I answered. [...] "Truly {{it was not}} to be {{expected}} that I could be easily lured from Paris just as my fortunes are nearing a high tide, and his Eminence proposing to make me a Marshal of France and create me Duke. As <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> scant grounds for hoping that my love for you would suffice to make me renounce all these fine things for the mere sake of accompanying you on your jaunt to Blois." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Brother, don't speak like this. If {{you have}} any special reason, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> and think you have--though I say, No!--to love me, spare me the hearing of such wild mad words!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will try}} you, I think. Perhaps, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{never had a}} fair chance yet, and I will give you one. I believe what you say, {{that you will be}} faithful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} <b>you</b> why I <b>say</b> so. Because I {{went to the}} drawer this morning before going to parade, and I saw some of Mrs. Clinton's baby's night-gowns in it. Yes, I see they {{are all in the}} wash-tub now; but they were there this morning, and when I heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> put the child into one of our baby's night-gowns because it had no clean ones of its own, I knew that you were lying, and that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done this on purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the bye," [...] {{the latter}} asked, as their {{conversation}} drew toward a close, [...] "how long did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been in England, Mr. Saton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How coolly <b>you</b> <b>say</b> so! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> iron nerves, all <b>you</b> Douglases. I <b>have</b> heard all, and I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> suffered. How soon will you leave London?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> much to {{communicate}} to me, let us have it by all [...] means, as I am utterly {{at a loss to}} guess; whatever it may be it will [...] meet with due attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of late {{you have}} drawn but {{slightly}} upon me for, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> few expenses save {{the pay of}} your five men, when staying at Laville; but do not stint money, should there be an occasion." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are {{all very}} cruel," [...] the Duc de Carolan laughed. [...] "And you, Mademoiselle de Pignerolles? But I know what <b>you</b> will <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> never seen anyone worth loving." ...|$|R
6000|$|Henrietta's {{peculiar}} scarlet blush flowed rapidly {{over her}} cheeks as she flung Agatha's arm away, exclaiming, [...] "How dare <b>you</b> <b>say</b> so! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> no heart. He adored me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen him? Oh!" [...] Once {{more the}} colour suffused her cheeks, {{and her eyes}} glowed, her {{expression}} became radiant. [...] "Where is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must be quicker next time, O'Grady," [...] the {{adjutant}} said, {{when the}} laughter had subsided; [...] "as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> missed {{a good thing}} by your slowness. I am afraid your brain was still a little muddled by your indulgence the night before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,--not a whit less. Ask {{any person}} of experience. But what of that? Let's talk {{of our own}} affairs. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no thought of the Bishop. And yet if he had stayed here another day or two he would have {{proposed}} to you straight off.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Corwin," [...] said Blandford, sternly, [...] "whatever your {{business}} is here you'll find {{it will pay}} you better, a ---- sight, to be frank with me and stop this Yankee shuffling. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been with Demorest--what has HE {{got to do with}} {{your business}} here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In such {{an affair}} three men are as useful as thirty,' said Savary. 'I should {{not in any}} case <b>have</b> {{employed}} more. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> another friend, Lieutenant--?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Val. If, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> silently <b>have</b> been [...] So long my lover, let {{my power}} be seen: [...] One hour's {{discourse}} before Porphyrius die, [...] Is all I ask, and you too may be by.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] said Peter {{from the}} shadow of the doorway, [...] "I fear this business, Inez, and I do not {{understand}} why it is needful. Why cannot <b>you</b> <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to <b>say</b> here?" ...|$|R
