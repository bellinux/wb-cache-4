500|$|To {{give the}} Odyssey an unnatural ghostship feeling of solitude, many wide angle shots and VisFX matte {{extension}} were used with no additional music. Robert C. Cooper often {{listened to the}} CCR song [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Seen</b> the Rain?" [...] during {{the making of the}} episode and decided to play it over the first montage, showing the passage of time. The tone of the second montage was set with a cello. Stargate composer Joel Goldsmith later accompanied the hand movements of the hired cellist with different music during post-production. A third montage was filmed but not included in the final cut of the episode since the last table scene already supplied the needed sentiment. Each time period included the same shots to help the audience focus on the differences that characters have gone through. The last scene at Stargate Command was the last filmed Stargate SG-1 scene, shot at two o'clock in the morning, for which every member of the crew came back.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for animal rights, Linda lent her support to many organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the Council for the Protection of Rural England, and Friends of the Earth. She was also a patron of the League Against Cruel Sports. She narrated a TV advertisement for PETA, in which she said: [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> a fish gasping for breath when you {{take it out of}} the water?

2500|$|Whilst he {{was writing}} The Rise of the Russian Empire, {{he made his first}} foray into short story writing and {{published}} a piece called 'Dogged' in St Paul's in February 1899. He then moved into the world of political satire in 1900 with a collaboration with Francis Carruthers Gould entitled [...] "Alice in Westminster". Gould produced the sketches, and Munro wrote the text accompanying them, using the pen-name [...] "Saki" [...] for the first time. The series lampooned political figures of the day ('Alice in Downing Street' begins with the memorable line, '"Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> an Ineptitude?"' - referring to a zoomorphised Arthur Balfour), and was published in the Liberal Westminster Gazette.|$|E

2500|$|On November 8, 1995, {{while she}} was a student of {{aeronautics}} at the Technion {{as part of the}} academic reserve, Alice Miller appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court after being turned down for the pilot selection phase in the Israeli Air Force flight academy. Following her appeal, Israeli president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, made chauvinistic comments that ridiculed the idea of women as fighter pilots: [...] "Listen maideleh, have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> a man knitting socks? Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> a female surgeon or a female being a conductor of an orchestra? Women are not able to withstand the pressures required for fighter pilots." [...] The Israeli Supreme Court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller did not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in the IDF. Following the petition, formerly all-male military units began accepting women, including the Israeli Air Force flight academy, the Israeli navy officers' course, various artillery courses, the Israeli air defense [...] and the Israeli Border Police. The Equality Amendment to the Military Service law, enacted in January 2000, completed the Supreme Court ruling as it defined the right of female soldiers to volunteer for combat professions. This law stated that [...] "The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men." [...] The amendment drafted by female lawmakers granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was [...] "suitable" [...] was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, DeStefano {{was arrested}} after {{he tried to}} {{represent}} Vito Zaccagonini in a forgery trial in Rockford, Illinois. He later returned demanding {{the names of all}} employees in the state's attorney's and sheriff's offices so they could be called as witnesses at his subsequent trial. During another court date in Rockford, when he was serving as his own lawyer as was his practice, he confused everyone in the courtroom when he approached the jury and asked, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> an elephant?" [...] Moments later DeStefano suddenly changed his plea to guilty, telling the jury, [...] "something had come to light that I had not known before." [...] The jury found him guilty and fined him $100 for disorderly conduct.|$|E

2500|$|Goldsmith's {{reliance}} on Arnold's score decreased {{over the seasons}} when Stargate SG-1 departed from the Goa'uld theme and introduced new characters and races. Goldsmith had a thematic approach to races and spaceships. For example, he wanted a mechanical, repetitive musical motif for the Replicators; Gothic, Gregorian and Christian themes were {{the inspiration for the}} Ori motif. The Ancient theme was deliberately carried over to Stargate Atlantis. The end of [...] "Lost City" [...] has a basic melody that would become part of the main title of Atlantis per a suggestion by Goldsmith's assistant. Non-original music was rarely used on SG-1, although Goldsmith chose the aria [...] "Vesti la giubba" [...] from Leoncavallo's [...] "Pagliaccio" [...] for the season 3's [...] "Shades of Grey". Additionally, Lily Frost's song [...] "Who am I" [...] played in Season 7's [...] "Fragile Balance" [...] and CCR's song [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Seen</b> the Rain?" [...] played in the series finale [...] "Unending". A television soundtrack with Goldsmith's adapted score was released in 1997, followed by a best-of release in 2001. [...] In Season 1 Episode 7, The Nox, the music that played when The Nox appeared was Spinning The Silk from the album Chrysalis by 2002.|$|E
