According to Ahn, an anonymous message {{was sent to}} Kyungnam University where he worked, alleging that he [...] "had sex with two underage girls". Ahn filed a criminal libel case against the accuser, a British English teacher living in Seoul. The man retaliated by posting the allegations against Ahn publicly on his blog and in ESL teacher forums, starting a social media firestorm of condemnation. Ahn wrote that In Internet forums I was called a [...] "violent pornographer," [...] a 'child molester,' and a 'serial rapist.' I began receiving hate mail. One of my detractors had this to say: [...] "We will have won when you leave this country broken, blacklisted and when <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> a symbol of deceit, lies and {{a perfect example of}} what NOT to be in Korea.

500|$|The first movement, [...] "" [...] (God, as <b>Your</b> <b>name</b> <b>is,</b> so also Your praise is to {{the ends}} of the world.), deals with {{universal}} praise of God's name is a choral fugue. While the trumpets are independent, the strings and oboes mostly double the voices in the style of Bach's motets. The first trumpet even plays the fugue theme. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr argues that the work is probably no new composition but the reworking of an older lost movement, which forms the basis of both this movement and the later second part of the Credo of this music to the Mass in B minor, [...] ( [...] almighty father, maker of Heaven and Earth). The idea of both is the [...] "world-embracing almighty power of God".|$|E
500|$|The {{thought is}} {{continued}} in [...] "" [...] (to the Father, almighty), in a four-part choral movement with trumpets. The movement probably shares its original source {{with the opening}} chorus of [...] (God, as <b>Your</b> <b>name</b> <b>is,</b> so is also Your praise), which also expresses the idea of thanks to God and praise of his creation. The voices sing a fugue to a concerto of the orchestra. The bass introduces the theme, without an instrumental opening, while the other voices repeat simultaneously in homophony [...] "" [...] as a firm statement. The theme contains all eight notes of the scale, as a symbol completeness. Bach noted {{at the end of}} the movement that it contains 84 measures, the multiplication of 7 and 12, a hint at the symbolic meaning of numbers. The word [...] "" [...] appears 49 times (7*7), the words [...] "" [...] 84 times.|$|E

[...] Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. [...] He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. [...] Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, [...] "My job is about my name. My dad taught me <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> the most important thing. I had to fight for my name." [...] During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable.

500|$|Starting in June 1967 {{and ending}} in October 1967, Bob Dylan's writing and {{recording}} sessions with the Band (then {{known as the}} Hawks) in Woodstock, New York, were the source of many new songs that were circulated as demos by Dylan's publisher for fellow artists to record. [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" [...] was written and recorded during this period and features lyrics that allude to the singer waiting for his bride to arrive and possibly, a final premarital fling. [...] The original version found on 1975's The Basement Tapes album was recorded with the Band (minus Levon Helm who had temporarily left the group at this point) {{in the basement of}} their house in West Saugerties, New York, called [...] "Big Pink". A first take recorded during the Basement Tapes sessions includes improvised nonsense lyrics such as [...] "Just pick up that oil cloth, cram it in the corn / I don't care if <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> Michael / You're gonna need some boards / Get your lunch, you foreign bib".

500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences.

There were some times {{in the second half}} when we were a bit lucky but we defended very well and to keep a clean sheet is good." [...] He admitted his players had practiced taking penalties, but was quick to point out [...] "you don't score because of the practising – keeping your nerve is more important." [...] Lehmann, who had been side-lined by Wenger {{during the course of the}} season, credited his teammates for scoring all five penalties, and described it as a [...] "big mental achievement." [...] Cole called Arsenal's win a [...] "…great team performance, we didn't have too many chances but we defended really well and battled really hard." [...] Henry, who sat out the final due to injury expressed sympathy for Manchester United, and recollected a similar experience from his early Arsenal career: [...] "I know how they feel because we lost against Liverpool and did not deserve to lose.

2500|$|Call Me by <b>Your</b> <b>Name</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} and final {{installment}} in Guadagnino's Desire trilogy, following I Am Love (2009) and A Bigger Splash (2015). The film represents a departure from his previous work, as he took a non-aggressive and simple approach, and has called this [...] "the most calm" [...] movie he has made. Despite being a literary adaptation, many scenes in the film play out wordlessly. [...] "Words are part of what's going on, but it's not necessarily what's going on underneath. I think this film celebrates the underneath," [...] he said. Guadagnino considers the film an [...] "homage to fathers," [...] referring to his own father and four filmmakers who inspired him—Jean Renoir, Jacques Rivette, Éric Rohmer, and Bernardo Bertolucci.|$|E

Either you send us an explanation of this game of chess or send revenue and tribute us." [...] Khosrow's grand vizier successfully solved the riddle and {{figured out how to}} play chess. In response the wise vizier created the game backgammon and sent it to the Indian court with the same message. The Indian King was not able to solve the riddle and was forced to pay tribute.|$|E

In 1978, Warnke recounted his Vietnam experiences on his third album, Hey, Doc!. His albums became [...] "the most popular Christian comedy albums ever produced". During a tour to Hazard, Kentucky, Warnke met Rose Hall, a thrice-divorced mother of three children. At this time, Warnke began courting Hall while still married to his second wife. Warnke's second marriage came to an end when, as Alberty stated in an interview, [...] " [...] threw me into a wall and split my head open. He said, 'If you go to a local hospital and tell them what <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>is,</b> I'll kill you.'" [...] Alberty fled to Florida. By November 1979, their divorce was final, and Warnke moved to Hall's farm in Kentucky. On January 2, 1980, Warnke and Hall were married.|$|E

One, Al Bailey, denied to Moseley that he had seen a UFO in the desert or the alien Adamski described. Jerrold Baker, who had worked at Palomar Gardens with Adamski, told Moseley that he had overheard [...] "a tape-recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc." [...] several days before Adamski's claimed 20 November meeting with Orthon, and Baker stated that Adamski's meeting with Orthon was a [...] "planned operation." [...] Baker added that Adamski had tried to convince him not to expose their hoax by telling him that he could make money by charging fees to give UFO lectures, as Adamski was doing: [...] "Now you know the [...] picture connected to <b>your</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> in the book (Flying Saucers Have Landed) too.

This album {{is known for its}} heavy West Coast hip hop sound, something that didn't feature much in his debut The Documentary. He worked with a number of west coast artists such as Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Tha Dogg Pound giving more west coast oreientated lyrics.

[...] DJBooth praised his lyrical skills by saying [...] "to briefly touch on the lyrics, only Eminem and Lil’ Wayne are currently equals." [...] However, once again many critics panned The Game's namedropping throughout the album, but Steve Juon of Rapreviews says that [...] "some accused him of being a [...] "name dropper" [...] back then and still will today, the references seem more in keeping with his [...] "soldier of the West" [...] philosophy and less like a filler for lack of content." ...|$|E
