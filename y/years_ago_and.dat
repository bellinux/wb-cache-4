5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 66million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.|$|E

5|$|Evidence from {{daughter}} {{products of}} short-lived radioactive isotopes {{shows that a}} nearby supernova helped determine {{the composition of the}} Solar System 4.5billion <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> may even have triggered the formation of this system.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. The trigger for th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> dacite erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E

5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica millions of <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone {{in the ruins of}} an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica thousands of <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} glaciations further {{modified}} the region starting about 2 to 3 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> ending sometime around 10,000 BP.

The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.|$|E
