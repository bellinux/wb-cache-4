For the video's primary filming locations, Carey had Louis Vuitton's flagship store on Champs-Élysées, {{one of the most}} prestigious avenues in Paris, shut down. When describing the experience filming in the boutique, Carey explained: [...] "Obviously, being able to take <b>your</b> <b>pick</b> of anything in the store and have the whole store shut down for you is every girl's dream. You know, just a pretty standard {{day in the life of}} anybody. No, just joking.

500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Talk, Jason Bovberg praised the episode for its [...] "spooky wonderfulness", {{stating that the}} episode scared his daughter. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "A fun, 'scary' (for little kids) SpongeBob that adults will appreciate, 'Graveyard Shift' uses the old standby of the headless/handless/legless (take <b>your</b> <b>pick)</b> killer-seeking-revenge stories we all told as kids, and cleverly grafts it onto a 'SpongeBob at work' storyline." [...] Mavis added, [...] "I always enjoy it when Rodger Bumpass, the voice actor for Squidward, gets quiet and {{manipulative}} when he's shining SpongeBob on, and here's {{one of the best}} examples of that." [...] He praised Count Orlok's cameo, [...] "especially when they animate the vampire's face into a goofy, giddy smile." [...] Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said the episode is one of his [...] "personal faves." [...] He also said [...] " [...] has everything that makes the show great: funny dialogue (the whole story of the Hash-Slinging Slasher is hilarious), clever sight gags (especially SpongeBob's regenerating limbs), and that aforementioned outta-nowhere ending that made me bust a gut." ...|$|E
