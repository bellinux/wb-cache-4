60|$|MATTHEW [sullenly]. What call {{have you}} to look down on me? I suppose you think you're {{everybody}} because <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> land agent.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rich man." [...] Mr. Mariner's {{voice was}} high and plaintive. [...] "He made a fortune over here {{before he went to}} England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do not {{understand}} what kind of secret remembrance you mean to infer that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> prey to,' she returned, after a silence. 'You speak so mysteriously.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, Mademoiselle, and I know more. I {{know that}} this hinted {{conspiracy}} against <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> trumped-up lie to lure you to the coppice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tottie," [...] she said, [...] "listen--you're {{old enough}} to understand, I think. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bad man--at least, I won't say he's {{altogether}} bad, but--but, he's not good." ...|$|R
50|$|I Am <b>Your</b> <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 2015 Spanish {{documentary}} film {{written and directed}} by Marcos Cabotá (es). The film dealt with actor David Prowse many years after the role of Darth Vader.|$|R
6000|$|... "I once {{felt that}} strongly; {{the trouble is}} that the {{objection}} applies with equal force to you. Your mother had a resolute character; <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> daring man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubt not of your words, {{my young}} friend; <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gentleman {{of a high}} and scrupulous honour. But why all this hide-and-seek work?--I hate holes and corners!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, Mr. Richard," [...] {{he would}} say; [...] "tho' <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> soldier afore ye, ye {{were born to}} {{the deck of a}} ship-o'-war. Mark an old man's words, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{the first}} thing I was told," [...] said Lodloe, [...] "was that you <b>were</b> <b>a</b> good-hearted fellow, {{but the fact that}} <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Irishman had {{deprived}} your character of ballast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Without prejudice, Miss Bannerman, without prejudice," [...] {{said the}} lawyer, with some confusion. [...] "Our {{conversation}} is entirely between ourselves, {{and to the}} world I have always upheld that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> innocent man." ...|$|R
50|$|And When Did You Last See <b>Your</b> <b>Father?</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 2007 British drama film {{directed}} by Anand Tucker. The screenplay by David Nicholls {{is based on}} the 1993 memoir of the same title by Blake Morrison.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your mother's {{name was}} Dorothy Kenneir. She was, before her marriage, the matron {{of a home}} in the East End of London, and a lady devoted to philanthropic work. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> police-court missionary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you know}} why I shrank from calling you my son, knowing that {{when the time came}} for you to be told of your parentage, I must also tell you that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> murderer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [As {{though the}} words were dragged out of him.] He called it a very mean and shameful crime, worse than another man's because <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gentleman of ancient family and bore a name of great honour.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is in danger," [...] {{replied the}} man, [...] "but not from illness. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> ruined man. Of all his friends, but one remains to him. That friend has {{travelled}} far to prove if his daughter has a daughter's affection." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go to! you <b>are</b> <b>a</b> shrewd knave," [...] said Master George; [...] "charm your tongue, {{and take}} care of saucy answers. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> honest burgher, and the deacon of his craft: I am sorry to see his son in so poor a coat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Silverbridge," [...] said Mr. Boncassen, {{speaking}} a little through his nose, [...] "I {{am proud to}} make your acquaintance, sir. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man for whom we in our country have a great respect. I think, sir, you must be proud of such a father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You are right. I am {{sufficiently}} {{informed of}} that deplorable affair; it is painful to me. My nephew, <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{man who would}} not be advised,’ said he. ‘Tell me, if you please, simply of yourself.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man of good counsel," [...] said she, [...] "and you cannot {{carry out}} his will better than by going on this path, where all that is noble and gallant in England will be your companions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I {{thought as}} much. That is beggary, you know. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very {{imprudent}} man. And {{you have a}} fellowship? I thought you broke down in your degree." [...] Whereupon Arthur again had to explain {{the facts of the}} case.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our incomes {{may improve}} {{when we are}} bent and grey," [...] said St. Barbe, [...] "and we may even retire on a pension {{about as good as}} a nobleman leaves to his valet. Oh, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> horrid world! <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> privy councillor, <b>is</b> not he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He's {{had some}} very bad luck lately. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man who prides himself on his {{business}} ability, {{but he has no}} more knowledge of such matters than a child. He's an imaginative man, and when some scheme appeals to his feeling for romance, he loses all sense of proportion.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{nothing will}} move {{you to go}} back," [...] I continued, [...] "there are still some decencies to be observed. Wait here with your baggage, and I will go forward and prepare <b>your</b> family. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> old man; and ..." [...] I {{stumbled}} ... "there are decencies to be observed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{seemed to}} {{think the fact that}} <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gentleman made the crime more odious, {{and the way in which}} he had induced that woman to part with her money made no {{punishment}} too severe. He sentenced him to seven years penal servitude.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And did he cast {{up to my}} bairn {{that he was a}} bastard?--troth he was na blate--my certie, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{better man}} than ever stood on the Doctor's shanks--a {{handsome}} grand gentleman, with an ee like a gled's, and a step like a Highland piper." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Garland reflected. 'Well, if {{you don't}} want to go, I don't,' she said. 'Perhaps, {{as you are}} growing up, {{it would be better}} to stay at home this time. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{professional}} man, certainly.' Having spoken as a mother, she sighed as a woman.|$|E
5000|$|Ḥadīth 4: The ḥadīth of Salamah ibn al-Akwā', who said: “The Messenger of Allah (SAW) {{passed by}} a group of people from the tribe of Aslam who were {{practicing}} archery.“ And he said to them: ”Throw Banī Ismā’īl, for <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> archer, and I am with the sons of such-and-such a one …” ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy slowly {{shook his}} head. [...] "No," [...] he said; [...] "that {{is out of}} the question--I could not ask it of you. There is also this to recognize: <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man of station, and would never permit you to marry a {{steamboat}} skipper. He will make every effort to keep you away from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} not. He didn't give me {{anything}} like the money I expected, when I said good-by--and I rather think he warned me solemnly, at parting, to take the greatest care of it.' There's not a farthing more for you,' he said, 'till your ship returns from her South American station.' <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> clergyman, Stone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is hearty, {{and like}} a man! There is none of your mopes about the Wallingfords, and I believe you {{to be of the}} true stock. But why never marry, Miles? <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sailor, and he married, and a very good time I've always {{understood}} he had of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{there it}} is," [...] said I. [...] "You had the cause at least. And yet <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good man; I never knew a better, save {{on the one}} point, nor yet a wiser. Where he stumbled, it is highly {{possible}} another man should fall. He had the two sons----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} it was {{different}} when <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> young man. And your father, too, was, not very long since, {{at the head of}} a government which contained many Conservatives. I don't look upon your father as a Radical, though perhaps I should not be justified in calling him a Conservative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{infantry}} {{captain and}} well thought of in his regiment. His worst faults <b>were</b> <b>a</b> quick temper and a rash impulsiveness, but he suffered for them. Before coming to India, he married beneath him, {{a girl of}} some beauty but no education. His relatives strongly opposed the match, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> quarrel with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{you begin}} to tell us your story, young sir, we should be glad {{to know how it}} is that you speak our {{language}} so well; for indeed we could not tell by your accent that you <b>are</b> not <b>a</b> native of these parts, which is of course impossible, seeing that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> Englishman and captain of the ship lying off there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it but {{gambling}} {{that he and}} Mr. Lopez is a-doing together? Of course, ma'am, I don't know you, and you {{are different}} from me. I ain't foolish enough not to know all that. My father stood in Smithfield and sold hay, and <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> gentleman as has been {{high up in the}} Courts all his life. But it's your husband is a-doing this." ...|$|R
