500|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 1905, Potter {{sent the}} {{illustrations}} to Warne for his review, writing, [...] "I think it promises to make a pretty book." [...] He criticised {{a picture of the}} cat and Potter wrote him, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> doubtful about the little cat—will you post it back to me at once ... I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but I think I can get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs. The drawing is getting much too rubbed." ...|$|E
500|$|Vincent D'Onofrio's {{character}} in [...] "Subway" [...] partially inspired {{the creation of}} the antagonist played by Bryan Cranston in [...] "Drive", a sixth season episode of The X-Files, which first aired on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter Vince Gilligan intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by [...] "Subway", which he called an [...] "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: [...] "The brilliant thing they did in this episode, the thing that stuck with me, was this guy's an asshole, the guy really is unpleasant, and yet at the end (<b>you)</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> his humanity." [...] The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series Breaking Bad.|$|E
500|$|The Nigella Bites series, {{which was}} filmed {{in her home}} in west London, was later {{broadcast}} on American television channels E! and Style Network. Lawson said of the US release, [...] "In the UK, my viewers {{have responded to the}} fact I'm trying to reduce, not add to, their burden and I'm looking forward to making that connection with Style viewers across the US". Overall, Lawson was well received in the United States. Those who did criticise her often suggested she was too flirtatious; a commentator from The New York Times said, [...] "Lawson's sexy roundness mixed with her speed-demon technique makes cooking dinner with Nigella look like a prelude to an orgy". The book of Nigella Bites became the second bestselling cook book of Christmas 2002 in America. The series was followed by Forever Summer with Nigella in 2002 on Channel 4, the concept being, [...] "that you cook to make <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> as though you're on holiday". Fellow food writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall condemned the conceit as [...] "cynical and reckless" [...] and referred to the book as Fuck Seasonality.|$|E

Here {{there are none}} to interrupt us, none to thwart my sovereign will. Reflect then, and remember. Remember what a pride you took in the change you had wrought in me. Your vanity welcomed that flattery, that tribute {{to the power of}} your beauty. Yet, all in a moment, upon the paltriest grounds, you believed me the murderer of your brother." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but {{it is better to}} be quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 December 1820 Lord Grey {{wrote to}} Fitzwilliam, {{asking him to}} support {{parliamentary}} reform: [...] "Your known opinions bear no inconsiderable part in the difficulty which I feel on this subject. Do <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> it quite impossible to admit any modification of them?" [...] Fitzwilliam replied on 10 December [...] "that hitherto the parliamentary reform has never been placed before me {{in a manner that}} has in the least degree weakened my objection, or lessened my apprehension of the extreme danger, that would in my opinion inevitably attend its admission". The reformers themselves could not agree on a specific reform programme, constitutional perfection would never be seen to have been reached so there would be endless reform, and that the present system was beneficial: [...] "Are we quite sure that the theoretic systems will be better for the purpose of good and free government, than the existing, undefined, indescribable mode of election, loose and various as it is?" [...] On 12 February 1821 Fitzwilliam wrote to Wood that reform was [...] "a dangerous experiment—certain destruction in the hands of vain and presumptuous fabricators of constitutions". On 17 February he again wrote to Wood: [...] "I feel the constitution is on the wane, its spirit being gone, it cannot last—whether despotism or anarchy will be the first upshot I know not, but if the constitution is not now maintained in its true spirit both will ensue".|$|E
2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E
5000|$|Folklore {{includes}} the single [...] "Força" [...] (meaning [...] "carry on" [...] or [...] "strength" [...] in Portuguese), {{which was written}} as the official anthem of the 2004 European Football Championship. Furtado performed the song at the championship's final in Lisbon, in July 2004. [...] Other singles included the ballad [...] "Try" [...] and [...] "Powerless (Say What You Want)", in which she embraces her Portuguese heritage; the song deals with [...] "the idea that <b>you</b> can <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> like a minority inside, even if you don't look like one on the outside". Additional singles were released in certain territories; [...] "Explode" [...] in Canada and Europe, and [...] "The Grass Is Green" [...] in Germany.|$|R
500|$|... "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics. In {{a review of}} the group's debut album Spice, Chuck Campbell of the Star-News said it is [...] "a slamming dance song". Daniel Incognito of Sputnikmusic said that with a [...] "dynamite chorus harmonising the girls voices, 'Who Do You Think <b>You</b> Are' <b>still</b> <b>feels</b> relevant today", he added that [...] "each girl excels in their solo-lines", and believed that Chisholm [...] "provides [...] delicious contrast with her loud and spirited lines". The Daily Mirror called the song [...] "a full-on disco number which would get to No. 1 even if it wasn't by Spice Girls and even if they weren't giving all the money to Comic Relief".|$|R
5000|$|Kish {{grew up in}} Florida {{where she}} began a fashion club {{at the high school}} she attended, reading Vogue and {{coordinating}} Goodwill garments according to outfits from multinational MySpace users. In speaking to Oyster, she further likened today's Instagram as a more curated iteration of it and reflected on the internet as a tool of identity formation: [...] "I feel like it's strange now, though, because there is more opportunity to find people similar to you and for <b>you</b> to <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> alone." [...] Graduating from the Fashion Institute of Technology in 2012, Kish began to pursue a musical career when her roommates set up a home studio. She released a series of EPs, Homeschool (2012), K+ (2013) and Across (2014).|$|R

5000|$|Angelo from BloodyGoodHorror.com {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review; stating {{in his review}} of the film, [...] "In a way, it inspires so much emotion on such a deep and raw level, it’s a moving and poignant film. However, the message it makes is not pretty. You will see the horrors that man is capable of in shockingly graphic detail. But if you’re like me, and wondering if you’ve been desensitized after years of horror flicks, it’ll show you whether <b>you</b> can <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> or not".Author and independent filmmaker John Kenneth Muir awarded the film {{two and a half}} out of a possible four stars, calling it [...] "an experimental, one-of-a-kind cinematic experience". In his review, Muir praised the film's originality and powerful imagery, while criticizing the running time as being too long.|$|R
500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] {{is central}} to the 2004 Michael Winterbottom film 9 Songs, being one of the nine songs {{mentioned}} in the title. The movie charts the relationship of main characters Matt and Lisa from their initial meeting to the pair splitting up. Footage of the two attending a series of nine concerts at Brixton Academy, where they initially meet, is interspersed with scenes of the actors performing unsimulated sex. Matt and Lisa are already growing apart when Matt attends a Super Furry Animals concert at the Academy alone. Giving Lisa's ticket away as she [...] "didn't want to go" [...] the character comments: [...] "5000 people in a room and <b>you</b> can <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> alone". The scene appears roughly forty minutes into the film and shows the band performing [...] "Slow Life" [...] live in its entirety as Matt looks on.|$|R

On disc two the musical explorations arrive.... two draws on nearly all elements of the Dead's range with never a dull moment to be found. It should also be pointed out that both discs sound amazing!

5000|$|The {{album is}} [...] "structured around Sundfør's {{acoustic}} guitar and her high, plangent voice." [...] Sundfør said: [...] "I {{was tired of}} technology, I wanted to feel like I was a musician again. But also, what I wanted to say needed something organic to convey it." [...] The album's subject matter {{has been described as}} dark, [...] "conflating a destructive personal relationship with environmental damage, heartbreak and climate change." [...] Sundfør said she was inspired by American poet Robert Bly's 1980 anthology News of the Universe. Regarding the title of the album, Sundfør said: [...] "Everybody's got issues. We are all insane. It's not a political album, and it's not therapy. It's music that you can listen to order to hear somebody else is thinking the things you are thinking. We are killing our planet.

[...] The song then starts to play, with Keys playing the piano in her apartment, and also scenes of her sitting on the couch, and looking out of the window at the sunset. Various objects around the apartment then start to disappear, including a photograph on the piano of her and her lover. The scene then changes once her surroundings have all eventually disappeared, showing Keys in a new outfit, {{in the middle of a}} desert-like setting, with her piano. She is then seen to walk up the path she is on, eventually leading to a mountain. Keys then climbs the mountain, and once she has reached the top, looks out at the landscape surrounding her.|$|R

He had heard a few voices in the hall, which, under fear of death, had expressed their dislike to the Fixed Period; but he had no idea of the love which the people felt for their own independence, or,--I believe I may say,--for their own president.
