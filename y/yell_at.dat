50|$|Kicking {{the cat is}} {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve stress. This behaviour can result in a chain reaction, where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses his or her subordinate, who takes it out on his or her own subordinate, and so on down the line. This domino effect can also be seen in family dynamics, where the father <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> the mother who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> the older child who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> the younger child who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> the pet.|$|R

Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E

25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a <b>yell.</b> <b>At</b> the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E

[...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Back from Vacation" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Spitzer, a staff writer who joined The Office in its third season. The episode was his first script for the series. Spitzer found Jan's final scene with Michael– in which he expects she will <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> him for their {{circulated}} picture but instead informs him they are staying together– especially tricky to write. Spitzer was unsure how to craft the scene, and eventually requested advice from the other series' writers. They decided that Jan would give a [...] "psychobabble" [...] response to Michael.

500|$|Further {{disputes}} arose {{over whether}} a corporate sponsor {{could be found}} to promote the film. Marketers of the Clearasil acne product liked the film, seeing it {{as a vehicle to}} reach a teen target audience. However, when they learned the film contained an abortion scene, they asked for that part of the plot to be cut. As Bergstein refused, the Clearasil promotion was dropped. Consequently, Vestron promoted the film themselves and set the premiere on August 16, 1987. The Vestron executives had planned to release the film in theaters for a weekend, and then send it to home video, since Vestron had been in the video distribution business before film production. Considering how many people disliked the film at that point, producer Gottlieb's recollection of her feelings at the time was, [...] "I would have only been grateful, if when it was released, people didn't <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> me." ...|$|E
