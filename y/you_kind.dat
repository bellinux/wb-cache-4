He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. <b>You</b> <b>kind</b> of have to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just have to find a couple of flat streets.|$|E

500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I really like that. I like that it's something <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of need to hear twice to catch everything.

Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film's concept, [...] "My immediate reaction was 'Holy crap, that's cool.' In the hands of somebody else, you might sit there and go, 'Well, this might be terrible,' but with del Toro doing it, <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of go, 'This {{is going to be}} amazing.'". Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, [...] "The most fun I have ever had in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying [...] "It was initially shocking.

It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity.

500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the backspace key on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one's life. Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters. Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of {{have to go back and}} look at your mistake." [...] Gossard said, [...] "There's some retrospective moods on this record, where Ed is looking at both his past and his future." [...] The album title Backspacer was also used for the name of a leatherback turtle that was sponsored by Pearl Jam for Conservation International and National Geographic's Great Turtle Race.|$|E

500|$|In {{his late}} teens and early twenties, Murphy worked towards {{a career as}} a rock musician, playing guitar in several bands {{alongside}} his brother Páidi. The Beatles-obsessed pair named their most successful band [...] "The Sons of Mr. Greengenes", after a 1969 song by another idol, Frank Zappa. Murphy sang and played guitar in the band, which he has said [...] "specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos". In 1996, The Sons of Mr. Greengenes were offered a five-album record deal by Acid Jazz Records, but they did not sign the contract due to Murphy's brother still being in secondary school and the little money involved in ceding the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label. Murphy confessed that [...] "I'm very glad in retrospect that we didn't sign because <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of sign away your life to a label and the whole of your music".|$|E
500|$|In the film's {{period as}} a {{developing}} project under several studios, {{different versions of}} the screenplay were drafted by numerous screenwriters, beginning with Steve Oedekerk. Other screenwriters involved included David Hayter, Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer, Jeffrey Boam, Thompson Evans, and Chris Hauty. When Universal and DreamWorks re-partnered in 2007, they [...] hired Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus. In 2009, Ostby and Fergus were replaced by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Damon Lindelof. Kurtzman and Orci analyzed American Western films including The Searchers. Orci said, [...] "The first draft was very kind of jokey and broad and then it went very serious. <b>You</b> <b>kind</b> of swing {{back and forth between the}} two extremes and the tone until you find the exact right point where a Western and a sci-fi movie can really shake hands without it seeming unnatural." [...] "Imagine you're watching Unforgiven and then Aliens land," [...] Orci explained.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam toured relentlessly {{in support}} of Ten. Ament stated that [...] "essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour," [...] adding, [...] "We told the record company, 'We know we {{can be a great}} band, so let's just get the {{opportunity}} to get out and play.'" [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics are}} about the birth of Madonna's {{daughter}} Lourdes, and the realization of motherhood. In {{an interview with the}} Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: [...] "There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and it is very much inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing {{that at the end of}} the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love. The birth of my daughter has been a huge influence. It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, and suddenly you have a whole new respect for life and <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'." [...] Based on the lyrical content, Bryan Lark from The Michigan Daily reviewed the parent album, and concluded that as the single [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was about confronting the past, [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] conversely is about [...] "moving onward." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, {{on moving}} the {{universe}} to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, [...] "I {{think there will be}} a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a [...] different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." [...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is really going to start to be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films." [...] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, [...] "it might be a new thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so difficult," [...] she murmured, [...] "so {{impossible}} to explain. Even {{to my own}} brother--if I had one--I could not tell everything, and you, although <b>you</b> are so <b>kind,</b> <b>you</b> are almost a stranger, aren't you?" ...|$|R

500|$|Gary Sanchez Productions' Adam McKay said in 2010, [...] "The idea is, they've {{grown up}} and they hunt witches. It’s a hybrid sort of old-timey feeling, yet there’s pump-action shotguns. Modern {{technology}} but in an old style. We heard it {{and we were just}} like, ‘That’s a freakin' franchise! You could make three of those!'" [...] Dante Harper was hired to rewrite the script, aimed for [...] "having a gory-but-funny Shaun of the Dead vibe." [...] McKay said inspirations included Sam Raimi's early horror comedy films like Army of Darkness but also [...] "John Carpenter's movies, which we all love [...] we're all hugely influenced by the first Matrix—obviously a really big one—also the Bourne Supremacy movies and the way Oliver Wood shot those. <b>You</b> <b>kind</b> of throw in all those, mix 'em up in a pot and that's what you get." [...] Wirkola also credited Quentin Tarantino for influencing him [...] "in many ways" [...] and singled out Peter Jackson's Braindead for having been [...] "a game-changer" [...] for him.|$|E
500|$|... "Empty Orchestra"—the name {{of which}} is a literal {{translation}} of the Japanese word karaoke—was written by Pemberton and Shearsmith, and was directed by Guillem Morales. It was originally intended as a wholly musical episode. The resulting episode, for Pemberton, was [...] "a kind of musical", in that [...] "there's music all the way through it". While he would be interested in doing [...] "a proper La La Land-style musical" [...] in the future, [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] serves to [...] " [...] that box to some degree". The idea of a love story, which is how Pemberton characterised [...] "Empty Orchestra", was also [...] "very appealing". Pemberton ultimately chose the episode as his favourite of the series, calling it very different to other episodes of Inside No. 9. At the series launch, speaking in reference to the previous episode [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx", Pemberton said that [...] "When you’ve cut someone's bum off and eaten it, <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of go, well, better try something different!" [...] One influence on the episode was Shane Meadows's This Is England; Pemberton drew inspiration from the way that characters' enjoyment of music events was portrayed in the film.|$|E
500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave <b>you</b> <b>kind</b> of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E
