'Tom always said, gentlemen, {{that that}} waiting-maid was the artfullest minx {{he had ever}} seen; and he left it in writing in this country {{when he went to}} colonize abroad, that he was certain in his own mind she and the Salamander had blown up the philosopher's stone on purpose, and to cut him out of his property. I believe Tom was in the right, gentlemen; but whether or no, she comes forward at this point, and says, [...] "May I speak, Sir?" [...] and the old gentleman answering, [...] "Yes, you may," [...] she {{goes on to say that}} [...] "the stars are no doubt quite right in every respect, but Tom is not the man." [...] And she says, [...] "Don't you remember, Sir, that when the clock struck five this afternoon, you gave Master Galileo a rap on the head with <b>your</b> <b>telescope,</b> and told him to get out of the way?" [...] "Yes, I do," [...] says the old gentleman. [...] "Then," [...] says the waiting- maid, [...] "I say he's the man, and the prophecy is fulfilled." [...] The old gentleman {{staggers}} at this, as if somebody had hit him a blow on the chest, and cries, [...] "He! why he's a boy!" [...] Upon that, gentlemen, the Salamander cries out that he'll be twenty-one next Lady-day; and complains that his father has always been so busy with the sun round which the earth revolves, that he has never taken any notice of the son that revolves round him; and that he hasn't had a new suit of clothes since he was fourteen; and that he wasn't even taken out of nankeen frocks and trousers till he was quite unpleasant in 'em; and touches on a good many more family matters to the same purpose. To make short of a long story, gentlemen, they all talk together, and cry together, and remind the old gentleman that as to the noble family, his own grandfather would have been lord mayor if he hadn't died at a dinner the year before; and they show him by all kinds of arguments that if the cousins are married, the prediction comes true every way. At last, the old gentleman being quite convinced, gives in; and joins their hands; and leaves his daughter to marry anybody she likes; and they are all well pleased; and the Gifted as well as any of them.|$|E
50|$|Orange County Astronomers (OCA) started life in 1967 when a {{small group}} of intrepid amateur astronomers got {{together}} to form a club. Those were the days when an amateur built his own telescope, usually a Newtonian reflector. It was a laborious process of grinding a mirror to as close to a 1/4 wave as you could get. Then you built the tube and assembly so you could actually search out a dark patch of sky to look up at the stars. It helped to know about stepping motors and who was building the best drives to keep <b>your</b> <b>telescope</b> tracking your object. And that was another thing - you had to get on intimate terms with the night skies for all seasons. That was a daunting task for many and proved to be a barrier to many but the most dedicated observer.|$|E

This book also discusses about choosing hardware and softwareYou love sky watching and are excited by what you see through <b>your</b> <b>telescope.</b> You want to keep a record of what you see. You want others to see it. These are all good reasons to put down your pencil and pad and get started cybersketching! What is cybersketching? It is using a small computer, such as a laptop or a PDA, to make a sketch of what you see through <b>your</b> <b>telescope</b> or even with your naked eye. Particularly good subjects are the Moon and the brighter planets, but even deep space has much to offer a cybersketcher. Why cybersketch? Sketching what you see is a fantastic way not only to record what you see but to share it with others. Before imaging, sketching was the only way people had of sharing their discoveries. With all the fancy new imaging devices around, sketching has become something of a lost art. But it shouldn’t be! Not only is it an inexpensive and quick way to record and share what you see. It also helps you to hone your observational skills. Using a computer gives you a variety of exciting and fun tools to use and ways to make your sketches almost professional, so you can show them off and display them. In this book, Peter Grego outlines the evolution of cybersketching, with a brief review of the history of computers, hardware and software, and how to use the tools that are now available to astronomy buffs. If you are not sketching because you think it is old-fashioned, or if you are sketching using only a pencil and paper, read this book and see why you are missing out on some terrific new technologies that are easy to use and affordable to nearly everyone. Become an astronomical cybersketcher, and you will find that the time you spend exploring the night sky is even more rewarding than you ever imagined...|$|E
40|$|Inexpensive webcams are revolutionizing imaging in amateur {{astronomy}} {{by providing}} an affordable alternative to cooled-chip astronomical CCD cameras, for photographing the brighter astronomical objects. Webcams – costing {{only a few}} tens of dollars – are capable of more advanced high resolution work than "normal" digital cameras because their rapid image download speed can freeze fine planetary details, even through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. Also, their simple construction {{makes it easy to}} remove the lens, allowing them to be used at high power at the projected focus of an astronomical telescope. Webcams also connect direct to a PC, so that software can be used to "stack" multiple images, providing a stunning increase in image quality. In the Lunar and Planetary Webcam User’s Guide Martin Mobberley de-mystifies the jargon of webcams and computer processing, and provides detailed hints and tips for imaging the Sun, Moon and planets with a webcam. He looks at each observing target separately, describing and explaining all specialised techniques in context.

So-called “go-to” telescopes are programmed with the locations of thousands of objects, including dazzling distant Suns, stunning neighboring galaxies, globular and open star clusters, the remnants of past supernovae, and many other breathtaking sights. This book does not tell you how to use your Go-to telescope. Your manual will help you do that. It tells you what to look for in the deep sky and why, and what equipment to best see it with. Organized broadly by what is best for viewing in the northern hemisphere in different seasons, Monks further divides the sights of each season into groupings such as “Showpiece Objects,” “Interesting Deep Sky Objects,” and “Obscure and Challenging Deep Sky Objects. ” He also tells what objects are visible even in light-polluted skies.

40|$|This book is for {{amateur astronomers}} of all expertise, from {{beginner}} to experienced. It {{is intended to}} be used at the telescope – small, medium, or large – or even by an observer using binoculars or the naked eye. It is organized by constellation and will enable practical observers to locate the approximate positions of important star clusters in the 88 constellations from literally anywhere on Earth.  In practice, GO-TO telescopes can usually locate clusters accurately enough, but this, of course, first requires that the observer knows what is visible in the sky at a given time and from a given location, so as to input a locatable object! This is where the book becomes an essential aid to finding star clusters to observe. Observers who do not have computer-controlled telescopes can of course use the traditional “star-hopping” method to find specific objects, starting from the given reference stars.  The constellation maps in this book are in black and white, {{so that they can be}} read by the light of a red LED observer’s reading light. The clusters and their names/numbers are printed in bold black, against a “grayed-out” background of stars and constellation figures.  Used as a self-contained reference, Observer’s Guide to Star Clusters offers detailed and up-to-date coverage of these beautiful objects.

40|$|Ultradeep {{occultation}} for planet hunting Webster Cash A {{technique for}} suppressing diffraction makes {{the use of}} external oc-culters in conjunction with separate satellite telescopes an attractive option {{in the search for}} extra-solar planets. As we learn more about the richness of planetary systems around other stars using indirect means, the desire for direct ob-servation grows. Ideally, astronomers should have instruments that can see exoplanets directly, and fully apply the techniquesof photometry, spectroscopy, imaging, and polarimetry to the anal-ysis of alien systems. Direct spectroscopy, in particular, has the potential to carry observations beyond mere mapping of physi-cal characteristics and into the search for extraterrestrial life. 1 The overwhelming problem that has impeded direct obser-vation of planets is the relative brightness of the central star. At 10 billion times the brightness of an Earth-like planet, stars simply swamp their planetary systems with stray light in-side the telescopes. The technology to suppress diffraction and scattered light inside the optics has been pursued in some depth recently, but has remained an expensive and risky ap-proach. Spitzer suggested an alternative in 1962, {{at the start of the}} space age. 2 He pointed out that by placing an occulter larger than <b>your</b> <b>telescope</b> on a separate spacecraft, you could artifi-cially eclipse the central star without suppressing light from the planets. Keeping the starlight out of the telescope largely by-passes the issues of telescope performance. But Spitzer also rec-ognized that diffraction around the edge of the occulter would limit such a system, concluding that onemight search for Jupiter-class planets. In 1985 Marchal revisited the concept and reached similar conclusions. 3 Recently, we have found that there is a practical way to suppress diffraction to a much higher level across small angles. 4, 5 To reveal Earth-like planets at 10 parsecs requires that starlight be suppressed by a factor of 1010 at 0. 1 arc-seconds of separation. It has now been shown that one can achieve very high levels of suppression in a mini-mal size shade at a minimal distance by creating an oc-Figure 1.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{only a handful of}} famous deep sky "catalogs," {{including}} Charles Messier’s, which was the first and remains the most famous. Messier was a comet hunter, and in the late 1700 s he published a list of 109 objects in the sky that were not comets. In December 1995, Sky & Telescope published a list of deep sky objects sent to them by British amateur astronomer extraordinare, Sir Patrick Moore (officially, Sir Patrick Caldwell-Moore). It was a huge hit! Sir Patrick may be the most prolific authors of astronomy books for all time and has been presenting the BBC Sky at Night television series since April 1957. Moore’s list contained 109 non-Messier objects that were Patrick’s favorites, many of them visible only in the southern hemisphere. Accompanying the list of objects were long exposure black and white and color photographs of some of these objects. In this book Martin Mobberley, who has known Sir Patrick Moore for many years, describes these objects and tells how to locate them. He discusses the best ways to visually observe them and image them. He also tells a little of Moore’s life and observing practices and how he made his choices for the "catalog.
