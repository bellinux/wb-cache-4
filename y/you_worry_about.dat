500|$|In the summer, Margaret {{collaborated with}} Thomas Karlsson and Mats Tärnfors on [...] "Start a Fire"—the {{official}} {{song of the}} 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship in Poland. She performed it at the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship Opening Ceremony in August {{in front of an}} audience of 62,000 in the National Stadium in Warsaw, before the Poland v. Serbia match broadcast in over 168 countries. [...] "Start a Fire" [...] was released as the second single from Margaret's debut studio album. Distributed only in Poland, it peaked at number ten. Around this time, the singer recorded a cover of Katarzyna Sobczyk's song [...] "O mnie się nie martw" [...] ("Don't <b>You</b> <b>Worry</b> <b>About</b> Me"), which was used as the theme song for the Polish TV series of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from her}} solo work, Margaret {{featured}} on the single [...] "Let It Snow!" [...] from Old School Yule! by Matt Dusk (2016). She also appeared on two charity albums, Siemacha po kolędzie (2014) and Gwiazdy po kolędzie (2015), and provided vocals for a non-album single [...] "6 in the Morning" [...] (2017) by the Swedish music group Vax. Margaret also released few non-album promotional singles, including [...] "O mnie się nie martw" [...] ("Don't <b>You</b> <b>Worry</b> <b>About</b> Me"; 2014), a theme song for the Polish TV series of the same name, [...] "Smak radości" [...] ("The Taste of Happiness"; 2015), and [...] "Coraz bliżej święta" [...] ("Christmas Is Getting Closer"; 2015). The last two songs were recorded {{as a part of}} the Polish Coca-Cola promotional campaign in which Margaret took part. [...] "Coraz bliżej święta" [...] peaked at number thirty-two in Poland.|$|E

500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had [...] "sent a message to everyone that music is free, and that's disturbing. It's easy {{to do that when}} you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really something that <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about,</b> but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away hundreds of millions of albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E

2500|$|Callaghan's {{advice to}} Bjelke-Petersen {{included}} the recommendation that he maintain his rambling style {{of communication with}} mangled syntax, recognising it added to his homespun appeal to ordinary people and also allowed him to avoid giving answers. His catchphrase response to unwelcome queries was, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> that", a phrase that {{was used as the}} title of his 1990 memoir. Wear wrote: [...] "His verbal stumbling communicated decent simplicity and trustworthiness and, in order to enhance his popular appeal, Bjelke-Petersen appears to have exaggerated, or at least not tried to rid himself of, his famous speaking style." ...|$|E
