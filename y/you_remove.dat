25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will <b>you</b> <b>remove?</b> The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

50|$|Ken Wilber {{comments}} {{that the test}} of holon hierarchy (holarchy) is that if all instances of a given type of holon cease to exist, then all the holons {{they were part of}} must cease to exist too. Thus an atom is of a lower standing in the hierarchy than a molecule, because if <b>you</b> <b>removed</b> all molecules, atoms could still exist, whereas if <b>you</b> <b>removed</b> all atoms, molecules, in a strict sense would cease to exist. Wilber's concept is known as the doctrine of the fundamental and the significant. A hydrogen atom is more fundamental than an ant, but an ant is more significant.|$|R

500|$|Nolan first {{pitched the}} film to Warner Bros. in 2001, but then felt that he needed more {{experience}} making large-scale films, and embarked on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. He soon realized that a film like Inception needed a large budget because [...] "as soon as you're talking about dreams, {{the potential of the}} human mind is infinite. And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite. It has to feel like you could go anywhere {{by the end of the}} film. And it has to work on a massive scale." [...] After making The Dark Knight, Nolan decided to make Inception and spent six months completing the script. Nolan states that the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream. [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>remove</b> the privacy, you've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the attraction of the plastic wrap to your hand after <b>you</b> <b>remove</b> it from a package to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and photocopier & laser printer operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge {{on the surface of}} objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when {{at least one of the}} surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. [...] This is because the charges that transfer are trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed. [...] These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with insulated surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|Sabyasachi Mukherjee [...] made a {{debut in}} jewelry line with Guzaarish. He had {{designed}} the line {{keeping in mind}} a multicultural element with a nomadic vibe. Omar Siddiqui played by Aditya Roy Kapoor was styled like a struggling French musician. Suhel Seth, who played Ethan's doctor, is presented in stiff suits and Shernaz Patel, Ethan's lawyer is given a look of a Gandhian in cotton saris and three-quarter blouses. The maids are in dumpy dresses. The costume designer says that [...] "..the clothes are nearly theatrical {{and they have a}} mind of their own. If <b>you</b> <b>remove</b> the characters and hang the clothes, they will tell a story. It's like Neverland or the reality version of The Magic Faraway Tree!". The entire look of Rai consisted of thirty-seven long frocks, four dumpy shoes, maxis, aprons with motifs of cutlery, quirky glasses and jewelry, surreal hairdos and red lips. For the collection, Sabyasachi used precious and semi-precious stones, minakari and filigree and had to work with about 60 skilled workers from West Bengal to complete the line. The price range of rings and earrings starts from Rs. 40,000 and navratan necklaces are priced at Rs. 510,000. On the look of Ethan Mascarenhas, Mukherjee said that the make up and costume was more organic. On a lighter note he added that he wanted his hero to look like Clark Kent and not James bond.|$|E
