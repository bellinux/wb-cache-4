500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did you ever want to be something <b>your</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life?</b> ...

500|$|In 2008, he portrayed Pontius Pilate in The Passion, a BBC/HBO {{adaptation}} of the {{last week in the}} life of Jesus. He had originally rejected the script due to other filming commitments, but accepted the role after his agent told him to re-read it before making a final decision. He was pleased to learn that the serial was being produced by Nigel Stafford-Clark, whose Bleak House adaptation he had enjoyed, and that he would be appearing with his Jekyll co-star Denis Lawson. Contrary to previous portrayals of Pilate, Nesbitt played the biblical figure as [...] "nice", and—as when playing Jack Parlabane—used his own accent. The serial was broadcast in the UK during Easter week 2008. Shortly after filming The Passion, he filmed the part of journalist Max Raban in the Carnival Films thriller Midnight Man, which was shown on ITV in May 2008. It won him a joint nomination (along with the 2007 series of Murphy's Law) for the ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for Best Actor. At the end of the year, he had a starring role in the low-budget independent film Blessed. The writer and director Mark Aldridge scripted the character of Peter with Nesbitt in mind to play him. The film had a limited release throughout 2008 and 2009 before the BBC screened it on television in 2010. Nesbitt said, [...] "The role of Peter is what I have dreamed about playing, you wait <b>your</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> for an opportunity like this and when it comes you have to grab it." ...|$|E

500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call.

In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for <b>your</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life,</b> and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time."
