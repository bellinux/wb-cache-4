Mechanical properties (including stress relaxation and frictional behaviour) <b>of</b> acetate multifilament <b>yarns</b> as well as physical-chemical properties of acetate fibre substance are investigated.

It was observed that molecular weight of different fractions decreases from highest fraction to lowest fraction. The size or <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> particles was obtained by dissymmetry method.

5000|$|The other {{process of}} {{degradation}} is photodegradation, {{which is when}} a molecular bond is broken by the absorption of photon radiation (i.e. light). Due to <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> carbonyl groups, the molecule naturally absorbs light at 260 nm, but it contains some impurities which can absorb light. These impurities are known to absorb light in the far UV light region (< 280 nm). [...] The atmosphere filters radiation {{from the sun and}} allows radiation of > 300 nm only to reach the surface. Thus, the primary photodegradation <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> is considered insignificant to the total degradation process, since <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> and its impurities absorb light at shorter wavelengths.

The secondary mechanisms would be the addition of a compound to the filters that would be able to absorb natural light and use it to start the degradation process. The main two areas of research are in photocatalytic oxidation and photosensitized degradation. Photocatalytic oxidation uses a species that absorbs radiation and creates hydroxyl radicals that react with the filters and start the breakdown. Photosensitized degradation, though, uses a species that absorbs radiation and transfers the energy to the <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> to start the degradation process. Both processes use other species that absorbed light > 300 nm to start the degradation <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate.</b>|$|R
