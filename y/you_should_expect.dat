500|$|Like {{most major}} {{infrastructure}} work in Hawaii, {{construction of the}} rail line is likely to uncover historic human remains, notably in its downtown Honolulu section. The Oahu Island Burial Council (part of the State Historic Preservation Division, within the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources) refused to sign a programmatic agreement on October 21, 2009, over concerns about likely [...] burial sites located along the line's proposed route over Halekauwila Street in Kakaako. [...] Three construction projects in the area since 2002 have each encountered unforeseen human remains that led to delays, and archaeologist Thomas Dye stated, [...] "The council is absolutely right that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> to find burials on Halekauwila Street".|$|E

60|$|DOLPHIN. You didn't {{think much}} of my {{well-being}} when you interfered between Miss Toomis and me, did you? You've probably ruined my whole life, that's all. I really don't see why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> me to have any pity for you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eames," [...] said Sir Raffle, [...] "that must be nonsense;--that must be nonsense. There can be {{no reason}} why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> always <b>expect</b> to have your own way in everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Then I don’t see why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>expected</b> me to {{resemble}} him,” said Tony plaintively. “As everybody knows I {{should never have}} done such a thing! Will {{you tell us about}} the engagement?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--and it is {{impossible}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be <b>expected</b> to see it. I don't quite {{know how to talk}} about it even to you, though I think you are about the softest-hearted fellow out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "I don't think I could. If she {{had been}} rigged that way she would {{probably}} have gone under by now. Still, I don't see why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> me {{to know anything about}} English boats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was natural}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> me, mademoiselle. I was sorry {{afterwards}} that I {{did not tell}} you when I left you that I should {{not be able to}} come in the evening, but indeed I did not think of it at the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{not done}} for my sake. Do not repeat that falsehood. The old {{thoughts}} will never come back, Harry. They are dead and gone. I have ceased to respect you or myself. Love cannot survive the loss of self-respect. Who am I that I should give love to anybody? Who are you that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> love?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Barbara {{smiled a}} little, though {{she looked at}} him steadily. [...] "You," [...] she said, [...] "will, I think, go a long way. In fact, if it was a sword I gave <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> it of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me {{to oblige}} you by hearing {{you play the}} flute, any more than I <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to oblige me by not playing it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your lordship {{may choose}} what penance you please," [...] said Ravenswood; [...] "but I assure <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> my old servant to hang himself, or throw {{himself from the}} battlements, should your lordship visit him so unexpectedly. I do assure you, we are totally and {{literally}} unprovided." ...|$|R
6000|$|When he stopped, Nellie Austerly {{looked up}} with a little nod. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "you took those miners in as you had promised, {{in spite of the}} fog, and you brought the Shasta down all that way with only a few tons of coal. Still, I don't think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> any {{particular}} commendation. There are men who can't help doing things of that kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> {{payment for}} it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden {{believes}} there is some mystery in Hamlet but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. It will {{come as a surprise}} to his grace. But he believes his theory.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{a certain}} extent," [...] Mr. Dunster admitted. [...] "Where I am {{still in the}} dark, however, is why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> that I should become your confederate. It is true that by holding me up and obstructing my message, you may bring about the evil you seek, but unless that word is cabled back to New York, and my senders believe that my message has been delivered, {{there can be no}} certainty. What has been trusted to me as the safest means of transmission, might, in an emergency, be {{committed}} to a cable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly! Kirsteen's a {{woman of}} great character; revolutionary by temperament. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> her to act as you would act yourselves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt he}} thinks you have been wrong. By liberality you mean sympathy. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> him to sympathise with your wrong-doing?" ...|$|R

Ethics and Leadership courses are {{designed}} to equip you with skills that are necessary for making ethical decisions in your adult and professional life. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> therefore <b>expect</b> {{a substantial portion of}} your grade to come from assignments involving ethical issues and the process of applying ethical reasoning to real-life situations...|$|R
60|$|And now I {{have kept}} the biggest news to the last. Mother has been to Madame, and she says that if she works all night, she will have {{everything}} ready for the 30th. O Frank, does it not seem incredible! Next Tuesday three weeks. And the banns! Oh my goodness, I am frightened when I think about it! Dear old boy, you won't tire of me, will you? Whatever should I do if I thought you had tired of me! And {{the worst of it}} is, that you don't know me a bit. I have a hundred thousand faults, and you arc blinded by your love and cannot see them. But then some day the scales will fall from your eyes, and you will perceive the whole hundred thousand at once. Oh, what a reaction there will be! You will see me as I am, frivolous, wilful, idle, petulant, and altogether horrid. But I do love you, Frank, with all my heart, and soul, and mind, and strength, and you'll count that on the other side, won't you? Now I am so glad I have said all this, because it is best that you should know what <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect.</b> It will be nice for you to look back and to say, 'She gave me fair warning, and she is no worse than she said.' O Frank, think of the 30th.|$|E

5000|$|Dealer or Retail Price is {{the price}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> to pay if buying from a {{licensed}} new-car or used-car dealer — retail price.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is not the}} {{slightest}} reason why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not," [...] he answered. [...] "We have seventeen hundred on the books, but we could always do with more, especially now we are opening so many more branches. But, <b>you</b> know, we <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to come sometimes, and how would Lady Caroom like that?" [...] She laughed.|$|R
50|$|Signs {{that you}} have an {{infestation}} is spotting their pellets and skin. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> also <b>expect</b> to see the adult beetles and their larvae. Adult guernsey carpet beetles have patches of brown, white, and black. They move slowly and if you touch them they will roll over. Identify the source of the infestations by looking where there is more beetles, skins, and feces.|$|R
6000|$|AUGUSTUS. I {{addressed}} a meeting here last night--went {{straight to the}} platform from the train. I wrote to <b>you</b> that I <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to be present and report yourself. Why did you not do so? ...|$|R
50|$|Computer {{performance}} {{increases as}} {{the square of}} the cost. If computer A costs twice as much as computer B, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> computer A to be four times as fast as computer B.|$|E
5000|$|Dealer Trade-in Price or {{wholesale}} price {{is the price}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> to receive from a dealer if you trade in a car. This is also the price that a dealer will typically pay for a car at a dealer wholesale auction.|$|E
5000|$|Private-Party Price is {{the price}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> to pay if you were buying from an individual. A private-party seller is hoping to get more money than they would with a {{trade-in}} to a dealer. A private-party buyer is hoping to pay less than the dealer retail price.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are indeed}} {{old enough to}} judge for yourself," [...] said Mrs Leather, {{resuming}} her knitting, [...] "and I don't wish to turn you from your plans. On the contrary, I will pray that God's blessing and protection may accompany you wherever you go, but <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>expect</b> me to be instantaneously jubilant over an arrangement which will take you away from me, for years perhaps." ...|$|R
6000|$|ACIS. You {{mean that}} I wont {{play the game}} of make-believe. Well, I don't ask you to play it with me; so why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to play it with you? ...|$|R

5000|$|Game Revolution {{gave the}} game a B+ and said [...] "While not {{innovative}} in any way, AOM: The Titans is everything <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> from a quality expansion."

5000|$|On 2 November 2015, Prime Minister Turnbull stated: [...] "I {{would say}} around September-October 2016 is when <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> the next {{election}} to be." [...] However, in December 2015, ABC News reported that some [...] "senior Liberal MPs" [...] had been seeking an election as early as March 2016. An election held at this time would have required a separate half-Senate election {{to be held in}} late 2016 or early 2017.|$|E
50|$|Kaufmann (2010) {{explained}} {{the significance of}} Marks' study as follows. If increasing literacy were really explaining a number of seemingly different IQ trends, then {{you would expect to}} see a few different phenomena. First, within a population <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> increased education of literacy skills to be associated with an increase in the average IQ of that population. Second, IQ gains should be most pronounced in {{the lower half of the}} IQ bell curve since this is the section of the population that prior to the education would have obtained relatively lower scores due to their inability to comprehend the intelligence test's instructions. With increased literacy, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> to see a change in the skewness of the IQ distribution from positive to negative as a result of higher rates of literacy in the lower half of the IQ distribution (but very little change in the top half of the distribution). You should also expect to see differences on the particular intelligence test subscales, with increased literacy showing the strongest effects on verbal tests of intelligence and minimal differences on other tests of intelligence. If all these predictions hold up, there would be support for the notion that secular IQ gains and race differences are not different phenomena but have a common origin in literacy.|$|E

5000|$|As Tufts's humor magazine, The Zamboni has {{sometimes}} sparked controversy with its articles. During one 2005 issue, an article was run that gave {{a list of}} how-tos to get kicked out of clubs on campus. One joke said that to get kicked out of SSARA (a sexual assault counseling group) one should say, [...] "With an outfit like that, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>expected</b> it," [...] to which some students took offense. The Zamboni responded to the controversy in the following week's Tufts Daily opinion section.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I!" [...] the King answered. [...] "Yet I {{know your}} terms {{as they were}} {{proposed}} to Nicholas of Reist, and it amazes me only that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>expected</b> men in whose hands remain the destinies of their country to give you even a patient hearing. My Councillors, give this man the answer his insolent mission deserves, and let him be shown across the frontier. We will before long show Europe {{how we deal with}} our enemies. The Turks are not yet at the gates of the city." ...|$|R
