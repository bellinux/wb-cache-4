6000|$|... "And {{your love}} {{was a great}} love; there was none greater," [...] she continued; [...] "or so <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rose garden. Yet it is not fine enough, large enough, to forgive me here, crying now at your feet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{think of}} making excuses!" [...] she rejoined, giving three-fourths of her {{attention}} to the flowers, and one-fourth to me. [...] "It's a pity you took the trouble of coming here. I quite agree with what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden. Considering the object I had in view at Browndown, I could not possibly expect you to accompany me. True! quite true!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try us and see," [...] said Tom. Then {{he raised}} his voice. [...] "Harris, bring up that brace of pistols <b>you</b> <b>said</b> were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> locker." ...|$|R

Two years later, the duo moved to Philadelphia and released a second EP titled <b>The</b> Words <b>You</b> <b>Said.</b> <b>In</b> 2017, <b>The</b> Dove & The Wolf signed to Fat Possum Records and released their third EP titled I Don't Know What To Feel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Part of what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} words: `Mark what I say. I {{will sell}} this knoll to your father, and give {{my daughter to}} you, when you take that house, and with your own unaided hands {{place it on the}} top of this knoll!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Elizabeth {{was again}} deep in thought, {{and after a}} time exclaimed, [...] "To treat {{in such a manner}} the godson, the friend, the {{favourite}} of his father!" [...] She could have added, [...] "A young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with, [...] "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closest manner!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will talk}} {{more of these}} things," [...] said Bardo, eagerly. [...] "You must recall everything, to the minutest trace left in your memory. You will win the {{gratitude}} of after-times by leaving {{a record of the}} aspect Greece bore while yet the barbarians had not swept away every trace of the structures that Pausanias and Pliny described: you will take those great writers as your models; and such contribution of criticism and suggestion as my riper mind can supply shall not be wanting to you. There will be much to tell; for you have travelled, <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnesus?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I have {{to inform}} you that, at Sir Sidney Smith's request, which I have no doubt will be {{complied}} with, you will be appointed, {{by the president of}} the prize court, agent for the sale of what Eastern goods there are on board her. The cargo is made up of European goods, dried fruits, and Eastern goods. They are what we captured from the pirates, and Sir Sidney Smith suggested that it would be as well to intrust to one who knew the value of the Eastern goods the work of selling them privately, instead of putting them up to auction, and he requested that the agency should be given to you. Wilkinson, who has come home with me, is going to see the president of the prize court this morning, and he is to come up here afterwards. Of course Sir Sidney did it chiefly to oblige me, but he thought that the goods would really fetch more if sold in that way. He said, of course, that you would get a commission on the sale, and as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last letter that I received that you were getting very sick of having nothing to do, I thought you might like the job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, it's all right, uncle, when we're {{going to}} be married so soon," [...] said Gideon. [...] "You know <b>you</b> <b>said</b> so {{yourself}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> houseboat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} to meet Mary now, you see, and if {{you were to}} say to her, come--come and we'll jump down Etna together, and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proper voice and with the proper force, she'd do it, Stratton. You know that. Any man knows a thing like that. And she wouldn't want to do it...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I told Ana aught {{that he did}} not know? Did not Ana {{hear the}} last words <b>you</b> <b>said</b> to me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temple of Amon at Tanis?" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ears of your son.|$|E
5000|$|Refrain: It wasn't God {{who made}} honky tonk angels As <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> words of your song. Too many times married men think they're still single And that's caused many {{a good girl}} to go wrong.|$|E
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Boston debate, Governor, on {{this issue}} of nation building, that the United States {{military}} is overextended now. Where is it overextended? Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you become president? ...|$|E
6000|$|The Baroness smiled maliciously. [...] "I {{may have}} occasion," [...] she answered, [...] "to {{remind you of}} what <b>you</b> have just <b>said.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{meanwhile}} the Princess's secret {{is in danger of}} discovery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{was not so}} bound before what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> to me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{shrubbery}} last night? Remember, John, it was {{but last}} night. Have I had a moment to speak to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] cried Josephine, {{pressing}} her hands across her shuddering eyes. Then, uncovering her white and set face, she said rapidly, [...] "Saddle my horse {{and your own}} at once. Then take your choice! Come with me and repeat all that <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of that man, or leave this ranch forever. For if I live I shall go to him tonight, and tell the whole story." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{would like}} {{to send a message}} to my dad. I saw what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newspapers. You say you want to kill me; to shed my blood in public. But I love you so much because you are my dad and because Jesus taught me to love. I {{accepted}} Jesus Christ willingly and nobody forced me. I forgive you. No matter what decision you make. No matter what you do. To my dad and mom, I say Jesus Christ died to save me." ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 1976, the {{bitterness}} of their divorce behind them, the couple reunited for one last try with The Sonny and Cher Show. This incarnation of the series was produced by veteran musical variety-show writers, Frank Peppiatt and John Aylesworth. It was basically {{the same as their}} first variety series but with different writers to create new sketches and songs. The duo's opening conversations were markedly more subdued and made humbled references to the couple's divorce, as well as Cher's subsequent marriage to Gregg Allman (during production Cher was pregnant with and eventually bore Allman's son, Elijah). Some jokes would get awkward; in one opening segment Cher gave Sonny a compliment, and Sonny jokingly replied [...] "That's not what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courtroom!") Despite these complications, the revived series garnered enough ratings to be renewed for a second season, finally ending its run in 1977. By this time, the variety show genre was already in steep decline, and Sonny and Cher {{was one of the few}} successful programs of the genre remaining on the air at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Hill later reflected:What made it {{a success}} with young people... {{is that for the}} first time {{somebody}} made a film within Hollywood, big distribution, that took the gang situation and did not present it as a social problem. Presented them as a neutral or positive aspect of their lives. As soon as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old days gang movies it was how do we cure the pestilence and how do we fix the social waste. We want to take these kids, make sure they go to college... This was just a movie that conceptually was different. Accepted the idea of the gang, didn't question it, that was their lives, they functioned within that context. And the social problem wasn't were they going to college, but were they going to survive. It's the great Hawksian dictum, where is the drama? Will he live or die? That's the drama."Hollywood forgives a lot when you have a hit," [...] he added. [...] "I don't know what to say about it, other than the fact that it was just a gift in terms of getting it. The studio hated it, and didn't even want to release it. There was a lot of friction with management at the time. Some of it might have been my fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so are you," [...] Julia {{retorted}} swiftly. [...] "What was it <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> Chicago about <b>the</b> phrase-makers?--the Socialism that flourished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study {{while women}} and children starved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets? Those are the sort {{of things that we}} remember, Aaron and I." ...|$|R
5000|$|Proving {{you were}} who <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> court system {{was also a}} {{challenge}} for Saudi women, since {{not only did they}} not have access to ID cards but also passports or drivers licenses. Women had to produce two male relations to confirm their identity. If a man denied that <b>the</b> woman <b>in</b> court was his mother or sister, [...] "the man's word would normally be taken", making a woman vulnerable to things like false claims to her property and violation of her rights to inheritance if she fell out of favor with her family.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is perhaps}} very foolish {{of me to}} come here," [...] she said, [...] "but I have never quite {{forgotten}} what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> to me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tea-room. It was probably nonsense. If so, please tell me, and let me go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wrote <b>the</b> entry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cellar-book myself, sir, if <b>you</b> please,' <b>said</b> David, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tone of a man, quite {{confident}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{strength of}} his facts. 'Mr Linkinwater had only been here twenty year, sir, when that pipe of double-diamond was laid down.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>said</b> I was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right," [...] replied De Vaux to his sovereign, [...] "I will {{be treated}} as one should be who hath {{been found to be}} right--that is, I will have my own will. I leave you not with this false Scot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll tell <b>you</b> what,' <b>said</b> Ethelberta <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prompt and broadly-awake tone {{of one who}} {{had been}} {{concentrated}} on the expectation of that sound for a length of time, 'it was a mistake in me to do this! Joey will be sure to make a muddle of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are <b>you</b> mad?' he <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same {{deep tone}} which had before thrilled on my ear, 'or are you weary of your life? You will be {{presently}} amongst the quicksands.' I professed my {{ignorance of the}} way, to which he only replied, 'There {{is no time for}} prating--get up behind me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then if you {{borrow a}} fresh sum {{in order to}} take up this farm, you will owe about thirty {{thousand}} pounds, and if you give five per cent., as I suppose you do, you will have to pay fifteen hundred a year in interest. Now, father, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> good times <b>the</b> land brought <b>in</b> two thousand a year, so, of course, it can't bring in so much now. Therefore, by the time that you have paid the interest, there will be nothing, or less than nothing, left for us to live on." ...|$|R
60|$|The song {{had stopped}} as {{suddenly}} as it began--broken off, <b>you</b> would have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a note, as though someone had laid his hand upon the singer's mouth. Coming through the clear, sunny atmosphere among the green tree-tops, I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly; and the effect on my companions was the stranger.|$|R
5000|$|Several years later, Holtz {{had a big}} hit on Broadway in 1931 when {{he hired}} his pianist to write a show for him. The pianist, Harold Arlen, {{would go on to}} write the music for The Wizard of Oz in 1939. Holtz {{produced}} <b>You</b> <b>Said</b> It. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, Holtz became the highest paid entertainer on Broadway, [...] with articles touting his salary as an unheard of $6,000 per week. Unfortunately for Holtz, all of that money was invested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stock market. He later told friends that {{he came out of the}} 1929 crash with $500, while he had been worth more than a million dollars the year before.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you here," [...] {{continued}} Sindbad. [...] "And I {{will answer}} {{for the rest of the}} company that they are equally pleased, but I wish you to tell me what it was that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> just now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street." [...] For Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast began, had heard his complaint and therefore had sent for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Compose yourself, Mr. Noel," [...] she said, gently. [...] "You have {{no cause}} to be alarmed at seeing me. Your servant, when I inquired, <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden, and I {{came here to}} find you. I have traced you out, sir, with no resentment against yourself, with no wish to {{distress}} you by {{so much as the}} shadow of a reproach. I come here on what has been, and is still, the business of my life--your service." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{columnist}} wrote <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Plain Dealer on July 8: [...] "Cleveland's man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{street is}} the right sort of American, as was evidenced right solidly once more by {{the response to the}} question: 'How does the signing of Larry Doby by the Indians strike <b>you?</b> <b>Said</b> <b>the</b> man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street: Can he hit?... That's all that counts." [...] Conversely, Doby was criticized from players both active and retired. Noted former player Rogers Hornsby said, after watching Doby play one time in 1947: ...|$|R
5000|$|R. Lordkipanidze writes, that [...] "The great {{force of}} Faith is even <b>in</b> {{material}} Economy... <b>The</b> main miracle of mankind is the God's blessed material fire, which {{given to us}} without material costs always exactly {{at the same time}} of the Great Resurrection of Christ.

50|$|He was {{considered}} {{an example of a}} righteous man who is not suspected of any sin. Once when Abba Arika was walking with his pupil Judah ben Ezekiel, he told his student: Let's move away from that woman walking in front of us, so we will not be punished in hell. Then his pupil protested: But <b>you</b> yourself <b>said</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of respectable people it is well? and his Rabbi replied: And who says that the intention is to us, that is to mean to a person such as Hanina Bar Papi.|$|R
