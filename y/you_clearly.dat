500|$|On {{her first}} {{televised}} performance of [...] "White Horse", on November 23, 2008, at the 2008 American Music Awards, Swift donned a white evening gown {{as she sat}} on floral-patterned couch. While promoting the song, she later performed it at the Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's [...] "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and on Dancing with the Stars. Swift performed [...] "White Horse" [...] on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, {{standing at the edge}} of the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang [...] "White Horse" [...] in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists in the air to yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. <b>You</b> <b>clearly</b> love him more than he loves you, and you know it. And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} [...] "after an underwhelming pre-credits sequence... this sucker moved, {{and lots of}} things happened. [...] We met our four new regulars, {{squeezed}} in useful flashbacks about [...] and even found out the real reason they're on the island ... The flipside of all this business is that 'Confirmed Dead' didn't have the same emotional resonance as ' Beginning of the End'... but <b>you</b> <b>clearly</b> can't have everything in every episode." [...] Times James Poniewozik said that [...] "What amazed [...] about this episode was the economy and precision with which it introduced... {{the crew of the}} downed chopper from [...] [...] Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet {{by the end of the}} episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed. [...] They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline. [...] E!'s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed [...] "hot damn!" [...] in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench. [...] She also thought that [...] "Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious" [...] and it was [...] "awesome to see [...] again". [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted [...] "watching Dan's landing from his point of view. [...] You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, looks up at his parachute, looks down to see himself about to hit the trees... it was amazing." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] an 8/10, writing that it [...] "isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters" [...] and praising the new actors by writing that [...] "Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. [...] Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] "Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like watching my dream episode of Lost [...] people asked direct questions for once... this episode was all about the Freighties." [...] A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that [...] " [...] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been". In contrast, TV Guides Michael Ausiello of [...] said that it [...] "was thirty-one flavors of awesome... the negatives outweighed the positives". [...] He had problems with Claire's lack of grief for Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk's main objective. [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] three out of five stars, calling it [...] "so-so", but commenting that [...] "the new revelations in the episode are fairly startling and provide a momentary distraction from the frustrations." ...|$|E
