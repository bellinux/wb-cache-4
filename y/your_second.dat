500|$|The duo hired {{choreographer}} Agnes de Mille to direct—a move {{between two}} theatre functions which was unusual at the time. [...] De Mille {{had been the}} choreographer for the dances in Oklahoma! and Carousel, designing ballets which disclosed the characters' psychological states to the audience. [...] She had been concerned about the cohesion of the script as she received it from Hammerstein. [...] When {{a few days before}} rehearsals began, she asked Hammerstein what the show was about, the lyricist replied, [...] "It's about a man not being allowed to do his own work because of worldly pressures." [...] De Mille answered, [...] "That's not the play you've written. [...] You haven't written <b>your</b> <b>second</b> act." [...] Hammerstein replied, [...] "But we're already committed to the theatre in New York." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{work was}} premiered by the Vienna Philharmonic on December 4, 1898, {{conducted}} by Gustav Mahler, {{a friend and}} supporter of Dvořák. Mahler wrote to Dvořák before the premiere, [...] "I have just received <b>your</b> <b>second</b> work 'The Hero's Song' and, as with , am quite enchanted with it." [...] Dvořák {{was present at the}} premier and had planned to conduct it himself with the Berlin Philharmonic on November 14, 1899, but cancelled his plans due to a sudden nervous breakdownin Dvořák's words, [...] "I was so indisposed that I had to leave Berlin with my wife without even seeing Simrock." [...] The piece had been performed the previous day, conducted by Arthur Nikisch. It was also performed in London, Hamburg, Boston and Leipzig in October and November 1899. Dvořák was finally able to personally conduct the piece in Budapest in December of that year.|$|E

2500|$|However, both Benko and Webb {{advocate}} what Webb {{calls the}} [...] "barrage technique": analyze a forced sequence of moves, then play them quickly. Webb explains, [...] "For example, {{if you have}} an obvious exchange of pieces available, don't play it immediately, but first decide on your next move, and then play them both at once. ... The aim is to catch your opponent with a move he hasn't considered. He will probably have considered most sensible moves in the position on the board, but since he doesn't know what your first move is going to be, he can't prepare replies to <b>your</b> <b>second</b> or third moves. The effect of an unexpected second move bashed out instantaneously can be shattering, even if it isn't particularly good." [...] (Both Benko and Webb emphasize that a player who has a winning position should not play quickly in his opponent's time pressure. Likewise, GM Luděk Pachman remarks, [...] "It is best to continue with one's sound strategic plan, and if one has the better position, it is completely illogical to fish in the murky waters of the opponent's time trouble.") ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, it was {{reported}} that Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions had bought the rights to the film under the Stage 6 Films banner, with Michael London and his company Groundswell Productions producing the feature. The film was originally picked up by New Line Cinema in November 2011, but the script was shopped elsewhere when production did not get off the ground. The screenplay was written by Joshua John Miller and M.A. Fortin, and was directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson. Miller's father, Jason Miller, was an actor and writer who appeared as Father Karras in The Exorcist. The script for The Final Girls was in part inspired by The Exorcist, with Miller pointing out, [...] "I grew up watching my dad in The Exorcist, and there's something haunting, strange, confusing, and a little bit unnatural to see your parent constantly die in a film. But it's something that also becomes iconic, and we tried to deconstruct what the effects of that would be, as well as {{what it would be like}} if you had a second chance, but <b>your</b> <b>second</b> chance was inside of a movie?" [...] Miller and Fortin also served as executive producers, alongside Darren M. Demetre.|$|E

That’s very poised, very composed." [...] The USA won the game 103–56. In the next game, the USA faced Mali. Although Mali held a very early 3–2 lead after the first minute, the game result was never in doubt, as the USA team scored 23 consecutive points and led 30–5 early. The team would go on win 103–26.
