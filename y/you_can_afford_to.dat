500|$|Commander (originally {{known as}} Elder Dragon Highlander or EDH) is a casual format, {{but can be}} played competitively. In this format each player {{constructs}} a 100 singleton deck that has a legendary creature {{that acts as a}} commander. The deck construction is limited to the colors that are represented by the chosen commander and there cannot be two or more cards with the same name with the exception of basic lands. The legendary creature chosen as commander is kept in a special [...] "command zone" [...] and may be cast at any time <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> cast the creature. If the commander card would enter any zone other than the battlefield from anywhere, its owner has the choice to return that card to the [...] "command zone", where it can be cast again for an additional two generic mana to its regular cost.

State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery. The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly what was single-sourced to the informant known as Curveball. Powell later recounted how Vice President Dick Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, [...] "You've got high poll ratings; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> lose a few points." [...] Powell's longtime aide-de-camp and Chief of Staff from 1989–2003, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to [...] "go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two.
