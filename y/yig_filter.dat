40|$|A novel {{technique}} for effecting phase shift of X-band signals {{has been developed}} and analyzed for use with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) of signals in a phased array application, {{and the impact of}} this phase shifter on error vector magnitude (EVM) has been quantified. A commercially available filter consisting of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres was characterized by means of a network analyzer. The gain and phase response was measured across a 25 MHz frequency band centered at 10 GHz, while the filter was tuned in frequency steps such that a 360 ° range of phase shifts was achieved. The S-parameters from these measurements were integrated with Matlab representations of QAM- 16 modulation, demodulation, and phased array antennas to model a complete radio system. The EVM caused by non-ideal gain and phase response of the <b>YIG</b> <b>filter</b> was determined for various beam angles and data patterns. It was found that a <b>YIG</b> <b>filter</b> does provide stable phase shift suitable for phased array applications, with acceptable attenuation so long as the frequency being transmitted remains within the filter 2 ̆ 7 s pass band. The particular filter analyzed did not contain sufficient stages to maintain 3 dB flatness across the required 360 ° tuning range, but performed satisfactorily for a limited range of beam orientation. The capability to provide continuously variable phase shift offered by the <b>YIG</b> <b>filter</b> was found to not offer significant advantage over the discrete steps produced by switched delay lines...|$|E

40|$|The frequency-multiplier {{submillimeter}} spectrometer (FMSS) is {{a laboratory}} apparatus for far-infrared molecular spectroscopy, embodying several advances over prior such apparatuses. The most innovative {{part of the}} FMSS {{is a source of}} monochromatic submillimeter- wavelength radiation that can be tuned over a wide frequency range, as needed for trace gas analyses and molecular- structure studies for which such apparatuses are typically used. The radiation source features a modular design and is built mostly from commercially available components. It includes a computer-controlled radio-frequency synthesizer, amplifiers, and frequency multipliers of a type heretofore used in local oscillators for heterodyne far-infrared receivers. In conjunction {{with the rest of the}} apparatus, this source makes it possible to perform measurements over large portions of the submillimeter-wavelength spectrum with resolution, accuracy, and sensitivity greater than those achievable in Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. In comparison with prior laboratory submillimeter- wavelength radiation sources, this source is much lighter in weight, less cumbersome, less power-hungry, and capable of sustained operation with less intervention by laboratory personnel. Also, unlike some prior submillimeter-wavelength sources, this source does not require a high-voltage power source. As shown in more detail in the figure, the radiation source includes a sweep frequency synthesizer connected to an external waveform generator, the output of which is used as a reference signal. The synthesizer is computer-controlled through a standard general-purpose interface bus (GPIB) and is operated in phase-locked continuous- wave mode for all measurements. The synthesizer output ranges in frequency from 11 to 18 GHz.

40|$|We have {{undertaken}} {{a comprehensive program}} directed at developing and perfecting a novel class of microwave yttrium iron garnet (<b>YIG)</b> <b>filters</b> based upon our recent observations (in the Microwave and Quantum Mechanics Group of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) of extremely sharp localized resonance in single crystals biased with spatially nonuniform fields. Such magnetically tunable filters would employ photolithographically derived planar microwave circuit elements for coupling energy {{into and out of}} the crystal, and it appears that multipole filters can be integrated within the same crystal to provide economy of scale and hence preclude costly time-consuming hand-alignment procedures. Magnetic resonance is normally very much broadened if a ferrimagnetic sample is immersed in a spatially nonuniform field, and experimentalists measuring fundamental resonance parameters take great pains to employ ellipsoidal sample shapes (usually small spheres) that are positioned in fields of very high uniformity.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} is {{presented}} a useful and economic measuring principle with which radar spurious emissions can be investigated {{under field conditions}} without disturbing {{the function of the}} radar in any way. The method presented here consists of two parts: In the time-domain parameter study is presented, how the radar antenna rotation produces radar pulses to the measuring receiver. Also is presented, how receiver parameters are defined by availability and use of radar pulses in the measurement. In the frequency spectrum measurement part a new sweep measurement system is presented. In this measurement the <b>YIG</b> <b>filter</b> presented by ITU [1] is replaced by a similar multistage tunable band-stop filter, which meets similar filtering characteristics, this is more easy to use and a less expensive filter. It is explained how the needed measurement dynamics are achieved and how the measurement time is determined and optimized in different situations. A two part measuring approach like this has not been reported before. ITU recommendations for attenuation of radar spurious emissions are updated to 100 dB below the radar nominal frequency (NF) signal level. The fulfillment of these spurious level requirements sets a hard challenge for measuring dynamics: dynamics must be more than 110 dB. The author provides in this work a solution to this requirement. This measuring method produces results, with which one can conclude the relative power level of radar spurious emissions and its effect on other radio services. In this work the spectrum produced by a 5 GHz weather radar has been studied and the results have been applied to study radar impact to terrestrial digital radio relay systems (TDRRS). The achieved result is both very important and current, and it can be utilized in the planning of new radar systems as also in the planning of new radio networks operating in the frequency ranges adjacent to radar frequencies. Possible radio networks in addition to TDRRSs that can be interfered from radar spurious emissions are Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Area (WiMAX) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) systems. These systems also can interfere with radar frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Widely Tunable RF Filters {{that are}} small, {{cost-effective}} and offer ultra {{low power consumption}} are extremely desirable. Indeed, such filters would allow drastic simplification of RF front-ends in countless applications from cell phones to satellites in space by replacing switched-array of static acoustic <b>filters</b> and <b>YIG</b> <b>filters</b> respectively. Switched array of acoustic filters are de facto means of channel selection in mobile applications such as cell phones. SAW and BAW filters satisfy most criteria needed by mobile applications such as low cost, size and power consumption. However, the trade-off is a significant loss of 3 - 4 dB in modern cell phone RF front-end. This leads to need for power-hungry amplifiers and short battery life. It is a necessary trade-off {{since there are no}} better alternatives. These devices are in mm scale and consume mW. <b>YIG</b> <b>filters</b> dominate applications where size or power is not a constraint but demand excellent RF performance like low loss and high tuning ratio. These devices are measured in inches and require several watts to operate. Clearly, a tunable RF filter technology that would combine the cost, size and power consumption benefits of acoustic filters with excellent RF performance of <b>YIG</b> <b>filters</b> would be extremely desirable and imminently useful. The objective of this dissertation is to develop such a technology based upon RF-MEMS Evanescent-mode cavity filter. Two highly novel RF-MEMS devices have been developed over the course of this PhD to address the unique MEMS needs of this technology. ^ The first part of the dissertation is dedicated to introducing the fundamental concepts of tunable cavity resonators and filters. This includes the physics behind it, key performance metrics and what they depend on and requirements of the MEMS tuners. Initial gap control and MEMS attachment method are identified as potential hurdles towards achieving very high RF performance. Simple and elegant solutions to both these issues are discussed in detail and have proved pivotal to this work. ^ The second part of the dissertation focuses on the Liquid Metal Droplet RF-MEMS. A novel tunable RF MEMS resonator that is based upon electrostatic control over the morphology of a liquid metal droplet (LMD) is conceived. We demonstrate an LMD evanescent-mode cavity resonator that simultaneously achieves wide analog tuning from 12 to 18 GHz with a measured quality factor of 1400 - 1840. A droplet of 250 -μm diameter is utilized and the applied bias is limited to 100 V. This device operates on a principle called Electro-Wetting On Dielectric (EWOD). The liquid metal employed is a non-toxic eutectic alloy of Gallium, Indium and Tin known as Galinstan. This device also exploits interfacial surface energy and viscous body forces that dominate at nanoliter scale. We then apply our Liquid Metal Droplet (LMD) RF-MEMS architecture to demonstrate a continuously tunable electrostatic Ku-Band Filter. A 2 -pole bandpass filter with measured insertion loss of less than 0. 4 dB and 3 dB FBW of 3. 4 % is achieved using a Galinstan droplet of 250 μm diameter and bias limited to 100 V. We demonstrate that the LMD is insensitive to gravity by performing inversion and tilt experiments. In addition, we study its thermal tolerance by subjecting the LMD up to 150 ° C. ^ The third part of the dissertation is dedicated to the Micro-Corrugated Diaphragm (MCD) RF-MEMS. We present an evanescent-mode cavity bandpass filter with state-of-the-art RF performance metrics like 4 : 1 tuning ratio from 5 to 20 GHz with less than 2 dB insertion loss and 2 - 6 % 3 dB bandwidth. Micro-Corrugated Diaphragm (MCD) is a novel electrostatic MEMS design specifically engineered to provide large-scale analog deflections necessary for such continuous and wide tunable filtering with very high quality factor. We demonstrate a 1. 25 mm radius and 2 μm thick Gold MCD which provides 30 μm total deflection with nearly 60 % analog range. We also present a detailed and systematic MCD design methodology for relevant applications. To further demonstrate MCD versatility, we implement a bandstop MCD filter that cascades nine separate resonators to achieve a 6 - 24 GHz continuous tuning. ^ The disseration concludes with a Galinstan Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) micropump and summary of my doctoral work. Although presented {{at the very end of}} this dissertation, the MHD micropump was indeed the very starting point for all my doctoral research efforts. The invaluable lessons learned here paved the way for development of both LMD and MCD RF-MEMS. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{differential}} SiGe oscillator circuit uses a resonant ring-oscillator topology {{in order}} to electronically tune the oscillator over multi-octave bandwidths. The oscillator s tuning is extremely linear, because the oscillator s frequency depends on the magnetic tuning of a YIG sphere, whose resonant frequency is equal to a fundamental constant times the DC magnetic field. This extremely simple circuit topology uses two coupling loops connecting a differential pair of SiGe bipolar transistors into a feedback configuration using a <b>YIG</b> tuned <b>filter</b> creating a closed-loop ring oscillator. SiGe device technology is used for this oscillator {{in order to}} keep the transistor s 1 /f noise to an absolute minimum in order to achieve minimum RF phase noise. The single-end resonant ring oscillator currently has an advantage in fewer parts, but when the oscillation frequency is greater than 16 GHz, the package s parasitic behavior couples energy to the sphere and causes holes and poor phase noise performance. This is because the coupling to the YIG is extremely low, so that the oscillator operates at near the unloaded Q. With the differential resonant ring oscillator, the oscillation currents are just in the YIG coupling mechanisms. The phase noise is even better, and the physical size can be reduced to permit monolithic microwave integrated circuit oscillators. This invention is a YIG tuned oscillator circuit making use of a differential topology to simultaneously achieve an extremely broadband electronic tuning range and ultra-low phase noise. As a natural result of its differential circuit topology, all reactive elements, such as tuning stubs, which limit tuning bandwidth by contributing excessive open loop phase shift, have been eliminated. The differential oscillator s open-loop phase shift is associated with completely non-dispersive circuit elements such as the physical angle of the coupling loops, a differential loop crossover, and the high-frequency phase shift of the n-p-n transistors. At the input of the oscillator s feedback loop is a pair of differentially connected n-p-n SiGe transistors that provides extremely high gain, and because they are bulk-effect devices, extremely low 1 /f noise (leading to ultralow RF phase noise). The 1 /f corner frequency for n-p-n SiGe transistors is approximately 500 Hz. The RF energy from the transistor s collector output is connected directly to the top-coupling loop (the excitation loop) of a single-sphere <b>YIG</b> tuned <b>filter.</b> A uniform magnetic field to bias the YIG must be at a right angle to any vector associated with an RF current in a coupling loop in order for the precession to interact with the RF currents...|$|R
