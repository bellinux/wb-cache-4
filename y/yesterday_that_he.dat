Twenty-one hundred dollars for hen-fruit! Say, Smoke, I tell you what. You run right up and see the Doc. He'll tend to your case. An' he'll only charge you an ounce for the first prescription. So-long, I gotta to be pullin' my freight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{father had}} told me that you had been coming, Masters Vickars, I would have had a proper dinner for you; but though he sent word <b>yesterday</b> morning <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should be over today, he did not say a word about your coming with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{alternative}} {{is not even}} to be thought of," [...] she interposed. [...] "We are Sir Percival's friends, and if generosity and forbearance can add to our regard for him, {{we ought to be}} Sir Percival's admirers as well.

6000|$|... "I was {{informed}} by a Gentleman <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had been at}} Harrow [...] and heard him speaking, and that he acquitted himself uncommonly [...] well." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lady Wantridge however, after all, easily {{overlooked}} it. [...] "I {{only knew}} {{he was one of}} your odd Americans. That's why, when I heard <b>yesterday</b> here <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was up there awaiting your return, I didn't let that prevent me. I thought he might be. He certainly," [...] her ladyship laughed, [...] "IS." ...|$|R

50|$|Just then, Steven Crane {{calls and}} speaks with Commissioner Gordon, {{telling him that}} Lambert {{received}} an anonymous threat on his life <b>yesterday</b> and <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> Crane, had received the same one today and fears for his life.

6000|$|... 'We {{shall be}} very slow to-day, dear,' she said, as they toiled painfully through the streets; 'my feet are sore, and I have pains {{in all my}} limbs from the wet of <b>yesterday.</b> I saw <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looked at us and thought of <b>that,</b> when <b>he</b> said how long we should be upon the road.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not a whit," [...] {{replied the}} other; [...] "he doesn't know the backstays from the taffrail. It was only <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{thought he was}} already in the port of Belize, and dressed himself up like a fighting-cock to meet you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Former {{colleague}} and Stasi officer Grünwald visits him shortly afterwards, informing {{him that the}} curator is in this for the money. The following day, the curator indefinitely [...] "loans" [...] him the picture <b>he</b> wanted <b>yesterday.</b> <b>That</b> night, <b>he</b> also receives a surprise visit from his daughter Nina, although she does not enter his place. She quickly confirms his suspicion that she {{and his wife are}} forwarding him the packages and she gives him another one before leaving. He opens up this package; inside are a pair of calf-skin gloves and an aesthetically elegant but confiscated pen from the prison, which he gave to his daughter many years ago as a gift. He decides shortly after <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will give a tour, but stresses that it will be on his own terms.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes. He {{came to me}} <b>yesterday</b> {{and said}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was sure you had {{something}} on your mind. Now, maybe it is none of our business, Dave.

60|$|By General Meade's {{despatch}} to you of <b>yesterday</b> {{it appears}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> desires your views {{and those of}} the government as to whether he shall advance upon the enemy. I am not prepared to order, or even advise, an advance in this case, wherein I know so little of particulars, and wherein he, in the field, thinks the risk is so great and the promise of advantage so small.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{believes}} you," [...] she continued, [...] "to be harmless {{enough at}} a wholesome period of our country's history.

6000|$|... "Fothergill told me only <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{sees her}} almost every day," [...] said the father. [...] "What {{are we to}} do, Griselda?

6000|$|... "But," [...] he answered, [...] "I {{want him}} to talk of himself and of his {{delusion}} as to consuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?" ...|$|E
5000|$|English language: The boy {{who came}} <b>yesterday</b> was annoyed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not accepted. After a quarrel with me, {{he went off}} sorry for himself. We were later told <b>that</b> <b>he</b> told our boss <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{rejected}} because I hated him. The boss later called me to his office and questioned me about the reasons I refused {{to take in the}} boy in question and I told him.

6000|$|... "Yes, Dr. Holloway thought {{very badly}} of him <b>yesterday,</b> and said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had but very faint hope of his rallying. I cannot help {{thinking}} that it was best so. Of course, {{he was not a}} very old man, but he has for some years been a very feeble one, and now that Millicent and I have both given up our studies with him, I think <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have felt that his work was done, and would have gone downhill very fast." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>That</b> morning <b>he</b> went to {{an office}} that hired him under the table to shovel snow. When he enters the office the man asks him where his friends are, and Ali thinks that the police will be coming to arrest him. It is {{revealed}} {{that the man was}} just disappointed that there weren’t going to be more workers to shovel the time, but still Ali is anxious and has a flash back to {{when he was in the}} military. The man hiring him checks his passport and tells Ali to go back to the place <b>he</b> worked <b>yesterday</b> and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would return to the office to retrieve his money and his passport. Ali almost calls the man Commander after the man tells him to start work at a specific time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do! Oh, I can do nothing. I {{could do}} nothing, {{even though he}} were here in Baslehurst every day of his life. If I once thought that he didn't wish me--to--be--his wife, I should {{not want to do}} anything. But, mamma, I can't believe it of him. It was only <b>yesterday</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was here." ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{observed}} <b>yesterday,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> tried to entice Mr. Wickfield to drink; and, interpreting the look which Agnes {{had given me}} as she went out, had limited myself to one glass, and then proposed that we should follow her. I would have done so again today; but Uriah was too quick for me.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{should feel}} greatly obliged if you would, sir, {{for there is}} no doubt that he saved my life. He is {{certainly}} as well up in his work as any of the midshipmen.

50|$|The song is a {{moderate}} mid-tempo song where {{the narrator is}} begging forgiveness of a woman he did wrong because he didn't trust her fidelity. <b>He</b> tells her <b>that</b> <b>yesterday</b> <b>he</b> was a jealous man but today he is just a lonely fool. The second verse is half spoken, half sung. The narrator says that if she takes him back, he will always trust her and be proud when other men notice her.|$|R
40|$|Davis {{believes}} that at most {{half of the}} cases have been reported; he has received noticed that many physicians are too busy to report their cases• Mayor Babcock called Davis <b>yesterday,</b> recommending <b>that</b> <b>he</b> issue instructions <b>that</b> all persons should wear “flu” masks; Davis is considering this; Babcock does not yet have a mask for himself but has been inoculated; Babcock had visited West Virginia recently and observed the use of masks there• The Criminal Court rooms and grand jury rooms were fumigated with formaldehyde candles yesterday and sealed until Monday, with guards placed at the doors• State Health Department agreed to send 2 doctors to Sharpsburg (a town near Pittsburgh) upon request• Red Cross hopes that Pittsburgh will not be hit as hard as other cities; {{is currently working on}} manufacturing anti-flu serum to give to corporations, firms and other organizations; testimonials of the good work of the Red Cross have been receivedNewspaper Article...|$|R
