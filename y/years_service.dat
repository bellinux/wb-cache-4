5|$|A large repair {{was carried}} out at Plymouth Dock (i.e. Devonport) for the sum of £78,909 between March 1814 and March 1816, but {{with the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars she was laid up for a number of years.

She was prepared for sea again in early 1845, spending time under the command of Fairfax Moresby, before being laid up at Devonport in 1848. She was fitted out there as a receiving ship between June and October 1862, and served as a tender to , the Devonport guardship. Canopus became a mooring hulk in 1869, with her masts being removed in April 1878. She was finally sold after 89 <b>years</b> <b>service</b> with the Royal Navy in October 1887 to J.

5|$|In July and August, the 9th Armoured Brigade {{worked in}} support of the 4th and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions in the central {{mountains}} south east of Florence, on the approach to the Gothic Line. In August, the order was received that all men with over 4½ <b>years</b> <b>service</b> overseas should be repatriated, and this reduced the regiment's strength by half. This made it impossible to function as a fighting unit and it was withdrawn from the line of battle. In October 1944, the regiment returned to England to train replacements for armoured regiments still fighting in Europe. It continued in this role until 1946, although the pace slowed after victory in Europe in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Albert Aubrey (Aub) Koch, MBE (2 October 1904 – 21 June 1975) was a {{pioneering}} Australian military and civil pilot. He trained at Point Cook in 1926, and following graduation accepted a Short Service Commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) {{as there were}} no places available in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at the time. After four <b>years</b> <b>service</b> in Egypt and Palestine, he returned to Australia and was commissioned into the Citizen Air Force, flying with No. 1 Squadron at Laverton, where he gained flying instructor qualifications. Soon after, he was employed by Guinea Airways as an aircraft captain, and spent five years in Papua and New Guinea (PNG), gaining fame as the rescuer of the Archbold expedition. Koch {{was transferred to the}} RAAF Active Reserve upon going to PNG. He joined Qantas a year before World War II broke out, employed predominantly on the Singapore route. He was unfortunate to be the captain of the only Qantas aircraft known to be shot down during that war, when the Short Empire flying boat Corio was lost off Timor (Circe disappeared in 1942, possibly also shot down, and Corinna was destroyed by enemy action on the water at Broome, Western Australia). Post war he was recruited by Lester Brain at the formation of Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), specifically to be Senior Pilot DC4 Skymaster. At 45, he retired from active flying to become Inspector of Safety and Accidents, TAA.|$|E
5|$|Penelope was {{completed}} at Devonport Dockyard on 27 June 1868 {{for the cost}} of £196,789 and served in the Channel Fleet until June 1869. She was then guard ship at Harwich until 1882, which included summer cruises in company {{with the rest of the}} reserve fleet. She was part of the Particular Service Squadron mobilised during the Russian war scare of June–August 1878. In 1882, she was at Gibraltar on the summer cruise when the Anglo-Egyptian War began and her shallow draught caused her to be sent to Egypt. Upon arrival in Alexandria, she assisted with the evacuation of European refugees for several days before the bombardment of the city began on 11 July. Penelope was the ship closest to the Egyptian forts and fired 231 rounds during the battle. The ship was only lightly damaged by Egyptian shells, with eight men wounded, one eight-inch gun damaged and one mainyard needing to be replaced. She became Rear-Admiral Anthony Hoskins's flagship when the British seized the Suez Canal to allow their troop transports to land at Ismailia. Penelope returned home after the war for a further five <b>years</b> <b>service</b> at Harwich. She was paid off in 1887, refitted, and sent to Simonstown, South Africa, as a receiving ship the following year. In January 1897, Penelope was converted to a prison-hulk and then sold for scrap on 12 July 1912 for the price of £1,650. The ship was broken up at Genoa, Italy, in 1914.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{remained in}} reserve until April 1918, when German forces attacked {{as part of}} the Spring Offensive. During the Battle of the Lys, the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was effectively wiped out, leaving a two-mile wide gap in the British lines. The 33rd was ordered into position, and Pinney personally commanded the divisional machine-gun battalion, which—with the assistance of various stragglers from retreating units—helped turn back a heavy German attack at the Battle of Hazebrouck on 12 and 13 April. For his service in April, Pinney, along with the commanders of the 12th, 55th and 61st Divisions, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. The 33rd was used to train the American 30th Infantry Division through the summer, but went over to the offensive in September, seeing action at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal, the Battle of Cambrai, and the Battle of the Selle. At the Selle, Pinney organised a dawn attack with improvised bridges, allowing the 33rd to force a bridgehead and successfully clear the opposing bank in a short time. The division finished the war in the Sambre valley, and began demobilisation. In February 1919, with the division mostly demobilised, Pinney retired from the army, aged fifty-six, after thirty-five <b>years</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{officer is}} {{entitled}} to a pension when he is retired {{at the age of}} 45, or if he retires between the ages c 40 and 45 at his own request, otherwise he receives only half pay. The amount of his pension depends upon his rank, length of service and age. As an example, in past, the maximum retired pay of an admiral was £850 per annum, for which 30 <b>years</b> <b>service</b> or its equivalent in half-pay time is necessary; he may, in addition, have held a good service pension of 300 per annum. The maximum retired pay of a vice-admiral with 29 <b>years</b> <b>service</b> was £725; of rear-admirals with 27 <b>years</b> <b>service,</b> £600 per annum. Pensions of captains who retire at the age of 55, commanders, who retire at 50, and lieutenants who retire at 45, ranged from £200 per annum for 17 <b>years</b> <b>service</b> to £525 for 24 <b>years</b> <b>service.</b> The pensions of other officers were calculated in the same way, according to age and length of service.|$|E
