Well, here we are." [...] The Castro District was not the only neighborhood to promote someone new to city politics. Sworn in with Milk were also a single mother (Carol Ruth Silver), a Chinese American (Gordon Lau), and an African American woman (Ella Hill Hutch)—all firsts for the city. Daniel White, a former police officer and firefighter, was also a first-time supervisor, and he spoke of how proud he was that his grandmother was able to see him sworn in.|$|E

[...] Annie from the London Community Gospel Choir provided the female background vocals throughout the song. Madonna also mentioned that new versions would be [...] "coming out, but just not yet". Describing the song as [...] "one of [...] more mellow productions", Madonna composed [...] "Living for Love" [...] as a break-up song, commenting, [...] "lots of people write about being in love and being happy or they write about having a broken heart and being inconsolable. But nobody writes about having a broken heart and being hopeful and triumphant afterwards. So I thought, how can I do this? I didn't want to share the sentiment of being a victim. This scenario devastated me, but it just made me stronger". She complemented saying that [...] "Living for Love" [...] was [...] "kind of like the old me and the new me all mixed in together".|$|E

Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly".

The 1960s style track lyrically talks about falling in love, with Roberts explaining [...] "The song is about a boy not playing along but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing".

5000|$|In American English, {{you make}} a decision, and in British English, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> also <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> For the same thing, French says prendre ‘take’ une décision, German—eine Entscheidung treffen/fällen ‘meet/fell’, Russian—prinjat´ ‘accept’ rešenie, Turkish—karar vermek ‘give’, Polish—podjąć ‘take up’ decyzję, Serbian—doneti ‘bring’ odluku, and Korean—gyeoljeongeul hada 〈naerida〉 ‘do 〈take/put down〉’. This clearly shows that boldfaced verbs are {{selected}} {{as a function of}} the noun meaning ‘decision’. If instead of DÉCISION a French speaker uses CHOIX ‘choice’ (Jean a pris la décision de rester ‘Jean has taken the decision to stay’ ≅ Jean a … le choix de rester ‘Jean has ... the choice to stay’), he has to say FAIRE ‘make’ rather than PRENDRE ‘take’: Jean a fait 〈*a pris〉 le choix de rester ‘Jean has made the choice to stay’.|$|R
