500|$|Friedrich's written {{commentary}} on aesthetics {{was limited to}} a collection of aphorisms set down in 1830, in which he explained {{the need for the}} artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality. His best-known remark advises the artist to [...] "close your bodily eye so that you may see <b>your</b> <b>picture</b> first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards." [...] He rejected the overreaching portrayals of nature in its [...] "totality", as found in the work of contemporary painters like Adrian Ludwig Richter (1803–84) and Joseph Anton Koch (1768–1839).|$|E
500|$|The initial {{reception}} {{after the}} ride's announcement was positive. According to Lance Hart, {{a theme park}} enthusiast from Screamscape, [...] "Instead of selling <b>your</b> <b>picture...</b> they should sell baby wipes and clean underwear at the exit" [...] and the ride {{could be the most}} frightening drop tower in the world. Robb Alvey of Theme Park Review called the ride the world's best drop tower, later ranking it one of the top 14 new attractions for 2014; Dave Parfitt and Arthur Levine of USA Today ranked Falcon's Fury in their top ten. Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times originally ranked Falcon's Fury his seventh-most-anticipated ride for 2014; on an updated list, he ranked it 17th.|$|E
500|$|Mike Boone of The Gazette praised Belzer's {{performance}} and the hand-held camera style of photography, adding, [...] "But if <b>your</b> <b>picture</b> tube blew Sunday night, you could still listen to an hour of the hippest, funniest dialogue on TV." [...] Not all reviews were positive. Some critics considered the photography style of jump cuts and hand-held camera movement too jarring; some said it made them feel seasick. James Endrst, television columnist for The Hartford Courant, felt the episode was over-hyped and said [...] "seen it, done it, been there before" [...] of the filming techniques otherwise being praised as cutting edge. Endrst, however, praised the performances of Braugher, Belzer, Polito and Secor in particular. Time reviewer Richard Zoglin said the episode had a strong cast and that he appreciated the lack of two-dimensional violence, but said, [...] "the characters are too pat, their conflicts too predictable", particularly the rookie character Bayliss.|$|E

500|$|Photos of Parks and Recreation {{producers}} {{were included}} among {{the photos of}} past city council members on the town hall walls. The photo of Norm Hiscock is the one Leslie said she believes, [...] "No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at my chest. Mark's social networking site featured in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] included the character {{with a wide range}} of promiscuous women. The pictures were shot during a photo session during which, according to series co-creator Michael Schur, [...] "We brought in a lot of women and basically said, you're really trashy. You're trashy women, and we're going to take <b>your</b> <b>picture</b> now." [...] During the courtyard party scenes, a brief clip shows Poehler, Jones and Schneider dancing together. The clip was actually the three actors out-of-character playing around between takes, but the Parks producers decided to add it to the episode.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Weber {{complained of}} both the control exerted by {{consolidated}} studios, {{as well as the}} ever more strenuous censorship of the Hays Code: [...] "I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ... The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell you how much you can pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne. But when they tell you that they also will cut <b>your</b> <b>picture,</b> that is too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Photographers find perp walks {{their second}} most-dreaded {{assignment}} after {{going to the}} home of someone who has recently died to ask for a picture. They must wait a long time for a period of a few seconds in which they will be competing with a potentially large group of other photographers and television crews. This presents the possibility that they can be trampled beneath the group, as depicted in the 1994 film The Paper, and the difficulty of photographing a defendant who may be looking downward to keep his face from view. Marty Lederhandler, an Associated Press photographer who worked for {{the last half of the}} 20th century and shot the perp walks of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well as David Berkowitz, describes the perp walk as [...] "it's, 'He'll be out in 10 minutes.' You line up. He comes out and into the car, and you've got <b>your</b> <b>picture.</b> Nice." [...] When he began in the years after World War II, Lederhandler says, the media was more polite during perp walks than they are now. [...] "We all had the same lenses those days, and everybody would stand 8 or 10 feet back, and nobody was pushing or shoving." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pauline Curuenavuli {{was born}} in Suva, Fiji on 15 October 1982 to parents Isireli, a former choir conductor, and Miliana, a nurse. Her mother Miliana lived and worked alone in Sydney, Australia for two years. Paulini, her five {{siblings}} and their father Isireli moved from Fiji to Sydney in 1986, when she was four years old, to join Miliana. Their first home in Australia was a two-bedroom apartment in Randwick, New South Wales, where Paulini attended Coogee Public School. The family later moved to a South-western Sydney suburb, close to the Fijian church they regularly attended. Paulini is the youngest of six siblings; she has three brothers and two sisters. Paulini's eldest brother {{was shot and killed}} during a robbery incident in 1990. She recorded a cover of Luba's [...] "Every Time I See <b>Your</b> <b>Picture</b> I Cry", in her brother's memory, for her third album Come Alive (2015). Paulini and her family began singing and playing instruments from a young age, despite not being classically trained in music. Their father taught Paulini and her siblings how to harmonise. At the age of 10, Paulini's father encouraged her to showcase her singing abilities at a church talent quest. It was during this moment Paulini realised that singing is [...] "what I wanted to do with my life." [...] Aside from singing, Paulini also had a passion for playing netball.|$|E
