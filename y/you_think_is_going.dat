500|$|Upon Burton's casting, it was {{revealed}} by MSN that Dylan, who was described as [...] "the mysterious ex Avery keeps bringing up" [...] by Jillian Bowe of Zap2it, {{would be involved in}} a love triangle with his ex-girlfriend Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins) and her current lover, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind {{despite the fact that she}} had moved on.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Thorne {{of course}} {{expressed}} her congratulations, {{and took her}} departure without having committed herself to a word as to the other inhabitants of the Deanery. But {{when she got to}} her father's house, where she was for the present staying, she in truth startled them all by the news. The Dean had just come into the drawing-room to have his afternoon tea and a little gossip with his wife and his own sister, Mrs. Forrester, from London. [...] "Who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be married, and to whom?" [...] said Mrs. Thorne.

I will warrant there are papers there which concern scores of men besides you, for I know that Ben Soloman likes to work with agents he has got under his thumb. But, even if all the papers should be put {{into the hands of the}} authorities, what would come of it?

Pushed by Delia's ex-boyfriend Jeremiah, June begins to wonder if it really was suicide at all - or was Delia murdered.|$|E
5000|$|Upon his death, The New York Times {{described}} Youngs prose style: [...] "With all the {{subtlety of}} a knee in the groin, Dick Young made people gasp... He could be vicious, ignorant, trivial and callous, but for many years he was the epitome of the brash, unyielding yet sentimental Damon Runyon sportswriter." [...] Esquire Magazine called Youngs writing [...] "coarse and simpleminded, like a cave painting. But it is superbly crafted." [...] Ross Wetzsteon wrote that Young had [...] "singlehandedly replaced the pompous poetry of the press box with the cynical poetry of the streets." [...] In his book The Boys of Summer, Roger Kahn called Young [...] "spiky, self-educated, and New York." [...] Characteristically, Young described his approach to sportswriting simply: [...] "Tell people whats going on, and what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. Bread-and-butter stuff, meat-and-potato stuff." ...|$|E

5000|$|Concerning {{the temple}} in Jerusalem, Orson Pratt stated, [...] "By and by {{there will be}} a Temple built at Jerusalem. Who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to build it? You may think that it will be the unbelieving Jews who {{rejected}} the Savior. I believe that which is contained on the 77th page of the Book of Mormon, as well as in many other places, in that same book, will be literally fulfilled. The Temple at Jerusalem will undoubtedly be built, by those who believe in the true Messiah. Its construction will be, in some respects different from the Temples now being built. It will contain the throne of the Lord, upon which he will, at times, personally sit, and will reign over the house of Israel for ever. It may also contain twelve other thrones, on which the twelve ancient Apostles will sit, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel." ...|$|E

40|$|Good {{planning}} is always {{key to success}} for agricultural producers [...] but perhaps never {{more so than in}} today 2 ̆ 7 s economy, said a University of Nebraska-Lincoln agricultural economist. 2 ̆ 2 Planning what to grow in 2009 has many complications this year, 2 ̆ 2 said Doug Jose, UNL farm management specialist. 2 ̆ 2 Among the possible unknowns at the farm level are market prices for commodities, the cost and availability of inputs and the cost and availability of operating credit. 2 ̆ 2 I say 2 ̆ 7 possible 2 ̆ 7 because through contractual arrangements and forward pricing decisions, farmers already may have locked in many of these prices for the next production cycle, 2 ̆ 2 he added. Like everyone, farmers are {{keeping an eye on the}} overall economy, Jose said. 2 ̆ 2 Agriculture needs improvement in our general economy and improved consumer confidence to prosper, 2 ̆ 2 Jose wrote in the Dec. 17 issue of Cornhusker Economics. 2 ̆ 2 Yes, people will buy food, but they will spend more on food through buying more expensive items, more protein and more prepared meals, if they have more money in their pockets. 2 ̆ 2 Jose offers these planning tips for 2009 : Establish your business model. Despite the unknowns, producers need to 2 ̆ 2 start with describing the operating environment <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to exist for the next year, 2 ̆ 2 Jose said. 2 ̆ 2 This gives you a base to respond to if the situation does change as opposed to reacting on a daily basis without any structure in your decision making process. 2 ̆ 2 Farmers should figure out what they plan to produce, the inputs they 2 ̆ 7 ll need, the forces that will impact production and major risks to their operations. Define a marketing plan. Price patterns and relationships have changed, but it is still important to establish a marketing plan. Despite market volatility, seasonal price patterns are still relevant. Make farm program decisions. Details of the new farm program and specifically the Average Crop Revenue Election program are expected early in 2009. Coordinate decisions. Once producers decide what they plan to grow, the next set of decisions will be the inputs needed seed, fertilizer, fuel, chemicals, Jose said. 2 ̆ 2 But this should be coordinated with two other sets of decisions, namely the crop insurance decision and a marketing plan. All three groups of decisions should be tied together, 2 ̆ 2 he said. Evaluate the costs and benefits of seed alternatives. An increasing number of seed alternatives are available. Traits incorporated into these varieties have increased yields and reduced chemical use...|$|E
