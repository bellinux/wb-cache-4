500|$|Lawrence Taylor was {{the second}} of three sons born to Clarence and Iris Taylor in Williamsburg, Virginia. His father worked as a {{dispatcher}} at the Newport News shipyards, while {{his mother was a}} schoolteacher. Referred to as Lonnie by his family, Taylor was a mischievous youth. His mother said that [...] "e was a challenging child. Where the other two boys would ask for permission to do stuff, Lonnie...would just do it, and when you found out about it, he would give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> story." [...] Taylor concentrated on baseball as a youth, in which he played the position of catcher, and only began playing football at the advanced age of fifteen. He did not play organized high school football until the following year (eleventh grade), and was not heavily recruited coming out of high school.|$|E

We all have faults. Before I let you stand on your high horse and point a finger back down at me, I'm going to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> stiff 'Fuck you.'" [...] On Power 105's The Breakfast Club, T.I. hinted that Trouble Man could be his last album, explaining that he wanted to quit rapping, believing that it is not how it once was: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If I'd known you, Missy, we'd {{never have}} held up this homestead. White people all through, and you're a prairie daisy. What {{made me do}} it?

6000|$|They are all admirable and exquisite--for I {{seem to have}} {{received}} so much from you that [...] "all" [...] is the only indication comprehensive enough. I came down from ten days in town the other day to find L'Aiglon, and within three or four the beautiful little pocket-diary has added itself to that obligation. Dear and splendid Tony, let me not even (scarcely) speak of my obligations. That way lies prostration, the sense of deep unworthyness (wrongly spelled--to show how unworthi I am:) the memory and vision of a little library of Bond St. booklets that collectors (toward the end of 1901) will cut each others' throats for: and what do I know besides? I am more touched than I can say, in short, by your fidelity in every particular. L'Aiglon, now that we at last have the glittering text, has been a joy to me, of the finest kind, here by the Xmas fireside. I haven't seen the thing done--and I don't hugely want to: I so represent it to myself as I go. The talent, the effect, the art, the mastery, the brilliancy, are all prodigious. The man really has talent like an attack of smallpox--I mean it rages with as purple an intensity, and might almost (one vainly feels as one reads) be contagious. You have given me, by your admirable consideration, an exquisite pleasure. I wish we could talk of these things: but we are like the buckets in the well.... Make me a preliminary sign {{the first time you}} pass. For the present good-night. My Xmas letters are still mainly unwritten and they are many and much. I greet you and Mrs. Tony very constantly: I wish <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> slice of the new century: and I am yours ever so gratefully, ...|$|E
6000|$|Fever--one of your dastard weapons--was {{no doubt}} what set me drawing portraits, {{but why did}} I see <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> man with a black beard? Because long ago, when the world was young, I had a {{schoolmaster}} of that appearance. He crackled his fingers too. I had forgotten him utterly. He had gone from me with the love of climbing for crows' nests--which I once thought would never die--but during some of these seventeen days of thirty-six hours each I suppose I have been a boy again. Yet I had many schoolmasters, all sure at first that they could make something of me, all doleful when they found that I had conscientious scruples against learning. Why do I merge you into him of the crackling fingers? I know. It is because in mediæval times I hated him as I hate you. No others have I loathed with any intensity, but he alone of my masters refused to be reconciled to my favorite method of study, which consisted, I remember (without shame) in glancing at my tasks, as I hopped and skipped to school. Sometimes I hopped and skipped, but did not arrive at school in time to take solid part in lessons, and this grieved the soul of him {{who wanted to be}} my instructor. So we differed, as Gladstonian and Conservative on the result of the Parnell Commission, and my teacher, being in office, troubled me not a little. I confess I hated him, and while I sat glumly in his room, whence the better boys had retired, much solace I found in wondering how I would slay him, supposing I had a loaded pistol, a sword, and a hatchet, and he had only one life. I schemed to be a dark, morose pirate of fourteen, so that I might capture him, even at his black-board, and make him walk the plank. I was Judge Lynch, and he was the man {{at the end of the}} rope. I charged upon him on horseback, and cut him down. I challenged him to single combat, and then I was Ivanhoe. I even found pleasure in conceiving myself shouting [...] "Crackle-fingers" [...] after him, and then bolting round a corner. You must see now why I pictured you heavy, and dark, and bearded. You are the schoolmaster of my later years. I lay in bed and gloried in the thought that presently I would be up, and fall upon you like a body of cavalry.|$|E
