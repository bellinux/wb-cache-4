5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

No matter how {{you try to get}} away from it, the sin is within <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> It was this fear that haunted me; it taunted and pained me every moment. My music was {{probably}} the only distraction I had.|$|E

You can't be worried about the manager getting on <b>you.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I was at Cleveland, I saw Lopez get mad only twice. He never showed anybody up. I don't do it either." ...|$|E

2500|$|Connolly's bedroom had double windows, which {{directly}} faced St Peter's Primary School {{across the}} street. Now defunct, {{it has been}} converted into living accommodation. [...] "The school was very violent indeed. At first, in the infant school, the nuns were very violent. And then over here at St Peter's, they were just strapping <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> I had a psychopath in here, called McDonald— Miss McDonald. [...] "Big Rosie", they called her. There was a guy with glasses in my class and she called him [...] "four eyes", {{and she was a}} teacher!" ...|$|E

Keys told MTV News Canada that the song [...] "is {{really talking about}} the way that in relationships, the way that so many things are around <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to try to distract you. And even though people may talk and say whatever {{they may want to}} say, but then no one can {{get in the way of}} this." [...] Keys said that it was a song that [...] "just wrote itself". It was one of the last songs written for the album.|$|E
2500|$|After nine weeks, Gilman {{was sent}} home with Mitchell's instructions, [...] "Live as {{domestic}} a life as possible. Have your child with <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time...</b> Lie down an hour after each meal. Have but two hours' intellectual life a day. And never touch pen, brush or pencil {{as long as you}} live." [...] She tried for a few months to follow Mitchell's advice, but her depression deepened, and Gilman came perilously close to a full emotional collapse. Her remaining sanity was on the line and she began to display suicidal behavior that involved talk of pistols and chloroform, as recorded in her husband's diaries. By early summer the couple had decided that a divorce was necessary for her to regain sanity without affecting the lives of her husband and daughter.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2012, Lucas {{announced}} that he would step away from blockbuster films and instead produce smaller arthouse films. Asked whether the criticism he received following the prequel trilogy and the alterations to the re-releases of the original trilogy had influenced his decision to retire, Lucas said: [...] "Why would I make any more when everybody yells at <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and says what a terrible person you are?" [...] Despite insisting that a sequel trilogy would never happen, Lucas began working on story treatments for three new Star Wars films in 2011. In October 2012, The Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and {{announced that}} Star Wars Episode VII would be released in 2015. Later, it was revealed that the three new upcoming films (Episodes VII–IX) would be based on story treatments that had been written by George Lucas prior to the sale of Lucasfilm. The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy became president of the company, reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn. In addition, Kennedy will serve as executive producer on new Star Wars feature films, with franchise creator and Lucasfilm founder Lucas serving as creative consultant.|$|E
