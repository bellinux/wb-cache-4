5000|$|The {{protocol}} allows differing {{degrees of}} privacy. Interactions are always anonymous, but the Member/Verifier may negotiate {{as to whether}} the Verifier is able to link transactions. This would allow user profiling and/or the rejection of requests originating from a host which has made too many requests. The Member and Verifier can also elect to reveal additional information to accomplish non-anonymous interactions (just as you can choose to tell a stranger <b>your</b> <b>full</b> <b>name,</b> or not). Thus, known identity can be built on top of an anonymous start. (Contrast this with: if you start with known identity, you can never prove you un-know that identity to regress to anonymity.) ...|$|E
