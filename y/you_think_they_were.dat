'I think I {{see them}} now {{coming up the}} street very wide apart, in nankeen' pantaloons a little shrunk and without straps. Ah! what a vale of tears we live in. Do we say crooked?' ...|$|E

[...] The baby had slightly soiled {{the front of her}} dress.|$|E
6000|$|And the Little Breeze laughed happily as {{he danced}} away {{to join the}} other Merry Little Breezes on the Green Meadows.

6000|$|... "Well, I {{can tell}} you," [...] she said, [...] "that if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not the nicest people you ever saw, you're mightily mistaken. They {{had about the}} best manners; {{and they had been}} everywhere, and knew everything. I declare it made me feel as if we had always lived in the backwoods. I don't know but the mother and the daughters would have let you feel so a little, if they'd showed out all they thought; but they never did; and the son--well, I can't express it, Silas! But that young man had about perfect ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, {{there she}} is indeed; I {{remember}} now, when I was a youngster, of going with my kinsman, old Lord Gosford, to meet his sister, the Lady Juliana, when she first came from school (this was the lady whose infidelity had driven him from the world); and a beauty she was indeed, something like Emmy there; only she was taller, {{and her eyes were}} black, and her hair too, that was black; and she was not so fair as Emmy, and she was fatter, and she stooped a little--very little; oh! they are wonderfully alike though; don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> nephew?" [...] he stopped {{at the door of the}} room; while John, who in this description could not see a resemblance, which existed nowhere but in the old man's affections, was fain to say, [...] "yes; but they were related, you know, uncle, and that explains the likeness." ...|$|E
60|$|If out of sight, {{then out}} of mind. This is a saying which you often hear. It may be true sometimes, {{but it is very}} far from true at other times. Take the case of Blacky. He had had only a glance into that nest just inside the door of Farmer Brown's henhouse, but that glance had been enough to show him two eggs there. Then, as he flew away toward the Green Forest, those eggs were out of sight, of course. But do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> out of mind? Not much! No, indeed! In fact, those eggs were very much in Blacky's mind. He couldn't think of {{anything}} else. He flew straight to a certain tall pine-tree in a lonely part of the Green Forest. Whenever Blacky wants to think or to plan mischief, he seeks that particular tree, and in the shelter of its broad branches he keeps out of sight of curious eyes, and there he sits as still as still can be.|$|E

60|$|It was raining, apparently, but she didn't mind--she {{would put}} on stout shoes and walk over to Plash. She was restless and so fidgety {{that it was a}} pain; there were strange voices that frightened her--they threw out the ugliest intimations--in the empty rooms at home. She would see old Mrs. Berrington, whom she liked because she was so simple, and old Lady Davenant, who was staying with her and who was {{interesting}} for reasons with which simplicity had nothing to do. Then she would come back to the children's tea--she liked even better the last half-hour in the schoolroom, with the bread and butter, the candles and the red fire, the little spasms of confidence of Miss Steet the nursery-governess, and the society of Scratch and Parson (their nicknames would have made <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dogs) her small, magnificent nephews, whose flesh was so firm yet so soft and their eyes so charming when they listened to stories. Plash was the dower-house and about a mile and a half, through the park, from Mellows. It was not raining after all, though it had been; there was only a grayness in the air, covering all the strong, rich green, and a pleasant damp, earthy smell, and the walks were smooth and hard, so that the expedition was not arduous.|$|E
60|$|She {{was always}} {{delicate}} from that hour, {{and for many}} months she was very ill. I have heard that {{the first thing she}} expressed a wish to see was the christening robe, and she looked long at it and then turned her face to the wall. That was what made me as a boy think of it always as the robe in which he was christened, but I knew later that we had all been christened in it, from the oldest of the family to the youngest, between whom stood twenty years. Hundreds of other children were christened in it also, such robes being then a rare possession, and the lending of ours among my mother’s glories. It was carried carefully from house to house, as if it were itself a child; my mother made much of it, smoothed it out, petted it, smiled to it before putting it into the arms of those to whom it was being lent; she was in our pew to see it borne magnificently (something inside it now) down the aisle to the pulpit-side, when a stir of expectancy went through the church and we kicked each other’s feet beneath the book-board but were reverent in the face; and however the child might behave, laughing brazenly or skirling to its mother’s shame, and whatever the father as he held it up might do, look doited probably and bow at the wrong time, the christening robe of long experience helped them through. And when it was brought back to her she took it in her arms as softly as if it might be asleep, and unconsciously pressed it to her breast: there was never anything in the house that spoke to her quite so eloquently as that little white robe; it was the one of her children that always remained a baby. And she had not made it herself, which was the most wonderful thing about it to me, for she seemed to have made all other things. All the clothes in the house were of her making, and you don’t know her in the least if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> out of the fashion; she turned them and made them new again, she beat them and made them new again, and then she coaxed them into being new again just for the last time, she let them out and took them in and put on new braid, and added a piece up the back, and thus they passed from one member of the family to another until they reached the youngest, and even when we were done with them they reappeared as something else. In the fashion! I must come back to this. Never was a woman with such an eye for it. She had no fashion-plates; she did not need them. The minister’s wife (a cloak), the banker’s daughters (the new sleeve)—they had but to pass our window once, and the scalp, so to speak, was in my mother’s hands. Observe her rushing, scissors in hand, thread in mouth, to the drawers where her daughters’ Sabbath clothes were kept. Or go to church next Sunday, and watch a certain family filing in, the boy lifting his legs high to show off his new boots, but all the others demure, especially the timid, unobservant-looking little woman in the rear of them. If you were the minister’s wife that day or the banker’s daughters you would have got a shock. But she bought the christening robe, and when I used to ask why, she would beam and look conscious, and say she wanted to be extravagant once. And she told me, still smiling, that the more a woman was given to stitching and making things for herself, the greater was her passionate desire now and again to rush to the shops and ‘be foolish.’ The christening robe with its pathetic frills is over half a century old now, and has begun to droop a little, like a daisy whose time is past; but it is as fondly kept together as ever: I saw it in use again only the other day.|$|E
