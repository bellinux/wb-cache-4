500|$|Later, Chess {{arranged}} for Howlin' Wolf to record [...] "The Red Rooster" [...] {{and some other}} songs with Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts for the 1971 album The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions. [...] At {{the beginning of the}} recording, Howlin' Wolf can be heard attempting to explain the timing of the song, because as Wyman later explained, [...] "we were kind of playing it backwards". [...] Finally, Clapton (joined in by the others) encourages him to play it on guitar so [...] "I can follow <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can see what you're doing". [...] Despite their efforts to get it right, according to Wyman, [...] "the Chess people ended up using the old 'backwards' take anyway".|$|E
500|$|Three {{weeks after}} his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: [...] "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run." [...] The race was run at [...] miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.|$|E
500|$|The couplet {{summarizes}} the sonnet in two lines, [...] "Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue, because I would not dull {{you with my}} song". This is a clear statement from the poet vocalizing for the final time {{that he will not}} dull, bore, or represent his muse in a tedious way by creating a sonnet as exhausted and cliched as his contemporaries. In his analysis of the couplet, Stephen Booth compares the couplet to a proverb: [...] "My desire is not to dull <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> cannot delight you." [...] Booth suggests that the poet does not wish to make his lover seem common with overabundant praise. Aitkins similarly suggests that the poet does not wish his praises to become annoying. Helen Vendler suggests that the poet uses proverbial language here to address the Fair Youth's seeming obsession with receiving praise; a personal plea would fall on deaf ears, so he makes his case rather impersonal.|$|E

500|$|In February 1870, Wills captained Victoria to a 265-run {{win over}} New South Wales at the MCG. The match {{featured}} Twopenny (Jarrawuk), an Aboriginal paceman who {{was said to}} have been recruited by Lawrence as a foil to Wills' [...] "chucks". Comparing the two, the Melbourne press surmised: [...] "Undoubtedly Wills throws sometimes, but there is some decency about it, some disguise." [...] In March, Victoria trounced a Tasmanian XVI in Launceston under Wills' leadership, though not without criticism of his bowling action. The accusations of throwing were growing louder, and one-time ally Hammersley, now Melbourne's foremost sportswriter, emerged as Wills' most vocal critic. He accused Wills of resorting to throwing to maintain pace as he aged, and criticised him for introducing a type of bouncer designed to injure and intimidate batsmen. The Australasian, Hammersley's newspaper, described Wills' modus operandi: [...] "If I cannot hit your wicket or make you give a chance soon, I'll hit you and hurt <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can. I'll frighten you out." ...|$|E
500|$|Yitzhak Azulay {{composed}} the music played in Fill the Void. He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the film. Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music, and the prayers are [...] "regularly chanted rather than spoken". The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither; Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E

[...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E

Lagun Ein was the lowest ranking member of the 30-member Hanthawaddy delegation led by Byat Za to negotiate the ceasefire terms with their Ava counterparts, and {{to set up a}} meeting between the two kings. During the negotiations, the Ava commander Thado routinely asked Lagun Ein if Pegu was negotiating in good faith. Lagun Ein answered with brutal honesty: [...] "Fool, this is war.

She commented: [...] "I was getting a lot of hate for my body and ‘you’re gaining weight,’ and so I was in Mexico and I was just feeling all of this stuff and I would be lying to <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> said it didn’t kind of hurt my feelings, but I kind of channeled that into my music." [...] Gomez called the experience [...] "degrading", explaining that she had never been through intense bullying before.|$|E

[...] Beck's hard rock treatment of the song made it a highlight of their live performances. [...] Beck biographer Martin Power notes {{the appeal of the}} [...] "dynamic interplay between Jeff's guitar and Rod's [...] voice". [...] Beck utilized fuzz-box and wah-wah pedal guitar effects for his extensive fills around Stewart's vocals as well as his solo. [...] The song concludes with guitar-amplifier feedback, which Beck described in the Truth liner notes: [...] "Last note of song is my guitar being sick – well so would <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> smashed your guts for 2:28". Power adds [...] "Jeff's solo at the end of 'You Shook Me' indeed lived up to his claim, vomiting all over Rod's shoes at the conclusion".|$|E
2500|$|The book Frustrated Witness, {{written by}} former Miami Herald writer Willis Morgan, {{examines}} the Walsh case and cites circumstantial evidence that suggests Jeffrey Dahmer may have killed Adam Walsh. At {{the time of}} Walsh's murder, Dahmer was living a short drive away in Miami Beach and working at a sub shop where he had access to a blue van {{similar to the one}} seen leaving the mall after Walsh's disappearance. A number of witnesses reported seeing a man looking like Dahmer at the mall talking to young boys. When interviewed about Adam in the early 1990s, Dahmer repeatedly denied involvement in the crime, even stating; [...] "I've told you everything—how I killed them, how I cooked them, who I ate. Why wouldn't I tell <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did someone else?" [...] After this rumor surfaced, John Walsh stated that he had [...] "seen no evidence" [...] linking his son's kidnapping and murder to Dahmer.|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes I think it will be good, at other times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E

[...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea.

2500|$|Initial {{criticism}} of Amos Barton was mixed, with Blackwood's close friend W. G. Hamley [...] "dead against Amos" [...] and Thackeray diplomatically noncomittal. However, the complete Scenes of Clerical Life {{was met with}} 'just and discerning applause', and considerable speculation as to the identity of its author. Sales were no better than satisfactory, following a first printing of 1,500 copies, but Blackwood was none the less confident of Eliot's talent. Early reviewers deemed the writer [...] "religious, without cant or intolerance" [...] and [...] "strong in his [...] knowledge of the human heart". It was praised for its realism: one contemporary review noted approvingly that [...] "the fictitious element is securely based upon a broad groundwork of actual truth, truth as well in detail as in general". Due to its subject matter, it was widely assumed to {{be the work of}} a real-life country parson; one such even attempted to take the credit. Popular opinion in Eliot's home town attributed the work to a Mr Joseph Liggins, who attempted ineffectually to deny the rumours, and eventually accepted the undeserved celebrity. George Eliot's [...] "identity" [...] was revealed in a letter to The Times, but this claim was immediately refuted in a letter from Eliot herself. In 1858 Charles Dickens wrote to Eliot to express his approval of the book, and {{was among the first to}} suggest that Scenes of Clerical Life might have been written by a woman.I have been so strongly affected by the two first tales in the book you have had the kindness to send me, through Messrs. Blackwood, that I hope you will excuse my writing to you to express my admiration of their extraordinary merit. The exquisite truth and delicacy both of the humour and the pathos of these stories, I have never seen the like of; and they have impressed me in a manner that I should find it very difficult to describe to <b>you.</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had the impertinence to try. In addressing these few words of thankfulness to the creator of the Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton, and the sad love-story of Mr. Gilfil, I am (I presume) bound to adopt the name that it pleases that excellent writer to assume. I can suggest no better one: but I should have been strongly disposed, if I had been left to my own devices, to address the said writer as a woman. I have observed what seemed to me such womanly touches in those moving fictions, that the assurance on the title-page is insufficient to satisfy me even now. If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman since the world began.|$|E
