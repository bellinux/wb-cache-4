500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Noi doi", when {{translated}} to English, feature {{an invitation to}} a love interest: [...] "Baby/ Would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> a favor/ If you come to the sea/ We would be both under the sun/ Under the sun, both of us". Regarding this, Stan said in a press release: [...] "I am the child of the sea, I feed myself with the sun, I love the energy of the water and I think that's what sea means: happiness, fun, where the stress disappears and also the ideal place to start relationships".|$|E
500|$|A peasant {{told the}} social activist Danilo Dolci in the 1950s how the {{situation}} was in Villalba after the Americans had landed: the Mafia [...] "robbed the storehouses of the agrarian Co-op and the army’s storehouses; sold food, clothes, cars and lorries in Palermo on the black market. In Villalba all power was in their hands: church, Mafia, agricultural banks, latifundia, all {{in the hands of}} the same family … One used to go and see him and ask 'Can <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> this favour?' even for a little affair one had with some other person."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wish <b>me</b> {{to say to}} <b>you?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish <b>me</b> to {{tell you}} it is good? It isn't. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish <b>me</b> to tell you it is well drawn? It isn't. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish <b>me</b> to say it has merit? It hasn't. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish <b>me</b> {{to show you what}} is wrong with it? It is all wrong. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish <b>me</b> to tell <b>you</b> what to <b>do</b> with it? Tear it up. Are you {{satisfied}} now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you're going to say, but they can't <b>do</b> <b>me</b> any good, and <b>you</b> can't <b>do</b> them any good as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>ME,</b> so there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think, sir,' said Mortimer, {{breaking}} the awkward silence with his airy self-possession, 'that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>me</b> the honour to mention my name?' ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{returning}} to the United States in 1919, Austin settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where he intended to study dentistry. Soon, however, he was playing piano and singing in local taverns. He started writing songs and formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere, with whom he wrote [...] "How Come <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Me</b> Like You Do." [...] The act ended when Bergere married. Austin worked briefly in a club owned by Lou Clayton, who later {{was a part of}} the famous vaudeville team Clayton, Jackson and Durante.|$|E
2500|$|Melanie {{had another}} Top 40 hit single in 1973 with [...] "Bitter Bad", {{a song that}} marked a slight {{departure}} from the hippie sentiments of earlier hits (with lyrics such as [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> wrong I'll put your first and last name in my rock n' roll song"). Other chart hits during this period were the self-penned [...] "Together Alone" [...] and a cover of [...] "Will You Love Me Tomorrow". In 1973, Melanie started to retreat from the spotlight to begin a family.|$|E

6000|$|... "You were saying, lady, that I had {{a feeling}} for the {{weakness}} and helplessness of our sex, and surely <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>me</b> justice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not very}} lively, always going about with <b>you.</b> It's always <b>do</b> <b>you</b> love <b>me,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> love <b>me,</b> till I just get about sick of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Adolphe, {{it is not}} nonsense. Do not {{let them}} teach <b>you</b> so. What <b>does</b> love mean, {{if it does not}} mean that? Oh, Adolphe, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> love <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> love <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> love me?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The vogue for {{portrait}} drawings intensified during Catherine de' Medici's life, and she {{may have}} regarded part of her collection as the equivalent of today's family photograph album. Catherine loved having her children painted: [...] "I would like", she wrote in 1547 to her children's governor, Jean d'Humières, [...] "to have paintings of all the children done [...] [...] [...] and sent to me, without delay, {{as soon as they}} are finished". However, the more formal pictures include a high proportion of portraits of European kings and queens, past and present, most of which she probably commissioned personally. On 3 July 1571, Catherine wrote to Monsieur de la Mothe-Fénelon, ambassador in London, discussing the work of François Clouet and requesting a portrait of Queen Elizabeth. Catherine gave detailed instructions: [...] "I pray <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> the pleasure that I may soon have a painting of the queen of England of small volume, in great , and that it be well portrayed and done in the same fashion as the one sent be by the earl of Leicester, and ask, as I already have one in full face, {{it would be better to}} have her turning to the right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don't wish you to give me your opinion about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Again he {{discussed}} his ideas, and she subsequently wrote telling him of her [...] "fear that our {{opinions on the}} most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain." [...] She continued; [...] "my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling." [...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E
