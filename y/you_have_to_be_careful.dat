500|$|While on {{the trail}} in Iowa on November 20 Dodd criticized fellow {{candidates}} who threatened to cut off funding to Pakistan in light of President Pervez Musharraf's suspension of the constitution. He stated [...] "I think it's a very dangerous thing to suggest at this point. We could find ourselves cut off. ... We could not get into Afghanistan except through Pakistan. So {{in addition to the}} issue of nuclear weapons, and who controls them, and a state hostile to our interest, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> how much you threaten." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Moth" [...] {{aired on}} November 3, 2004. The episode was {{directed}} by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini. The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the guitar}} sound, the group tried to balance Grohl's [...] "playing the rhythm {{straight}} up the middle", Shiflett's [...] "sharp and clean sense of melodic playing", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that [...] "with three guitars, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> that it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing their thing really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated." [...] Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett {{and add a}} heavier sound - as Grohl declared, [...] "if we ever felt like a section wasn't heavy enough, we put the fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge." [...] Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills {{at the suggestion of}} Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one of the producer's favorite drummers, Ian Paice.|$|E

500|$|According to Caballero, SpongeBob was {{the most}} {{challenging}} character to translate to stop motion. It was so [...] "...just because of {{the sheer number of}} parts that needed to be made. We wanted to retain as much of that squashy-stretchy goofiness as possible, so he had dozens of replacement parts, like arms, noses, even various sizes of cheeks and freckles. Of course, as the main character, you really want to make sure he will charm the audience, which brings a special kind of pressure." [...] Walsh said, [...] "The {{most important thing is to}} capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D. Puppets have their own kind of energy and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> about what to include and what to leave out." [...] On the other hand, Patchy the Pirate became the easiest character to make [...] "because he has the most humanoid proportions." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the film's opening crawl, Lucas {{originally}} wrote {{a composition}} consisting of six paragraphs with four sentences each. He said, [...] "The crawl {{is such a}} hard thing because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem." [...] Lucas showed his draft to his friends. Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: [...] "The crawl at the beginning {{looks like it was}} written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish." [...] Lucas recounted what De Palma said {{the first time he saw}} it: [...] "George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit down and write this for you." [...] De Palma helped to edit the text into the form used in the film.|$|E

2500|$|After leaving Asylum for Island Records, Waits {{released}} Swordfishtrombones in 1983, {{a record}} that marked a sharp turn in his musical direction. While Waits had before played either piano or guitar, he now gravitated towards less common instruments, saying, [...] "Your hands are like dogs, going to the same places they've been. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> when playing {{is no longer in}} the mind but in the fingers, going to happy places. You have to break them of their habits or you don't explore; you only play what is confident and pleasing. I'm learning to break those habits by playing instruments I know absolutely nothing about, like a bassoon or a waterphone." [...] Swordfishtrombones also introduced instruments such as bagpipes ("Town with No Cheer") and marimba ("Shore Leave") to Waits' repertoire, as well as pump organs, percussion (sometimes reminiscent of the music of Harry Partch), horn sections (often featuring Ralph Carney playing in the style of brass bands or soul music), experimental guitar, and obsolete instruments (many of Waits' albums have featured a damaged, unpredictable Chamberlin, and more recent albums have included the little-used Stroh violin).|$|E
