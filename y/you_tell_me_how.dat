500|$|Hoffman's older brother, Glenn, {{was nine}} years older and played shortstop in the Boston Red Sox organization. During summer {{vacation}} when Hoffman was 10 years old, he joined Glenn while he was playing in Pawtucket. His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg {{asked him how he}} did. Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you did. When I ask you how you did, it's how the team did." [...] Hoffman never forgot that. Given their age difference, Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates. [...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E
2500|$|Rumor {{is that a}} {{pedestrian}} on Fifty-seventh Street, Manhattan, stopped Jascha Heifetz and inquired, [...] "Could <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to get to Carnegie Hall?" [...] "Yes," [...] said Heifetz. [...] "Practice!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During Farber's {{nomination}} proceedings, Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Republican from Bergen County, directed some of {{the most}} pointed queries at Farber. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> many times you've gotten speeding tickets or is it an isolated incident?" [...] Cardinale asked. Farber apologized for her driving history but offered no specifics. She acknowledged some personal difficulties with driving and added,"...I thank the governor for giving me a job with a driver." [...] Cardinale asked Farber about the bench warrants; state records show warrants were issued against her in 1996 and 2003.|$|E
6000|$|... "It 's odd to hear <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to be happy. I don't {{think you}} know yourself, dear uncle. Now, does that sound brutal?" ...|$|R
60|$|HON. JACOB COLLAMER. MY DEAR SIR:--God help me. It is said I have {{offended}} you. I hope <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm better now, thank you," [...] John answered. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> friend, <b>how</b> {{that one}} cottage came among all those fine houses?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a high-pitched}} voice he said, [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to get..." [...] but then quickly {{produced}} a revolver. He shot {{each of the}} victims once and, as they {{fell to the ground}} injured, he fired several more times, striking the apartment building before running away. A neighbor heard the gunshots, rushed out of the apartment building, and saw a blond man rush by gripping a pistol in his left hand. DeMasi {{had been shot in the}} neck, but the wound was not life-threatening. Lomino was hit in the back and hospitalized in serious condition; she was ultimately rendered a paraplegic.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the very}} platform, {{in that moment}} of bustle, Phoebe conscientiously and {{reasonably}} began, 'Will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> much you mean by that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I feared {{this when}} I {{saw he was}} not with <b>you.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> it happened. It {{is not the first}} shrewd blow fate has dealt me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bartley," [...] {{she said}} tremulously, [...] "I wish <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> felt {{justified}} in writing out Mr. Kinney's life in that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You said, {{speaking}} for your friend, that <b>you</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{to do something}} useful and good. Something {{that you would like}} done, is it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, not yet, Mr. Petter," [...] said she; [...] "I want <b>you</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came to {{have that}} little turret over the {{thatched}} roof." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear old Ethel! Aunt, it is a {{thing that}} no one has told me yet. Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> she bore the news of Norman Ogilvie's engagement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me quite earnestly for a moment, then said, [...] "And can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> much is two-an'-two-an'-two-an'-two-an'-two-an'- two?"--and several more two's all in a rapid strain.|$|E
6000|$|Peter nodded. [...] "More than that, Mr. Toad. I {{think you}} have a little the best of it," [...] he replied. [...] "Now won't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you did it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--I'm not a cousin. It's {{more like}} a foster-brother, you know. Of course I shan't call you Mary if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> not. <b>How</b> is it to be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But surely," [...] I cried, [...] "you {{will give}} me some reason! This is unlike <b>you,</b> Agatha. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I have been unfortunate enough to offend you." ...|$|R
6000|$|The invalid {{shook his}} head impatiently. [...] "You're an ungrateful dog," [...] he muttered, [...] "or <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> your affair is going. Have you got any chance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never heard}} her name,' said Newman, choking with his energy. 'Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me?</b> <b>How</b> was I to know? We might, at least, {{have had some}} time to think!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> near {{we are to}} a sea-port? We {{have just}} landed from a {{pleasure}} yacht which was destroyed by fire, and haven't any idea where we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{was waiting}} to hear more of it from <b>you.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> in the world you're so certain about the {{fittings}} of the ship. You know nothing of ships." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean, {{and if you}} won't be serious I shall {{think there is no}} {{seriousness}} in you. I want <b>you</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> it can be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Rollo, {{after a short}} pause, [...] "I wish, Jonas, <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{the bubbles}} of air get down into the mud, {{at the bottom of}} the brook." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What am I to say then? How am I to {{call back}} to his {{recollection}} {{the fact that he}} committed himself, unless <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> and when he did so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must be {{a little}} better acquainted, Amelius, with you and Tadmor before I can answer your question. Suppose <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you {{became one of the}} Socialists, to begin with?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{was waiting}} to hear more of it from <b>you.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{in the world you}} re so certain about the {{fittings}} of the ship. You know nothing of ships." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} is true enough, Galleygo; but take my advice, and knock off with the ale for to-night. Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> the land lies, {{with the rest of}} the company?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Martin laughed. [...] "I shouldn't wonder," [...] he said, [...] "if we {{were about}} square. Well, if <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> found it out, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear maidens," [...] said he, {{when they}} paused to take breath, [...] "now {{that you know}} my name, will <b>you</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I am to reach the garden of the Hesperides?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] {{chimed in}} McLean. [...] "I {{see it is}} evident <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> Tommy Sandys will do," [...] but at that Cathro's rush of words again {{subsided}} into a dribble.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{no doubt}} {{it is a very}} good neighbourhood,' said Lord St. Erme, rising. 'I must go, or we shall miss the train. Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> soon you expect Lord Martindale?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dearest sister, now be serious. I {{want to talk}} very seriously. Let me {{know every}} thing that I am to know, without delay. Will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> long you have loved him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I {{can help}} you," [...] I said, [...] "I {{want to know}} one thing more. Have you decided in this serious matter entirely by yourself? Have you taken no advice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] whispered Sweet Fern, {{with his}} mouth close to the student's ear, [...] "that <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> big {{were some of the}} oak-trees that grew between the giant's toes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Jos, majestically, [...] "when I want money, I {{know where}} to ask for it. And as for my sister, <b>you</b> needn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I ought to behave to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adrian," [...] he said, [...] "I am much {{pleased with}} you. I don't {{want to get}} you into a row, but I should be much obliged if <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> all this happened." ...|$|R
