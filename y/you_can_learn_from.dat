This external evaluation model typically consists of an independent evaluator who is intentionally screened from the program’s stated goals and objectives in hopes of reducing potential goal-related tunnel vision.

If the program is achieving its stated goals and objectives, then these achievements should show up; if not, it is argued, they are irrelevant" [...] The goal-free evaluator attempts to observe and measure all actual outcomes, effects, or impacts, intended or unintended, all without being cued to the program’s intentions.
