25|$|You are {{catching}} fish {{with a small}} net. It is possible {{that more than one}} fish can go into the net at the same time. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> the net multiple times until you have got at least n fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{initialization}} declares (and perhaps assigns to) any variables required. The type of {{a variable}} should be same if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> multiple variables in initialization part. The condition checks a condition, and quits the loop if false. The afterthought is performed exactly once every time the loop ends and then repeats.|$|E

Provided <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> an operating system and browser that can handle Unicode, and have the correct Unicode fonts installed, {{some or all of}} these will display correctly.

25|$|You are {{catching}} fish as in example 1, but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> a big net. You {{are setting up}} the net one day and coming {{back the next day}} to remove the net. You count how many fish you have caught and then you go home regardless of how many fish you have caught. Each fish has a probability of getting into the net that is proportional to its weight but independent of what happens to the other fish.|$|E
25|$|A birth {{certificate}} can {{be filled with}} a handwritten way and {{with the use of}} technical equipment (typewriters, computers). When filling in the form is carried handwritten way, all records are made legibly in ink or paste blue or black. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> a computer or typewriter dye must be black. The quality of paste, ink, dye, used in completing the documents should ensure the preservation of text documents for a set retention period. When filling out the {{birth certificate}} is not allowed to have it in patches, blots and erasures, cuts.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} error or bias occurs {{when there is}} a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of {{systematic error}} is if, unknown to you, the pulse oximeter <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).|$|E

2500|$|For {{calculations}} involving annuities, {{you must}} decide whether the payments are made {{at the end of}} each period (known as an ordinary annuity), or at the beginning of each period (known as an annuity due). If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> a financial calculator or a spreadsheet, you can usually set it for either calculation. [...] The following formulas are for an ordinary annuity. [...] If you want the answer for the present value of an annuity due simply multiply the PV of an ordinary annuity by (1 + i).|$|E
2500|$|Parsimony {{methods are}} {{intuitively}} appealing and highly efficient, {{such that they}} are still used in some cases to seed maximum likelihood optimization algorithms with an initial phylogeny. However, the underlying assumption that evolution attained a certain end result as fast as possible is inaccurate. Natural selection and evolution do not work towards a goal, they simply select for or against randomly occurring genetic changes. Parsimony methods impose six general assumptions: that the phylogenetic tree <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> is correct, that you have all of the relevant data, in which no mistakes were made in coding, that all branches of the phylogenetic tree are equally likely to change, that the rate of evolution is slow, and that the chance of losing or gaining a characteristic is the same. In reality, assumptions are often violated, leading to several issues: ...|$|E
5000|$|Azerbaijani has {{informal}} and formal ways of saying things. This {{is because there}} is more than one meaning to [...] "you" [...] in Turkic languages like Azerbaijani and Turkish (as well as in many other languages). The informal <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> when talking to close friends, relatives, animals or children.

2500|$|It is {{important}} to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living. It recommends contacting a medical professional if [...] "you can’t deal with grief, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life."

In the Southern United States, y'all (<b>you</b> all) <b>is</b> <b>used</b> as a plural form, {{and various other}} phrases such as <b>you</b> guys <b>are</b> <b>used</b> in other places. An archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference <b>is</b> thou, <b>thee,</b> thyself, thy, thine, which <b>are</b> still <b>used</b> in religious services and {{can be seen in}} older works, such as Shakespeare's - in such texts, the you set of pronouns <b>are</b> <b>used</b> for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal V-form. <b>You</b> can also <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as an indefinite pronoun, referring to a person in general (see generic you) compared to the more formal alternative, one (reflexive oneself, possessive one's).|$|R
