500|$|Williams was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of women in academia; according to Nussbaum, he was [...] "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." [...] He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams's mentors at Oxford, said that he [...] "understands what you're going to say better than <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> yourself, and sees all the possible objections to it, and all the possible answers to all the possible objections, before you've got to the end of your own sentence." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferguson {{was proud}} of his team's performance, but {{admitted}} their failure throughout the season to convert chances into goals, had cost them once more. Of the game, he continued: [...] "In cup football, you need a break and we didn't get one. We've had luck in the past, so <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> can happen. It's not a nice experience but it's one you have to accept." [...] Ferguson criticised the referee for failing to send Vieira off during extra-time as he fouled Rooney, and labelled Arsenal as [...] "boring" [...] for deploying negative tactics. Keane, like his manager, rued the missed opportunities and said it was a small consolation: [...] "We dominated but I'm sure the Arsenal players won't be too bothered about that – they've got the winners' medals and the cup and we haven't." ...|$|E
500|$|The jury {{returned}} guilty verdicts for {{all eight}} defendants. Before being sentenced, Neebe {{told the court}} that Schaack's officers were among the city's worst gangs, ransacking houses and stealing money and watches. Schaack laughed and Neebe retorted, [...] "You need not laugh about it, Captain Schaack. You are one of them. You are an anarchist, as <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> You are all anarchists, in this sense of the word, I must say." [...] Judge Gary sentenced seven of the defendants to death by hanging and Neebe to 15 years in prison. The sentencing provoked outrage from labor and workers' movements and their supporters, resulting in protests around the world, and elevating the defendants {{to the status of}} martyrs, especially abroad. Portrayals of the anarchists as bloodthirsty foreign fanatics in the press along with the 1889 publication of Captain Schaack's sensational account, Anarchy and Anarchism, on the other hand, inspired widespread public fear and revulsion against the strikers and general anti-immigrant feeling, polarizing public opinion.|$|E

500|$|Jet {{magazine}} reported [...] "Janet's innovative stage performances {{during her}} world tours have won her {{a reputation as}} a world-class performer." [...] Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times stated the [...] "enthralling" [...] choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour [...] "represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." [...] When Jackson was asked [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> when people talk about [...] in terms of Broadway?", she responded, [...] "I'm crazy about Broadway ... That's what I grew up on." [...] Her [...] "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" [...] tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasn't always evident in stadiums... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered in 20-plus years." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 16, 1986, Slippery When Wet was {{released}}. The album reached {{number one}} in U.S., where it spent 8 weeks at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 album chart. The first two singles from the album, [...] "You Give Love a Bad Name" [...] and [...] "Livin' on a Prayer", both reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Slippery When Wet was named the top selling album of 1987 by Billboard [...] "Livin' On A Prayer" [...] won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance. The band won an award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band at the American Music Awards and an award for Favorite Rock Group at the People's Choice Awards. When Slippery When Wet was released in August 1986, Bon Jovi was the support act for 38 Special. By the end of 1986, Bon Jovi were well into six months of headline dates in arenas across America. In August 1987, the band headlined England's [...] "Monsters of Rock" [...] festival. During their set Dee Snider, Bruce Dickinson and Paul Stanley joined the band to perform [...] "We're an American Band". The band ended the year having headlined 130 shows in the [...] "Tour Without End", grossing $28,400,000. Jon Bon Jovi was asked what this breakthrough to worldwide fame meant, to which he answered, [...] "Everything is bigger, and it moves twice as fast. You're recognized twice as often. This is bigger, the whole world gets bigger. You have to sell more records, be huger. You get smarter and you understand the business a little more, so it's more responsibility. <b>You</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> now, and {{you want to make sure}} everything goes right".|$|E
