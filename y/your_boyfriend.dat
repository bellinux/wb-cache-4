500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Anime News Network, Mikhail Koulikov {{wrote that}} readers would have various reactions to The One I Love: {{he felt that}} some would regard it as [...] "charming" [...] and others would find it upsetting that the female protagonists were primarily defined by their worry over their relationships. While considering it one of Clamp's minor works, he stated that it was [...] "unusual" [...] for including some colored pages when the majority of manga is printed in black and white; being a slice-of-life manga; and featuring Tsubaki Nekoi's art, as prior {{to the time of}} his review, most of their works translated into English had been drawn by another member of Clamp. Koulikov wrote that [...] "insecurity and self-doubt" [...] served as the theme of the anthology. Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, wrote that some of the stories were worrisome, particularly one that she felt [...] "justifies having an interest in whatever <b>your</b> <b>boyfriend</b> likes," [...] and contained stereotypes as a result of limited space. She also stated that the essays included generalizations about women and [...] "quickly become redundant." [...] In , Mason Templar suggested a possible theme of being one's self in [...] relationships, but felt that it appeared [...] "almost anti-feminist in execution," [...] as only the female characters underwent a change in behavior. Templar rated the series one-and-a-half out of four stars, and criticized it as a naïve take on romance; Templar suggested Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, or Man of Many Faces as better examples of Clamp's romantic manga. A reviewer of the French edition wrote that repetitive nature of the stories detracted from the manga's appeal, and made for a [...] "laborious" [...] reading experience, although the reviewer felt that a [...] "romantic" [...] reader would not mind this. Conversely, another reviewer for Anime News Network, Liann Cooper, wrote that the stories were [...] "incredibly sweet and touching" [...] and were best read a few stories at a time. According to Cooper, The One I Love would appeal to fans of Clamp or shōjo, manga targeted towards girls.|$|E
