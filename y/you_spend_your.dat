500|$|... "Call the Shots" [...] is a dance-pop and pop rock track {{written in}} the key of D major and with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. Unlike previous singles released by the band, the song follows the verse–chorus form. The lyrics {{are concerned with the}} ending of a relationship, and opens with a repetitive melody followed by Coyle singing, [...] "Static tone on the phone, I'll be breaking again / Must be something better babe". As the chorus begins, the five members of the group trade lines and sing, [...] "Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me / It really doesn't faze me how <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> time", with Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stating that [...] "only anterograde amnesia could wipe [...] from your brain". During the middle-eight, Roberts sings lyrics that were the inspiration for Girls Aloud's autobiography Dreams that Glitter – Our Story, released in 2008: [...] "I've seen life burn bright, seen it shimmer / Then fade like starlight to a glimmer, oh no / I've seen life flow by like a river / So full of twilight, dreams that glitter". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that the instrumentation of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] was based on 1990s dance productions, and added that it incorporated [...] "oohs" [...] and [...] "ah ah ahs" [...] that [...] "reverberate around an infectious chorus," ...|$|E
2500|$|Gooch's {{commitment}} to England cricket and {{passion for the}} game remains. When commenting on the new England coaching role he said: [...] "It {{came out of the}} blue. I met Andy at Trent Bridge when I was working for radio and I was a bit surprised when he asked me to do it. But <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> <b>your</b> career trying to do your bit for England and when you're asked to help again the call of your country is special.". He has since remained as England's batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch's influence on England's and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England's batting (or 'run-scoring', as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.|$|E
