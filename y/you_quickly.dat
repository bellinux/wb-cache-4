500|$|The Saturn's design {{elicited}} mixed commentary among game {{developers and}} journalists. Developers quoted by Next Generation in December 1995 described the Saturn as [...] "a real coder's machine" [...] for [...] "those {{who love to}} get their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware", with [...] "more flexibility" [...] and [...] "more calculating power than the PlayStation". The Saturn's sound board was also widely praised. By contrast, Lobotomy Software programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly slower than the PlayStation, whereas Kenji Eno of WARP observed little {{difference between the two}} systems. In particular, Dreisbach criticized the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals as its basic geometric primitive, in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. Ken Humphries of Time Warner Interactive remarked that compared to the PlayStation, the Saturn was markedly worse at generating polygons but markedly better at sprite-based graphics. Third-party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful software libraries and development tools, requiring developers to write in assembly language to achieve good performance. During early Saturn development, programming in assembly could offer a two-to-fivefold speed increase over higher-level languages like C.s number crunching was handled by four serial DSPs that were way too costly to be included in any home system. Sega's consequent development of the SH-2 meant that it could also produce a Saturn-compatible arcade system.}} The Saturn hardware is considered extremely difficult to emulate. Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier. Sega of America also purchased a United Kingdom-based development firm, Cross Products, to produce the Saturn's official development system. Despite these challenges, Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn. Traveller's Tales' Jon Burton opined that while the PlayStation was easier [...] "to get started on... <b>you</b> <b>quickly</b> reach [...] limits", whereas the Saturn's [...] "complicated" [...] hardware had the ability to [...] "improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly." [...] A major point of criticism was the Saturn's use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space. The PlayStation functioned in a similar manner, but also featured a dedicated [...] "Geometry Transfer Engine" [...] that rendered additional polygons. As a result, several analysts described the Saturn as an [...] "essentially" [...] 2D system.|$|E
2500|$|Bernard-Henri Lévy, one of {{the intellectuals}} who was criticized, called on the French anti-globalization {{movement}} to distance itself from Ramadan. In an interview with Le Monde, Lévy said: [...] "Mr. Ramadan, dear anti-globalizationist friends, is not and cannot be one of yours. ... I call you on <b>you</b> <b>quickly</b> to distance yourselves from this character who, in crediting {{the idea of an}} elitist conspiracy under the control of Zionism, is only inflaming people’s thoughts and opening the way to the worst." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, Lynch {{moved with}} his wife and {{daughter}} to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the AFI Conservatory, a place that he would later describe as being [...] "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great... <b>you</b> <b>quickly</b> learned that {{if you were going to}} get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing." [...] He began writing a script for a proposed work titled Gardenback, which had [...] "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his Gardenback project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that Gardenback was [...] "wrecked", he instead set about on a new film, which he called Eraserhead.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, <b>you</b> <b>quickly</b> realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
