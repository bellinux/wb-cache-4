40|$|Abstract—In many {{practical}} situations, molecules can {{be obtained}} from a “template ” molecule like benzene by replacing some of its hydrogen atoms with ligands (other atoms or atom groups). There can be many possible replacements of this type. To avoid time-consuming testing of all possible replacements, it is desirable to test some of the replacements and then extrapolate to others – so that only the promising molecules, for which the extrapolated values are desirable, will have to be synthesized and tested. For this extrapolation, D. J. Klein <b>and</b> <b>co-authors</b> <b>proposed</b> to use a Dempster-Shafer-type poset extrapolation technique developed by G. -C. Rota from MIT. One of the limitations of this approach is that this technique has been originally proposed on a heuristic basis, with no convincing justification of its applicability to chemical (or other) problems. In our previous paper, we showed that for the case when all the ligands are of the same type, the poset technique is actually equivalent to a more familiar (and much more justified) Taylor series extrapolation. In this paper, we show that this equivalence can be extended to the case when we have variant ligands...|$|R

The work is motivated by the desire to build maps without having to use odometry, and to build maps with multiple robots without requiring the robots to see each other. Each robot builds a map incrementally by matching geometric features (segments and angles between them) in the environment with features previously obtained, The partial maps produced by each robot are then merged again using feature matching.|$|R

40|$|To {{clarify the}} complex {{interaction}} between mechanical and biological processes in natural or artificial (surgical) phenomena, {{the knowledge of}} the properties of biological tissues is required. It is also of interest for biochemistry, biophysics, cardiology, radiology, physiology, surgery, and pathology. In particular we require a constitutive formulation to be capable of reflecting an actual experimental data over the wide range of deformation and stresses. The constitutive equations should ideally be relatively simple, involving a few parameters, capable to predict the material response of biological tissue subject to a static or dynamic load. Almost 30 years ago Y. C. Fung <b>and</b> <b>co-authors</b> <b>proposed</b> the algorithm, which became classical and popular nowadays, using in vitro measurements to identify the stress-strain relationship of the arterial wall. The method is based on two integral static equilibrium conditions, comprising the load factors (internal pressure and axial force), radial distributions of strain tensor components, and material constants of the Fung’s pseudo-elastic model. Using the set of measured outer diameters for the combinations of internal pressure and an axil force loads, as well as an empirical distribution of strain components, the integral equations have been discretized, and solved for the four unknown hyperelastic constants. The new algorithm, proposed in the present work, is based on a 3 D theoretical model, and does not require a priori empirical knowledge of any distributions. The two measurements of the principal stretch ratios at the internal and external radii of the arterial vessel cross section serve as boundary conditions for the utilized 3 D theoretical model, accounting for an arbitrary hyperelasticity and finite deformations. Applying the least square methodology to provide the best fit between available set of measurements and theoretical prediction, the material constants of the arbitrary nonlinear anisotropic constituent model are identified. As a side effect of this approach the residual stress in artery is identified as well. Two algorithms serving for in-vivo approaches are developed to identify the stress- strain relationship of the arterial wall based on PPG (photoplethysmography) measurements of the pulse wave velocity (PWV) propagation, or the strain tensor components, based on ultrasound measurements. Examples of applications of a hyperelastic finite deformation 3 D nonlinear model, and 2 D thin walled membrane shell model to in-vivo identification of biological tissues properties are presented...|$|R

All of the reported clustering algorithms (except the one reported in Hammer et al., 2015) operate on Bayesian principles, which is understandable because these principles constitute the basis of optimal PR. Recently, Oommen <b>and</b> his <b>co-authors</b> have <b>proposed</b> a novel, counter-intuitive and pioneering PR scheme that is radically opposed to the Bayesian principle.
