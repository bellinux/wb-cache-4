The protesters objected to the plotline of a Partisan collaborating with the Nazis. This runs directly counter to the accepted historical version of events, ruled by an Italian military court in 2005, that the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre was entirely premeditated by the Germans with no reason except the aim to frighten the population.

However, Lee, unrepentant, stated [...] "I am not apologizing." [...] He told Italians there was [...] "a lot about <b>your</b> <b>history</b> you have yet {{to come to grips}} with.

[...] McBride, the novel's author, stated: [...] "As a black American, I understand what it's like for someone to tell <b>your</b> <b>history...</b> unfortunately, the history of World War Two here in Italy is ours as well, and this was the best I could do... it is, after all, a work of fiction.” ...|$|E

500|$|Along with musicians D'Angelo and Erykah Badu, Maxwell was {{credited}} with helping to shape the [...] "neo soul" [...] movement that rose to prominence during the late 1990s. Along with D'Angelo's Brown Sugar (1995) and Badu's Baduizm (1997), Urban Hang Suite has been recognized by writers for beginning neo soul's popularity and helping the genre obtain commercial visibility. However, in contrast to D'Angelo, Maxwell was more conventional in his approach on his debut album. The term [...] "neo soul" [...] was penned in the late 1990s by record executive Kedar Massenburg, who managed both D'Angelo and Erykah Badu. According to Shapiro, the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from more classical styles, and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival, while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R counterparts. In commenting on the [...] "new soul revival" [...] in music, Maxwell told Entertainment Weekly in 1997 that [...] "everything out there musically was inspired or influenced by something from the past. It's not about creating some super-fresh new thing. If it doesn't lend itself to <b>your</b> <b>history,</b> {{how is it going}} to extend to your future?" [...] According to Kerika Fields, Maxwell received an overwhelmingly positive reaction to his debut album from music listeners due to their weariness of contemporary black music's predictability.|$|E

Burke wrote a letter to Barruel and expressed his admiration. He wrote, [...] "I cannot easily express to you how much I am instructed and delighted by the first volume of <b>your</b> <b>History</b> of Jacobinism." [...] He praised [...] "the whole of the wonderful narrative" [...] for being supported by documents and proofs with [...] "the most judicial regularity and exactness." [...] At the end of the letter Burke added: [...] "I forgot to say, that I have known myself, personally, five of your principal conspirators; and I can undertake to say from my own certain knowledge, that {{as far back as the}} year 1773, they were busy in the plot you have so well described, and in the manner, and on the principle you have so truly represented. To this I can speak as a witness." [...] Burkes own works were also filled with references to the philosophe sect and a dislike for their fanaticism, atheism and perversion of public morals.|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky {{returned}} as the costume designer for Jessica Jones from Daredevil, and was assisted {{on the first}} episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' costume of leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots.

And what you might discover is that, as illustrated, they kind of do wear the same thing all the time." [...] Maslansky also stated that [...] "everyone has a very specific look, and you can vary within that look, but it’s not over the top. It has to feel realistic and feel very grounded in this authentic reality we’ve created in Hell’s Kitchen." [...] On Jones' costume, Maslansky said she [...] "considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way." [...] At least 10 versions of Jones' jacket were made, which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any [...] "bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details" [...] removed, while 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both being aged and distressed.|$|E
