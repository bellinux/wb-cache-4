500|$|... "Follow Me Home" [...] {{was written}} by the Sugababes—Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena, and Heidi Range—in {{collaboration}} with Jonathan Lipsey, Karen Poole, and Jeremy Shaw, for the group's fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways (2005). Lipsey developed {{the idea of a}} close person as the song's inspiration. Buena wrote the first verse based upon her daughter Tahlia, who was born in March 2005. While writing the verse, she pondered questions such as 'What would <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> if she was ever in trouble?', and 'How would you say, I’ll always be there for you?'. Buena wanted people to interpret the verse in different ways, and stated that the lyrics came naturally. Buchanan drew inspiration from her close friend when she wrote the other verse. Lipsey produced the song under his production name Jony Rockstar. [...] "Follow Me Home" [...] was mixed and engineered at Metropolis Studios by Tom Elmhirst and Richard Wilkinson, respectively.|$|E

6000|$|... "But, stop!" [...] cried Lawrence, on {{his feet}} again. [...] "You must tell me more than that. Did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> only what I said to you? How did it affect her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why do {{you look}} so terrified, my darling? What have <b>you</b> been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> old villain?' and the Amal raised his whip.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! I {{know you}} always are for Lady Merrifield! But what do <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> then, <b>to</b> <b>her</b> prying into all that poor child's correspondence?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{his father}} {{burst into tears}} and said, 'If she comes again <b>you</b> must <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that your parents bid her take her forfeit at once, and depart.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} the sort!" [...] said the minister's wife. [...] "She's easily seen; she {{generally}} sits in the front yard. Only take care what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and be very sure you are polite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{tell her}} so. Let there be some one bright spot in what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> on which her mind may fix itself. If she be not {{altogether}} hardened, that letter will drive her to despair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yours? Who {{has been}} paying the rent for you, these four months past? You! What can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her?</b> What {{can you do}} for her? Young pedant, you must be in love {{yourself}} before you can help poor creatures who are in love!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What have <b>you</b> been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> Dickory?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Do {{you know}} {{something}} we have not heard? Have you been giving her news of her father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But tell Mrs. Haney I've {{gone up to}} the mine. <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Williams {{sent for}} me. You can tell <b>her,</b> but <b>to</b> no one else, what <b>you</b> heard Dan <b>say.</b> <b>You</b> understand?" ...|$|R
60|$|H'm, I think bed's {{the place}} for <b>you,</b> Fanny. <b>Say</b> good-night <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ladyship and let's be going.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not!" [...] replied her master. [...] "Stay here, Lecount, {{and keep}} us company. Mrs. Lecount has my fullest confidence," [...] he continued, {{addressing}} Magdalen. [...] "Whatever {{you say to}} me, ma'am, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She is a domestic treasure. There is not another house in England has such a treasure as Mrs. Lecount." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure I shall beg nothing, Mr. Arabin, {{which you}} will not grant, and I do beg for an answer. Do you not as a rule think women below your notice as {{companion}}s? Let us see. There is the Widow Bold looking round at you from her chair this minute. What would <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as a companion for life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe she}} ever went out hunting {{in her life}} before she saw you. You mounted her,--and gave her a horse,--and took her out,--and brought her home. Everybody at Mistletoe knew all about it. My brother and the Duchess were told of it. It {{was one of those}} things that are plain to {{everybody}} as the nose on your face. What did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> when you were coming home in that postchaise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Add fairy-princess gag. <b>Say</b> there's {{something}} <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Heave {{a couple}} of sighs. Grab her hand. And give her the works. Right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now mind!" [...] he said. [...] "You {{are going}} to see, if it is goot or bad <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> that she has had those nice white arms of hers round the wrong brodder. You {{are going to}} tell me afterwards, if <b>you</b> dare <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> in plain English words, 'Blue-Face is the man.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at the end, and see {{if there}} isn't a piece of poetry pasted in. You learn that, and see how funny Celia will look when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She wrote it when she was a girl, and {{somebody}} had it printed for other children. I like it best, myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No wicked Indian, I grant you; no wicked Indian, sartainly. He is {{obliged to}} carry the ammunition, and to look on without sharing in the sport, and to cook, and to light the fires, and to do every thing that isn't manful. Now, mind; I don't tell you these are my idees, but they are Hist's idees, and, therefore, {{for the sake of}} peace the less <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ag'in 'em, the better." ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{the more}} {{particular}} upon this Part, because, however the Devil {{may have been}} the first that ever practised it, yet I can assure him the Experiment has been tried upon many a Woman since, to the wheedling her out of her Modesty, as well as her Simplicity; and the Cunning Men tell us still, that if you can come at a Woman when she is in a deep sleep, and Whisper to her close to her Ear, she will certainly Dream of the Thing <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and so will a Man too.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all--she never dismisses them--they go theirselves. Ye see 'tis like this. She's got a {{very quick}} temper; she flees in a passion with them for nothing at all; next mornen they come up and say they are going; she's sorry for it and wishes they'd stay, but she's as proud as a lucifer, and her pride won't let her say, [...] "Stay," [...] and away they go. 'Tis like this in fact. If <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about anybody, [...] "Ah, poor thing!" [...] she says, [...] "Pooh! indeed!" [...] If you say, [...] "Pooh, indeed!" [...] "Ah, poor thing!" [...] she says directly. She hangs the chief baker, as mid be, and restores the chief butler, as mid be, though the devil but Pharaoh herself can see the {{difference}} between 'em.' ...|$|E
6000|$|DAVID. No, by God! [But {{his love}} for MAGGIE {{steadies}} him. There is even a note of entreaty in his voice.] Have <b>you</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> man? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not? <b>You</b> mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at {{the right}} time all that a man can. Till that time comes I haven't the least doubt she understands you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He added a {{touch or}} two, {{and then gave}} her his sketch. She looked at it, but she went on with her idea of a moment before. [...] "If a woman were to ask you <b>to</b> marry <b>her</b> <b>you</b> would <b>say,</b> 'Certainly, my dear, with pleasure!' And you would marry her and be ridiculously happy. Then {{at the end of}} three months <b>you</b> would <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> 'You know that blissful day when I begged you to be mine!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most decidedly!" [...] {{answered}} the captain. [...] "The whole {{success of the}} enterprise depends on your keeping away. Mrs. Lecount will try the credibility of everything <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> by one test--the test of your communicating, or not, with this house. She will watch you night and day! Don't call here, don't send messages, don't write letters; don't even go out by yourself. Let her see you start for St. Crux on her suggestion, with the absolute certainty in her own mind that you have followed her advice without communicating it in any form whatever to me or to my niece. Do that, and she must believe you, on {{the best of all}} evidence for our interests, and the worst for hers--the evidence of her own senses." ...|$|E
6000|$|Take {{the silver}} wreath and {{knock at the}} windows of the goddess Venus. When she says, [...] "Who is there?" [...] answer that you have come on foot and lost your way on the heath. She will then tell you to go your way back again; but take care not to stir from the spot. Instead, be sure <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "No, indeed I shall do nothing of the sort, as from my {{childhood}} I have heard stories of the beauty of the goddess Venus, and it was not for nothing that I had shoes made of leather with soles of steel, and have travelled for nine years and nine months, and have won in battle the silver wreath, which I hope you may allow me to give you, and have done and suffered everything to be where I now am." [...] This is what you must say. What happens after is your affair.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Can't <b>you</b> try <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{a word or}} two {{to prove}} you care for her, Jamie? She is so fond of you," [...] {{continued}} his mother. [...] "I don't want to interfere with your private concerns, but I think it's only thoughtlessness on your part; and I'm sure you don't wish to make Mary miserable. Poor thing, she's so unhappy at home; she yearns for a little affection.... Won't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> something <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about your marriage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No more a witch than I am a warlock," [...] {{said the}} honest smith: [...] "a poor, broken hearted thing, that, if she hath done evil, has dreed a sore weird for it. Be kind <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> And you, my musical damsel, I will call on you {{tomorrow}} morning, and carry {{you to the}} waterside. This old woman will treat you kindly if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>her</b> but what becomes honest ears." ...|$|R
60|$|KNOX. [shortly and sternly] Amelia: {{this is your}} job. [To Margaret] I {{leave you}} to your mother. I shall have my own say in the matter when I hear what <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [He goes out, solemn and offended].|$|R
5000|$|In April 2007, Ferrell and Adam McKay {{launched}} [...] "Funny or Die", a {{streaming video}} website where short comedy films are uploaded and voted on by users. One of the featured shorts, The Landlord, stars Ferrell {{as a man}} harassed for the rent by his landlady, a swearing, beer-loving, two-year-old girl, played by McKay's own daughter, Pearl. Child psychologists have criticized Ferrell and the McKay family for child exploitation, to which McKay responded: Fortunately she is in this great stage now where she repeats anything <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and then forgets it right away, which is key. She has not said the 'B-word' since we shot the thing. Adam McKay They followed {{with the release of}} a video entitled [...] "Good Cop, Baby Cop" [...] which also starred baby Pearl; the end of the video stated that this would be her final appearance and wished her a happy [...] "baby retirement." ...|$|E
50|$|Nadine is a {{realistic}} female humanoid social robot that is modelled on {{the director of}} the Institute for Media Innovation (IMI) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Professor Nadia Magnenat Thalmann. The robot has a strong human-likeness with a natural-looking skin and hair and realistic hands. Nadine is a socially intelligent robot who is friendly, greets you back, makes eye contact, and remembers all the conversations you had with her. She is able to answer questions in several languages, show emotions both in her gestures and in her face depending on the content of the interaction with the user. Nadine can recognize people she has previously met and engage in flowing conversation. Nadine is also fitted with a personality, meaning her mood can sour depending on what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Nadine has a total of 27 degrees of freedom for facial expressions and upper body movements. She can recognise anybody she has met, and remembers facts and events related to each person. She can assist people with special needs by reading stories, showing images, put on Skype sessions, send emails, and communicate with the family. She can play the role of a personal, private coach always available when nobody is there.|$|E
40|$|A satire on the Democrats' {{approach}} to the delicate question of the annexation of Texas. In marked contrast to his portrayal of the issue as a beautiful woman in "Virtuous Harry" (no. 1844 - 27), the artist here presents Texas as the ugly hag War or Chaos, brandishing a dagger, pistols, whips, and manacles. She embodies {{the threat of war}} with Mexico, feared by American opponents of annexation. The whips and manacles in her left hand may also allude to slavery, whose expansion into the new territory was desired by southern annexationists. Bucholzer parodies Van Buren's evasion of the controversial and sectionally divisive issue and Democratic candidates Polk and Dallas's motives in favoring the measure. Senators Thomas Hart Benton and John C. Calhoun confront Van Buren with Texas, whom they support on a plank across their shoulders. Calhoun says, "Come, Matty, we introduce you to the Texas Question, what do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> Ladyship?" Van Buren, backing away, replies, "Take any other shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble!" Andrew Jackson, who prods Van Buren from behind with his cane says, "Stand up to your lick-log Matty or by the Eternal you'll back into Salt River before you know it. " In the background right are Polk and Dallas. Polk says, "What say you Dallas? She's not the handsomest Lady I ever saw but that $ 25, 000 a year [...] Eh! it's worth a little stretching of Conscience!" (The annual salary of a U. S. President was $ 25, 000.) Drawn by H. Bucholzer. Entered... 1844 by James Baillie. Lithography & print coloring on reasonable terms by James Baillie No. 33 Spruce St. N. Y.
