5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{presence}} of British missionaries, military advisers and diplomats in Antananarivo {{in the early}} part of Rainilaiarivony's administration, the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal led the British to shift their focus to reducing French presence in Egypt, at the expense of their own long-standing interests in Madagascar. When Jean Laborde died in 1878 and Rainilaiarivony refused to allow his heirs to inherit Malagasy land accorded him under RadamaII's Lambert Charter, France had a pretext for invasion. Rainilaiarivony sent a diplomatic mission to England and France to negotiate release of their claims on Malagasy lands and was successful in brokering a new agreement with the British. Talks with the French conducted between November 1881 and August 1882 broke down without reaching consensus on the status of French land claims. Consequently, France launched the First Franco-Hova War in 1883 and occupied the coastal port towns of Mahajanga, Antsiranana, Toamasina and Vohemar. Queen Ranavalona II died during the height of these hostilities in July 1883. Rainilaiarivony chose her 22-year-old niece, Princess Razafindrahety, to replace her under the throne name Ranavalona III. It was widely rumored that Rainilaiarivony may have ordered the poisoning of Razafindrahety's first husband in order to free the princess to become his spouse and queen. Thirty-three years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> new husband, Ranavalona III was relegated to a largely ceremonial role during her reign, while the Prime Minister continued to manage the critical affairs of state. In December 1885, Rainilaiarivony successfully negotiated the cessation of hostilities in the first Franco-Hova War.|$|E

50|$|Zubaidah's birthdate is unknown; it {{is known}} that she was at least a year <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> Harun. <b>Her</b> father, Ja'far was a {{half-brother}} of the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi.

60|$|Pierre was {{the only}} son of an affluent, and haughty widow; a lady who {{externally}} furnished a singular example of the preservative and beautifying influences of unfluctuating rank, health, and wealth, when joined to a fine mind of medium culture, uncankered by any inconsolable grief, and never worn by sordid cares. In mature age, the rose still miraculously clung to her cheek; litheness had not yet completely uncoiled itself from her waist, nor smoothness unscrolled itself from her brow, nor diamondness departed from her eyes. So that when lit up and bediademed by ball-room lights, Mrs. Glendinning still eclipsed far younger charms, and had she chosen to encourage them, would have been followed by a train of infatuated suitors, little less <b>young</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> own son Pierre.|$|R

Katelan Redmon hit six of her eleven shots to score 16 points for the USA team.|$|E

50|$|Maud Chadburn {{was born}} in Middlesbrough; her father was Reverend James Chadburn, a Congregational {{minister}} from Blackburn and her mother was Grace (née Tetley) from Bradford.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of widowhood, Maria Isabella was still young, with a will to live and a certain beauty, despite her {{increasing}} obesity. Surrounded by admirers, she had a weakness for handsome officials <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her.</b> According to court rumors, she took lovers. Her behavior made her an easy target for libels and exasperated Ferdinand II. Maria Isabella was kind to her daughter-in-law Maria Cristina of Savoy, who married Ferdinand II on 21 November 1832. The new queen achieved a reconciliation between mother and son.|$|E
25|$|Asha's {{first husband}} Ganpatrao was her {{personal}} secretary. Their marriage failed miserably in 1960. Her husband and in-laws mistreated her.

She continued to sing in films to earn money. Asha married Rahul Dev Burman in 1980. This was the second marriage for both Rahul and Asha. Rahul, 6 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her,</b> earlier got divorced from Rita Patel in 1971.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 2011, Sunhwa guested on the KBS's Lunar New Year special, Idol Health Beauty Contest, {{during which}} she {{was chosen as the}} star with the healthiest and most {{beautiful}} skin. Sunhwa, along with many other female idols, participated in a skin evaluation by selected professionals. In the end, results showed that Sunhwa's skin appeared 10 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> actual age. In April 2011, Sunhwa was chosen as the model for the cosmetics company The Skin House. Sunhwa reportedly received a $100,000 deposit for her six-month contract.

25|$|Pompey was {{supposedly}} infatuated with his bride. The personal charms of Julia were remarkable: {{she was a}} kind woman of beauty and virtue; and although policy prompted her union, and she was thirty years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> husband, she possessed in Pompey a devoted husband, to whom she was, in return, devotedly attached. A rumor suggested that the aging conqueror was losing interest in politics in favor of domestic life with his young wife. In fact, Pompey {{had been given the}} governorship of Hispania Ulterior, but had been permitted to remain in Rome to oversee the Roman grain supply as curator annonae, exercising his command through subordinates.|$|E
25|$|Bonario, {{a wealthy}} but mild-mannered {{merchant}} and former widower, is now married to Ciprigna. Much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> husband, Ciprigna is vain, capricious, and bullying. Bonario's children {{from his first}} marriage, Valerio and Isabella, and his servants, Fiuta the major domo and Cilia the maid, are so exasperated by her behaviour that they confront Bonario and threaten to leave his house unless he does something to curb his new wife's antics. Giglio, Ciprigna's fawning and flamboyant cavaliere servente, arrives and pays court to her. Their encounter in the garden is observed by Bonario, his children, and the servants. Bonario prepares a speech which he plans to deliver to Ciprigna {{in an attempt to}} reassert his authority but accidentally drops it. When she finds it, the outraged Ciprigna unbraids her husband in a lengthy tirade. Fiuta reproves his master for cowardice.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in mid-1908, Mary had {{an affair}} with Gilbert Cannan (who was twenty years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> and an {{associate}} of Barrie's in his anti-censorship activities), including a visit together to Black Lake Cottage, known only to the house staff. When Barrie learned of the affair in July 1909, he demanded that she end it, but she refused. To avoid the scandal of divorce, he offered a legal separation if she would agree not to see Cannan any more, but she still refused. Barrie sued for divorce on the grounds of infidelity– the divorce was granted in October 1909. Knowing how painful the divorce was for him, some of Barrie's friends wrote to a number of newspaper editors asking them not to publish the story. In the event, only three newspapers did. Barrie continued to support Mary financially even after she married Cannan, by giving her an annual allowance which was handed over at a private dinner held on her and Barrie's wedding anniversary.|$|E
60|$|In time, {{though no}} one {{mentioned}} it, everybody thought that if an alliance ultimately took place between Lady Roehampton and Mr. Sidney Wilton, {{it would be the}} most natural thing in the world, and everybody would approve it. True, he was her father's friend, and much her senior, but then he was still good-looking, very clever, very much considered, and lord of a large estate, and at any rate he was a <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> <b>her</b> late husband.|$|R

25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} date of the {{shooting}} match, Oakley and Butler were married a year afterward. A certificate is currently on file with the Archives of Ontario, Registration Number 49594, reporting Butler and Oakley being wed on June 20, 1882, in Windsor, Ontario. Many sources say that the marriage took place on August 23, 1876, in Cincinnati, {{yet there is no}} recorded certificate to validate that date. A possible reason for the contradicting dates may be that Butler's divorce from his first wife, Henrietta Saunders, was not yet final in 1876. An 1880 U.S. Federal Census record shows Saunders as married. Sources mentioning Butler's first wife as Elizabeth are inaccurate; Elizabeth was actually his granddaughter, her father being Edward F. Butler. Throughout Oakley's show-business career, the public was often led to believe that she was five to six years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> actual age. Claiming the later marriage date would have better supported her fictional age.|$|E
25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her.</b> When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know how to treat it. Instead, they were waiting {{to see how it}} progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. When she left the hospital {{for the first time in}} a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a need to explain to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in her legs, and if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. The last time she was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory. Perales earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy, which she earned from the Universidad de Zaragoza where she was a student from 1996 to 1999.|$|E
500|$|Brundage married Elizabeth Dunlap, {{daughter}} of a Chicago banker, in 1927, when he was 40. Elizabeth Brundage, three years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>her</b> husband, was a trained soprano, a talent she exhibited for visitors to the Brundage home. She had {{a strong interest in}} classical music, one which may not have been fully shared by her husband, who said of a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre that it [...] "started at 7o'clock, at 10:00pm I looked at my watch and it registered exactly 8o'clock". She died at age 81 in 1971.|$|E
