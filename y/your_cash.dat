500|$|By 1762, however, Johnson {{had gained}} notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the {{contemporary}} poet Churchill teased Johnson {{for the delay}} in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes <b>your</b> <b>cash,</b> but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his Shakespeare, and, after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762, {{he was able to}} dedicate most of his time towards this goal. Earlier that July, the 24-year-old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of £300 in appreciation for the Dictionary. While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy, it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life. The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials, he was told by Bute that the pension [...] "is not given you for anything you are to do, but for what you have done".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Voliminal was mixed. The newspaper Dawn called the DVD [...] "an audible treat for thrash and speed metal fans", {{he went on}} to compliment drummer Joey Jordison, stating that he [...] "structures his beats and percussions in a very traditional thrash set-up, almost as well as (dare I say it) the great Dave Lombardo of Slayer fame". Ultimate Guitar called the DVD [...] "behind-the-scene action in an unorthodox format, complete with choppy editing and absolutely no specific chronology". They would go on to state though the DVD [...] "only gives partial attention to the music", [...] "The best moment in the 2-disc collection comes during a chat with Corey Taylor, who shares his feelings about everything from his less-than-perfect relationship with his father to the obstacles that the band faced in its early days". TuneLab wrote [...] "Slipknot takes a unique approach to their latest film, as they turn {{what could have been a}} mundane video of live footage and band antics into a rather peculiar and extremely interesting movie". The [...] "scatterbrained and choppy" [...] style of Voliminal [...] " [...] the viewer to feel like he or she is [...] "outside looking in", rather than being truly involved with the band's happenings". Reviewing for Blogcritics, Chris Beaumont wrote [...] " [...] was enthralled and bored by the documentary". He went on to state, [...] "the best part is watching them perform", despite the [...] "audio is near unlistenable"; [...] "these guys know their way around the stage...this shows the whole package". Reviewing for Billboard, Christa Titus criticized the DVD writing it [...] "randomly [...] footage from concerts and the usual backstage antics with images of pigeons and overflowing toilets, then tossing in whatever visual effects struck M. Shawn Crahan's fancy while he edited it." [...] She concluded [...] "Save <b>your</b> <b>cash</b> for the band's next tour...that's where you'll get your money's worth". Film School Rejects's Cole Abaius wrote of the DVD, [...] ", probably no one else will purchase or enjoy this DVD". He added that with no narration, [...] "the images are left to speak for themselves", only [...] "some just don’t speak loudly enough". Despite the mixed reviews, Voliminal was certified gold in Australia, platinum in the United States, and double platinum in Canada. The album peaked at the 5th spot on Billboards Music Video charts, and remained on the chart for 10 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Named after {{lieutenant}} governor Henry Brougham Loch and beloved {{by many as}} their [...] "favourite" [...] engine on the railway, As originally built [...] "Loch" [...] was a small boilered locomotive, but she was rebuilt as a medium boilered locomotive in 1909. [...] This gave her the same tractive effort as Nos 10 and 11. [...] No. 4 has the strange distinction of being what must surely be the first locomotive ever to (re)enter service {{on the day the}} line closed. Having been earmarked for re-boilering in 1967 by the 1968 season she was ready for service and steam tests were carried out accordingly. Fate intervened however {{and at the end of}} September 1968 the Peel and Ramsey lines closed for good. Fortunately, the Port Erin line was retained and No. 4 was familiar to many as the south based engine for many years, right up until her withdrawal from service after the 1995 Christmas services on the railway. She is the only locomotive to carry a non functioning [...] "bell-mouth" [...] dome and a non-standard livery of maroon was carried from 1979 to withdrawal. Of course, now she wears the familiar Indian red but is distinguished from her shed-mates by carrying a Legs Of Mann and [...] "4" [...] numeral on her buffer beam. She was used heavily in the marketing campaign for the 1993 [...] "Year Of Railways" [...] when she was the locomotive chosen to haul special services on the Manx Electric Railway. Following the Un-Loch <b>Your</b> <b>Cash</b> appeal by the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association in 1998–2000, she returned to service in 2002 and was a regular fleet member once more. On 20 May 2008, she collided with a van and badly damaged her buffer beam. [...] The boiler certificate expired on 31 August 2015 and following that day's services the locomotive with withdrawn from traffic; it is not known when it is likely to return.|$|E
