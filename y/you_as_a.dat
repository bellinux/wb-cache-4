25|$|In 2005, BBC One {{broadcast}} {{an adaptation}} for the ShakespeaRe-Told series, written by Sally Wainwright {{and directed by}} David Richards. Written in modern prose, the episode relocates the story to contemporary London, where Katherine (Shirley Henderson) is an abrasive career politician who is told she must find a husband {{if she wants to}} become the party leader. Meanwhile, her supermodel sister Bianca (Jaime Murray) has fallen in love with Lucentio (Santiago Cabrera) and wants to marry him, but Bianca's manager, Harry (Stephen Tompkinson), has long believed she will marry him. To put him off, Bianca announces she will not marry until her sister is married (as she believes Katherine will never marry). Harry then arranges a meeting between his friend Petruchio (Rufus Sewell) and Katherine. Harry bets Petruchio that he {{will not be able to}} woo Katherine, so, determined to prove him wrong, Petruchio sets out to win her over. At the end of the episode, Katherine's 'submission' speech is triggered when Bianca is annoyed that Lucentio refuses to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. Katherine states it is a woman's duty to love and obey her husband, but with the requirement that he do precisely the same for her. In 2009, ABC Family adapted the 1999 film 10 Things I Hate About <b>You</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sitcom of the same name, starring Lindsey Shaw and Ethan Peck.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} his GCSEs, where he achieved three A grades, Primus signed a two-year apprenticeship with Charlton. He also received {{an offer from}} West Ham United, who were in a higher division, but he rejected this because he felt his first team opportunities would be greater at Charlton. Primus was playing in various positions until the club's youth team coach, Colin Clarke, decided that he should play as a centre back, [...] "I see <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> centre back, that way you can see everything you want in front of you".|$|E
500|$|Sydney Morning Herald {{commentator}} Bernard Zuel described Dream Days at the Hotel Existence as Powderfinger's first dull album, {{noting that}} on numerous songs [...] "It promises to become exciting but never quite gets there." [...] He complained {{that most of}} the songs were uneventful, or uninspiring, and that they do not [...] "lift <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> listener." [...] PerthNows Jay Hanna disagreed, claiming the album was [...] "rippling with emotions". He said the album contained some [...] "incredible moments", praising [...] "Head Up in the Clouds", and calling [...] "Nobody Sees" [...] "Powderfinger at their devastating best", while giving the album four stars.|$|E

I'm not saying that all couples fight this way.

Megan was the key to this video.... I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> director the reason why [...] scenes in the video feel so real is because in the moment they were real.|$|E
500|$|The {{price of}} VVVVVV {{when it was}} {{originally}} released was $15. [...] This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's [...] "one unfortunate barrier" [...] to entry: [...] "While there's plenty to see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off." [...] Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost [...] "does strike <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lot for an Indie lo-fi platformer", while insisting that [...] "it is worth the money". [...] Since its original release, the price of VVVVVV {{has been reduced to}} $5. [...] On his blog, Cavanagh said that the decision was difficult to make, but added, [...] "I know that the original price of $15 was off putting for a lot of people".|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Perry voiced {{criticism}} of Tony Abbott, then-leader of conservative Liberal Party of Australia and candidate for Prime Minister of Australia, {{due to his}} opposition to gay marriage and told Abbott, [...] "I love <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> human being but I can't give you my vote." [...] In April 2014, she publicly supported Marianne Williamson in her campaign for California's 33rd congressional district by attending a political press event. She endorsed Kamala Harris in the United States Senate election in California, and organized a fundraiser for Harris {{at her home in}} Los Angeles in November 2016. Perry also publicly endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. She performed alongside Elton John at a fundraising concert for Clinton in New York City in March 2016. Perry also spoke and performed at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Clinton.|$|E

500|$|On September 25, 2007, Representative John Conyers (D), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, {{announced}} that he would hold congressional hearings on what he described as [...] "the miscarriages of justice that have occurred in Jena, Louisiana," [...] with the goal of pressuring the United States Department of Justice into taking action. The hearing took place on October 16, 2007; Washington and Sharpton, among others, testified. Walters was invited to testify but declined. Most Republican members of the committee declined to attend. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said to Washington and other Justice Department officials, [...] "Shame on <b>you....</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> parent, I'm on the verge of tears," [...] and said, [...] "I want to know what you're going to do to get Mychal Bell out of jail!" [...] US Attorney Washington responded that the federal government had a limited role to play in the matter.|$|E
500|$|Alexandra's letters {{reveal that}} Maria, the middle {{child of the}} family, {{sometimes}} felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn't loved {{as much as the}} other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. [...] "One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he likes <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so." ...|$|E

[...] For the former would lead one to expect a Speer in sackcloth and ashes; I, however, know <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> merry fellow who undertakes one lovely journey after another and who happily regales his old chums with tales of his literary and financial successes... our accusations against your former colleagues (Göring, Goebbels, Bormann, etc.) who, being dead, cannot defend themselves are agony to me... I hope and think that the day will come when you will no longer find it necessary to confess your guilt to all and sundry in order to persuade yourself of your virtue.|$|E

50|$|Looking at how <b>you</b> learn <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{individual}} {{is a huge}} part in your development of self according to Kolb and his model. By knowing {{what you need to}} do to learn it makes it easier for <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> individual to grow <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person. Using the different personality types and ways to learn, we become more self-aware and willing to learn from new ways.|$|R
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the post-apocalyptic world and the survival horror genre gave {{them the opportunity to}} better develop the characters. Taking inspiration from their work on the Uncharted games, the team used their knowledge of paralleling characters with the conflict in both gameplay and stories when developing The Last of Us. They also took inspiration from the books The Road (2006) and City of Thieves (2008), and the film No Country for Old Men (2007), noting that they all include memorable characters and using this as a point of inspiration. [...] "e can make <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> player feel more of what it's truly like to exist inside of a world where every bullet counts and each step you take is a conscious choice that's going to make or break your existence," [...] said Straley. The team also {{felt that the}} [...] "pressures of the world" [...] allowed them to better develop their characters. They felt that the pressure forced the characters to make interesting decisions, allowing better development.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were strongly}} interested in [...] "world building," [...] and the alternate universe {{allowed them to}} create a very similar world with {{a large amount of}} detail to fill in the texture of the world. An alternate universe also allowed them to show [...] "how small choices that you make define <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person and can change your life in large ways down the line," [...] according to co-director Jeff Pinkner. However, the producers also realized the concept of the alternate universe could be confusing to viewers. To avoid this, elements of the world were introduced in small pieces {{over the course of the}} first two seasons before the larger revelation in the second-season finale and the third season. J. H. Wyman stated that he would often pass the story ideas for the alternate universe by his father to see if it made sense, and would rework the script if his father found it confusing. Such world building also gave them a risky opportunity to create stories that focused solely on characters from the alternate universe with nearly no ties to the main characters; as stated by Wyman, they would be able to [...] "make two shows about one show," [...] a concept that the network executives embraced.|$|E
500|$|Sylvia and Adela, meanwhile, did {{not share}} their mother's enthusiasm for the war. As {{committed}} pacifists, they rejected the WSPU's support for the government. Sylvia's socialist perspective convinced her {{that the war was}} another example of capitalist oligarchs exploiting poor soldiers and workers. Adela, meanwhile, spoke against the war in Australia and made public her opposition to conscription. In a short letter, Emmeline told Sylvia: [...] "I am ashamed to know where you and Adela stand." [...] She had a similar impatience for dissent within the WSPU; when long-time member Mary Leigh asked a question during a meeting in October 1915, Pankhurst replied: [...] "hat woman is a pro German and should leave the hall.... I denounce <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pro German and wish to forget that such a person ever existed." [...] Some WSPU members were outraged by this sudden rigid devotion to the government, the leadership's perceived abandonment of efforts to win the vote for women, and questions about how funds collected on behalf of suffrage were being managed with regard to the organisation's new focus. Two groups split from the WSPU: The Suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union (SWSPU) and the Independent Women's Social and Political Union (IWSPU), each dedicated to maintaining pressure toward women's suffrage.|$|E
