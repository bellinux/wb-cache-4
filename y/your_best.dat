5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with <b>your</b> <b>best</b> friend.|$|E

25|$|Undoubtedly, you Orleanians {{think of}} me as a most horrible murderer, which I am, but I could be much worse if I wanted to. If I wished, I could pay a visit to your city every night. At will I could slay {{thousands}} of <b>your</b> <b>best</b> citizens (and the worst), for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.|$|E
25|$|Just {{north and}} south of the Huntington Beach Pier are some well defined sandbars that shift {{throughout}} the year with the different swells. Southside of the Pier is often a popular destination during the summer for good surf, but the Northside can be just as well during the winter. Around the Pier it all depends on the swell and the sandbars. Shortboard is <b>your</b> <b>best</b> option for surfing around the Pier.|$|E

25|$|Bisociation: This is a {{technical}} term coined by Arthur Koestler. He {{says that a}} funny text is situated in two different semantic levels. In the beginning, the hearer or reader is aware of only one of them. In the punch line, the second level comes up so suddenly that they start laughing. The sudden coming up of the second level is the point. For example: I only want <b>your</b> <b>best</b> â€“ your money.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use <b>your</b> <b>best</b> judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
500|$|National Review writer Mark Hemingway lauded the film's {{celebration of}} liberty. [...] "If there's a better {{celluloid}} expression of ordinary American freedom than Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I {{have yet to}} see it. If you could take one day and do absolutely anything, piling into a convertible with <b>your</b> <b>best</b> girl and <b>your</b> <b>best</b> friend and taking in a baseball game, an art museum, and a fine meal seems about as good as it gets," [...] wrote Hemingway.|$|E

500|$|When {{adapting}} The Kite Runner for the theatre, Director Eric Rose {{stated that}} he was drawn into the narrative by the [...] "themes of betraying <b>your</b> <b>best</b> friend {{for the love of}} your father", which he compared to Shakespearean literature. Throughout the story, Amir craves his father's affection; his father, in turn, loves Amir but favors Hassan, going as far as to pay for plastic surgery to repair the latter's cleft lip.|$|E
500|$|In {{defending}} himself {{from what he}} believed was the elitism of his online critics, Idol admitted {{that he was still}} learning about computers, but compared it to the early punk ethic of simply trying <b>your</b> <b>best</b> as a musician, even if you had difficulty. He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer. [...] "I don't know much about computers, but I have the desire to learn and I have a computer and a modem, so I go for it. Banging my head sometimes, but continuing on." ...|$|E

500|$|Both teams {{valued the}} competition, despite some {{commentators}} being dismissive of the match's importance. CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich underlined his team's determined mood: [...] "We know their players {{are very strong}} because they won the Champions League. But we are not thinking about individuals. We will only worry about ourselves and not them." [...] Likewise Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was equally determined to be successful: [...] "This {{is the opportunity to}} win another trophy. When you play against good teams you have to do <b>your</b> <b>best.</b> I am not thinking about the past and that we won the Champions League." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2001, Ronald Isley {{stated that}} Aaliyah and the Isley Brothers had {{discussed}} a collaboration {{prior to her}} death.

500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you do <b>your</b> <b>best</b> not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E
500|$|... "The Cure" [...] {{was written}} after Gaga's {{performance}} at the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Gaga worked with longtime collaborator DJ White Shadow (aka Paul Blair) for the track. He recalled sitting with Gaga and feeling a positive vibe, which led them to write the track described by Blair as [...] "upbeat and cool". Their camaraderie originated due to the [...] "terrible stuff {{going on in the}} world right now, it's like when you're a creative person you do <b>your</b> <b>best</b> to try and combat evil with creative stuff, so that was kind of the vibe." [...] Gaga and her team wanted to release the [...] "one-off" [...] single as soon as production was completed.|$|E

[...] He gave the film three and a half out of five stars. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times criticized the excessive flashbacks, but praised the action scenes and design, and considered that Marlon Wayans [...] "steals the show". Dan Kois of The Washington Post describing it as [...] "loudest, flashiest, silliest and longest blockbuster in a summer full of long, silly, flashy, loud blockbusters" [...] thought it was [...] "as polished and entertaining as war-mongering toy commercials get".|$|E
