500|$|Harriet {{returns in}} 2005 Christmas special [...] "The Christmas Invasion", set {{several months later}} when the {{character}} is now Prime Minister. Jones oversees {{the launch of the}} Guinevere Space Probe which is captured by an invading Sycorax spaceship. Although the invasion is averted by the Doctor (now David Tennant) Jones orders the covert Torchwood organisation to destroy the retreating Sycorax ship, arguing that there will come a time when the Doctor cannot protect Earth and so she must do what she can to defend it. The Doctor reacts furiously to what he perceives as cold blooded murder and tells her that he can bring her down with just six words: [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> looks tired?" [...] In the episode's d√©nouement, Jones faces rumours of ill-health and a vote of no confidence. In the 2007 episode [...] "The Sound of Drums" [...] it is stated that the Master, running for Prime Minister under the alias Mr Saxon, appeared right after Harriet Jones's downfall.|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{signed a}} five-album record deal with SYCOmusic {{as part of}} Columbia Records on September 18, 2006. She was the first U.S. artist to sign with SYCOmusic; during the press conference, Simon Cowell called Ryan [...] "potentially {{one of the best}} singers I have ever heard in my life." [...] The {{following}} month, Ryan was in Los Angeles to record her first CD. The self-titled debut was released on November 14, 2006, featuring cover versions of [...] "The Rose" [...] and [...] "I Believe I Can Fly", and original songs like [...] "I Wish That" [...] and [...] "Pray for a Better Day". Eight days later, the album debuted at No. 57 on the Billboard album charts, showcasing [...] "her gargantuan chops and sweet charm". Matt Collar of AllMusic added that the arrangements were [...] "grandiose" [...] for someone of Ryan's age, but they were [...] "more than matched by her truly impressive vocal talent." [...] Los Angeles Daily News reviewer Sandra Barrera wrote that Ryan handled the songs [...] "like the old pro that her big, powerful voice makes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is".|$|E
2500|$|From the {{wreckage}} of the museum, a sentinel begins to form. While Wolverine tries to stop the sentinel from maturing, he is thrown into the ocean. Shortly after, Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave. Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel, but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles. Cyclops doesn't listen and begins to prepare the students for combat. Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate. Cyclops and Wolverine's frustration with each other come to a head when Cyclops brings up Jean Grey saying that she never loved Wolverine and always feared him. Wolverine replies [...] "And if she were here right now, who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> would be more frightened of?" [...] The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops visor, the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel. In the morning, Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living, but Wolverine cannot continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles. Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him. While Wolverine does not leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X-Men, he makes clear he wants both sides {{to stay out of the}} others business.|$|E

6000|$|... "Does Mrs. Saintsbury like me?" [...] asked Dan. [...] "Well, she's awfully nice. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> awfully fond of formulating people?" ...|$|R
6000|$|KEITH. [Dryly] I'm {{trying to}} get at truth. If you want me to help, I must know everything. What makes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> fond of <b>you?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense,' said Reginald, 'do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> {{is to sit}} poking {{here all}} day, playing with those foolish London things of yours?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is so {{much more}} {{beautiful}} in the crescent, Mrs. Kendal?' said Genevieve, in the most wakeful manner.|$|E
60|$|After a little, Joan {{arrived and}} was brought in. She saw the rack, {{she saw the}} attendants, and the same picture which I had been seeing must have risen in her mind; but do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> quailed, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> shuddered? No, {{there was no sign}} of that sort. She {{straightened}} herself up, and there was a slight curl of scorn about her lip; but as for fear, she showed not a vestige of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Verrian, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> wonderful? I've {{been telling}} mother about it, and I don't feel {{at all the}} way she does. Do you?" ...|$|R
60|$|JOHNNY. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> a {{designing}} minx. I {{tell you}} she's got no more design in her than a rabbit. She's {{just at the}} mercy of anything.|$|R
6000|$|Jake {{told him}} and he nodded. [...] "I made it half a point more to port, but this compass swivels rather wildly. Where do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> bound?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I go {{away from}} here an' leave Wildfire for Lucy--do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> could keep him? Wouldn't Bostil take him from her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Jordan {{continued}} to brood. [...] "Well, I know some beauties." [...] Then with her odd jerkiness: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> looks good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Dora,' said Rupert, {{wishing to}} try the little girl rather further, 'do not <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> deserves it, for being out of temper?' ...|$|E
6000|$|They did {{not speak}} till {{well on the way}} home. Then the father leaned forward and whispered huskily: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> as strong as she was?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course," [...] {{he tried}} to say with {{unaltered}} gayety, but a note of disappointment made itself felt. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> going to be worse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sensible, yes. And as {{practical}} as she's pretty. She can do {{all sorts}} of things, and likes to be doing them. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> an extraordinary beauty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Charming! {{he said in}} a finical sweet voice, {{showing his}} white teeth and {{blinking}} his eyes pleasantly. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was? Quite charming! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is EXCLUSIVE?" [...] I asked Hilda as we strolled on {{towards the}} stern, {{out of the}} spoilt child's hearing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> {{is likely}} to be in {{correspondence}} with your father, or your stepmother, while she is out of England?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Clarence is handsome, but worthless," [...] she {{continued}} in her sprightly way. [...] "I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> so very pretty, Mr. Hopper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This was {{a little}} {{difficult}} to follow, and Mr. Touchett considered it for a while. At last he said: [...] "Isabel's a sweet young thing; but do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> so good as that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Smart {{moved on}} {{a step or}} two. [...] "Supposing now, father,--We-hey, Smart!--I did think a little about her, and I had a chance, which I ha'n't; don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> a very good sort of--of--one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mrs. Norton said Jack was {{not invited}} to Sir Harry Griffin's because {{his father was a}} stock-jobber. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was right, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so glad, Frederic, because I do like her. I {{was sure}} she was a real cousin. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is very,--very nice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{nothing like}} it, sir,' replied Mr Lillyvick solemnly. 'How do you think,' whispered the collector, drawing him aside, 'how do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> looks tonight?' ...|$|E
5000|$|The People Next Door {{received}} positive reviews. Roger Ebert {{said in his}} Chicago Sun-Times review, [...] "Deborah Winters, {{is disturbing}} at first because <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> too mannered. Gradually the mannerisms become indispensable to the characterization." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's cheated me. I {{paid him}} {{to clear out}} and leave her alone. D' <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> asleep?" [...] He's made no appeal for sympathy, he'd take pity for an insult; but he feels it badly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My way? No, not a bit. I'm glad Isabel has {{somebody}} to talk to. I'm afraid it's I who {{am in the}} way. I know I'm not very lively company. Isabel's all right, don't <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>She's</b> not unhappy, is she?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Kitty is {{only going}} up for French and German. Miss Leverett is so angry. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> will do to me, Gill? Expel me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' smiled Gerald. 'I can see. But in {{case she}} won't--do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> would go abroad {{with me for a}} few days--or for a fortnight?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dangers! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> has any disease? She {{seems to}} be a healthy child enough, I'm sure. She has a lovely color in her cheeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dearest Lady Crich,' she said, 'you are {{beautiful}} as an angel on earth. Angel--angel--don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> good enough and beautiful {{enough to go}} to heaven, Gudrun? They will be in heaven, won't they--and ESPECIALLY my darling Lady Crich! Mrs Marshall, I say!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{may make}} bold {{to assert that}} for persevering {{sharpness}} she beats all that I ever met, even in Yorkshire;" [...] and Mr. Kantwise looked at his new friend over his shoulder, {{and shook his head}} as though lost in wonder and admiration. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> done now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|PATIOMKIN. Psha! I know. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> if <b>she</b> once sets eyes on {{your face}} and your uniform your fortune is made. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> that if <b>she</b> could stand a man like me, with only one eye, and a cross eye at that, she must fall down at your feet at first sight, eh? ...|$|R
