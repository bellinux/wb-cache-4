He concentrated his troops in Boston, and called for reinforcements from London, writing [...] "if you think ten thousand men sufficient, send twenty; if one million is thought enough, give two; <b>you</b> <b>save</b> both blood and treasure in the end." [...] However, Gage's request was seen by some in London as absurd, as there were only 12,000 troops in Britain at the time, but he did eventually receive an additional 400 Marines in response to these requests.

2500|$|A {{tradition}} of Highland hospitality and chivalry concerns Clan Lamont and Clan Gregor. The story {{is supposed to}} take place around the year 1600. The son of the chief of Clan Lamont and the only son of MacGregor of Glenstrae, chief of Clan Gregor, went hunting together {{on the shores of}} Loch Awe. After the two men had made camp at nightfall they eventually became embroiled in a quarrel {{at the end of which}} Lamont grabbed his dirk and MacGregor was mortally wounded. Lamont then fled, hotly pursued by MacGregor's furious retainers, until losing his way and eventually making it to the house of the MacGregor chief himself. On hearing that Lamont was fleeing for his life, MacGregor promised the lad protection. Soon, though, the old MacGregor guessed it was his own son who had been slain, but considered himself bound to the Highland laws of hospitality, saying [...] "Here this night you shall be safe". With the arrival of the furious MacGregor clansman who pursued the young Lamont, the MacGregor chief was true to his word and protected Lamont from his clansmen's vengeance. Later, while it was still dark, the chief had Lamont personally conducted to Dunderave on Loch Fyne and provided him with a boat and oars. The chief bid him leave quickly, saying [...] "Flee for your life; in your own country we shall pursue <b>you.</b> <b>Save</b> yourself if you can!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Until Chamberlain's death, he and Wilhelm {{had what}} the American {{historian}} Geoffrey Field called [...] "a warm, personal bond", which was {{expressed in a}} series of [...] "....elaborate, wordy letters, full of mutual admiration and half-baked ideas". The Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were full of [...] "the perplexing thought world of mystical and racist conservatism. They ranged far and wide in subject matter: the ennobling mission of the Germanic race, the corroding forces of Ultramontanism, materialism and the [...] "destructive poison" [...] of Judentum were favorite themes." [...] Other subjects often discussed in the Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were the dangers posed to the Reich by the [...] "Yellow Peril", [...] "Tartarized Slavdom", and by the [...] "black hordes". In 1901, Wilhelm informed Chamberlain in a letter that: [...] "God sent your book to the German people, just as he sent you personally to me, that is my unshakably firm conviction". Wilhelm went on to praise Chamberlain as his [...] "comrade-in-arms and ally in the struggle for Teutons against Rome, Jerusalem, etc". In 1902, Wilhelm wrote another letter in which he told Chamberlain: [...] "May <b>you</b> <b>save</b> our German Volk, our Germanentum, for God has sent you as our helper!". Chamberlain in his turn advised Wilhelm to create [...] "a racially aware...centrally organised Germany with a clear sense of purpose, a Germany which would 'rule the world'". In 1903, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm to claim that as in the last decadent days of Rome, [...] "the civis britannicus is now become a purely political concept" [...] with no racial content being involved. Chamberlain wrote with disgust how for two shillings and a sixpence, [...] "every Basuto nigger" [...] could now carry a British passport. Chamberlain went on to predict within the next fifty years [...] "the English aristocracy will be nothing but a money oligarchy, without a shred of racial solidarity or relation to the throne". Chamberlain went on to deplore the practice of raising businessmen to the peerage in Britain, contemptuously declaring that in Britain mere [...] "brewers, ink manufacturers and ship-owners" [...] now sat in the House of Lords. Chamberlain ended his letter to the Kaiser by calling the general British public [...] "a herd which has no will and which a few newspapers and handful of politicians manipulate as they wish". Wilhelm's later concept of [...] "Juda-England", of a decaying Britain sucked dried by Jewish capitalists owed much to Chamberlain. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma described Chamberlain's letters to the Kaiser as pushing his [...] "â€¦Anglophobic, anti-Semitic, Germanophile ideas to the point of murderous lunacy". The liberal Berliner Zeitung newspaper complained in an editorial of the close friendship between Wilhelm II and such an outspoken racist and anti-Semite like Chamberlain, stating this was a real cause for concern for decent, caring people both inside and outside Germany.|$|E
