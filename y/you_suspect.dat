500|$|On the EastEnders website, Yusef is {{described}} as calm, collected, strong-willed, mysterious, loyal to Afia and regretful of his past. Daniel Maier from The Guardian said that Yusef [...] "is clearly a wrong 'un but it's hard to tell exactly what his game is. <b>You</b> <b>suspect</b> he's not sure himself. A Baddie Without Portfolio, {{most of his time}} seems taken up with malicious glances and general inveigling." [...] Susan Hill from the Daily Star called Yusef [...] "twisted", while Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror called him [...] "smug, deceitful and dangerous". [...] Wadia opined that Yusef is not evil but much more complex than that, and his personality would be explored during his storyline. Bhatti told Inside Soap that Yusef has [...] "more bad qualities than good" [...] but is insecure because when Zainab left him, it brought shame on his family.|$|E
500|$|On 14 January 2010 Thirsty Merc {{announced}} that Carey {{had left the}} band and was replaced on guitar by Matt Smith, from afrobeat and reggae band, The Strides. Carey wanted {{to work as a}} record producer and spend more time with his wife. On 18 June 2010 Thirsty Merc released their third album, Mousetrap Heart, which was recorded mostly in Los Angeles with Matt Wallace co-producing, while two tracks were produced in Melbourne with Gravina. Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald opined that [...] "we buy, or actively avoid, songs that excite a response in us but radio wants songs that fit in, that don't provoke strong responses, that offend the fewest people ... this [...] is a collection of extremely professional, well-considered, carefully targeted songs whose key performance indicators are ticked off one by one in a manner so efficient <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> band meetings must have an agenda, notes secretary and double-cream biscuits for elevenses".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} {{as to the}} merits of the novel's ending. Andy Smith lamented that the finale of the [...] "mostly intriguing" [...] novel was [...] "distinctly anticlimactic". Tim Martin wrote that it seemed [...] "somehow less {{than the sum of its}} parts". Clay Evans {{dismissed}} it as [...] "not especially meaningful, but fun", whereas Matt Thorne found it lacking [...] "a traditional thriller's excitement". San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Michael Berry called it [...] "an ingenious reversal" [...] which proved that despite its apparent cynicism, the novel was [...] "oddly optimistic for a ghost story". Overall, Thorne judged the novel ultimately unsatisfactory on account of the underwhelming ending and because Gibson [...] "hides the full complications of the plot so successfully that it feels as if everything important is happening offstage". Roger Perkins judged the novel to be [...] "a triumph of style over substance – which is exactly the way <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> that Gibson wants it." [...] His colleague Martin mused that along with the regular Gibsonian tropes, there was [...] "something new ... a dark and very contemporary surge of suspicion and bad faith" [...] in the novel which suggested that the author might be approaching the apex of his writing. Dan Conover concluded that while the [...] "darkly comic satire" [...] was [...] "a worthy addition to the Gibson canon and a significant cultural artifact", it would not rank among the author's best works.|$|E
6000|$|... "What about that, Miller?" [...] I asked, {{in a tone}} of exultation. [...] "Who's doing that? Last time <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> Howard, {{now here}} <b>you</b> must <b>suspect</b> the psychic. The {{movement}} of that pencil is of enormous significance. How can she possibly reach and handle that cone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{certainly}} news. I knew Hardwick {{did not like}} <b>you</b> because <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> him, but I thought that had passed over." ...|$|R

2500|$|The album {{so far has}} a {{score of}} 66 out of 100 from Metacritic based on [...] "generally {{favorable}} reviews". Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press gave the album all five stars and called it [...] "the first great record of 2008." [...] John Hanson of Sputnikmusic gave the album a score of 4.5 out of five and called it [...] "simply an immense album." [...] Uncut gave it a score of four stars out of five and called it the band's [...] "most digestible record yet." [...] Blender also gave it a score of four stars out of five and said, [...] "Never before have these kings of experimental metal sustained such pulse-quickening energy, honing their tricks--cryptic lyrics, cliffhanging cries, spine-twisting rhythms--into a screaming arrow of sound." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard gave it a favorable review and said, [...] "Most of the time, however, the band makes a righteous racket that straddles the worlds of prog rock, funk, fusion jazz and world music, with Eastern motifs spicing 'Aberinkula' {{and a bit of}} cosmic blues making its way into 'Conjugal Burns.'" [...] Vibe likewise gave it four stars out of five and said, [...] "Rarely does rock music feel so simultaneously orchestrated and raw." [...] Shilpa Ganatra of Hot Press gave it a positive review and said, [...] "The manner in which the group weave complex musical tapestries is certainly impressive from a purely technical perspective, but <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> that they were a lot more fun to assemble than they are to listen to." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2008, Bachmann gave an {{interview}} on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews {{in support of the}} presidential campaign of Senator John McCain that brought the Minnesota 6th Congressional District race national attention. During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying [...] "...usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are... I am very concerned that he [...] may have anti-American views." [...] She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Barack Obama, arguing that [...] "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with." [...] Matthews followed up by asking [...] "But he [...] is a Senator from the State of Illinois; he's {{one of the members of}} Congress <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" [...] Bachmann answered, [...] "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look... I wish they would... I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America. I think people would love to see an exposé like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] with a forbearing smile, [...] "that is frank. But pray, don't {{forget that}} when <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> my herbs <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> nature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} have been dying of curiosity ever since I was waiting behind your lordship's chair at your mother's. I knew <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> {{something}} then,--confess now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gently, sir! <b>You</b> <b>suspected</b> me {{just now}} of wasting your {{valuable}} time. Don't rashly conclude that I am the lady, {{until you find}} that I am acquainted with the circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Its {{obvious that}} I've given {{everybody}} {{a good deal}} of trouble, but I feel that you deserved it for your foolishness. May I ask on what grounds <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> Jack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘What do <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> me of, Mister Jarsper?’ he asks, with drunken displeasure. ‘Let them as has any {{suspicions of}} Durdles name ’em.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Not {{on my own}} land?” said Marmaduke sternly. “If it be as <b>you</b> <b>suspect,</b> I {{will know}} their reasons for making this excavation.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then whom do <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> of {{inserting}} the advertisement, as {{you deny}} having done it yourself, for some purpose {{which does not}} appear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{looks as}} if <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> me of leading him astray. Now, in a sense, that’s hardly fair to either of us. Don’t you think your father has a will of his own?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will listen}} to you," [...] he said. [...] "You {{referred}} me just now to the consul's letter. The consul tells me <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> some one of taking your papers and your clothes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me that you doubted it?" [...] Harding returned. [...] "You haven't the {{reputation}} of being a fool. Would you have lent money on a note <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> was forged?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rotherby?" [...] he cried. [...] "Would {{you tell}} that villain what <b>you</b> <b>suspect?</b> Would you arm him with another weapon for my undoing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, man!" [...] said Demorest impatiently. [...] "You're {{letting your}} prejudices go too far. Do {{you mean to}} say that <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> his wife." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Still harping,' says Ogden, {{laughing}} again. 'Don't {{you suppose}} that if I was Black Bill and thought <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> me, I'd put a Winchester bullet into you and stop my nervousness, if I had any?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, little gentleman, {{do not be}} so {{particularly}} scandalised," [...] {{said the}} King; [...] "I promise <b>you</b> I <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> of no audacity of gallantry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{chairman}} of 'em," [...] assented the general, after {{a glance at}} Mr. Crewe's countenance {{to see how this}} statement fared. [...] "But the fact is, the boys are all jealous of you--on the quiet. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> something of the kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Isaac," [...] she said. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>suspect?</b> What do you think? This {{friendship}} {{has been}} going on----How can I end it suddenly?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, kisses, yes! If I didn't {{kiss you}} father {{would think that}} we had already quarrelled. But {{it may be that}} we must do so. When I had told you everything, that you should rush up to London to look after me--as though <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing that's of the {{slightest}} use, after all,' {{he said to}} her; 'we are as far as ever from the merest shadow of legal proof that would convict him of what I am morally certain he did, marry <b>you,</b> <b>suspecting,</b> if not knowing, her to be alive all the time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's the {{way with}} all your sex. One asks you to be {{suspicious}}, and you ask whom <b>you</b> shall <b>suspect.</b> <b>You</b> can do nothing in the abstract. I should like to be suspicious for you. Will you let me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head impatiently, and {{collecting}} myself, I said, very slowly and somewhat unsteadily, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> me of being instrumental in taking it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>suspected,</b> {{while reading}} {{this part of}} my letter, who the high-born gentleman was whose {{evidence}} hung him? If you have not, I will tell you.

6000|$|... "You stopped, {{and spoke}} to me, sir," [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Bashwood, advancing more and more eagerly to his end.
