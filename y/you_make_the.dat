His {{depression}} and paranoid well-being inspired the song [...] "Gas Panic!", subsequently {{included on the}} 2000 album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. He claimed to have quit using illicit drugs on 5 June 1998. Gallagher stated in 2001, [...] "I liked drugs, I was good at them.

[...] To combat this issue, Minear decided to make the remote viewer blind. He sought to make the blind woman [...] "not Audrey Hepburn", a reference to the 1967 film Wait Until Dark, in which Hepburn played the part of an innocent but terrorized blind woman. He later said, [...] "I wanted to make [...] a bitch, because the fact is that disability doesn't necessarily ennoble a person." [...] After several meetings with fellow writers John Shiban, Vince Gilligan, and Frank Spotnitz—who provided storyboard support—Minear was allowed to begin work on the episode.|$|E

Zoya cast Roshan {{in the role of}} an uptight workaholic as she considers him her favourite actor. For the film's soundtrack, Roshan recorded the song [...] "Señorita" [...] with his co-stars and Maria del Mar Fernández. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was released to positive reviews and Roshan's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Hrithik Roshan once again brings real depth to his character with a spectacular performance. He's shy and restrained, then lets go with such fantastic intensity that <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> inward journey with his character." [...] The film grossed [...] worldwide and became Roshan's first commercial success in three years. He was nominated for another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance. Later that year, he made a special appearance in Farhan's Don 2.|$|E
500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said.

500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E

500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E

They served no jail time, were given three years probation, fined $3,000 and ordered to pay $780 in court costs.

In an interview in July 2014, Pritchard stated that Listen includes more improvisation and found that “that kind of fearlessness when <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> first album kind of crept back in.” Upon its release, the album debuted at No.16 on the UK Albums Chart, then fell to No.57 the week after, and the next week dropped off the chart. A remix album for Listen, entitled Hello, What's Your Name?, was released on 4 December 2015. It features remixes by Jack Beats, The Nextmen, Montmartre and Kove among others.|$|E

UGO Networks gave the game a negative review, commenting that [...] "this uninspired train wreck of a Game Boy title fails on nearly every level, {{but most of all}} simply because it's a snore-fest. It's your basic side-scrolling platformer with little to no connection to the source material and lasts only about few hours at best. During the game you come across bullies, camp counselors and even a few wild animals, battling them with spitballs, a boomerang and, in the lunchroom level, food. This one is for completists only." [...] Matt Williamson of the Rocky Mountain News gave the game a C+ grade and commented that [...] "Escape from Camp Deadly tries too hard to be a Nintendo game. It's hard, I know, to try to make game graphics more primitive, but please, guys, the more complex <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> graphics, the more confusing a game gets!"

2500|$|... 'What is necessary', writes Gleizes, 'is to take {{everything}} up {{again from the}} foundations and to start out from the unquestionable reality of two currents which, unaware of each other, were finally enfolded under a single heading, the movement that was called 'Cubism'.

2500|$|The {{argument}} of Law and the Unionists between 1912 and 1914 {{was based on}} three complaints. Firstly, Ulster would never accept forced Home Rule, and made up a quarter of Ireland; if the Liberals wanted to force this issue, military force {{would be the only}} way. Law thundered that [...] "Do you plan to hurl the full majesty and power of the law, supported on the bayonets of the British Army, against a million Ulstermen marching under the Union Flag and singing 'God Save The King'? Would the Army hold? Would the British people– would the Crown– stand for such a slaughter?". A second complaint was that the government had so far refused to submit it to a general election, as Law had been suggesting since 1910. Law warned that [...] "you will not carry this Bill without submitting it to the people of this country, and, if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> attempt, you will succeed only in breaking our Parliamentary machine". The third complaint was that the Liberals had still not honoured the preamble of the Parliament Act 1911, which promised [...] "to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of a hereditary basis". The Unionist argument was that the Liberals were trying to make a massive constitutional change while the constitution was suspended.|$|E
2500|$|The International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS) {{heavily criticized}} Virgin Galactic {{within hours of}} the accident. Tommaso Sgobba, Executive Director of the IAASS, claimed that Virgin Galactic had refused to let IAASS {{scientists}} review its procedures and snubbed industry gatherings. He stated: [...] "They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand. They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design. They use outdated methods like testing and then seeing what happens. There has been no independent oversight. There is no peer review. I have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen." [...] Sgobba, the former head of flight safety for the European Space Agency, said on November 6, 2014 that industry best practice called for operators to build in [...] "two-failure tolerance", or sufficient safeguards to survive two separate, unrelated failures—two human errors, two mechanical errors or one of each. [...] "What we see in the incident is what we call 'zero-failure tolerance'," [...] Mr Sgobba said. [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> mistake—you have a catastrophe. The design would not be acceptable in other safety-critical industries, such as aircraft manufacture." [...] Other members of IAASS also commented on the accident in the immediate aftermath. Rocket propulsion expert and rocket powered dragster driver Carolynne Campbell-Knight was quoted as saying that Virgin Galactic [...] "...should stop, give up. Go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones. They should stay out of the space business." [...] Campbell-Knight also stated that an explosion of the nitrous oxide hybrid propulsion system was the cause of the accident, although the initial NTSB report did not indicate that the propulsion system contributed to the breakup of the vehicle.|$|E
