500|$|Along with Spears's {{performance}} specifically, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was generally}} well received by television critics. In television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoler Seitz's 2016 book TV (The Book), Sepinwall singles out this episode (along with Slap Bet) as episodes where he [...] "will still laugh, and be touched, and marvel at just how inventive a traditional-looking sitcom can be". [...] Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted is a master of romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> being wooed. I wanted to like it more than I did. Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce heavy on the trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode, adding that the show returned to full form.|$|E

The songs lyrics {{pertain to the}} {{influence}} of Jackson and his worldwide appeal and effect, as well as reflecting on their own personal memories of Jackson. The song instruments include a piano and a bass drop. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] opens with a piano-accompanied soundscape starts off with Diddy [...] "testifying" [...] about Jackson's influence with the lyrics, [...] "I believed I can do anything," [...] he says. [...] "You made the world dance. You made the music come to life." [...] Then a [...] "thunderous bass drops" [...] in, led by Brown's vocals on the chorus, [...] "This the type of song that makes the angels cry/ Look up in the sky and I wonder why/ Why you had to go, go/ I know it's better on the other side." [...] The song concludes with one last statement from Diddy, [...] "People can say what they want about you. We gonna remember the miracles that you showed us. Through your music, through your dance. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that made us realize that you are the world. Through us your legacy lives on, Mike Jackson." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{interlude}} is {{the opening}} for eighth track [...] "With U", which {{was described as}} [...] "the follow-up to 1986's 'Let's Wait Awhile'", where a couple postpone intimacy. [...] "With U" [...] takes place after the act, which results in romantic confusion. In it, she sings, [...] "I wish <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> the one I could be with forever". [...] "Call on Me" [...] is the ninth song and lead single from 20 Y.O. It features Nelly, and samples The SOS Band's 1983 song [...] "Tell Me If You Still Care". It includes whispered vocals from both Jackson and Nelly. Second interlude finds Jackson remembering her Good Times days as Penny. [...] "Daybreak", the eleventh song, begins with fairy tale infused chimes before introducing electronic soul handclaps before Jackson starts singing. It has a few lyrics which deal about sex. The following track, [...] "Enjoy", is composed by piano and bass. In the song, Jackson's vocals were heavily treated. Both songs have additional carnival charms, sing-along melodies, and a children's chorus at its end of the latter. An interlude follows, with Jackson calling her lover, asking him to come home. Fourteenth song [...] "Take Care" [...] is a love song which finds the singer pleasuring herself while she waits for her lover. The last song from the album, [...] "Love 2 Love" [...] was recorded by Jackson with her brother Michael in mind. She sings, [...] "We are a couple / Which love knows no bounds". An outro closes the album.|$|E
