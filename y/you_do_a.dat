She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E

Critics have provided [...] "generally favorable reviews", according to Metacritic, which assigns a score of 79 out of 100 based on 10 reviews. Jim Squires, writing for Gamezebo, stated the game [...] "is both how <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> runner right AND how <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> superhero game right."

500|$|In early 2001, Spears {{said that}} she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later {{developed}} by Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes. Spears commented that she [...] "talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project. When <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> movie, I {{think you have to be}} really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into."

500|$|Francis {{characterized}} Genevieve as [...] "harsh", attesting {{this quality}} to her past tragedy. In {{an interview with}} AOL, Francis said that, [...] "Although tragic things have happened to her, she is not tragic." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described Genevieve as an [...] "eerie bitch". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described her as [...] "kooky" [...] and [...] "The Pervy-Odd Mob Mama". The soap opera's official website describes her relationship with Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) as [...] "twisted" [...] and [...] "confusing". Genevieve was considerably [...] "darker" [...] than the role of Laura Spencer on General Hospital, which Francis loved.

Rolling Stone wrote that Glover [...] "got judges on their feet" [...] with her [...] "impeccable" [...] performance. Mariah Carey was moved to tears by the performance and complimented Glover for doing the song justice. Nicki Minaj exlaimed {{at the end of}} the performance that [...] "And that is how <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> Mariah Carey/Whitney Houston song". Likewise, Billboard called Glover's performance [...] "best single showing of the night" [...] and commented on the vocal delivery that [...] "she knows precisely when to hit the sweet spot of a song, building up to that point with masterful restraint".

I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. Usually <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> project and it has its moment. This just feels like it keeps going." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of [...] on the Nintendo 64 in 1996, LucasArts began {{planning}} a follow-up. At the time, Factor 5 was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps. LucasArts, pleased with earlier collaborations with the company, decided to use Factor 5's engine for its new game. The game's focus would be space combat; this direction {{was inspired by a}} level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth. Rogue Squadron and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated, [...] "That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said, 'Why don't <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> whole game like that?' So we did." [...] Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films. This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, LucasFilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role.

[...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E

500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, in a way you don't get a chance to explore when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Steven Zaillian (writer of Schindler's List) {{was offered}} the chance to write the {{adaptation}} after Tally passed, but he also declined. He explained that [...] "I was busy. And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> sequel." [...] David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to Ridley Scott and the producers, needed major revisions. Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures (a co-production deal was struck between Universal and MGM) said on the rejection of Mamet's screenplay: [...] "There's no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available {{to work on the}} script day-to-day." [...] Mamet was preparing to direct his own film. Zaillian, who had already passed, reconsidered and became involved in the project, saying: [...] "It's hard to say no to Dino once and it's almost impossible to say no to him twice." [...] A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as [...] "stunningly bad" [...] but found Zaillian's rewrite to be [...] "gripping entertainment".|$|E
500|$|The {{publicity}} {{stemming from}} this incident was {{the impetus for}} Google contributing to the Chilling Effects archive, which archives legal threats of all sorts made against Internet users and Internet sites. Chilling Effects contains the original complaint letter from the law firm used by the Church of Scientology, Moxon & Kobrin.Google provided {{a copy of the}} letter from law firm Moxon & Kobrin to online rights watchdog Chilling Effects, a joint project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, and University of San Francisco law school clinics. Helena Kobrin, lawyer for the Church of Scientology, stated she took offense at the name of the Web site, saying: [...] "It implies that the First Amendment gives people some special right to infringe copyrights." [...] Sergey Brin and Larry Page were both questioned on Google's response to the Church of Scientology's complaints in a 2004 interview in Playboy Magazine, and they appreciated Chilling Effects as a [...] "nice compromise". Brin explained the new scenario: [...] "So now, if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> generic search on Scientology, you get a link to a site that discusses the legal aspects of why the anti-Scientology site isn't listed." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot from May 23 to 24, 2008 on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, with {{director}} Joseph Khan. American recording artist Britney Spears filmed a cameo appearance for the video on June 4 at the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles. An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly am not so sure. You shoot {{a lot of things}} when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so I really wish she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future." [...] A short clip of the music video was released online on June 12, 2008; a day before the video's premiere on June 13, 2008 on FNMTV.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E

[...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole was going to have a baby, James said [...] "I went in to see our producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different.

500|$|Kramer Morgenthau, {{who worked}} with Taylor on Game of Thrones, was brought in as the {{director}} of photography. Morgenthau said, [...] "We wanted a grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling, inspired by what Alan and I had done on Game of Thrones. We wanted the realms to feel grounded, like a real place, {{while at the same time}} respecting the magical 'planet of the Gods' feeling and theme." [...] Thor: The Dark World was Morgenthau's first time shooting a feature film digitally. For the film, Morgenthau chose the Arri Alexa Plus, although he tested with the Sony F65 but found the Alexa to be more pleasing. In addition to the Alexa, Red Epic and Canon EOS 5D Mark II cameras were used for second unit filming. With the Alexa, Morgenthau used Panavision anamorphic lenses. Morgenthau said, [...] "The lenses brought some of the magic and mystery of photochemical back to digital, that big-movie look." [...] Morgenthau also stated that Thor: The Dark World was easily the most technically complex project that he has worked but said, [...] "It's all the same concept and the same principles as in a smaller film. You just scale it up. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot more prep. We had three months of prep and loads of time to pre-rig stages. Part of it is having a really good crew—it's definitely not a one-man show." ...|$|E
500|$|Lucasfilm Games {{began to}} design Labyrinth: The Computer Game in 1985. Company head George Lucas had {{requested}} a tie-in video {{game for the}} movie of the same name, which was under production at Lucasfilm. As was common with Lucasfilm Games projects, Lucas himself provided very little direction to the team. Labyrinth was the first licensed game developed by the company: earlier products, such as Rescue on Fractalus! and The Eidolon, had been original intellectual properties. According to project leader David Fox, working with a license [...] "frees you up in some ways and restricts you, too". With their adaptation, the team was not pressured to reuse events and characters from the Labyrinth film; but they [...] "felt obligated" [...] to follow the source material. Because they saw the film as an adventure story, they chose to set their adaptation in the adventure game genre. However, Fox disliked the genre's then-reliance on text parsers and syntax guessing, and so he created the word wheel menus as a replacement. They were meant to supply [...] "a limited set of words that still let <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of things", in order to streamline the game without hampering the player's freedom. The game's visual design was shared by Lucasfilm's Habitat, a massively multiplayer online game under production at the time.|$|E
