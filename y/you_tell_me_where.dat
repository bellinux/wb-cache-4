500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I tell you what we ought to do. As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> we are going to be racing?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Resurrection Mary {{story is}} a type of {{vanishing}} hitchhiker story, a type of folklore that is known from many cultures. On his 1996 album The Artful Dodger, singer/songwriter Ian Hunter included the song [...] "Resurrection Mary", in which a driver in or near Chicago picks up a beautiful young woman with an [...] "incandescent glow" [...] who asks him [...] "I'm tryin' to get to Heaven/Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> that is?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2003, British musicologists {{stumbled}} upon superficial {{similarities between the}} lyric and rhyming schemes of [...] "Yesterday" [...] and Nat King Cole's and Frankie Laine's [...] "Answer Me, My Love"; originally a German song by Gerhard Winkler and Fred Rauch called Mütterlein, it was a number 1 hit for Laine on the UK charts in 1953 as [...] "Answer Me, O Lord", leading to speculation that McCartney had {{been influenced by the}} song. McCartney's publicists denied any resemblance between [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] and [...] "Yesterday". [...] "Yesterday" [...] begins with the lines: [...] "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay." [...] In its second stanza, [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] has the lines: [...] "You were mine yesterday. I believed that love was here to stay. Won't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> I've gone astray".|$|E

2500|$|Owner Tom Gerun {{contracted}} {{for several}} more show runs with Sophie Tucker through the 1940s. The club put on two floor shows a night, one at 9 or 9:30 and one starting around midnight. Gerun took the show some [...] south to Fort Ord to entertain U.S. Army troops for a special engagement in August 1941. Other bands {{taking part in the}} show were Carl Ravazza and his Palace Hotel Band, and Robert Nurok and his band from the Alcazar nightclub. Coming from the Bal Tabarin were Bob Saunders and his band, Señor Wences (a ventriloquist), singer-actress Gertrude Niesen, and the Duncan Sisters with their vaudeville act. After World War II started in earnest for the United States, Martinelli joked with a Billboard reporter that it was easy to get big-name stars to perform at his club, but asked [...] "can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> I can get one waiter and two dishwashers? Those are the rare birds these days." [...] After the war, Gerun hosted NBC broadcasts of Ted Lewis and his band, announced by Bill Roddy, performed live from the nightclub's stage. This activity was not enough to keep the club solvent—in 1947 Billboard reported their doors shut for a time so that the owners could save money as they attempted to sign a major musical artist. Gerun and Martinelli also admitted they were seeking a buyer for the place.|$|E
