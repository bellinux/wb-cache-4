In 2016, he remarked, [...] "as a film critic, it taught me that when a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> careful about {{assessing}} it... I didn't walk out on Blue Velvet because it was a bad film. I {{walked out on}} it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Feynman {{delivered}} the Caltech commencement {{address on the}} topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience {{due to a lack of}} [...] "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty" [...] on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, Harrison's Revolver {{compositions}} – [...] "Taxman", {{which opened}} the album, the Indian music-styled [...] "Love You To", and [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] – established {{him as a}} songwriter within the band. Recalling the release in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Sheffield said that Revolver displayed a diversity of emotions and styles ranging from the Beatles' [...] "prettiest music" [...] to [...] "their scariest", among which [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] represented the band at [...] "their friendliest". Commenting on the unprecedented inclusion of three of his songs on a Beatles album, Harrison told Melody Maker in 1966 that he felt disadvantaged in not having a collaborator, as Lennon and McCartney were to one another. He added: [...] "when you're competing against John and Paul, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> good to even get in the same league." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} cast for their hamming and {{effective}} delivery of what Bennion called the [...] "stilted, stagy dialogue"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting [...] "stellar". The {{attention to detail}} by {{the cast and crew}} was widely praised; the [...] "dated styling" [...] was, for Jackson, [...] "spot on". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that [...] "from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when you think about it, may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole". For her, [...] "the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own—these days <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> good to make TV that bad". White, similarly, argued that [...] "it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it [...] "relatively gripping". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, [...] "both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when you pay attention, {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> minimalist and choose every sound very carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio." ...|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> careful".|$|E
