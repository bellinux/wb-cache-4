500|$|Dante Bert Joseph [...] "Gluefingers" [...] Lavelli (February 23, 1923 – January 20, 2009) was an American {{football}} end {{who played}} for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) from 1946 to 1956. Starring alongside quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley, placekicker Lou Groza and fellow receiver Mac Speedie, Lavelli {{was an integral part}} of a Browns team that won seven championships during his 11-season career. Lavelli was known for his sure hands and improvisations on the field. He was also renowned for making catches in critical situations, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Clutch". [...] "Lavelli had one of the strongest pairs of hands I've ever seen," [...] Browns coach Paul Brown once said of him. [...] "When he went up for a pass with a defender, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> always count on him coming back down with the ball." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rauschenberg {{himself said}} that they were {{affected}} by ambient conditions, [...] "so <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> tell how many people are in the room".|$|E
2500|$|George Sidney {{described}} Thau as [...] "a {{very quiet}} man, a gentle man." [...] He {{would be brought}} in to calm down the performers when they got upset. He said, [...] "Benny spoke very quietly. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> never quite hear what he said. But he would talk to this one and that one and {{had the ability to}} calm things down.|$|E
60|$|COMTESSE. It is such as {{you or me}} that {{he needs}} to educate him now. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> do it <b>almost</b> too well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] says I, [...] "if {{you will}} promise {{me not to}} enter into {{anything}} relating to me with him, nor to begin any discourse at all unless he begins it with <b>you,</b> I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be persuaded {{to let you go}} and try." ...|$|R
3000|$|For example, A 12 (female, age 45), a {{waitress}} {{working at a}} restaurant in Dashilar, described her long work hours as a major reason for her constrained mobility: “For us waiters, work is too busy. When I need something, I buy it by walking. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> find <b>almost</b> everything <b>you</b> need here in Dashilar.” [...]...|$|R
2500|$|Stephenson's process {{progresses}} from sketch pad, {{to computer}} graphics, to clay models, and finally test models. He says {{the advantage of}} working with clay {{is that you can}} feel the transitions and feel where there is too much surface or more surface needed. He suggests that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> design a car blind, because [...] "you don't have to see it, you have to feel it, and by feeling it you feel if it's right or it's not right".|$|E
2500|$|... "The Big Show was {{not just}} more grand than most radio shows---it was also more witty, {{smoothly}} produced, smart, and ambitious, with an interesting juxtaposition of guests, but it wasn't significantly different," [...] wrote radio historian Gerald Nachman in Raised on Radio. [...] "It was just a more lavish, inflated revival of radio's earliest form---the variety showcase; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> hear the sequins." [...] Yet Nachman admired the show, which he said was [...] "as close to a Broadway show as radio could whip together each week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know as to that, sir," [...] {{said the}} captain, moving on, [...] "but there they are, {{and some of}} 'em {{polished}} to that extent <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> see your face in 'em." ...|$|E
50|$|Mainly {{due to the}} product's {{comparative}} pricing (for {{the price}} of two CDJ-1000's <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get <b>almost</b> three CMX-3000 units with two players each) the CMX-3000's have {{found their way to}} the setups of many mobile DJ as well as into the booths of many world's best nightclubs as a backup player in case the industry standard CDJ-1000's fail for some reason during a night.|$|R
60|$|Standing at Master Waffles' side, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> follow <b>almost</b> every {{movement}} of that intricate fray, and mark how now one {{and now the}} other of the battlers gained a short-lived advantage. It was a great fight. Shrewd blows were taken and given, and {{in the eye of}} the imagination <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see the air thick with flying fur. Louder and louder grew the din; and then, at its height, it ceased in one crescendo of tumult, and all was still, save for a faint, angry moaning.|$|R
6000|$|Sewell {{looked at}} her reflectively. [...] "I think <b>you</b> are. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> fancy <b>you</b> wanted {{so many things that}} you couldn't quite decide which was the most {{important}} and give up the rest. The difficulty is that we can't very often have them all, you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a hill," [...] Rachel replied. There {{could be}} no doubt that Mrs. Flushing had {{represented}} the vigorous and abrupt fling of the earth up into the air; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> see the clods flying as it whirled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Willie jibed {{with his}} name considerable. He weighed {{about as much as}} a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings, and he had a 'Where-is-Mary?' {{expression}} on his features so plain that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> see the wool growing on him.|$|E
60|$|The artful dodger! he {{had drawn}} and {{coloured}} a beautiful little {{sketch of a}} bridge; not an engineer's plan with sections and measurements, vexatious to a woman's eye, but a graceful little bridge {{with a string of}} cars running under it. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> hear the bell going.|$|E
500|$|... "People {{talk about}} how horrible {{it is to be}} brought up Catholic, and it's all true. The main thing was that there was no sense of proportion. I would chew a piece of gum at school, and the nun would say, 'Jesus is very angry with you about that,' and on the wall behind her would be a dying, {{bleeding}} guy on a cross. That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. <b>You</b> really <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|R
50|$|Zhombe Store, near Zhombe Bridge (Old Somalala-Zhombe Mission dust road) was {{the best}} shop in the area. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> find <b>almost</b> {{anything}} there. Fountain Pens, Nibs, Pen-holders and ink were always available at Zhombe Store. In the sixties schools did not use today's pens but Fountain pens or pen-holders fitted with a nib for dipping in ink for writing. Buses and delivery vans past right {{at the front of}} Zhombe Store, so supplies were never short at this store. United Bus Service (now ZUPCO) and Kambasha Bus Service were the only buses that serviced the Que-Que (Kwekwe)-Gokwe road.|$|R
5000|$|DrownedInSound.com - [...] "Granted, one wouldn't {{have wished}} for a watered down xerox of its predecessor, but the West Coast psychedelia on a Nashville {{vacation}} of Alive As <b>You</b> Are <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> {{be a different}} band entirely. When Tim Presley sings [...] "Act like you were born again in your own time" [...] on the album's midpoint 'Maple Day Getaway' he <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be writing his and Darker My Love's updated autobiography. Certainly anyone expecting {{a repeat of the}} gargantuan riffs and soaring melodies of 'Summer Is Here' and 'Talking Words' will be disappointed here, although once the initial shock subsides, there are still a handful of treasures in Alive As You Are to suggest the instinctive chameleon within the band hasn't totally dampened their songwriting abilities." ...|$|R
60|$|JOHN. Majority 244. I've {{beaten the}} baronet. I've done it, Maggie, {{and not a}} soul to help me; I've done it alone. [His voice breaks; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> pick up the pieces.] I'm as hoarse as a crow, and I have to address the Cowcaddens Club yet; David, pump some oxygen into me.|$|E
6000|$|He {{raised his}} head, {{and looked for}} a moment {{through the window at}} the shadow of the church against the night, so {{outlined}} that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> fancy that the light of the New Jerusalem was beyond it. Then he wrote, and this time not to the world at large but only to Mullins: ...|$|E
60|$|I haven't had {{anything}} nice {{to send you}} this ever so long, but here's a little bird's nest of native silver which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> live in as comfortably as a tit. It will stand nicely on your table without upsetting, and is so comfortable to hold, and altogether I'm pleased to have got it for you.|$|E
5000|$|On Oct 6, 2007, Craig Venter {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with UK's The Guardian newspaper that the same team had synthesized {{a modified version of the}} single chromosome of Mycoplasma genitalium using chemicals. The chromosome was modified to eliminate all genes which tests in live bacteria had shown to be unnecessary. The next planned step in this minimal genome project is to transplant the synthesized minimal genome into a bacterial cell with its old DNA removed; the resulting bacterium will be called Mycoplasma laboratorium. The next day the Canadian bioethics group, ETC Group issued a statement through their representative, Pat Mooney, saying Venter's [...] "creation" [...] was [...] "a chassis on which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> build <b>almost</b> anything". The synthesized genome had not yet been transplanted into a working cell.|$|R
60|$|The {{noiseless}} Morgan {{had listened}} to the conversation between Strong and Major Pendennis at the latter's own lodgings, and had carried away from it matter for much private speculation; and a desire of knowledge had led him to follow his master when the Major came to the Wheel of Fortune, and {{to take his place}} quietly in the Confidential room, whilst Pendennis and Clavering had their discourse in the parlour. There was a particular corner in the Confidential room from which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hear <b>almost</b> all that passed in the next apartment; and as the conversation between the two gentlemen there was rather angry, and carried on in a high key, Morgan had the benefit of overhearing almost the whole of it and what he heard, strengthened the conclusions which his mind had previously formed.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} the station had a low dial {{position}} {{it was able to}} get a lot out of 1000 watts of power. It had to protect other stations on 920 in Spokane and Olympia, WA so going north you lost them just past Salem where Portland's KISN (910) splashed over. The signal was more than sufficient for them to cover the tri-cities of Albany, Lebanon, and Corvallis. The {{fact that the}}y were directionalized west and south gave them almost a city-grade signal in Eugene and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take them <b>almost</b> to the Oregon coast.|$|R
60|$|In fact, if {{you were}} to mount to the roof of the Mausoleum Club itself on Plutoria Avenue <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> see the slums from there. But why should you? And on the other hand, if you never went up on the roof, but only dined inside among the palm trees, you would never know that the slums existed which is much better.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it! Sometimes {{the ground}} {{he is on}} looks so near that you think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> drop on it, {{and the next time}} it's yards and yards awa. I've stood ready for the spring, Mr. Dishart, a dozen times, but I aye sickened. I daurna do it. Look at the dog; just when it's {{starting}} to jump, it pulls itsel' back." ...|$|E
60|$|And then Milly loomed {{up with a}} {{thousand}} dishes on her bare arm--loomed up big and white and pink and awful as Mount Saint Elias--with a smile like day breaking in a gulch. And the Klondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross, and let his jaw fall half-way, and stared at her. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> see the diamond tiaras on Milly's brow and the hand-embroidered silk Paris gowns that he meant to buy for her.|$|E
5000|$|The Beatles's {{introduction}} to [...] "Prellies" [...] (Preludin) was in Hamburg. As {{the group had}} to play for hours, Sheridan offered them Preludin, saying: [...] "Here's something to keep you awake." [...] Astrid Kirchherr also supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin, which when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. Looking back, Harrison said that the whole group would be “frothing at the mouth,” and would sometimes stay awake for days. Lennon recalled, “The waiters always had these pills Preludin, so when they saw the musicians falling over with tiredness or drink, they’d give you the pill. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> work <b>almost</b> endlessly until the pill wore off, and then you’d have another.” McCartney said that he would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five.|$|R
25|$|It {{seemed to}} strike an {{extraordinary}} {{balance between the}} psychological and the supernatural {{in such a way}} as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> accept it <b>almost</b> without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|R
50|$|Ghosts are {{the implied}} {{explanation}} for Jack's {{escape from the}} locked storeroom. In an interview by scholar Michel Ciment, Kubrick stated:It seemed to strike an extraordinary balance between the psychological and the supernatural {{in such a way}} as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.'

60|$|Every day, {{when his}} work was done, he used {{to go up to}} the house, half hidden among {{flowering}} plants and brilliant creepers, where humming-birds darted from bush to bush, and parrots of all colours, red and green and grey, shrieked in chorus. There he would find the maiden waiting for him, and they would spend an hour or two under the stars, which looked so large and bright that you felt as if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> touch them.|$|E
60|$|But on the {{occasion}} in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.|$|E
60|$|The {{birds are}} also remarkably tame. If you {{happened}} to see one perched upon a branch within reach of your arm, and advanced towards it, it did not fly away immediately, but waited quietly looking at you, until <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> touch it, and then took wing slowly, less alarmed at your presence, it would seem, than desirous of removing itself from your path. Had salt been less scarce in the valley than it was, this was the very place to have gone birding with it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some dog, some points," [...] he {{said aloud}} approvingly. [...] "Say, dog, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> pull down ribbons like a candy-kid in any bench show anywheres. Only thing against you is that ear, and I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> iron it out myself. A vet. could do it." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{can we say}} to you, {{in those}} many, many homes where the light has gone out forever?--you, O fathers, mothers, wives, sisters, haunted by a name that has ceased to be spoken on earth,--you, for whom {{there is no more}} news from the camp, no more reading of lists, no more tracing of maps, no more letters, but only a blank, dead silence! The battlecry goes on, but for you it is passed by! the victory comes, but, oh, never more to bring him back to you! your {{offering}} to this great cause has been made, and been taken; you have thrown into it all your living, even all that you had, and from henceforth your house is left unto you desolate! O ye watchers of the cross, ye waiters by the sepulchre, what can be said to <b>you?</b> We <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> extinguish our own home-fires, that seem too bright when we think of your darkness; the laugh dies on our lip, the lamp burns dim through our tears, and we seem scarcely worthy to speak words of comfort, lest we seem as those who mock a grief they cannot know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! pray stay then," [...] {{said his}} {{companion}} eagerly; [...] "I {{expect you to}} stay now. If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only have an idea what a relief conversing with you is, after having been dragged by the Crown Prince and whirled by that von Sohnspeer! Heigho!
