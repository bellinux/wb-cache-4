The rule should be changed so that a rider with no chance of winning can give his bike to his leader, or {{there should be a}} car with several spare bicycles. You lose the Tour de France when you find someone better than you are. You don't lose it through a stupid accident to <b>your</b> <b>machine.</b> Next year Desgrange modified the rules.|$|E
500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me so much confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun. Following Caesar you found yourself getting more out of <b>your</b> <b>machine</b> than you had ever imagined was possible, doing things that done by yourself would have made your hair stand on end." ...|$|E

2500|$|CEO Marcin Kleczynski {{states that}} the Malwarebytes engine has an {{advantage}} over many of the traditional antivirus programs because it was developed in 2008, when many of the others were developed in the late 1990s and had little idea of what malware would look like 15 years down the line. He states that this makes it [...] "easier for us to adapt as malware evolves". The New York Times describes their system as a [...] "hybrid of heuristics, behavior and a signature engine {{that is designed to}} detect and block malware that other vendors can't detect". According to Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat, Malwarebytes complements other antivirus software from vendors such as Symantec and McAfee, with the anti-malware working with the anti-virus software to attack the problem from [...] "different directions". He remarked that Malwarebytes [...] "cleans off machines that are already infected", while [...] "the pro version stops <b>your</b> <b>machine</b> from getting infected in the first place".|$|E

[...] It was eventually recorded at his houseboat studio, the Astoria, for the 2006 album On an Island. The song is in 3/4 time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{trust you}} may," [...] I answered, a trifle tartly. [...] "I am glad you're {{likely to do}} a little business; but you won't mind, my {{reminding}} you--will you?-- that you really came down here to give me a leg up with my election, and not to sell <b>your</b> <b>machines</b> or to spend half your time in the enemy's camp!" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, {{she says}} you'll {{be glad to}} see her when you know what she's come about. She's quite a common girl, sir. Very common indeed.
