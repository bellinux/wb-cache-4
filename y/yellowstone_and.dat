Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, {{as well as to}} provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities.|$|E
5|$|Three deep canyons {{are located}} in the park, cut through the {{volcanic}} tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000years. The Lewis River flows through Lewis Canyon in the south, and the Yellowstone River has carved two colorful canyons, the Grand Canyon of the <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone in its journey north.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone National Park was {{established}} in 1872. By the 1890s, the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in the <b>Yellowstone</b> River <b>and</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> Lake were well known and being promoted in national guidebooks.|$|R

5|$|One {{large group}} of fires {{was known as the}} Snake River Complex. These fires were in the {{southern}} section of the park, in the headwaters region of the <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The divide is a {{topographic}} feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the divide. The origins of the <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Heritage and Research Center {{is located}} at Gardiner, Montana, near the north {{entrance}} to the park.

The Yellowstone National Park Archives maintain collections of historical records of <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> the National Park Service. The collection includes the administrative records of Yellowstone, as well as resource management records, records from major projects, and donated manuscripts and personal papers. The archives are affiliated with the National Archives and Records Administration.|$|E

2500|$|The Mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in <b>Yellowstone</b> streams <b>and</b> rivers below the major falls. [...] It {{occurs in the}} Fall River, Snake River, Shoshone River, <b>Yellowstone</b> River <b>and</b> Gallatin River drainages. With one exception, it occurs only below the major waterfall barriers on the Firehole (Firehole Falls), <b>Yellowstone</b> (Knowles Falls) <b>and</b> Fall river drainages. [...] When the park waters were first surveyed in the 1880s–90s by biologists, they discovered a population of Mottled scuplin in the Gibbon River above Gibbon Falls, a water otherwise barren of fish. [...] No scientific explanation for this has yet been developed.|$|R
5|$|Behnke in his {{salmon and}} trout {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native to a separate geographic area. Not {{all of them were}} scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the cutthroat trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million years ago, in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs. These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> Lahontan.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{political}} advisers {{had given}} him a physically demanding schedule, even though the president had ordered it cut back. In Kansas City, Harding spoke on transportation issues; in Hutchinson, Kansas, agriculture was the theme. In Denver, he spoke on Prohibition, and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until Franklin Roosevelt. Harding had become a supporter of the World Court, and wanted the U.S. to become a member. In addition to making speeches, he visited <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> Zion National Parks, and dedicated a monument on the Oregon Trail at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer Ezra Meeker and others.|$|E

5|$|In Alaska, {{the gray}} wolf {{population}} {{is estimated at}} 6,000–7,000, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in <b>Yellowstone,</b> <b>and</b> 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho. The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was re-classed from endangered to threatened in 2003. Reintroduced Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight packs. A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times. DNA analysis by Fish and Wildlife laboratories showed genetic characteristics {{similar to those of}} wolves in the Great Lakes Region.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the Federal {{government}} had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial {{decision by the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas {{as suggested by the}} substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.|$|E
5|$|The planet Vulcan {{setting was}} created using {{a mixture of}} on-location {{photography}} at Minerva Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park and set recreation. Yellowstone was selected after filming in Turkish ruins proved to be too expensive. Securing permission for filming the scenes was difficult {{in the middle of}} the summer tourist season, but the Parks Department acquiesced so long as the crew remained on the boardwalks to prevent damage to geological formations. Zuberano, who had helped select the site for the shoot, traveled to <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>and</b> returned with a number of photos. Minor also made a trip and returned to create a large painting depicting how the scene might look. In consultations with Michelson, the crew decided to use miniatures in the foreground to create the Vulcan temples, combined with the real hot springs in the background. In the film, the bottom third of the frames were composed of miniature stairs, rocks, bits of red glass and a Vulcan statue. The center of the frame contained Nimoy's shots and the park setting, while the final third of the frame was filled with a matte painting. On August 8, the day after production began at Paramount, an eleven-person second unit left for Yellowstone. The sequence took three days to shoot.|$|E
