5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} for me to give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the surprise and consternation experienced by all on the receipt of the order to sail. Indeed, that surprise is well justified, for nothing can be expected of this expedition except the total destruction of the fleet or its hasty and demoralized return.|$|E
25|$|I wish I {{could give}} <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{the beauty of}} the {{situation}} of this house. The view of the river from the Balcony is lovely and in the distance the thick bush, is here and there cleared away, with the town at one side of the River, it certainly is very beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{might have}} struck me," [...] Crestwick rejoined. [...] "But you owned that <b>you</b> had <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what {{happened}} at the jump. How did you get it? Did Lisle tell you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must ask}} you first, Mr. Holmes, {{to glance at}} this rough plan, which will give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> general <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the {{position}} of the professor's study and the various points of the case. It will help you in following my investigation." ...|$|R
60|$|Suppose {{twenty or}} thirty such scenes going on at once, and <b>you</b> have <b>a</b> faint <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the Bergen fish-market.|$|R
500|$|Petrucci {{has called}} Portnoy's {{departure}} {{one of the}} hardest things Dream Theater have had to face, and speaking of when he first heard the news, Jordan Rudess recounted, [...] "You know, just to give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how deep this was to lose him, how difficult it was... after we got off the phone with him... I literally sat on the steps of my studio and cried. This is a guy who's a friend of mine, who we all love and admire. We didn't want to see it come crashing down." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} {{began work}} in early January 1871 and {{spent six months}} taking evidence. After Josephine testified on 18 March, {{a member of the}} committee, Liberal MP Peter Rylands, stated: [...] "I am not accustomed to religious phraseology, but I cannot give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the effect produced except by saying that the spirit of God was there". Nevertheless, the commission's report defended the one-sided nature of the legislation, saying [...] "...there is no comparison to be made between prostitutes and the men who consort with them. With the one sex the offence is committed as a matter of gain; with the other it is an irregular indulgence of a natural impulse." [...] The report accepted the findings that the sexual health of men in the 18 areas covered by the Acts had improved. In relation to the compulsory examinations, the commission was swayed by the descriptions of [...] "steel rape", and suggested it should be voluntary not compulsory. The commission heard significant evidence that many prostitutes were as young as 12 and recommended that the age of consent should be raised from 12 to 14. Bruce took no action on the recommendations for six months.|$|E
2500|$|Pretty {{frivolous}} interview, but gives <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{what the}} man is like ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It made {{me angry}} hot. Of course <b>you</b> couldn't keep <b>a</b> {{thing like that}} quiet; but the chests had been secured in the usual manner and were safe enough for any earthly gale, while this had been an {{altogether}} fiendish business I couldn't give <b>you</b> even <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Isabella corroborated it: [...] "My dearest Catherine, <b>you</b> cannot form <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the dirt; come, {{you must}} go; you cannot refuse going now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{will see}} {{no more of}} Stanhope after this week. I have {{arranged}} to send <b>you</b> to <b>a</b> tutor in Hertfordshire, who I hope will make you work, and where, I trust, you will find companions who will give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> better <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what becomes <b>a</b> gentleman.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Benjamin {{is married}} to activist Kevin Danaher and has one daughter, Arlen, from her first {{marriage}} in Cuba and another daughter, Maya, from her marriage with Danaher. Her daughter Arlen is named after Sandinista revolutionary Arlen Siu, with her daughter once writing [...] "I grew up believing that protest lines and teach-ins were normal family outings ... I was born in Cuba to an Afro-Cuban father and Jewish-American mother, {{and the fact that}} I was named for the first woman to die fighting for the Nicaraguan [...] Revolution gives <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> my politically oriented upbringing".|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, church apostle Mark E. Petersen: [...] "I think I {{have read}} {{enough to give}} <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what the Negro is after. He is not just seeking the {{opportunity}} of sitting down in a cafe where white people eat. He isn't just trying to ride on the same streetcar or the same Pullman car with white people. It isn't that he just desires {{to go to the}} same theater as the white people. From this, and other interviews I have read, it appears that the Negro seeks absorption with the white race. He will not be satisfied until he achieves it by intermarriage. That is his objective and we must face it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{can be no}} harm in your hearing it," [...] was Miss Fossett's excuse; [...] "it {{will give}} <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{the state of the}} poor thing's mind." ...|$|E
60|$|They are, {{in spite}} of their weaknesses, {{absolutely}} the only landscapes I could show you which give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> real <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the places, or which put your minds into the tone which, if you were happy and at ease, they would take in the air and light of Italy.|$|R
60|$|It was Jeeves. He had slid {{from the}} shadows and was gazing gravely at the picture. Upon my word, I can't give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> better <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the {{shattering}} effect of Corky's uncle Alexander when in action than by {{saying that he had}} absolutely made me forget for the moment that Jeeves was there.|$|R
6000|$|... "The devil it is!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "I'll come, Ralph. I shall motor to Norwich, {{and catch}} the eight o'clock. Could <b>you</b> give me <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are fortunate, then. He is unendurable. To give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> him, {{suppose you}} met him here (which you never will), {{he would write}} to you the next day, [...] "My dear St. James."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{want you}} to look at those; I merely meant to give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> my {{investment}} transactions. But if you do cost as much as they, never mind. You'll yield a better return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must excuse me; {{my answer}} might, for {{anything}} I know, give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> whose forces {{are in your}} front. Such knowledge as that is what I came into your lines to obtain, not to impart." ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of Maryknoll School {{air raid}} {{trenches}}. "This will give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what our campus looks like. There are five other series of trenches besides this one. See how our vegetables {{are beginning to}} grow. Each class has its own garden adjoining its air raid shelter. About 1500 feet of trenches were dug. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a plain {{case against}} the spring-gun," [...] said the Warden; [...] "and, as you tell me <b>you</b> are <b>a</b> stranger, I trust you will not suppose that our {{peaceful}} English woods and parks are the haunt of banditti. We must try to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> better <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> us. May I ask, are <b>you</b> <b>an</b> American, and recently come among us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, {{you have}} got the arms and {{ammunition}} which our great father sent for his children. If <b>you</b> have <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> going away, give them to us, and you may go and welcome. Our lives {{are in the hands}} of the Great Spirit. We are determined to defend our lands, and if it be his will, we wish to leave our bones upon them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{it is very}} rough, sir," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it may give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the {{position}} of the town and the neighbouring heights, and the position occupied by our troops." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} give me a piece of paper," [...] Mr. Sabin said, [...] "I will make you a sketch of the Duchess. The larger the better. I can give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the sort of clothes she would {{probably}} be wearing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However terrible they are, {{they can}} hardly give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the truth. At Nantes, for instance, the {{guillotine}} is too slow; {{and hundreds of}} men, women, and children are put into boats, which are sunk {{in the middle of}} the river. It is too horrible to think of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be absurd," [...] she answered. [...] "If I knew it, should I {{be likely}} to tell it to <b>you?</b> I have <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the nature of it, of course. But that is not enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, Sir Wycherly, I {{would not}} give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> false <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> my friend Atwood, if possible; and so I may as well confess, that, while his Scotch blood {{inclines}} him to toryism, his English reason makes him a whig. If Charles Stuart never gets the throne until Stephen Atwood helps him to a seat on it, he may take leave of ambition for ever." ...|$|R
5000|$|Janet Maslin in the New York Times wrote: [...] "Though Michelle Pfeiffer {{delivers}} impressively cold fury as the story's {{version of}} Regan (now an embittered breast cancer patient called Rose), and Jessica Lange {{works hard to}} breathe life into its Goneril (called Ginny), the film remains stilted and unconvincing... Think obsessive-compulsive Lady Macbeth or Ophelia with an eating disorder, and <b>you</b> have <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> just how simplistic that seems." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My name," [...] said he, [...] "is John Openshaw, but my {{own affairs}} have, as far as I can understand, {{little to do with}} this awful business. It is a {{hereditary}} matter; so in order to give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.|$|E
60|$|Just to give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{the immense}} {{variety of the}} Jungle Law, I have {{translated}} into verse (Baloo always recited them {{in a sort of}} sing-song) a few of the laws that apply to the wolves. There are, of course, hundreds and hundreds more, but these will do for specimens of the simpler rulings.|$|E
6000|$|... “He {{was just}} {{risen from the}} king’s table, and waiting for his {{equipage}} {{to go home and}} prepare for the ball. To give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the energy of his royal highness’s language, I ought to set apart an objection to writing, or rather intimating, certain forcible words, and beg leave to show you in genuine colours a royal sailor.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "Think {{of trying}} to {{transform}} a baked cake back into raw eggs, flour, sugar, vanilla [...] [...] [...] and <b>you</b> get <b>a</b> simplified <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the magnitude of Tuvok and Neelix from Tuvix." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We’ll let it go,” Clay {{answered}} dryly. “I guess <b>you</b> have <b>a</b> different <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> your value now. But you don’t seem to {{be making}} much progress with Ruth Osborne. I suppose you really want her?” ...|$|R
60|$|Next week we {{are off to}} Germany and Switzerland, and as {{we shall}} travel fast, I shall {{only be able to}} give you hasty letters. I keep my diary, and try to 'remember {{correctly}} and describe clearly all that I see and admire', as Father advised. It is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> better <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> my tour than these scribbles.|$|R
