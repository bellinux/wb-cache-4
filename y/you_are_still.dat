5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
25|$|Kramer even stated: Does it {{occur to}} you that we brought this plague of AIDS upon ourselves? I know I am getting into {{dangerous}} waters here but it is time. With the cabal breathing even more murderously down our backs it is time. And <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> doing it. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> murdering each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know all of <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I {{did not have a}} gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

500|$|The recitative for tenor, [...] "" [...] (Yet consider, o Jesus), {{begins as}} a secco recitative, but the idea [...] "" [...] (Yet consider, o Jesus, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> called a Prince of Peace!), close {{to the theme of}} the cantata, is {{accompanied}} by a quote of the chorale tune in the continuo.|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Although not {{included}} in the Test squads to face either New Zealand or South Africa, White was named in the ODI and Twenty20 squads to face South Africa at home, and professed [...] "it was a good feeling to know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in the mix". White played in a more familiar role in the Twenty20s, batting in the middle-order, and after a disappointing 7 in the first match, made 40* off 18 in the second to push Australia's total up beyond South Africa's reach. He had a steady ODI series, in which he was again used as a middle-order batsman, and part-time spinner. [...] He retained his place for the one-day series against New Zealand, but had limited involvement, making 27runs from his two innings, though he did claim two wickets in his seven overs bowling.|$|E
500|$|On 20 June, the King's uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, and Robert Tresilian, the {{replacement}} Chief Justice, were given special commissions {{across the whole}} of England. Thomas oversaw court cases in Essex, backed up by a substantial military force as resistance was continuing and the county was still {{in a state of}} unrest. Richard himself visited Essex, where he met with a rebel delegation seeking confirmation of the grants the King had given at Mile End. Richard rejected them, allegedly telling them that [...] "rustics you were and rustics <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still.</b> You will remain in bondage, not as before, but incomparably harsher". Tresilian soon joined Thomas, and carried out 31 executions in Chelmsford, then travelled to St Albans in July for further court trials, which appear to have utilised dubious techniques to ensure convictions. Thomas went on to Gloucester with 200 soldiers to suppress the unrest there. Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, was tasked to restore order to Yorkshire.|$|E
500|$|David Fricke of Rolling Stone {{felt the}} album's lyrics have an [...] "emotional and {{pictorial}} directness, rare for Yorke". The lines [...] "No more {{going to the}} dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I have to pull you out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The album title was inspired by [...] "these huge elephants {{that we have in the}} room at the moment, in the west, and people are desperately trying to erase them from public consciousness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] she admitted. [...] "Indeed, I'll {{confess that}} I was {{somewhat}} startled {{when you came}} in. You see, I imagined that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in Canada." ...|$|R

500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E
500|$|The telepathic mutant {{leader and}} founder of the X-Men. He is a close friend of Erik Lehnsherr until their differing views of mutantkind's place in {{humanity}} create a schism between them. McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry. McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the X-Men cartoons from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as [...] "a monk... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: [...] "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not going too far with it, but he's definitely got an ego and he's definitely got a sex drive as well." [...] McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and Martin Luther King Jr./Malcolm X, stating that the film was [...] "sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding out who they are and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> seeing some of the events that shaped them." [...] McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier as Vaughn told him and Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration. Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was [...] "a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's got too much fucking power", the script would make young Xavier more interesting by [...] "making him more of a rogue" [...] who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.|$|E
2500|$|.....he [...] {{went into}} the bedchamber, and saw the {{portrait}} {{of an old man}} crowned with garlands, and lamps and altars set before it. And he called him and said: Lycomedes, {{what do you mean by}} this matter of the portrait? [...] Can it be one of thy gods that is painted here? [...] For I see that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> living in heathen fashion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thus, Jacob (also {{known as}} Israel) and his entire house of seventy, {{gathered}} {{up with all}} their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. As they approached Egyptian territory, Judah went ahead to ask Joseph where the caravan should unload. They were directed into the province of Goshen and Joseph readied his chariot to meet his father there. It had been over twenty years since Joseph had last seen his father. When they met, they embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. His father then remarked, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> alive.” (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul the Apostle {{declared}} that [...] "Christ died for our sins {{according to the}} scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures". (...) The chapter states that such a belief in both the death and resurrection of Christ is of central importance to the Christian faith: [...] "And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain." [...] (...) Paul further asserted [...] "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied." [...] (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|Dallas {{received}} his orders at 11:00, and {{half an hour}} later Dobell and Chetwode ordered him to launch his attack forthwith. By 11:30, Desert Column staff considered that the 53rd (Welsh) Division was practically stationary, and the following message was sent to Dallas: [...] "I am directed to observe that (1) you have been out of touch with Desert Column and your own headquarters for over two hours; (2) no gun registration appears to have been carried out; (3) that time is passing, and that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> far from your objective; (4) that the Army and Column Commanders are exercised at the loss of time, which is vital; (5) you must keep a general staff officer at your headquarters who can communicate with you immediately; (6) you must launch your attack forthwith."

2500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2006, The Times style {{director}} Tina Gaudoin observed that [...] "when the women's wear buyer at M & S is quoted saying 'boho is over', you know the trend is well and truly six foot under." [...] Even so, the so-called [...] "folk" [...] look of spring 2007, with its smock tops and flounce hemmed dresses, owed much to boho-chic, while embracing such trends as the re-emergence of the mini-dress: as the Sunday Times put it, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> bemoaning {{the passing of the}} gypsy look, then the folk trend could be your saving grace". The Sunday Times cited the 1960s singer Mary Hopkin as influencing the use of bandannas, while, around the same time, Sienna Miller's appearance as 1960s [...] "starlet" [...] Edie Sedgwick in the film Factory Girl positioned her once more as a bohemian style icon. London Lite observed in May 2007 that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Israel and {{his entire}} house of seventy, {{gathered}} {{up with all}} their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. En route, Israel stopped at Beersheba for the night to make a sacrificial offering to his God, Yahweh. Apparently he had some reservations about leaving the land of his forefathers, but God reassured him not to fear that he would rise again. God also assured {{that he would be}} with him, he would prosper, and he would also see his son Joseph who would lay him to rest. Continuing their journey to Egypt, when they approached in proximity, Israel sent his son Judah ahead to find out where the caravans were to stop. They were directed to disembark at Goshen. It was here, after twenty-two years, that Jacob saw his son Joseph once again. They embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. Israel then said, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> alive.” (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{while he}} was {{traveling}} to Philadelphia from Pakistan, Gilani was arrested by police in Frankfurt, West Germany after two kilos of heroin were found hidden in a false bottom in his suitcase. Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was {{handed over to the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: [...] "It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, to do what you can with the rest of your life. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> a young man. You can either take advantage of this opportunity.
