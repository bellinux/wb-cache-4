500|$|The release {{also drew}} criticism. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a bait and switch, to get <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for a MySpace-quality stream {{as a way to}} promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} generally positive reviews. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday {{described it}} as a barrage of artistic images that continued the song's theme of combining art with pop culture. Erin Coulehan of Rolling Stone magazine noted that the video was in [...] "typical Gaga fashion", further calling it a spectacle of flashing lights, vivid colors and intricate choreography. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly also echoed Coulehan's statements about the video being in Gaga fashion, adding that it [...] "makes the song sound infinitely better... It doesn't quite hit the high notes of 'Paparazzi' or 'Bad Romance', but it's definitely a step up from the middling clips from the Born This Way era." [...] A writer of Billboard described the video as [...] "a collection of arty postures and scenarios" [...] and compared the black-glove bra look to Janet Jackson's 1993 Rolling Stone magazine cover. Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times saw the video as [...] "basically like 20 different Vogue shoots documented and spliced. There is no plot other than the basic lyrical premise, [...] "I need <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more attention to me," [...] given heft by a syllabically rocky first-person observation about pop culture, fame and art that Andy Warhol noted 50 years ago." [...] Chiderah Monde of New York Daily News described the video as [...] "a straight-forward profile of the artist herself." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

2500|$|Another Spanish businessman, who {{supervised}} ABM's {{operations in}} Equatorial Guinea from 1995 to 1997, said Teodorín [...] "would call {{us to come}} to his office, which meant wearing a suit and tie. He would keep you waiting for five hours and then appear wearing shorts. He would then tell you how much he wanted <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him, and that you had a week to do so, saying: 'If you don't pay, we will confiscate the machinery and give your concession to the Chinese.' We had to flee the country. He was demanding millions. The only ones who stayed were those who paid him." [...] Yet another Spanish firm, which was forced to work with a local company on whose board of directors Teodorin sat, [...] "had to pay commissions at every stage of the way" [...] and was confronted [...] "with permits and other obstacles"; after the firm had filled a warehouse with timber, one member of the firm was arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of rape, apparently a standard way of treating foreign businesspeople.
