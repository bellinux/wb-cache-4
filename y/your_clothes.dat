Once you take it all off, all your inhibitions, <b>your</b> <b>clothes,</b> we're all made up of the same thing." [...] She explained that she did not want the video to just be about [...] "Taking it off", that the message behind the video and the theme wasn't [...] "just about taking off <b>your</b> <b>clothes</b> and rolling in glitter.

500|$|... "Celebration" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a sleek dance-oriented track with influences of previous dance singles by Madonna from the early 90s such as, [...] "Vogue" [...] (1990) and [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] (1992). It consists of a pumping, house style music in it. Paul Oakenfold described the composition as [...] "lyrically classic Madonna with an edgy modern sound." [...] Influences of Europop are found in the song, but not to the extent of previous single, [...] "Hung Up" [...] (2005). According to a writer from the Los Angeles Times, the song has a highly energetic synth-pop groove while referencing 80s Madonna songs. The bridge is in a speak-sing format, where Madonna's voice, consisting of a little edge, declares that [...] "I [...] recognize you with <b>your</b> <b>clothes</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the harsh}} {{economic}} {{times of the}} early Depression, films and performers often featured an alienated, cynical, and socially dangerous comic style. As with political films, comedy softened {{with the election of}} FDR and the optimism of the New Deal. Characters in the pre-Code era frequently engaged in comedic duels of escalating sexual innuendo. In Employee's Entrance, a woman enters the office of a scoundrel boss who remarks, [...] "Oh, it's you — I didn't recognize you with all <b>your</b> <b>clothes</b> on." [...] Racial stereotypes were usually employed when ethnic characters appeared. Blacks in particular were usually the butt of the wisecrack, never the author. The most acknowledged black comedian was Stepin Fetchit, whose slow-witted comedic character was only meant to be successful in an unintentional manner, with himself as the punchline.Bogle, pg. 42.|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change <b>your</b> <b>clothes,</b> you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity...

500|$|The kiss between Mulder and Scully {{caused a}} furor of opinions. The Complete X-Files noted that many fans were [...] "ecstatic" [...] about Mulder and Scully's [...] "long-awaited" [...] kiss. David Blar from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "shocking" [...] because of Mulder and Scully's kiss, asking, [...] "why they didn't lock lips sooner"? Paula Vitaris {{noted that the}} kiss [...] "seems stuck on to the episode by a tack in its {{complete}} irrelevance to the storyline or Mulder and Scully in general." [...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files is getting more attention for what happens near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip <b>your</b> <b>clothes</b> off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s {{been going on for a}} long time now, right under our noses." ...|$|E
500|$|Nookie in New York, the TV {{show that}} Marge watches with her sisters, spoofs the TV series Sex and the City. When Marge leaves with Artie, {{she sees that}} Homer has spelt the words [...] "Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Clothes</b> On" [...] as a direct {{reference}} to the M*A*S*H series finale, Goodbye, Farewell and Amen. In the video that Homer recorded for Marge, Homer holds two toys. The one {{in his left hand}} is a [...] "Funzo", a fictional toy which first appeared in the season 11 episode [...] "Grift of the Magi". The fictional area of [...] "West Springfield" [...] is modeled after the American state Texas (purposely once again a red-herring to where Springfield is based - it seems to be right next to Texas, until Lisa states that West Springfield is [...] "Three times the size of Texas"). The scene in which Homer and Lenny are travelling to West Springfield is a reference to the last scene in the 1969 drama film Midnight Cowboy. The music heard during the scene is also made to resemble the theme from said film. The scene in which Homer and Lenny are working in an oil rig is a reference to the 1970 film Five Easy Pieces. The song produced by Artie's invention {{at the end of the}} episode is Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), originally by The Eurythmics.|$|E
500|$|Of the {{multiple}} music critics who {{commented on the}} song, the majority praised [...] "Skins musical structure and Rihanna's vocal performance. Apart from writing about the song's composition, Daw called the ballad [...] "smoldering" [...] and compared the last minute of the song to Sades [...] "No Ordinary Love" [...] for the song's sensual content, but noted that Adu's song is not as lyrically graphic as [...] "Skin". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Rihanna's sensuality in the song is evoked though her use of sexually suggestive moaning and heavy breathing, adding to the [...] "slow, torrid buildup". Colin Gentry of 4Music noted that Rihanna appears to be transitioning from singing songs about partying and dancing in clubs to singing about her sexual fantasies and desires, writing [...] "Rihanna swaggers through the album as {{a woman on the}} prowl, taking her conquests from the clubs to the bedroom. Demanding to know 'why are you standing over there with <b>your</b> <b>clothes</b> on?' on sultry track Skin, the Barbadian clearly means business." [...] Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media concurred with Stern with regard to [...] "Skin" [...] being the singer's most mature song to date, writing [...] "Skin' is her sexiest song yet, a haunted, near-dubstep stunner that wouldn't sound totally out of place on Massive Attack's Mezzanine." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{linguists}} {{and philosophers}} of language have criticized Fodor's self-proclaimed [...] "extreme" [...] concept nativism. Kent Bach, for example, takes Fodor {{to task for}} his criticisms of lexical semantics and polysemy. Fodor claims {{that there is no}} lexical structure to such verbs as [...] "keep", [...] "get", [...] "make" [...] and [...] "put". He suggests that, alternatively, [...] "keep" [...] simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, [...] "keep <b>your</b> <b>clothes</b> on", [...] "keep your receipt" [...] and [...] "keep washing your hands" [...] will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes on or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, differently, to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of [...] "fast" [...] in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of pragmatic inference, is a matter of debate. Fodor's own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in Concepts: [...] "People sometimes used to say that exist must be ambiguous because look at the difference between 'chairs exist' and 'numbers exist'. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. Since you have the latter to explain the former, you don't also need 'exist' to be polysemic." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in Milan, Italy between {{the dates of}} the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. The concept of the video is in {{similarity}} to {{the title of the}} song; celebration of Madonna's career. According to MTV, the video is a throwback to Madonna's Erotica era and encompasses a dark music image. The Benny Benassi remix of the song is used in the video. It starts with Madonna asking the line [...] "Haven't I seen you somewhere before?". The music starts and the scenes cut between Madonna and her dancers start dancing to the music of the song. Madonna wears a crystal embossed, shouldered Balmain dress with knee-high Christian Louboutin boots. While she is present in almost every frame of the camera, she does not perform choreographed dance moves. Her dance is mostly confined to casual maneuvers. The dancers on the other hand, perform choreographed moves as a solo act. As the song progresses, more dancers are shown and they ultimately reach a club. The DJ in the club is portrayed by model Jesus Luz. Madonna indulges in sensual poses with him and removes his clothes in an attempt to recognize him, as the line [...] "I guess I don't recognize you with <b>your</b> <b>clothes</b> on" [...] is played. The two of them brush their lips together, and Madonna moves away to the dance floor again. Lourdes makes an appearance {{near the end of the}} video. She appears in an eighties styled, polka-dotted leotard and pants, and does a back arch on the ground. Madonna is then shown on the ground on all fours, or dancing while grabbing her groin. Both Madonna's and her dancer's moves are edited to appear in fast forward. Hip hop styled dancing is showcased towards the end of the video. [...] The end shot of the video portrays Madonna sliding down on the ground. Teaser trailers for the video, show Oakenfold dancing to the song, but his scenes are not included in the final version.|$|E
