Ridley Scott also used [...] "Memories of Green" [...] from the Vangelis album See <b>You</b> <b>Later,</b> an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film Someone to Watch Over Me.|$|E

[...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration.

Well, see <b>you</b> <b>later.</b> That was my excuse to finally say I need a break." ...|$|E
