2500|$|On June 19, 1942 O'Hare assumed {{command of}} VF-3, {{relieving}} Lieutenant Commander Thach. He was relocated to Maui, Hawaii, to instruct other pilots in combat tactics. U.S. Navy policy {{was to use}} its best combat pilots to train newer pilots, {{in contrast to the}} Japanese practice of keeping their best pilots flying combat missions. Ensign Edward L. [...] "Whitey" [...] Feightner, who served with O'Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O'Hare passed on to him, was [...] "If you ever jump one of these Zeros and you surprise him, remember, the first thing he's going to do is a loop. Don't follow him into it! By the time you go into it a second time, he'll be behind you. The first thing you should do when he starts up the loop is make a hard right turn and keep turning. You'll come right around, and when he bottoms out of the loop, you'll be right on his tail!" [...] O'Hare also related [...] "First of all, remember, in today's world, whenever you take off and engage the enemy, you're going to be outnumbered. If you want to survive this War, you have to look behind you every chance you get. Even when <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> trigger, be sure to look behind because there's gonna be someone back there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound the fellow! There's {{too much}} at stake to stand on ceremony. I'll hold him, Muller, while <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> trigger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> cat's tail! Then I'll {{pull your}} nose, {{to see how}} you like it." [...] And give his nose a proper hard pinch.|$|E
6000|$|... "You might if {{you threw}} the pistol at <b>the</b> bear when <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger," [...] laughed Jerry. [...] "Sure {{as you are}} born, Blumpo, that pistol will go to pieces {{if you try to}} fire it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my man, please to be {{particular}} in your replies," [...] said Mr Tooth, pushing up his spectacles on his forehead, thrusting {{his hands into}} his trousers pockets, and staring very hard at Jim. [...] "You said that <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> second oar from the bow on the day in which the whale was killed." ...|$|R
2500|$|Matthew Lloyd (Victoria) – [...] "immense pride – {{you feel}} like you walk a bit taller when <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> on <b>the</b> Big V".|$|R
6000|$|... "Done you good. Supplied {{you with}} a serious {{interest}} in life. Well, I expect Evans will give you something--a jewelled snuff-box or something--if <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> thing off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In a jiffy. Look here, Crowle, {{remember}} about steering. <b>You</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> right line {{if you want}} to go to the right and the other {{if you want to}} go to the left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're {{right so}} far'--answered Joe, 'for if <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> bell here, where I'm known, there'll {{be an end}} of my soldiering inclinations in no time. Look in my face. You see me, do you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why didn't <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> down <b>the</b> Spanish colours, at once, Bob? I {{never heard}} of {{anything}} so silly," [...] Carrie said, indignantly.|$|R
5000|$|The ShKAS {{machine gun}} {{had a high}} rate of fire but it also had 48 ways of jamming. Some of them could be fixed immediately, some could not. And 1,800 rounds a minute was an insanely high rate of fire. If <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger too long, the ShKAS would fire all its ammo in one go and that would be it!! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Tommy, {{wrinkling}} his nose, [...] "you {{got that}} {{answer in the}} wrong place. You want to tell your hard-luck story before <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> out <b>the</b> child stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'All right, Mr. Biddle,' {{says the}} mayor. 'And now, Doc Waugh-hoo,' he goes on, 'why don't you demonstrate? Can't <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> cork {{out of your}} {{magnetism}} with your teeth and hocus-pocus them handcuffs off?' ...|$|E
6000|$|After lunch, {{at about}} three, they started on their walk, {{and managed to}} ferry {{themselves}} over the river. [...] "Oh, do let me, Bessy," [...] said Kate Coverdale. [...] "I understand all about it. Look here, Miss Holmes. <b>You</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> chain through your hands--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said she, with a smile, [...] "you {{pull the}} little trigger thing on top, and then {{pointing}} it very low, for it springs {{up as you}} fire, <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> underneath little trigger thing, and it goes off as well as if a man had done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now let me {{hear all}} about it, and be sure I'll not forget. What shall I do to please you, dear, before <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> down <b>the</b> house about my ears?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{should be}} moonlight; full moon two nights ago. Won't <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> up <b>the</b> blind and {{describe}} {{to me all}} you see? [...] . Tell me fully [...] . Remember, I am blind!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't tell," [...] Nasmyth {{answered}} sternly. [...] "Shoulder's smashed; don't know if that's the worst. Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> up <b>the</b> brute or {{send him}} at the hedge to the right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Cannot <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> cork, Señor Runyon? I am so thirsty!” cried Inez quickly, to {{save her}} friend from {{disclosing}} her secret. But big Runyon was bright enough, {{in spite of his}} peculiarities. He read Mildred’s confusion and suspected the truth, but was too considerate to press the question.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Payah kun,' {{said the}} Eldest Magician. 'See now that <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> Sea {{twice a day}} and twice a night for ever, so that the Malazy {{fishermen}} may be saved paddling. But {{be careful not to}} do it too hard, or I shall make a magic on you as I did to Pau Amma.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't {{any reason}} why you fellows can't make them play a real tune. It's up to you, just {{according}} to how <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> wires. Come on. It's worth going in for. Let's try something you all know. And remember, the regular orchestra will always help you out. Now, what do you all know? Something simple, and something the audience'll know, too?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Crochet chain cast-on : For {{this you}} {{need to know how to}} do a simple crochet chain. Once you have chained enough to equal the number of {{stitches}} you need, plus a few extra, turn the chain over so that you see the bumps that were forming as <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> yarn through the hole. Put your knitting needle through those bumps and knit through it as normal. This produces the same edge as knitting on.|$|R
6000|$|The painter {{stared at}} him. [...] "My dear boy, what nonsense!" [...] he cried. [...] "Do {{you mean to}} say you don't like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room looked {{different}} as I came in." ...|$|R
6000|$|Merton {{told the}} tale of Miss McCabe's {{extraordinary}} involvement, and of the wild conditions on which her hand was to be won. 'And as to her heart, I think,' he added, 'if <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> off <b>the</b> prize-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mistake me, Nell. You {{have your}} own way, generally. <b>You</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> wool over mother's eyes, and you wind me round your little finger. But you can't do either with Dick Gale. You're tender-hearted; you {{overlook}} the doings of this hound, Chase. But when Dick comes back, you just {{make up your mind}} to a little hell in the Chase camp. Oh, he'll find it out. And I sure want to be round when Dick hands Mr. Radford the same as he handed Rojas!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now jump in, Mrs. Cristie," [...] said Ida, [...] "and when I {{give the}} word <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> reins {{with all your}} might, and shout 'Back!' at him. Miss Rose, you go to that hind wheel, and I will go to this one. Now put one foot on a spoke, so, and take hold of the wheel, and when I say 'Now!' we will both raise {{ourselves}} up and put our whole weight on the spoke, and Mrs. Cristie will pull on him at the same instant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The old boy," [...] he said, as {{he stood}} with his hand upon the door-knob, [...] "made {{everything}} you see here, everything," [...] and we entered. He drew my attention to the wardrobe. [...] "Now I will hold it up," [...] he said, [...] "while <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> door open; I think the floor must be a bit uneven, it wobbles {{if you are not}} careful." [...] It wobbled notwithstanding, but by coaxing and humouring we succeeded without mishap. I was surprised to notice a very small supply of clothes within, although my friend is a dressy man.|$|E
6000|$|I curled the lip {{about half}} an inch. [...] "Being a female, you wouldn't. You gentler sexes are like that. <b>You</b> <b>pull</b> off <b>the</b> rawest stuff without a pang. You pride yourselves on it. Look at Jael, the wife of Heber." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow, at the Northwest Bank. But {{there are}} two other things I want for that ten thousand. In the first place, when you receive your money <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> down <b>the</b> river to Forty Mile and stay there the rest of the winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} back within an hour, my two-faced friend, and my coming {{will be the}} signal for your setting out to visit in Cambridge those over whose eyes <b>you</b> have <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> wool this many a day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said his}} father, [...] "a bird, when flying, has {{to climb up}} {{in much the same}} way. He has to pull himself up by the air, with his wings, just as you do with your hands and arms, by the rounds of the ladder; only the air is not fixed, like the ladder, but {{constantly}} gives way under his wing; and so, to make the case the same, you must suppose that the ladder is not firm, but is floating in the air, and sinks down with your weight, so that you have to climb up faster than <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> ladder down. Do you think you would have strength enough in your arms to do that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Our Government {{is rather}} peculiar. It gushes on the {{agricultural}} and general information side, and will supply a moderately respectable man {{with all sorts}} of [...] "economic statistics," [...] if he speaks to it prettily. For instance, you are interested in gold-washing in the sands of the Sutlej. <b>You</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> string, and find that it wakes up half a dozen Departments, and finally communicates, say, with a friend of yours in the Telegraph, who once wrote some notes on the customs of the gold-washers when he was on construction-work in their part of the Empire. He {{may or may not be}} pleased at being ordered to write out everything he knows for your benefit. This depends on his temperament. The bigger man you are, the more information and the greater trouble can you raise.|$|E
6000|$|At that moment, in {{the state}} of my nerves, I {{absolutely}} believed she lied; and if I once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which I might take this up. One of these, for a moment, tempted me with such singular intensity that, to withstand it, I must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that, wonderfully, she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. Why not break out at her on the spot and have it all over?--give it to her straight in her lovely little lighted face? [...] "You see, you see, you KNOW that you do and that you already quite suspect I believe it; therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our fate, where we are and what it means?" [...] This solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I could immediately have succumbed to it I might have spared myself--well, you'll see what. Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my feet, looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle way. [...] "Why did <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s {{where the}} nests are," [...] said Mr. Tasker, [...] "but I wasn’t looking {{in at the}} window. Besides, I noticed <b>you</b> always <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> blind down when you saw me looking, so I thought it didn’t matter." ...|$|R
40|$|Do you {{remember}} {{the days when the}} sewing lady came to your house and sewed and sewed and then <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> bastings? And there were yards and yards and spools and spools of bastings, and mother made you save them all so carefully? Do {{you remember}} the hours spent on fine hand finishings and tiny seams, that never showed at all when your friends admired your new dress? But that was several years ago. The idea today is not only to save time, energy and basting thread, but to do everything in the easiest way possible...|$|R
50|$|Conversely, TouchIT took 33 {{seconds to}} boot into {{game and the}} power cord could just be pulled to power down the system. TouchIT survived over 40,000 hours of testing without a single OS failure while UWink died if <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> out <b>the</b> power whilst running too often.|$|R
