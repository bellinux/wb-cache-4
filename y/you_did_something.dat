The way that they disciplined people was also straight forward. If <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> wrong your punishment would be public shame and ridicule. When the band depends so much on each other, this kind of punishment {{would have been one}} that was hard to deal with.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{difficult}} and unforgiving gameplay frustrated critics. Game Revolution explained that, while in previous Tomb Raider games [...] "instant death came {{about if you}} were trying to rush through an area and <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> stupid", every step in Tomb Raider III [...] "is a potential threat of instant death, no matter how careful you're trying to be." [...] The publication {{went so far as to}} call Tomb Raider III [...] "a marketing concept", stating that the game is so difficult that it is impossible to beat without buying a strategy guide. Similarly, Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the game for being rushed and highly frustrating, noting that it has [...] "too many instances of cheap deaths." [...] The magazine also remarked that the stealth elements in the Nevada levels were ineffective, especially when compared to Konami's 1998 hit Metal Gear Solid.|$|E
500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{important}} to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living. It recommends contacting a medical professional if [...] "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life." [...] Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: [...] "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> wrong or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have lost your sense of purpose in life, wish you had died along with your loved one." ...|$|E

She can run about barefoot through the streets and beg for coppers, for aught I care, but I want her to live for reasons of my own. I will pay you five {{shilling}}s a week for her regular, and if you spend, as I suppose you will, one shilling on her food and four shillings on drink for yourself, it ain't no business of mine. I could have put her for the same money in some country cottage where she would have been well looked after, but I want her to grow up in the slums, just a ragged girl like the rest of them, and if you won't take her there is plenty as will on those terms."
