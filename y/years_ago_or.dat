5|$|The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, {{the only}} {{members of the}} genus Rhinoceros, first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago.

Different studies have hypothesized {{that they may be}} closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino.

25|$|After Rodinia broke apart, its {{southern}} half traveled south {{and crossed the}} South Pole while its northern half traveled northward to the North Pole. The two halves of Rodinia eventually collided with the Congo craton to form the supercontinent Pannotia 600million years ago. In contrast to Rodinia, Pannotia was short-lived. It rifted apart 545million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>or</b> only 65million years after it formed. This resulted {{in the creation of}} at least four continents, namely Baltica, Siberia, Gondwana and Laurentia. By the Early Cambrian 514million years ago, Laurenta was located on the equator, Baltica was south of Laurenta, Siberia was just south of the equator east of Laurenta, and Gondwana lied mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. Subsequently, Baltica, Laurenta and microcontinent Avalonia collided in the Devonian period (416-359million years ago) to form minor supercontinent Euramerica. This eventually started to collide with Gondwana and other landmasses to form supercontinent Pangaea 255million years ago. In the Late Triassic period some 152million years ago, Pangaea split into two minor supercontinents, namely Gondwana and Laurasia. The TGB represented a minor portion of western Laurasia until it divided into Eurasia and North America about 94million years ago. Since the Middle Miocene 14million years ago, the TGB {{has been part of the}} Americas, a minor north-south trending supercontinent comprising the continents of North America and South America.|$|E

25|$|Periods of {{volcanic}} activity occurred throughout central Canada during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The source for this volcanism was a long-lived and stationary area of molten rock called the New England or Great Meteor hotspot. The first event erupted kimberlite magma in the James Bay lowlands region of northern Ontario 180million years ago, creating the Attawapiskat kimberlite field. Another kimberlite event spanned {{a period of}} 13million years 165to 152million years ago, creating the Kirkland Lake kimberlite field in northeastern Ontario. Another period of kimberlite volcanism occurred in northeastern Ontario 154to 134million years ago, creating the Lake Timiskaming kimberlite field. As the North American Plate moved westward over the New England hotspot, the New England hotspot created the magma intrusions of the Monteregian Hills in Montreal in southern Quebec. These intrusive stocks have been variously interpreted as the feeder intrusions of long extinct volcanoes {{that would have been}} active 125million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>or</b> as intrusions that never breached the surface in volcanic activity. The lack of a noticeable hotspot track west of the Monteregian Hills might be due either to failure of the New England mantle plume to pass through massive strong rock of the Canadian Shield, the lack of noticeable intrusions, or to strengthening of the New England mantle plume when it approached the Monteregian Hills region.|$|E
