There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb.

60|$|UNDERSHAFT. Well you see, my dear boy, {{when you}} are {{organizing}} civilization {{you have to make}} up your mind whether trouble and anxiety are good things or not. If <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> they are, then, I take it, you simply don't organize civilization; and there you are, with trouble and anxiety enough to make us all angels! But if you decide the other way, you may as well go through with it. However, Stephen, our characters are safe here. A sufficient dose of anxiety is always provided by the fact that we may be blown to smithereens at any moment.|$|E

That {{subject has}} been handled by {{them in an}} {{original}} manner, and they have constructed galleries at Munich, at Dresden, and I believe at St. Petersburg upon a new principle, and a very judicious principle. You have not had opportunities of considering that?--No, I have never considered that; because I always supposed {{that there was no}} difficulty in producing a beautiful gallery, or an efficient one. I never thought that there could be any question about the form which such a gallery should take, or that {{it was a matter of}} consideration. The only difficulty with me was this--the persuading, or hoping to persuade, a nation that if it had pictures at all, it should have those pictures on the line of the eye; that it was not well to have a noble picture many feet above the eye, merely for the glory of the room. Then I think that as soon as <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> a picture is to be seen, it is easy to find out the way of showing it; to say that it should have such and such a room, with such and such a light; not a raking light, as I heard Sir Charles Eastlake express it the other day, but rather an oblique and soft light, and not so near the picture as to catch the eye painfully. That may be easily obtained, and I think that all other questions after that are subordinate.|$|E
60|$|And {{it really}} all {{comes from the}} habit of {{preventing}} children from being troublesome. You are so careful of your boy's morals, knowing how troublesome they may be, that you keep {{him away from the}} Venus of Milo only to find him in the arms of the scullery maid or someone much worse. <b>You</b> <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> the Hermes of Praxiteles and Wagner's Tristan are not suited for young girls; and your daughter marries somebody appallingly unlike either Hermes or Tristan solely to escape from your parental protection. You have not stifled a single passion nor averted a single danger: you have depraved the passions by starving them, and broken down all the defences which so effectively protect children brought up in freedom. You have men who imagine themselves to be ministers of religion openly declaring that when they pass through the streets they have to keep out in the wheeled traffic to avoid the temptations of the pavement. You have them organizing hunts of the women who tempt them--poor creatures whom no artist would touch without a shudder--and wildly clamoring for more clothes to disguise and conceal the body, and for the abolition of pictures, statues, theatres, and pretty colors. And incredible as it seems, these unhappy lunatics are left at large, unrebuked, even admired and revered, whilst artists have to struggle for toleration. To them an undraped human body is the most monstrous, the most blighting, the most obscene, the most unbearable spectacle in the universe. To an artist it is, at its best, the most admirable spectacle in nature, and, at its average, an object of indifference. If every rag of clothing miraculously dropped from the inhabitants of London at noon tomorrow (say as a preliminary to the Great Judgment), the artistic people would not turn a hair; but the artless people would go mad and call on the mountains to hide them. I submit that this indicates a thoroughly healthy state {{on the part of the}} artists, and a thoroughly morbid one on the part of the artless. And the healthy state is attainable in a cold country like ours only by familiarity with the undraped figure acquired through pictures, statues, and theatrical representations in which an illusion of natural clotheslessness is produced and made poetic.|$|E

You listen for a while, until <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> you have caught the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar.

O'Brien went onto write [...] "whether you choose to listen to it as a celebratory worship experience or just a conventional pop/rock album, Homemade Worship by Handmade People works on both levels." [...] Alpha Omega News' Rob Snyder graded the album an A, and said [...] "a excellent release of original praise and worship music that was recorded in Irish church halls and homes in the band’s organic, collective style.

After he died, Gaga told White Shadow that she wrote a song about her grandfather's death and its impact on her.
