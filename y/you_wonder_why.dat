Lawrence said the All of Us project was wholly inspired by the Cronulla riots. “You watch this stuff on TV and <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> people are doing this - this is no way for a multicultural society to behave,” said Lawrence.|$|E
500|$|There's no {{chemistry}} between Astrid and the Doctor, she delivers her {{lines with}} a real lack of conviction and thus we never really believe in Astrid as a character. Where Catherine Tate's Donna in last year's special was overbearing, Kylie Minogue's Astrid is hardly there at all. It does make <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> casting Kylie {{was regarded as a}} coup. She's a pop star– of course she's going to say yes to being beamed into millions of homes in the run-up to Christmas. She's got a duff album to sell. In truth, Kylie should be grateful to [...]|$|E
500|$|Although Turner's {{lyrics are}} found to be [...] "far from wholly discernable", his vocals have [...] "mellowed". Robin Jahdi writes that [...] "Turner's vocals are growing as well, {{sounding}} eerily like Steve Brodsky, from Isis' peers Cave In. These journeys into melody are so successful (vocal harmonies, no less) that <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> Turner still bothers with the pseudo-death metal vocals at all. They add little to the music and must serve to turn off more potential fans than they attract." [...] Nate Chinen, however, sees this variety as a vital component of the album's success, attesting that [...] "Aaron Turner expertly alternates between a death-metal roar and a more human wail, using whichever better suits the needs of a song".|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} game's combat and pacing. G4 called the game's combat [...] "sublime," [...] {{and said that}} [...] "no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such {{interesting}} and intricate tactical combat." [...] GameSpot called it [...] "expertly paced." [...] PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that [...] "the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight." [...] The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that [...] "IWD II has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game is it more apparent than with character development," [...] and PC Gamer said it had [...] "a dazzling implementation of the D 3rd Edition rules." [...] GameSpot called the interface [...] "a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games," [...] and IGN said that [...] "the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> they weren't thought of before." [...] Game Informer called the interface [...] "absolutely inspired" [...] and its inventory system [...] "second to none." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage commented overall {{that the}} episode was [...] "about as deliciously old-fashioned as new Who gets," [...] {{stating that the}} script was [...] "a deftly simple premise that makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> you didn't think of it yourself", and that Tate's {{character}} {{moved away from the}} caricature in [...] "The Runaway Bride". Wright also praised Agyeman for [...] "effortlessly" [...] portraying Martha and her evil cloned counterpart. A fan of the Sontarans, Wright reacted positively to their return and redesign. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy rated the episode four stars out of five. Rawson-Jones felt the narrative was well plotted and paced, and felt Helen Raynor's writing had improved from [...] "Daleks in Manhattan". Rawson-Jones also praised the reintroductions of UNIT, Martha, Donna's family and the Sontarans, the interaction between Donna and Martha, and Christopher Ryan's portrayal of Staal, but felt Skorr's voice was [...] "distinctly lacklustre." [...] The episode's direction by Douglas Mackinnon also received criticism, particularly the scenes in the clone room. In the end, Rawson-Jones felt that the first part's effectiveness lies on how much the viewers wish to tune in to see [...] "The Poison Sky".|$|E
500|$|Zoe Williams {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Daily Telegraph in 2010, after Burbidge became head chef. She found issues {{with some of}} the dishes, such as a mackerel which wasn't properly filleted, and some overcooked samphire. However she thought that the dessert was perfect, stating that [...] "It was enough to make <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> anybody ever makes custard without fennel". Fay Maschler visited the new establishment in April 2010 for the Evening Standard, who disagreed with the idea that it was a reopening and said that it instead should be considered to be a new Ramsay restaurant. She was impressed by the majority of the food, especially the desserts, however felt that the service was a little alien. [...] Marina O'Loughlin for the Metro in June 2010, thought that the food was fine and although the restaurant seems to have been entirely designed with gathering Michelin stars, it seemed that everything on the menu had been done somewhere else but better. Time Outs review of the restaurant rated it at four out of five stars, being impressed with the quality of the food and describing the wine selection as [...] "crammed with class".|$|E

[...] Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Writer and director Brad Bird keeps Ratatouille moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films." [...] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the technical genius, emotional core and storytelling audacity to lift it into the ranks of [...] Pixar films, the crème de la crème of modern animation." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "No sketchy backgrounds here – Ratatouilles scenes feels like deep-focus camera shots. The textures, from the gleam of copper pans to the cobblestone streets, are almost palpable." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille doesn't center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disney's older era, when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters." ...|$|E
