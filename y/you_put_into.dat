500|$|During {{his brief}} {{career in the}} NFL, Leaf {{appeared}} in 25 games and made 21 starts. He completed 317 of 655 (48.4%) passes for 3,666 yards, with 14 touchdowns and 36 interceptions and a career quarterback rating of only 50.0. After hearing of Leaf's retirement, Rodney Harrison, {{one of his most}} outspoken critics on the Chargers, said, [...] "He took the money and ran. Personally, I could never rest good at night knowing my career ended like that. Normally in this game, you get back what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> it, and he pretty much got back what he put into it." ...|$|E
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{created the}} shapeshifter device and later regretted its design. He {{had joined the}} series during its second season, and had to quickly {{manufacture}} props while working under time and budget constraints. He explained, [...] " [...] first episode {{we had to make}} the shape-shifter device, the thing that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> your mouth and it transforms one person into another person. I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have that time over again to redo this one." [...] He added, [...] "A lot of the time, I [...] actually see [...] on set, so I watched the episode to see how everything comes together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Herr {{wrote of}} {{his work on the}} sceenplay: [...] "The {{substance}} was single-minded, the old and always serious problem of how <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> a film or a book the living, behaving presence of what Jung called The Shadow, the most accessible of archetypes, and the easiest to experience... War is the ultimate field of Shadow-activity, where all of its other activities lead you. As they expressed it in Vietnam, 'Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for I [...] the Evil'." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And yet, I daresay," [...] {{suggested}} Robina, [...] "that if one <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> a book--I {{mean that}} if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> a book, it would read amusingly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've got an idea,' he said presently. 'Could <b>you</b> <b>put</b> {{something}} <b>into</b> The Bun to-morrow about {{foot-and-mouth disease}} in that fellow's herd?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Greene {{recognizes the}} [...] "great bases" [...] of line 3 to be a manor house which carry over into his {{understanding}} of the Second Quatrain. According to Greene, this [...] "manor house is faintly sustained by [...] "ruining", [...] "dwellers", [...] "rent", and the possible allusion to compound and simple interest". This economic terminology transforms the actions of the suitors into a sort of currency that is spent too quickly. In line 7, the compound sweet is seen by Greene as an artificial confection or overwrought style of poetry in great use by the other suitors who are themselves poets. It is a reference to Sonnet 76 in [...] "which the poet reproached himself for omitting it from his own verse". The symbolism behind dwellers and rent is meant to show {{that a large number of}} people are offering grand gestures of affection with nothing to show for it in the end. There is no returned investment when you rent a property, because the owner receives and retains all of the expense <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> it. Greene puts a great deal of meaning to the closing line of the Second Quatrain. According to Greene, the word [...] "spent" [...] means bankrupted, exhausted, and failed while also referring to being [...] "drained of semen". He sums this up by adding, [...] "Unsuccessful entrepreneurs, with only the groundworks built of their mansion of love, the failure of their misguided, formalist generosity is symbolized by the suitors' symbolic distance from their prize, observable but not touchable". The suitors are [...] "pittifull thrivors" [...] who have expended so much to win affection only to find themselves wanting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Jake," [...] Peter said, [...] "the more {{strength}} <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> that paddle of yourn {{the sooner}} you'll {{have a piece}} of meat atween your jaws." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{give you}} {{ten minutes to}} write your letter; it can't {{possibly}} take you more, not even if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> it my love to my aunt and cousins." ...|$|E
60|$|Write to me soon again, {{and tell}} me as much of both of you as <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> <b>into</b> a letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue," [...] {{answered}} Alan savagely. [...] "Did {{you think}} so years ago when <b>you</b> were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> that pen to be butchered?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may do just as {{you please}} about making me teacher; but, if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> me <b>into</b> the office, you must expect to have to obey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunt Matilda," [...] said she, [...] "this is not {{the very}} same ten-cent piece <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> the company, but it's just as good; and Harry thinks that you have about doubled your money, and so here's another one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No indeed! There {{was nothing}} to do but to give a hint to old Lord de Lyonnais, and he could get <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> any berth you chose. Interest was {{interest}} in those days! I don't see why Kirkaldy can't do the same.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why in {{the name}} of common sense," [...] I cried, turning {{suddenly}} around in my chair and facing Walkirk, [...] "did <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> Miss Raynor's head all that stuff about typewriting? Did you do it simply because you liked to talk to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a cruel woman! You {{are driving}} {{him away from}} where his {{strength}} is. <b>You</b> <b>put</b> madness <b>into</b> his heart, O! Blind--without pity--without shame! [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I'm {{not sorry}} <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> his head," [...] cried Miss Milray. [...] "Clementina, may I say what I think of Mr. Gregory's performance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> him <b>into</b> a chair?" [...] growled Mat, looking round reproachfully {{from the}} frying-pan, as Valentine {{recovered}} his erect position again with young Thorpe's assistance.|$|R
60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. And, {{to deceive}} {{yourself}} the more completely, {{you take them}} so very very seriously that Ecrasia here declares that the making of dolls is the holiest work of creation, and the words <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> the mouths of dolls the sacredest of scriptures and the noblest of utterances.|$|E
6000|$|Cheyne's voice {{seemed a}} trifle strained, {{as though the}} music had troubled him. [...] "I know the march, but the {{composer}} never wrote what you have played to-night," [...] he said. [...] "It was--may mine be defended from it!--the shuffle of beaten men. How could you have felt what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> the music?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{seem much}} {{concerned}} {{at a very}} natural thing, senor doctor. I wonder why? It is very likely that before long we shall all get shot one after another, if not by Sotillo, then by Pedrito, or Fuentes, or Gamacho. And we may even get the estrapade, too, or worse--quien sabe?--with your pretty tale of the silver <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> Sotillo's head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine hasn't {{come to me}} yet," [...] said St. Clare, [...] "though I'll bear {{testimony}} that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> me pretty thoroughly when I was a boy."' ...|$|R
60|$|If {{anything}} {{should happen}} to that boy, Jonathan, there wouldn't be anything in life left for me! Industrial democracy! So <b>you</b> <b>put</b> that <b>into</b> his head! Socialism, I suppose.|$|R
60|$|Pray to Him to give you, {{every time}} you do wrong, that godly sorrow which brings peace and health, that heart-repentance never to be repented of. Pray to Him to {{convince}} you more and more, as you grow older, that all sin comes from not believing in Jesus Christ, not believing that He is near you, with <b>you,</b> in <b>you,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> your hearts all right thoughts and good desires, and willing, if you will, to help <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> those thoughts and desires into good practice.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] said Fulkerson. He esteemed {{a man who}} was {{not going}} to let himself go cheap. [...] "Or if it isn't, we can make it. You and March will pull {{together}} first-rate. I don't care how much ideal <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> the thing; the more the better. I can look after {{the other end of the}} schooner myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a liar," [...] said Mrs. Peters, reinterring the note. [...] "No tea store, nor no A B C store, nor no junk shop {{would have}} you. I rubbed the skin off both me hands washin' jumpers and {{overalls}} {{to make that}} dollar. Do you think it come out of them suds to buy the kind <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> you? Skiddoo! Get your mind off of money." ...|$|E
6000|$|Barrington's {{face grew}} a trifle stern. [...] "There {{are times when}} you tax our patience, Lance," [...] he said. [...] "Still, {{there is nothing to}} be gained by {{questioning}} your assertion. What I fail to see is where your reward for all this will come from, because I am still convinced that the soil will, so to speak, give you back eighty cents for every dollar <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> it. I would, however, like to look at those implements. I have never seen better ones." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By George!" [...] said Marvin. [...] "He {{certainly}} {{seems to want}} you badly enough. He hasn't spared expense. He has put in about everything <b>you</b> could <b>put</b> <b>into</b> a cable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was, indeed, a misfortune, Mr. Powis, and I fear <b>you</b> were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> {{the navy}} through the want {{of those who}} would feel a natural concern in your welfare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean. I am very anxious about this picture, and I shall be much {{disappointed}} if it cannot be done now. It was <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> my head first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy that, {{for some}} few years, {{you will find}} your time very fully occupied," [...] said he. [...] "By the way, what was it <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> the wood-pile besides your old trousers? A dead dog, or rabbits, or what? You won't tell? Dear me, how very unkind of you! Well, well, I daresay {{that a couple of}} rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred ashes. If ever you write an account, Watson, you can make rabbits serve your turn." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh! {{open your}} hearts to Him, my brave men, in your lonely night-watches--on your sick beds; ay, {{in the very}} roar of battle itself, ask Him to make you true and good, patient, calm, prudent, honourable, obedient, gentle, even in the hottest of the fight. Commit to Him your own lives and {{fortunes}}, and the lives and fortunes {{of those who have}} been left at home, and be sure that He, your Unseen Friend of friends, is able and willing to help to the uttermost all that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> His charge.|$|E
6000|$|... "But now, I must be off. Don't {{you worry}} about your head. I have seen as bad a clip given by a blackthorn. I have got to go round now and see the wounded, and watch some {{operations}} being done, but I will come in again this evening. Don't eat any more of their messes, if they bring them in. You and I will have a snug little dinner together. I might get <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> a more dacent chamber, but the general {{is one of the}} old pig-headed sort. We don't pull together, so I would rather not ask any favours from him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it depends}} upon what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it <b>into.</b> I daresay Mr. Petersfield could put it out for you on mortgage, on good security, at {{four and a half}} or five per cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And it was {{our good}} strange Piero who painted it?" [...] said Romola. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> his head to paint me as Antigone, {{that he might have}} my {{likeness}} for this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my lord, of course; {{that was}} the reason. So <b>you</b> <b>put</b> Arthur <b>into</b> the living, and you {{allocated}} the income to me. That is all settled. But {{now the question is}} about the house." ...|$|R
