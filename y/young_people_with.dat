The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one of the trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the employment experience of <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> Parkinson’s Disease (PD). The aims {{of this study were}} formulated from reflections on clinical practice and observation of the often detrimental impact caused by relinquishing employment. A steering group consisting mainly of <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> PD was established to guide the project. A sequential transformative research design was chosen and three methods of data collection were utilised in a flexible, multi-method approach: a questionnaire, which was distributed nationally and in electronic format via the Parkinson’s Disease Society website; a series of three focus groups; and an electronic proforma which recorded the employment stories of respondents via a newly created website. The meaning that employment had for <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> PD, benefits of working, the decision making process regarding leaving work, difficulties encountered and successful strategies used by <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> PD to maintain their employment were explored. This study unveiled a narrative surrounding the experience of employment of <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> PD. The results indicated that this group required targeted assistance to enable them to maintain employment. The results were therefore transformed into a seven staged intervention to facilitate the maintenance of employment and to alter the current narrative. The staged intervention was developed to address the key issues highlighted by the study. Respondents identified a lack of available information and had a poor awareness of employment rights. There was a consensus regarding difficult symptoms to cope with in employment with fatigue having the biggest impact and other symptoms being: cognitive changes, stress, anxiety, reduced dexterity and mobility. Lack of flexibility by employers was noted to contribute to difficulty in work, and dealing with customers or speaking in public were the most problematic work roles. Respondents identified the benefits of work as: mental stimulation, a sense of identity, self esteem and financial benefits, and felt that giving up work would contribute to a social withdrawal. Respondents found that interaction with non-specialist professionals, in relation to the maintenance of work, was ineffective. The study recommends that this intervention should be delivered by a specialist occupational therapist with access to the skills of a multi-disciplinary team. The intervention was tested in practice and an evaluation model was presented to enable further development...|$|R
