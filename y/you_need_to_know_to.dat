500|$|Carl Marbach of AVweb wrote {{positively}} of {{the first}} portion of the book, but was critical of the latter half: [...] "On the whole, the book has some worthwhile sections notwithstanding the soap opera ramblings at the end. Read the first half, then pass it along to another pilot-friend." [...] John Clark of The Plain Dealer gave the book a positive review, but was also critical of the instructive section {{at the end of}} the book: [...] "Narratively, the book breaks down when Schiavo resorts to lists and tables to provide information to help the reader fly more safely." [...] Robert W. Poole Jr. reviewed the book for Reason, and called it [...] "valuable and frustrating". Poole noted [...] "Only an outsider-insider like Schiavo could provide ordinary people with authentic accounts of how badly off-track the FAA has gotten in its job of looking after aviation safety," [...] but commented that some aviation veterans regarded her as a [...] "loose cannon". Jerry Fraser of The Boston Globe was critical in his review of the book, and wrote that [...] "a book that sets out to be 'everything <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> travel safer by air' winds up griping about how the FAA reimburses employees for moving expenses and conducts crude management-training seminars". The book received a critical review from Bill Adair in the St. Petersburg Times, who wrote: [...] "Schiavo is right about many problems at the FAA. ... But Schiavo seems unable to offer a calm and constructive account of the FAA's problems. She'd rather grab headlines with wild and often inaccurate comments." ...|$|E
