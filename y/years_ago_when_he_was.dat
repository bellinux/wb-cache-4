2500|$|On 23 April 2008, President Uribe {{revealed}} that a former paramilitary fighter had accused him of helping to plan the 1997 massacre of El Aro, a charge which he said was under official investigation. Uribe described the accuser as a [...] "disgruntled convict with an axe to grind", denied the charges and said there was proof of his innocence. The Colombian newsweekly Revista Semana reported that the paramilitary in question, Francisco Enrique Villalba Hernández, had not mentioned Uribe during previous declarations made more than five <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sentenced for his own role in the massacre. The magazine also listed {{a number of possible}} inconsistencies in his most recent testimony, including the alleged presence of General Manosalva, who had died months before the date of the meeting where the massacre was planned.|$|E

6000|$|Pluffles' {{weakness}} was {{not believing}} what people said. He preferred {{what he called}} [...] "trusting to his own judgment."

60|$|The Earl, who {{had studied}} {{popularity}} as a useful engine, but had never prized love beyond his own family, was exceedingly touched by the ardour of enthusiastic affection that his son had obtained,--not by courting suffrages, not by gifts, not by promises, but simply by real open-hearted love to every one.
