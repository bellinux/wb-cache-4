25|$|Rations {{were reduced}} for civilians, until {{by the end}} of 1944 they were at a slow {{starvation}} level. The level of rations depended on whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> German, civilian or heavy manual worker. Prostitutes were graded heavy manual workers.|$|E
25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave.

You were really letting down the team.|$|E

25|$|Using the Land Books (jarðarbøkur) it is speculated, {{that the}} number of {{inhabitants}} in Sørvág in the 17th century was around fifty. In the first census in the Faroes in 1801 the number of inhabitants in Sørvág had risen to a mere 86. In 1855 the number of inhabitants was 163. The reason for this slow progress is due to the special requirements for marriage, that were law in the Faroes. The law said, that in order to marry you would need to own land or have demonstrated that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> faithful servant to someone who owned land. It was only the wealthy farmers who had a substantial amount of land, and therefore the birthrate in the Faroes was very low until this law was abolished.|$|E
25|$|Women’s {{participation}} on {{the home}} front was essential to the war effort. Leading into the Second World War, the ‘breadwinner model’ indicated that married women belonged in the home, with men working. Men were supposed to work and play in the public domain with the private realm supposedly being the domain of women. The outbreak of World War II forced society to rethink women’s role outside of the home. The largest contribution by the majority of Canadian women was through unpaid volunteer work, through their domestic abilities and skills; women were able to support the nation and the war effort. The government called upon women to participate in volunteer programs. Women began collecting recycled items such as paper, metal, fat, bones, rags, rubber, and glass. Clothing was also collected by Canadian women for free distribution overseas. They also prepared care packages to send to the men and women overseas. Canadian women were responsible for maintaining the morale of the nation. All over Canada, women responded to demands made upon them by not only selling war savings stamps and certificates but purchasing them as well, and collecting money to by bombers and mobile canteens. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> young unattached woman in 1939, the war offered unprecedented opportunities {{on the home}} front. Young women were given a chance to move away from home, go to parties and dances in the name of patriotic duty.|$|E

500|$|During the 19th and 20th century, the {{industrial}} and working class makeup of Old Kent Road {{made it a}} haven for organised crime and violence.

500|$|Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore: Goldfinger's {{personal}} {{pilot and}} leader of an all-female team of pilots known as Pussy Galore's Flying Circus. Blackman was selected {{for the role of}} Pussy Galore because of her role in The Avengers and the script was rewritten to show Blackman's judo abilities. The character's name follows in the tradition of other Bond girls names that are double entendres. Concerned about censors, the producers thought about changing the character's name to [...] "Kitty Galore", but they and Hamilton decided [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> ten-year old boy and knew what the name meant, you weren't a ten-year old boy, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> dirty little bitch. The American censor was concerned, but we got round that by inviting him and his wife out to dinner and [...] we were big supporters of the Republican Party." [...] During promotion, Blackman took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character's name. Whilst the American censors did not interfere with the name in the film, they refused to allow the name [...] "Pussy Galore" [...] to appear on promotional materials and for the US market she was subsequently called [...] "Miss Galore" [...] or [...] "Goldfinger's personal pilot".|$|E
500|$|Jon Blisten of Beats Per Minute wrote a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} album in 2011, regarding Enema of the State a seminal album of Generation Y and [...] "one of those rare records {{that allows you to}} relive , a record where every song conjures up a specific memory or emotion that you could have only felt when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> teenager." [...] Billboard described the album as a [...] "classic" [...] in {{a retrospective}} review, calling it the [...] "catchiest batch of songs the band had ever written," [...] and commending the leap in quality both in production and vocals in comparison to its predecessor.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Chris Columbo, who {{conducted}} the club's orchestra for 34 years, [...] remembered that the early morning shows were the most vibrant because [...] the other clubs in town were closed {{and many of those}} who were appearing at them were now at Club Harlem jamming with the club's musicians. Johnny Lynch {{was in charge of the}} house band of 14 musicians, which was integrated. [...] The band was well-regarded among musicians. [...] It was said that if you were in the Club Harlem band for the summer, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> fine musician. [...] Young men who wanted to become professionals often quit their regular jobs in summer to play with the Lynch band.|$|E

500|$|Rhodes coached at Harrow School until 1936. Cricket {{was very}} {{important}} to the school, and they were following the lead of Eton College who had appointed George Hirst as their coach. However, Rhodes's personality and generally critical nature did not communicate well with privileged schoolboys who were accustomed to getting their own way, and he was eventually replaced with the more genial and sympathetic Middlesex professional Patsy Hendren. This was in contrast to the success Hirst enjoyed at Eton. According to Bowes, Rhodes had vast technical knowledge, but unlike Hirst {{did not know how to}} get the best out of people. [...] " [...] could not relate to beginners. But if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> Test match player looking to get advice, Wilfred was superb." ...|$|E
500|$|In her memoir, Stanton {{credits the}} Cadys' neighbor, Rev. Simon Hosack, with {{strongly}} encouraging her intellectual development and academic abilities {{at a time}} when she felt these were undervalued by her father. Writing of her brother Eleazar's death in 1826, Stanton remembers trying to comfort her father, saying that she would try to be all her brother had been. At the time, her father's response devastated Stanton: [...] "Oh, my daughter, I wish <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> boy!" [...] Understanding from this that her father valued boys above girls, Stanton tearfully took her disappointment to Hosack, whose firm belief in her abilities counteracted her father's perceived disparagement. Hosack went on to teach Stanton Greek, encouraged her to read widely, and ultimately bequeathed to her his own Greek lexicon along with other books. His confirmation of her intellectual abilities strengthened Stanton's confidence and self-esteem.|$|E

500|$|In {{the months}} pre-dating Batmans release in June 1989, a popular culture {{phenomenon}} rose known as [...] "Batmania". Over $750 {{million worth of}} merchandise was sold. Cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith remembered: [...] "That summer was huge. You couldn't turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman and if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> comic book fan it was pretty hot." [...] Hachette Book Group USA published a novelization, Batman written by Craig Shaw Gardner. It remained on the New York Times Best Seller list throughout June 1989. Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of The New York Observer categorized Batman as a high concept film. He believed [...] "it is less movie than a corporate behemoth".|$|E
500|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{for the failure of}} Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls [...] "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> little boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?" [...] His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.|$|E
500|$|Welsh singer Paul Child {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} Desmond Child in Nashville in April 2013 to discuss his work with Bonnie Tyler, both with [...] "Believe in Me" [...] and in the beginnings when he wrote her hit single [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>a</b> Woman" [...] in the 1980s. Paul Child drew similarities between the lyrical and rhythmic structure of [...] "Believe in Me" [...] and the Labelle song [...] "Lady Marmalade", specifically with the lines [...] "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?" [...] and [...] " [...] and you laugh {{at the thought of}} putting your faith in stuff, like love". Desmond stated that they (Child, Christy and Braide) wanted to write a song that would [...] "uplift the world, and we're so thrilled that Bonnie sang it and that it got chosen to represent the UK." ...|$|E
