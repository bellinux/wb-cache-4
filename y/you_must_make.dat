Therefore, you must go back to your country, and if the soldiers come to fight, you must remember they are not from me, but from that great war chief, and with him <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> peace.|$|E

2500|$|In 1610 the London Company {{instructed}} Gates, {{the newly}} appointed colonial governor, to christianise the natives and absorb {{them into the}} colony. As for Chief Powhatan, Gates was told, “If you finde it not best to make him your prisoner yet <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> him your tributary, {{and all the other}} his weroances [...] about him first to acknowledge no other Lord but King James”.|$|E

2500|$|A natural salesman, Stewart {{realized}} that [...] "you {{will deal with}} ignorant, opinionated and innocent people. You will often {{have an opportunity to}} cheat them. If they could, they would cheat you, or force you to sell at less than cost. You must be wise, but not too wise. You must never actually cheat the customer, even if you can.... <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> her happy and satisfied, so she will come back." [...] Stewart held that the key to establishing a great business was to make friends with the customers and encourage their return, i.e., to focus on customer service.|$|E
2500|$|Lerner {{points out}} that grey and black {{operations}} ultimately have a heavy cost, in that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda and discredits the source. He writes, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few dogmas advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make a man do as you say, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> him believe what you say." [...] Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in World War II was predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the flight}} from Portland to Boston had been delayed, his bags {{did not make it}} onto Flight 11. Atta's bags were later {{recovered}} in Logan International Airport, and they contained airline uniforms, flight manuals, and other items. The luggage included a copy of Atta's will, written in Arabic, as well as a list of instructions, also in Arabic, such as [...] "make an oath to die and renew your intentions", [...] "you should feel complete tranquility, because the time between you and your marriage in heaven is very short", and [...] "check your weapon before you leave and long before you leave. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> your knife sharp and you must not discomfort your animal during the slaughter." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack on}} the Jesuits was opened on April 17, 1762, by the Jansenist sympathizer the Abbé Chauvelin, who denounced the Constitution of the Society of Jesus, which was {{publicly}} examined and discussed in a hostile press. The Parlement issued its Extraits des assertions assembled from passages from Jesuit theologians and canonists, {{in which they were}} alleged to teach every sort of immorality and error. On August 6, 1762, the final arrêt was proposed to the Parlement by the Advocate General Joly de Fleury, condemning the Society to extinction, but the king's intervention brought eight months' delay and in the meantime a compromise was suggested by the Court. If the French Jesuits would separate from the Society headed by the Jesuit General directly under the pope's authority and come under a French vicar, with French customs, as with the Gallican Church, the Crown would still protect them. The French Jesuits, rejecting Gallicanism, refused to consent. On April 1, 1763, the colleges were closed, and by a further arrêt of March 9, 1764, the Jesuits were required to renounce their vows under pain of banishment. At the end of November 1764, the king signed an edict dissolving the Society throughout his dominions, for they were still protected by some provincial parlements, as in Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Artois. In the draft of the edict, he canceled numerous clauses that implied that the Society was guilty, and writing to Choiseul he concluded: [...] "If I adopt the advice of others for the peace of my realm, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>make</b> the changes I propose, or I will do nothing. I say no more, lest I should say too much." ...|$|E
