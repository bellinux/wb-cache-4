St. Francis must be in grey, for that is his dress; also the attendant of one of the Magi is in grey; but so warm, that, if you saw it by itself, you would call it brown. The shadow behind the throne, which Giotto knows he can paint, and therefore does, is grey also. The rest of the picture [Footnote: The floor has been repainted; but though its grey is now heavy and cold, it cannot kill the splendour of the rest.] in at least six-sevenths of its area--is either crimson, gold, orange, purple, or white, all as warm as Giotto could paint them; and set off by minute spaces only of intense black,--the Soldan's fillet at the shoulders, his eyes, beard, and the points necessary in the golden pattern behind.

5000|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, was filmed {{on location in}} New York City on September 30, and October 1, 2002.

In an interview with MTV News, Carey said that originally, the plot for the video wasn't going {{to have anything to do}} with her parent's past experiences with racism, but was changed a few days before shooting began. During the interview, she described how to plot came into reality:Originally it wasn't going to have anything to do with that, but people were looking through my photo albums this year.

She described that the shoot was set in the 1960s, and that she played the singer's mother during and after her pregnancy. Sigler described the plot: [...] "With my character, she's basically going against her parent's wishes to be with this gentleman. She's pregnant with a baby, which is Mariah, and they run away together. So it's kind of an epic love story, it's nice." [...] Carey revealed that the video would incorporate a rainstorm scene in New York City. Carey jokingly explained how she originally did not intend to get wet, but felt it added a lot to the video.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Within {{capitalist}} modernity, ‚Äòchildren ‚Äô and ‚Äòculture ‚Äô were ideologi-cally {{positioned as}} ‚Äòsacred ‚Äô {{in opposition to}} the ‚Äòprofane ‚Äô sphere of commerce and industry. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20 th century, this romantic construction of childhood as a time of enchantment was appropriated by the ‚Äòchildren‚Äôs culture industry ‚Äô and re-inscribed as a marketing strategy. Capitalist childhood was reconstituted as a time of consumption. In invoking the myth of the ‚Äòsacred child‚Äô, however, capital also elicits ambivalence about the ‚Äòprofanity ‚Äô of com-mercial intrusion into the domain of childhood. Similarly, the narratives of ‚Äògood ‚Äô versus ‚Äòevil ‚Äô through which children‚Äôs culture is organized can be deployed {{in opposition to the}} conditions under which global capital produces children‚Äôs consumer goods. While the cultural tension surrounding the com-mercialization of childhood has diminished as money itself takes on the aura of the ‚Äòsacred‚Äô, the residual power of romantic mythology creates potential for critical engagement on the terrain of capitalist childhood. KEYWORDS children‚Äôs culture ‚Ä¢ commodification ‚Ä¢ enchantment ‚Ä¢ profane ‚Ä¢ sacred ‚Ä¢ toy production Writing to his wife Giulia from Turin Prison in January 1929, Antonio Gramsci asked how their son Delio was ‚Äògetting on with the Meccano‚Äô. He expressed ambivalence about such toys, speculating as to their immediate effects on children‚Äôs ‚Äòinventiveness ‚Äô and long-term implications for mental and emotional orientation [...] I have never been able to decide whether Meccano is the best modern toy for children or not, seeing that to a certain extent it seems to me to rob boys of their own inventive spirit.

40|$|In {{second person}} fiction, the narrator {{addresses}} another character as ?you. ? The ?you? categorizes the narratee, or the imaginary person {{to whom the}} narration is directed, as a protagonist in the fictional world and a reader in the real world. By opening up the play of textual and extratextual worlds, second person narration dissolves the dichotomy of reality and unreality. Instead, second person fiction engenders a plurality of universes through the ambiguity of its reference: to whom is the ?you? of the text referring? Narratologists, philosophers and literary critics have attempted {{to answer this question}} with one overarching response: ?you? simultaneously refers to you the reader, me the author and/or narrator, he or she the narratee-protagonist, and we the socially constructed identity. By potentially addressing everyone, the ?you? directly implicates no one. Interior monologues in second person prevent the speaker from actively relating to an addressee. In communicating internally with the self, rather than an external narratee(s), the speaker forges an authenticating audience to exist in relation to. While the reader engages in the text as it unfolds, the protagonist evades first person culpability for his or her actions. In other words, the text is yours, not mine. Ultimately, the second-person point of view creates a tension between the passive protagonist in the fictional world, who speaks to no one outside of him or herself, and the active reader in the real world. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable <b>about</b> <b>this</b> narrative modality: are you being addressed...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} HRM {{perceptions}} {{is a growing}} interest in the literature, {{as one of the}} antecedents of HRM outcomes. Regardless, not only the cognitive aspect of perception is interesting in this field (what you think) but also the affective perspective is of interest (how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> it). In <b>this</b> study we propose a scale for assessing satisfaction with the perceptions of the HRM practices. A 24 item Likert-type scale was developed considering literature review, to assess subjects‚Äô satisfaction with Human Resources Practices in a healthcare setting. Talked reflections were held and a survey encompassing all workers from a Hospital was conducted later, with a sample of 922 subjects. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis were performed; reliability was tested using Cronbach‚Äôs alpha. The scale presents good psychometric properties with alpha values that range from. 71 to. 91. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis demonstrated that the scale presents a very good fit with CFI= 0. 94, AGFI= 0. 88, and RMSEA= 0. 07. The present study represents a first approach in the usage of this scale and despite having a large sample, respondents originate from a single institution. This study presents a pertinent scale towards measuring a seldom explored construct of the worker-organization relationship. The scale is parsimonious and results are promising. There seems to be very little research on how subjects <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> the HRM practices. This construct, very much in line with more recent studies concerning worker perceptions can be especially interesting {{in the context of the}} worker-organization relationship...|$|R
40|$|Most past {{research}} {{on the effectiveness of}} Student Response Systems (SRS) has focused on higher levels of education and neglected consideration of the learning environment. Therefore, this study is unique in its focus on Grade 7 and Grade 8 students and on the effect of using SRS on students‚Äô perceptions of the learning environment, {{as well as on the}} student outcomes of attitudes and achievement. This study also validated a new questionnaire, the How Do <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>About</b> <b>This</b> Class? (HDYFATC), which incorporates a new learning environment scale (Comfort) developed by the researcher. As schools incorporate technology such as SRS into the classroom, it is important to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of students‚Äô perceptions of the learning environment, attitudes, and achievement. Student perceptions of the learning environment and their attitudes were assessed with the HDYFATC, which combines four learning environment scales (Involvement, Task Orientation, Equity, and Cooperation) from the What Is Happening In this Class? (WIHIC) questionnaire with one created by the researcher (Comfort) to assess how comfortable students are in their science class, and an attitude scale (Enjoyment) from the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA). Students‚Äô achievement was assessed using the average of their examination scores for the duration of the study. The HDYFATC was administered to a sample of 1097 Grade 7 and Grade 8 students from 47 classes in three schools in New York State. Data analyses supported the HDYFATC‚Äôs factorial validity, internal consistency reliability, and ability to differentiate between the perceptions of students in different classrooms. All items had a factor loading of at least 0. 40 on their a priori scale and less than 0. 40 on all other scales. The total variance was 76. 13 %, with the largest contribution from the Enjoyment scale. Eigenvalues ranged from 1. 29 to 25. 62. When the individual was used as the unit of analysis, the internal consistency reliability for different scales of the HDYFATC ranged from 0. 94 to 0. 95. ANOVA revealed significant differences between students‚Äô perceptions in different classes for each learning environment scale, with eta¬≤ values ranging from 0. 50 to 0. 60 for different scales. To determine the effectiveness of SRS in terms of learning environment, attitudes, and achievement, data obtained from the HDYFATC and achievement scores were subjected to a MANOVA. The dependent variables were the five learning environment scales and two student outcome scales, while use or non-use of SRS was the independent variable. Because the multivariate test using Wilks‚Äô lambda criterion yielded a statistically significant result overall for the whole set of seven dependent variables, the univariate ANOVA results were interpreted separately for each individual dependent variable. The F value for between-group differences was statistically significant for every scale. Very large effect sizes ranged from 1. 96 to 2. 46 standard deviations for the learning environment scales and were 2. 19 and 1. 17 standard deviations for attitudes and achievement. For every scale, the SRS group had higher scores than the comparison group. A two-way MANOVA was used to determine if the use of SRS was differentially effective for males and females. The independent variables were the use/non-use of SRS and gender, and the dependent variables were the seven learning environment and student outcome scales. Although both males and females benefited from the use of SRS, Task Orientation was the only scale for which a statistically significant interaction emerged. However, the degree of differential effectiveness found for males and females when using SRS was small and of very little educational importance. Females appeared to benefit slightly more than males from the use of SRS. Simple correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to investigate the relationships between students‚Äô perceptions of the learning environment and the student outcomes of attitudes and achievement. All five learning environment scales correlated positively and significantly with both student attitudes and achievement. The multiple correlation of the five learning environment scales with student attitudes and achievement was, respectively, 0. 79 and 0. 45. Involvement, Task Orientation, and Comfort were statistically significant independent predictors of student attitudes, while Involvement, Equity, and Comfort were statistically significant independent predictors of achievement...|$|E
