500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Kerry, {{after talking}} to several {{co-workers}} and family and friends, I asked the ones {{who said they were}} not voting for you, why. They said that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> wishy-washy. Do you have a reply for them? ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My {{views were}} {{formulated}} as a 24-year-old officer in Normandy... On one occasion the jeep ahead hit a mine... Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: You get used {{to the fact that it}} can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The nastiness is his--not yours. And {{for that}} matter, what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing is not {{particularly}} nice. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> good for it. I don't say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the most useful man in the world, or the cleverest, or the most amiable. But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> good {{to go and get}} your throat cut for a prostitute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you, Mr. Canler, {{would have}} been the most surprised. You had no idea that the venture would succeed. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> good a {{businessman}} for that. And <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> good a businessman to loan money for buried treasure seeking, or to loan money without security--unless you had some special object in view.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh, nonsense, Mark! I {{should have}} thought that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> {{sensible}} a fellow to have such ridiculous fancies in your head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> late,--only for the inexpressible {{goodness}} of another. Have you thought what I owe--what you and I owe--to Mr Whittlestaff?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not thought}} that any action of his would affect you. I knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> great for that. But--have you {{considered}} me?" ...|$|E
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> nervous, Caroline. Believe me, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> nervous. Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day. I was {{in hopes}} {{he would have}} married lady Kelso. But I believe he said her family <b>was</b> <b>too</b> large. Or <b>was</b> it her feet? I forget which. I regret it very much. She was made to be an ambassador's wife.|$|R

6000|$|... "Four years ago! It is a {{very odd}} thing. I suppose you had a panic, for <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> old then for playing monkey tricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All that meaning my wickedness,' said Lucilla. 'Tell me again. You {{always did}} like the sprite {{even when it}} was wicked, only <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> good and right-minded.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{have asked}} you that," [...] she said. [...] "One reason I came was because--because I {{wanted to hear}} the worst. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> {{considerate}} to tell me--all." ...|$|E
5000|$|Do {{you believe}} {{yourself}} to be fat when others say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> thin? ...|$|R
60|$|Diom. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> inquisitive: nor <b>am</b> I bound To satisfy an enemy's request.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{you make}} a great mistake, sir,' {{returned}} Mrs Todgers, in the same strain. 'As many of the gentlemen and I have often said, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> sensitive. That's where it <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> of <b>too</b> susceptible a nature; it's in your spirit.' ...|$|R
60|$|The way Nature and Heaven {{waste the}} gifts and souls they give and make, passes all wonder. You {{might have done}} {{anything}} you chose, only <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> modest.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never been out? I thought too {{at sight}} {{of you that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> girlish-looking to have done much. But why did you {{advertise}} with such assurance? It misleads people.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> {{quick to}} see! No true lover {{would have seen}} any such thing; you are too severe upon me, Clym--I don't like your {{speaking}} so at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, and I do not," [...] said he mischievously. [...] "That is, I have my {{times and}} my seasons. One moment <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> tall, another moment <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> do-nothing, another too melancholy, another too dark, another I don't know what, except--that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{not the whole}} world to me that <b>you</b> used to <b>be,</b> my dear.

60|$|Gons. Hold, sir, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> cruel; he, {{that kills}} At such advantage, fears to fight again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> vexing, Bertie. Have you no sort {{of feeling}} for the family? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> lazy {{to try to be}} a credit to {{yourself}}, but at least you can exert yourself to prevent Gussie's disgracing us. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> going to America because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> Gussie's cousin, because <b>you</b> have always <b>been</b> his closest friend, because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{the only one of the}} family who has absolutely nothing to occupy his time except golf and night clubs.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{thoroughly}} disliked {{you ever}} since <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> clever {{for me in}} New York," [...] he confessed, [...] "and I have {{been in love with}} you all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we'll forgive you," [...] she laughed. [...] "Of course <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> {{anxious to}} get here to think about clothes. That was quite as it should be. Good-by! Don't be dull." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{were for}} a moment dumbfounded; Lenora {{was the first to}} find words. [...] "But when did you start, Laura?" [...] she asked. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> ill to move for weeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to}} {{discharge}} me. <b>You</b> think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> good {{to associate with}} the likes of me--you and your wife." ...|$|R

60|$|Jerome. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> hard on them. They {{are busy}} men, they hav'n't {{much time for}} thought, I daresay.|$|R

6000|$|MRS. CLANDON. My dears: I did not {{say that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> young to know. I said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> young to be taken into my confidence.

There are some experiences of mine that I cannot bear to speak of except to those who have gone through what I have gone through. I hope you will never be qualified for such confidences. But I will take care that you shall learn all you want to know. Will that satisfy you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Wilkinson, with {{a gesture}} of protest. [...] "I {{certainly}} thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> smart, {{although it was not}} my business. Anyhow, if you let him have a quiet game with his friends at home--" ...|$|E
