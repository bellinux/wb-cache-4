50|$|The <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> (Euplectes afer) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the family Ploceidae native to Africa south of the Sahara. It is highly sexually dimorphic in its breeding season, during which the male adopts a distinctive yellow and black plumage, contrasting with the female's predominantly brown coloration. Three subspecies are recognised.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that individual behavioural traits influence the potential to suc-cessfully colonize new areas. Identifying the genetic basis of behavioural variation in invasive species thus represents an important step towards understanding the evolu-tionary potential of the invader. Here, we sequenced a candidate region for neophilic/ neophobic and activity behaviour – the complete exon 3 of the DRD 4 gene – in 100 <b>Yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishops</b> (Euplectes afer) from two invasive populations in Spain and Portugal. The same birds were scored twice for activity behaviour while exposed to novel objects (battery or slice of apple) in captivity. Response to novel objects was repeatable (r = 0. 41) within individuals. We identified two synonymous DRD 4 SNPs that explained on average between 11 % and 15 % of the phenotypic variance in both populations, indicating a clear genetic component to the neophilic/neophobic/activity personality axis in this species. This consistently high estimated effect size was mainly due to the repeated measurement design, which excludes part of the within-individual nongenetic variance in the response to different novel objects. We suggest that th...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> eats insects, grain, and seeds. It {{lives in}} flocks with {{both males and}} females. In non-breeding seasons the flocks may contain weavers and sparrows. The call is a [...] "high-pitched, rasping, buzzing swizzling, {{somewhat}} insect-like: zzzzzzz, zzit, zzit, zzzz". Nesting is November-May, peaking from December-March, and males are polygynous, but the males do not breed in colonies. Each male will build two or more oval nests with a top opening, attracting a female to each nest by flaring their yellow feathers and display flights. <b>Yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> are gregarious and nomadic, wandering to breeding areas in response to rainfall. Nests are built among standing stems of grasses or sedges or shrubs. Bent over stems of live grass help hide the nest. The female will lay from two to four white eggs. Egg incubation is done solely by the females and lasts 12-14 days. Newborn chicks leave the nest after 11-13 days and are fully independent after an additional five weeks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> is 95 to(-) 105 mm {{in length}} and 15 g in weight. During the {{breeding}} season it is sexually dimorphic — that is, the observable characteristics of the males become more apparent. During the breeding season, the male has distinctive golden yellow and black plumage. The bill of both sexes is short and conical. The color of the male's bill is black during breeding season; by contrast, during non-breeding season, the male's bill is horn in color, as is the female's. The legs and feet are pinkish brown. The male has a black lower face, throat, breast and belly, a wide black collar {{on the back of}} the neck, and a brilliant yellow crown, forehead, and hindcrown. There is a yellow patch on the shoulder, and the rump and back are yellow. The wings and tail are brown. During non-breeding seasons the male plumage looks like the female plumage. The female <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> has pale brown upperparts, with darker streaking. The eyebrow is paler and the underparts are off-white with fine dark streaks on the breast and flanks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. It and the fire-fronted bishop have occasionally been placed in the separate genus Taha but DNA places it in Euplectes, without close relatives however. In captivity it has interbred with the northern red bishop. Alternate common names include: Golden bishop, Napoleon bishop, Napoleon weaver, black-winged golden bishop, goudgeelvink (in Afrikaans), Napoleonwever (in Dutch), euplecte vorabé (in French), Napoleonweber (in German), and obispo coronigualdo (in Spanish).|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> is {{native to}} the African {{countries}} of: Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It has been introduced in the following countries: Jamaica, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. It prefers habitats such as grasslands, vlies, and pans. It likes wheat and sorghum fields, and weedy vegetation along wetlands.|$|E
40|$|Animals {{attacked}} by predators often enter {{a state of}} tonic immobility (TI) in which individuals appear to simulate death. Despite the fact that TI is often used as a proxy of fear in domesticated animals, quantitative data on individual variation is very scarce for wild vertebrates. As a consequence, we lack ecological interpretations for the variability in TI that may exist in wild populations. Here, we tested whether there are consistent differences among individuals in 2 components of TI within wild populations of 2 avian species, the <b>Yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> (Euplectes afer) and the Tree sparrow (Passer montanus). We next tested whether this variation reflects variation in boldness toward predators (measured as the response to 2 predator models) or is simply related to variation in general activity/restlessness (measured as baseline activity) in the bishop. We analyzed our data by means of Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM), which has several general advantages and, moreover, allowed us to analyze censored (truncated) data. We found good support for relatively high repeatability within individuals of both components of TI. Measures of TI appeared to be uncorrelated with baseline activity. In contrast, our results suggest that individual variation in TI in a wild vertebrate can be interpreted {{in a context of}} boldness toward predators, making TI a meaningful and practical behavioral trait for studies involving personality and antipredation behavior in wild populations. In addition, we show that the Bayesian structural equation modeling approach to analyze censored data had greater statistical power than other approaches. Hence, this rarely implemented technique deserves to be more widely used. Key words: activity, animal personality, antipredation behavior, Bayesian structural equation modeling, boldness, fear, repeatability, tonic immobility. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} species are being transported beyond their natural range {{boundaries}} by humans. These non-native species can have severe negative impacts on native biodiversity. In order to guide management {{of these species}} {{it is important to}} be able predict where non-native species will spread to, and what impact they will have. This thesis aims to improve our understanding in both these areas, using the expansion of non-native birds in the Iberian Peninsula as a study system. The number of non-native passerines in the Iberian Peninsula has increased in the late 20 th century, with the common waxbill Estrilda astrild, <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> Euplectes afer, red avadavat Amandava amandava and black-headed weaver Ploceus melanocephalus all established as breeding species since 1960. Methods to (1) account for dispersal limitation when modelling the distribution of spreading non-native species and (2) evaluate the likely transferability of native trained species distribution models were developed. The consistency of the species-environment relationship during expansion in the non-native range was also examined. The ability of vacant niches to facilitate the spread of non-native species was tested, and a framework for detecting the early impacts of non-native species was developed. Species distribution models of the potential distribution of non-native species are improved by incorporating dispersal. Dispersal is an important constraint on the distribution of non-native species, and interacts with environmental suitability to alter the species-environment relationship between the range-margin and the range core, and over time. Despite accounting for dispersal limitation in their evaluation, the performance of native-trained species distribution models was poor when most environmental conditions that were analogous to the species native range were within the species niche. Non-native birds in the Iberian Peninsula utilised similar resources to native seed-eating birds, but small differences in resource utilisation allowed them to exploit rice fields, where resources were under-exploited by native species. Non-native birds could also interact with native reedbed nesting passerines, and indeed aggression between black-headed weavers and native Acrocephalus warblers has been recorded. However, we did not find evidence for competition between these species at current population densities of black-headed weavers. Further work on non-native species needs to extend the hybrid dispersal-species distribution models developed here, and also to conduct more assessments of the impacts of non-native species in the early stages of their invasion...|$|E
40|$|Although sexual {{selection}} for elaborate signals {{is well documented}} in numerous species, the extreme diversity in signal design and expression in many taxa is largely unexplained. This thesis explores phylogenetic, mechanistic and ontogenetic explanations for divergence in two classic condition-dependent signal traits in the African widowbirds and bishops (Euplectes spp.); elongated black tails (in widowbirds) and patches of bright yellow or red carotenoid coloration (most prominent in bishops). A molecular phylogeny of 33 Euplectes subspecies (representing all 17 species) was derived using parsimony and Bayesian analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences. A consensus tree, or {{a sample of the}} most probable Bayesian trees, was then used in parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian reconstructions of ancestral signal states. Specifically, the discrete presence of a nuptial tail (i. e. prenuptial tail moult), continuous tail length, and discrete as well as continuous reflectance-based measures of carotenoid colour hue were analysed. The proximate basis of interspecific colour variation was investigated using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analyses of feather and plasma pigments in five Euplectes species. Finally, the relative importance of nutritional and metabolic constraints behind differential occurrence of C 4 -keto-carotenoids, and thus red plumage color, in Euplectes, was tested by diet manipulation in a yellow and a red bishop species. Results show monophyly of the genus Euplectes, but not of ‘widowbirds’ or ‘bishops’. Most notably, the red-collared widowbird E. ardens belongs to a clade of short-tailed bishops and not to the ‘true’ widowbirds. Extant Euplectes furthermore derive from ancestors in which breeding males had short (not prenuptially moulted) tails and yellow colour signals. Nuptial tail elongation and red coloration have since evolved at least twice in distinct lineages, possibly as convergent responses to early established and directional {{sexual selection}} for increasingly exaggerated quality advertisements. This provides an interesting contrast to several recent findings of labile ornament evolution in birds and other animals. Three different pigment profiles were identified in Euplectes feathers. Yellow colours primarily depend on dietary yellow carotenoids, while red hues result either from addition of metabolically derived red C 4 -keto-carotenoids, or from high concentrations of dietary and derived yellow pigments. A possible genetic constraint on colour evolution was also identified, as the southern red bishop E. orix, but not the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>bishop</b> E. afer, can manufacture red C 4 -keto-carotenoids (α-doradexanthin and canthaxanthin) from yellow dietary precursors (lutein and β-carotene). Combined with previous work on adaptive signal functions in Euplectes, the phylogenetic and proximate analyses in this thesis provide an unusually complete picture of avian plumage diversification, and a useful framework for further exploration of both genetics and ecology of avian colour signalling...|$|E
