40|$|The cockroach, Periplaneta americana, {{running on}} a <b>Y-ring</b> globe, moves {{downwind}} if an air current is directed toward the head. However, if the air current carries sex pheromone, then upwind movement is elicited. This orientation behavior is apparently a mechanism to facilitate the orientation of males searching for pheromone-secreting females...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamic seal}} {{mechanism}} of hydrodynamic reciprocating sealing is discussed. TRIZ S-Field model and standard solutions is proposed. The reliability and effectivity S-Field models of hydrodynamic reciprocating sealing are constructed according to typical hydrodynamic reciprocating sealing configuration shapes, such as O-ring sealing, <b>Y-ring</b> sealing and polymer sealing. The leakage and failure problems solutions of hydrodynamic reciprocating sealing {{as well as}} their configuration realization are studied based on TRIZ S-Field analysis and standard solutions, which offer powerful theoretic guides for efficiency-reinforcement technology of hydrodynamic reciprocating sealing...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{advantages}} in specific mechanical properties, {{when compared to}} conventional aluminum (Al) alloys, make aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloys attractive candidate materials for use in cryogenic propellant tanks and dry bay structures. However, the cost of Al-Li alloys is typically five times that of 2219 aluminum. If conventional fabrication processes are employed to fabricate launch vehicle structure, the material costs will restrict their utilization. In order to fully exploit the potential cost and performance benefits of Al-Li alloys, {{it is necessary that}} near-net manufacturing methods be developed to off-set or reduce raw material costs. Near-net forging is an advanced manufacturing method that uses elevated temperature metal movement (forging) to fabricate a single piece, near-net shape, structure. This process is termed 'near-net' because only a minimal amount of post-forge machining is required. The near-net forging process was developed to reduce the material scrap rate (buy-to-fly ratio) and fabrication costs associated with conventional manufacturing methods. The goal for the near-net forging process, when mature, is to achieve an overall cost reduction of approximately 50 percent compared with conventional manufacturing options for producing structures fabricated from Al-Li alloys. This NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) sponsored program {{has been a part of}} a unique government / industry partnership, coordinated to develop and demonstrate near-net forging technology. The objective of this program was to demonstrate scale-up of the near-net forging process. This objective was successfully achieved by fabricating four integrally stiffened, 170 - inch diameter by 20 -inch tall, Al-Li alloy 2195, <b>Y-ring</b> adapters. Initially, two 2195 Al-Li ingots were converted and back extruded to produce four cylindrical blockers. Conventional ring rolling of the blockers was performed to produce ring preforms, which were then contour ring rolled to produce 'contour preforms'. All of the contour preforms on this first-of-a-kind effort were imperfect, and the ingot used to fabricate two of the preforms was of an earlier vintage. As lessons were learned throughout the program, the tooling and procedures evolved, and hence the preform quality. Two of the best contour preforms were near- net forged to produce a process pathfinder <b>Y-ring</b> adapter and a 'mechanical properties pathfinder' <b>Y-ring</b> adapter. At this point, Lockheed Martin Astronautics elected to procure additional 2195 aluminum-lithium ingot of the latest vintage, produce two additional preforms, and substitute them for older vintage material non-perfectly filled preforms already produced on this contract. The existing preforms could have been used to fulfill the requirements of the contract...|$|E
40|$|The current {{design of}} the ARES 1 Upper Stage uses a common {{bulkhead}} to separate the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks. The bulkhead consists of aluminum face sheets bonded to a Phenolic honeycomb core. The face sheets, or domes, are friction stir welded to <b>Y-rings</b> that connect the bulkhead to the barrel sections of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks. Load between the <b>Y-rings</b> is carried by an externally attached bolting ring. The development of nondestructive evaluation methods for the ARES I Upper Stage Common Bulkhead are outlined in this presentation. Methods for inspecting the various components of the bulkhead are covered focusing in on the dome skins, core-to-dome bond lines and friction stir welds as well as structural details like the fastener holes. Thermography, shearography and ultrasonic methods are discussed for the bond lines. Eddy current methods are discussed for the fastener holes and dome skins. A combination of phased array ultrasound, liquid penetrant and radiography are to being investigated for use on the friction stir welds. Keywords: Composite materials, NDE, Cryogenic structure...|$|R
40|$|A {{large scale}} bonding {{demonstration}} test article was fabricated to prove out manufacturing techniques {{for the current}} design of the NASA Ares I Upper Stage common bulkhead. The common bulkhead serves as the single interface between the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen portions of the Upper Stage propellant tank. The bulkhead consists of spin-formed aluminum domes friction stir welded to <b>Y-rings</b> and bonded to a perforated phenolic honeycomb core. Nondestructive evaluation methods are being developed for assessing core integrity and the core-to-dome bond line of the common bulkhead. Detection of manufacturing defects such as delaminations between the core and face sheets as well as service life defects such as crushed or sheared core resulting from impact loading are all of interest. The focus of this work {{will be on the}} application of thermographic, shearographic, and phased array ultrasonic methods to the bonding demonstration article as well as various smaller test panels featuring design specific defect types and geometric features...|$|R
40|$|The Ares I rocket is {{the first}} launch vehicle {{scheduled}} for manufacture under the National Aeronautic and Space Administration s (NASA s) Constellation program. A series of full-scale Ares I development articles have been constructed on the Robotic Weld Tool at the NASA George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The Robotic Weld Tool is a 100 ton, 7 -axis, robotic manufacturing system capable of machining and friction stir welding large-scale space hardware. This presentation {{will focus on the}} friction stir welding of 5. 5 m diameter cryogenic fuel tank components; specifically, the liquid hydrogen forward dome (LH 2 MDA) and the common bulkhead manufacturing development articles (CBMDA). The LH 2 MDA was the first full-scale, flight-like Ares I hardware produced under the Constellation Program. It is a 5. 5 m diameter elliptical dome assembly consisting of eight gore panels, a <b>y-ring</b> stiffener and a manhole fitting. All components are made from aluminum-lithium alloy 2195. Conventional and self-reacting friction stir welding was used on this article. Manufacturing solutions will be discussed including the implementation of photogrammetry, an advanced metrology technique, as well as fixtureless welding. The LH 2 MDA {{is the first}} known fully friction stir welded dome ever produced. The completion of four Common Bulkhead Manufacturing Development Articles (CBMDA) will also be highlighted. Each CBMDA consists of a 5. 5 m diameter spun-formed dome friction stir welded to a <b>y-ring</b> stiffener. The domes and y-rings are made of aluminum 2014 and 2219 respectively. An overview of CBMDA manufacturing processes and the effect of tooling on weld defect formation will be discussed...|$|E
