[...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a score of half a star out of four, saying: [...] "The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There {{was no reason to}} produce it, except to make money, {{and there is no reason}} to see it, except to spend money. It is a dead zone, a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects.

[...] Janoušek had been employed in order to prevent Cambridge losing for the fourth consecutive time, an occurrence which last took place following the 1912 race. [...] Preparations for the race were hampered by appalling weather conditions: horizontal sleet and snow made practice rows challenging.|$|E

500|$|Except for {{the short}} film I Am That Change whose music was {{composed}} by Sai Karthik, Sukumar chose Devi Sri Prasad to compose the soundtrack and background score for the films he directed. Sukumar worked with cinematographer R. Rathnavelu for Arya, Jagadam, and 1: Nenokkadine. When Raju asked Sukumar about the budget to be allotted to Arya, Sukumar said that he first wants Rathnavelu on board. In an interview to The Hindu in March 2012, Rathnavelu said, [...] "Sukumar's speciality is he can give you five different ways to solve every problem <b>you</b> <b>encounter.</b> He {{can get to the}} crux of the problem and figure out the best possible method to resolve it". Because of their friendship with Sukumar, neither Rathnavelu nor Prasad charged any remuneration for his maiden production venture Kumari 21F. For Arya 2, he collaborated with R. D. Rajasekhar. He worked with Venkat R. Prasad and Vijay C Chakravarthy for 100% Love and Nannaku Prematho respectively.|$|E
500|$|The fall of Rome on 4 June 1944 placed Kesselring in a {{dangerous}} situation as his forces attempted to withdraw from Rome to the Gothic Line. That the Germans were especially vulnerable to Italian partisans {{was not lost on}} the British General Harold Alexander, who appealed in a radio broadcast for Italians to kill Germans [...] "wherever <b>you</b> <b>encounter</b> them". Kesselring responded by authorising the [...] "massive employment of artillery, grenade and mine throwers, armoured cars, flamethrowers and other technical combat equipment" [...] against the partisans. He also issued an order promising indemnity to soldiers who [...] "exceed our normal restraint". Subsequently, massacres were carried out by the Hermann Göring Panzer Division at Stia in April, Civitella in Val di Chiana in June and Bucine in July 1944, by the 26th Panzer Division at Padule di Fucecchio on 23 August 1944, and by the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS at Sant'Anna di Stazzema in August 1944 and Marzabotto in September and October 1944.|$|E

I mean, in real life there aren't many of them. But the ones <b>you</b> <b>encounter</b> are {{at the very top of}} their game. You have to have a kind of ascetic personality to survive." [...] James Pickens, Jr. who portrays Dr. Webber said: [...] "That character itself set a bar in terms of how we look at millennial women: independent yet vulnerable, seriously competitive yet caring."

You meet bad things. These are stories of contact and conflict, of a border that is more cultural than political." [...] According to Haaretz, [...] "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{his initial}} failure as a Test batsman in 1955 Barrington [...] "set out to {{eliminate}} fun from his game {{and replace it}} with something very near impregnability". Ian Chappell wrote with feeling [...] "Every so often <b>you</b> <b>encounter</b> a player whose bat seem about a yard wide. It's not, of course. It just seems that way. England's Ken Barrington was one. Our own Bill Lawry was another. Gee, they were hard to dislodge". This was not always appreciated by the selectors, spectators and the press; and he once met a man on a train who told him [...] "I always switch off the television when you come in". This lack of appreciation may have been affected {{by the fact that he}} scored most of his centuries overseas and that he could play entertaining strokes, but chose not to do so. He was controversially dropped from the England team after 57 Tests for taking over seven hours to make 137 against a weak New Zealand attack in 1965 in which he [...] "almost brought the game to a standstill". But when quick runs were needed in the Fifth Test at Melbourne in 1962–63 he surprised everyone by smashing a hundred off 122 balls and bringing up the century with a six into the stands. Though he rarely expressed open dissent he used to pull faces if he disagreed with an umpire or thought that the light was too bad or the bouncers too frequent. His grimacing and nervous jump when receiving hostile fast bowling led some to believe that he was afraid, but he stood up to Wes Hall, Chester Watson, Charlie Griffith and Peter Pollock even if injured.|$|E
2500|$|Maimonides read [...] “You {{shall not}} see your brother's ass or his ox fallen {{down by the}} way, and hide {{yourself}} from them; you shall surely help him to lift them up again,” together with [...] “If you see the ass of him that hates you lying under its burden, you shall forbear to pass by him; you shall surely release it with him.” Maimonides taught that when a person encounters a colleague on a journey and the colleague’s animal has fallen under its load, [...] commands the person to unload the burden from it, {{whether or not the}} animal was carrying an appropriate burden for it. Maimonides interpreted [...] to command that one should not unload the animal and depart, leaving the wayfarer in panic, but one should lift up the animal together with its owner, and reload the animal’s burden on it. Maimonides taught that the general principle is that if the animal were one’s own and one would unload and reload it, one is obligated to unload and reload it for a colleague. [...] If one is pious and goes beyond the measure of the law, even if one is a great prince, and sees an animal belonging to a colleague fallen under a load of straw, reeds or the like, one should unload and load it with its owner. Maimonides interpreted the intensified form of the verbs in [...] and [...] to indicate that if one unloaded and reloaded the animal, and it fell again, one is obligated to unload and reload it another time, indeed even 100 times. [...] Thus, one must accompany the animal for a distance thereafter, unless the owner of the burden says that it is not necessary. Maimonides read [...] to obligate one when one sees the fallen animal in a way that can be described as an encounter, for [...] says, “When you see your colleague’s donkey,” and [...] says, “When <b>you</b> <b>encounter</b> [...] [...] [...] [...]” Maimonides taught that if one finds an animal belonging to a colleague fallen under its load, it is a commandment to unload and reload it even if its owner is not present, for the words “You shall certainly help” and “You shall certainly lift up” imply that one must fulfill these commandments in all situations. [...] Maimonides said that [...] says “together with him” (that is, the animal’s owner) to teach that if the owner of the animal was there and goes off to the side and relies on the passerby to unload it alone because the passerby is subject to a commandment, then the passerby is not obligated. [...] If the owner of the animal is old or ailing, however, the passerby is obligated to load and unload the animal alone.|$|E
