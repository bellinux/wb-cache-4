It's lucky for you that from what she let fall, I've got the clue I want, for if I hadn't, I'd have visited the failure upon you, I can tell you.' ...|$|E
60|$|GENERAL:--I {{have placed}} {{you at the}} head of the Army of the Potomac. Of course I have done this upon what appear to me to be {{sufficient}} reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which of course I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality. You are ambitious, which within reasonable bounds does good rather than harm; but I think that during General Burnside's command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in which <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer. I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the government needed a dictator. Of course it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the command. Only those generals who gain successes can set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship. The government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit that you have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you as far as I can to put it down. Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such a spirit prevails in it. And now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.|$|E

'I have never, sir,'--she {{interposed}} with {{an altered}} manner and a firmer voice; 'I {{have never heard}} you spoken of in harsh or disrespectful terms. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> wrong to Edward's nature if you believe him capable of any mean or base proceeding.' ...|$|R

5000|$|In July 2005, {{after the}} London bombings that killed 52 people, Bray said: [...] "Let me {{say to the}} terrorists very clearly, {{that you will have}} no comfort in our {{community}}.

6000|$|She {{had listened}} eagerly, as I say; {{and it was}} her nature to {{understand}} quickly. [...] "I wonder if you appreciate what you say. If <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> take <b>a</b> <b>great</b> responsibility." ...|$|R

I speak of our blessed Saint Catherine of Sienna!--may God forgive me that I spoke so lightly, and made <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> sin and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> blasphemy. This was her nunnery, in which there were twelve nuns and an abbess. My aunt was the abbess, till the heretics turned all adrift." ...|$|R

'You'll have him {{too ill to}} be moved; and then what will <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> lad of that age, and with illness enough in the house already!' She sighed, {{and it was not}} said unkindly; but Mrs. King {{answered}} with something about his being so good a lad, and so friendless. And Miss Jane exclaimed, 'O Grandmamma, it does seem so hard to send him to the workhouse!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miss Dartle,' I returned, 'you {{deepen the}} injury. It is {{sufficient}} already. I will only say, at parting, that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> him <b>a</b> <b>great</b> wrong.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My son," [...] said Mr. Franklin, solemnly, [...] "so {{far as it}} was in your power, <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> harm to {{the public}} than to the owner of the stones." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I {{will ask}} no more at present. But if you fear that my long absence has {{rendered}} me indifferent {{in the least}} degree to your happiness, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> me <b>a</b> <b>great</b> injustice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} {{she knows what}} is good for you better than you know {{yourself}}. I suppose she has told you that <b>you</b> might <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal better than trouble yourself with a wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} him. I {{come to you}} as a last resource. But without your telling me {{anything}} definite, Mr. Holmes, <b>you</b> may <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> service if <b>you</b> would enlighten me on one point." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear sir, <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> wonders. The horse {{looks very}} fit and well. It never went better in its life. I owe you a {{thousand}} apologies for having doubted your ability. <b>You</b> have <b>done</b> me <b>a</b> <b>great</b> service by recovering my horse. <b>You</b> would <b>do</b> me <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> still {{if you could}} lay {{your hands on the}} murderer of John Straker." ...|$|R

6000|$|One {{secret of}} Mr. Kendal's power {{was that he}} never interrupted, but let people run {{themselves}} down and contradict themselves; and all he observed was, 'However it may end, <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal for him.
