5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} semi-final Maguire beat Lee 6–4 in an error-strewn match which lasted four hours. After winning {{the first two}} frames Maguire lost the next three, but [...] "kept his cool" [...] to seal the victory. Maguire said the match was a [...] "battle" [...] {{and that he was}} {{surprised}} at how badly his opponents had played in the tournament, while Lee said he [...] "just blew up" [...] and that, [...] "When you’re as poor as that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> such a state of mind that you can’t think straight".|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} of the single-player mode received mixed reactions. Paul Mallinson of PC Zone {{stated that}} [...] "Mysteries Of The Sith starts off brilliantly and gets {{better and better}} and better the further <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it. The progressive nature of the constantly evolving storyline sees to that." [...] In contrast, Michael E. Ryan of GameSpot stated that the game is uneven and the challenging levels are only at the end. This adversely affects the gameplay by creating a steep change in how the game must be played. General aspects of the gameplay were seen as improvements, such as the artificial intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Effects {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar {{said that}} Narita did a [...] "good {{job of keeping}} [...] dark. When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a stage situation of aluminum walls and shiny metal, {{it can be a}} problem. But by keeping the light down, you see a little less and it becomes more textural. Hiro was very keen to avoid that over-bright stage look." [...] The budget meant that many of the Enterprise sets were redresses of those used in [...] Meyer and production designer Herman Zimmerman were only able to make minor adjustments to these sets, as the television series was still in production at the time of filming.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{spent five}} years writing and {{revising}} the screenplay, both during and between shooting other films. Believing the novel's language to be [...] "far more arcane than in [...] later books," [...] Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the [...] "elegance and wit of the original." [...] She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had [...] "a lot of good stuff in it" [...] but needed to be edited, and second drafts would [...] "almost certainly be rubbish... because <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a panic." [...] Thompson credits Doran for [...] "help me, nourish me and mentor me through that process... I learned about screenwriting at her feet." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{references}} to the larger MCU, Ramirez said [...] "those little Easter eggs that come along the way are fun", but {{there were times when}} the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters. Petrie stated that the writers wanted to [...] "keep it in Hell's Kitchen" [...] and focus on issues such as [...] "the air conditioner doesn’t work at Nelson and Murdock. That’s really what we’re interested in." [...] He explained that the real life New York City [...] "has a larger than life presence" [...] with celebrities that live there—"If you see Derek Jeter walking down the street, that’s great, but then you turn the corner and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel.

500|$|During {{the shoot}} {{of the music}} video for [...] "First" [...] (2005), Lohan {{revealed}} {{in an interview with}} MTV that she was preparing her sophomore studio album. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the studio, everything just comes out," [...] she said. [...] "All your creative juices are there. I don't [...] leave. I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E
500|$|Following the complaints, Fox removed {{any mention}} of Catholicism from the scene, {{resulting}} in the line [...] "The church..." [...] Scully was reportedly furious with Fox's actions. In an interview in Los Angeles Times, Scully said, [...] "people can say hurtful things {{to each other about}} their weight, their race, their intelligence, their sexual preference, and that all seems up for grabs, but when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> religion, some people get very nervous." [...] Marisa Guthrie of Boston Herald also criticized the network, describing it as [...] "caving in" [...] to the Catholic League's protests. She wrote, [...] "Hollywood has always been gun shy of controversy, but recent displays of self-censorship on the part of entertainment industry executives make us cringe [...] Granted Catholics, as a group have endured an ample amount of bashing, but The Simpsons is an equal opportunity offender." [...] Howard Rosenberg, a writer for Los Angeles Times, criticized Fox's actions as well. He argued that the network had a biased opinion towards Catholicism and that, had the scene mentioned a different religion, it would have been accepted. He also wrote, [...] "Given its famous flaunting of sleaze and death-defying motorcycle leaps, the big news here is that Fox has standards. Its latest production is Censors Who Kill Jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|Tancharoen {{hinted that}} the series would {{continue}} Age of Ultrons theme of [...] "diving {{into the world}} of A.I. [...] things may not go as planned". On what makes Aida different from the villain Ultron, Whedon explained that [...] "Aida started as something that was supposed to mimic human behavior. Ultron came out almost a fully fleshed-out creature with his own agenda, where she’s been discovering hers along the way." [...] He added that instead of thousands of robots, the LMDs would be presented as android versions of the other characters in the series. Whedon said of themes that are raised in the second pod, [...] "there are issues of reality and identity. Trust is always an issue in a spy organization. It’s much worse when you don’t know if the person next to you is the person next to you ... When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> trust, that’s when things get emotional." [...] The pod ends with the Melinda May LMD seemingly destroying herself and all the other known LMDs besides Aida, concluding her specific arc which explored the nature of humanity and identity. Asked if any of these LMDs survived this act, and could carry over to the third pod of the season, Whedon said [...] "We’ll see, but the idea was to put that chapter behind us." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There's a {{tone and}} feeling to the song, there's a militia, a march {{and a kind}} of rambunctious energy to it that, for me, I {{immediately}} wanted to tap into.

We live in very orderly society in America, but when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Brazil, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the Middle East, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Africa, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Eastern Europe, when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> places like that, there's a different sort of 'we run this town' [...] There's less order and more chaos. So we looked at a lot of those references, new photos and historical photos, to capture that kind of falling-apart feeling." [...] "We wanted you to feel uneasy throughout the piece," [...] he said. [...] "We wanted there to be a constant layer of tension through the piece. Even in the way I shot — where the camera comes by Jay, it doesn't stop on him, it goes to Rihanna — there's kind of this chaos of revealing and covering and concealing. And things happen offscreen that you don't see. I think people are really gonna flip on this".|$|E

2500|$|However, Milchan {{supported}} Hanson's casting {{decisions and}} this gave the director {{the confidence to}} approach Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and Kevin Spacey.
