500|$|Donald Sutherland {{reminded}} Wright of his {{own father}} and was cast as the Bennet patriarch; Wright thought the actor possessed the [...] "strength to handle those six women". Brenda Blethyn was hired to play Mrs Bennet, whom Moggach {{believed to be the}} unsung heroine of the film; Wright explained that it was [...] "a tricky part , as she can be very annoying; you want to stop her chattering and shrieking. But Brenda has the humour and the heart to show the amount of love and care Mrs Bennet has for her daughters." [...] Wright convinced veteran actress Judi Dench to join the cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh by writing her a letter that read [...] "I love it when <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> bitch. Please come and be a bitch for me." [...] Dench had only one week available to shoot her scenes, forcing Wright to make them his first days of filming.|$|E

This was further confirmed a few days later, with some fans being able to view it before its release. A delay in releasing it occurred as the band were trying to negotiate with MTV, as Westfall commented: [...] "I think it's more important to have them [...] on board, instead of just putting it on, like, YouTube." [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] was released as a radio single on March 2, 2010. The video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?"

500|$|Although Hirst was a {{right-handed}} batsman, he bowled {{with his}} left arm at medium-fast pace. He {{was one of the}} first bowlers to make the ball swerve through the air in a controlled fashion. According to A. A. Thomson, Hirst's development of swing bowling was almost as revolutionary as Bernard Bosanquet's invention of the googly. His bowling partnership with Rhodes was particularly effective, and established a formidable reputation. Hirst could not make the ball swing in every match, nor could he maintain it through a long innings. However, when he could achieve swerve, even the best batsmen found it almost impossible to bat against him. His success was dependent on atmospheric conditions; for example, he could not swing the ball much in Australia. He was particularly effective when bowling into the wind. Sammy Woods described facing Hirst when the ball was moving in the air: [...] "How the devil can <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> ball that comes in at you like a hard throw-in from cover-point?" [...] Hirst was not an especially quick bowler, [...] a little faster than medium pace, with a long run-up and a relaxed action. He usually bowled over the wicket, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets and therefore angled the ball across the pitch. After delivery, the ball swung through the air at the last minute and hurried through after pitching, appearing to get faster. A very accurate bowler, he was difficult to score against unless a batsman was prepared to hit him in the air over mid on. The main dangers to the batsmen were the risk of being bowled or hitting the ball with a defensive shot and being caught by specially-placed fielders on the leg side. His ability to make the ball swing made him effective on a variety of pitches. Before Hirst developed his technique, bowlers often rubbed the ball in the dirt to remove the shiny layer of the ball, unaware that this layer helped the ball to swing. Hirst's Wisden obituary records: [...] "Hirst, in fact, has been described as the father of all modern seam and swing bowling." ...|$|E

2500|$|A major hit for Dench {{came with}} Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice, a 2005 {{adaptation}} of the novel by Jane Austen, starring Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland.

[...] Dench had only one week available to shoot her scenes, forcing Wright to make them his first days of filming.

2500|$|A guajeo is {{a typical}} Cuban ostinato melody, most often {{consisting}} of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. Guajeos are a seamless blend of European harmonic and African rhythmic structures. A piano guajeo may be played during the verse section of a song, but {{it is at the}} center of the montuno section. That is why some salsa musicians refer to piano guajeos as montunos. Piano guajeos are one of the most recognizable elements in salsa music. As Sonny Bravo explains: [...] "In salsa, the piano is more of a percussion instrument than a melodic one, especially in ensemble playing. When you're backing a soloist, <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> riff over and over again. This is what we call guajeo. The pianist uses this guajeo to provide the rhythm section with its drive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} one of the first non-Grand Theft Auto open world action-adventure games {{released}} after Grand Theft Auto III in 2001, and, as such, was labeled by many as a Grand Theft Auto clone, as the core game mechanics are identical to Grand Theft Auto III, and its 2002 successor, [...] – the player can travel across the city freely, commandeer vehicles, do whatever they want in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, and progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city as they wish. However, the major difference from Grand Theft Auto games is that in True Crime, the player controls a law enforcement officer.

2500|$|Liberati's {{system of}} {{acquiring}} his style {{is founded on}} the bedrock of virtuosoship: persevering, persistent, faithful work of the severest nature. With a determination and energy truly admirable he devoted all his spare moments to practice. His {{first step was to}} perfect the 'attack of the tone.' Then, with a metronome as his guide in tempo, he practiced scales in all keys—always in a light staccato—until he could play them with absolute precision, in both time and tune. He stated, [...] "You may think <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> scale perfectly but try it with a metronome and you will find out that you don't. I thought I did until I began practicing with a metronome." [...] Although then regarded as an artist, Liberati learned that he could not play a simple scale with evenness, but by diligence he gained the point he sought. He was forced to begin at a slow tempo but gradually increasing it, he rapidly acquired the desired precision at any tempo he found necessary.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{ended with}} a final score of 79–10. North Texas's points came on a field goal {{in the third quarter}} and a 69-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza to Casey Fitzgerald {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter. The Mean Green finished with 15 yards rushing and 232 yards passing. All three of Oklahoma's quarterbacks saw gametime. Joey Halzle followed Bradford in the third quarter and completed four of his five pass attempts. Nichol finished the game, but did not attempt a pass. The Sooners had 668 yards of total offense against North Texas, the 11th-highest in school history to that point, and 403 passing yards, the fifth-highest in school history to that point. Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t really help either. They got on the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock. I’m not criticizing, I’m just saying that the style of play doesn’t help either.” Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer agreed: [...] "They had no game plan for losing… Because when you can't win a game, you need to run the clock, don't let it stop, don't throw passes incomplete… get the game over with, get on the bus and go home." [...] Stoops requested a running clock for the fourth quarter, but the request was not granted. North Texas's coach handled the loss well and held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win.
