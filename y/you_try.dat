5|$|From the few Greeks of Mani and {{the rest}} of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We {{received}} your letter in which <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and wait for you.|$|E
5|$|If, after I am {{home in the}} West, {{you make}} me a normal {{contract}} offer, a business deal such as people sign every day all over the world, and I like your offer, then I will come back and work with you {{in accordance with the}} contract. But if <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to put me to work under coercion of any kind, then I will resist to my dying gasp.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, and when <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{out a new}} idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E

25|$|Because in Catholicism {{you are a}} born sinner and you're {{a sinner}} all your life. No matter how <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to get away from}} it, the sin is within you all the time.

Bowl at the wicket.' Snow did just that next ball and took Redpath's leg stump – around behind his legs. Three for 269.|$|E
25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians <b>you</b> <b>try</b> {{to find a}} name for your band that represents you and you never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The {{most important thing for}} a name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E

25|$|I {{fought the}} communists {{as part of}} the {{battalion}} combat teams, I went up the ladder. Battalion staff officer. Company commander. Task Force commander. Special Forces group commander. Brigade commander. All in different periods in our country. Huk campaign. Korean War campaign. The Vietnam War, and I {{was the head of the}} advance party of the PHILCAG (Philippine Civil Action Group to Vietnam) that went to a tiny province at the Cambodian border – the so-called Alligator Jaw – War Zone Z where even Max Soliven said ‘The Viet-Cong will eat us up.’ Of course, we were physically there as non-combat troops. But <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to be a non-combat troop in a combat area – that is the toughest kind of assignment.|$|E
25|$|Ilê Aiyê's {{success has}} {{continued}} ever since and their numbers have grown into the thousands. Even today, the black only bloco continues to exclude others {{because of their}} skin color. They do this by advertising exclusive parties and benefits for members, as well as physically shunning and pushing you away if <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to include yourself. Though the media has called it ‘racist’, {{to a large degree}} the black-only bloco {{has become one of the}} most interesting aspects of Salvador’s Carnaval and is continuously accepted as a way of life. Combined with the influence of Olodum in Salvador, musical protest and representation as a product of slavery and black consciousness has slowly grown into a more powerful force. Musical representation of problems and issues have long been part of Brazil's history, and Ilê Aiyê and Olodum both produce creative ways to remain relevant and popular.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Elle {{was created}} long before Bell was cast; however, Kring noted [...] "when you do cast an actor ... <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to tailor that character {{a little closer}} to who the actor is. So it's hard to know when one starts to influence the other".|$|E

500|$|The law {{business}} is good. I have been {{fortunate to have}} the best of both worlds. I have enjoyed the political side of it and also enjoyed my private legal practice.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the film's withdrawal, Richard Curtis {{admitted}} that the attempt {{to draw attention to the}} cause of lowering [...] emissions may have backfired. Curtis said [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to be funny on a serious subject, it's obviously risky. I hope people who don't like the little film will still think about the big issue and try to do something about it." ...|$|E

500|$|In The Independent, Dominic Lawson wrote [...] "As {{often as}} 10:10 {{tried to pull}} the film off YouTube, their critics re-posted it. This, at least, proves what a cataclysmic misjudgement Curtis had made. When <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to satirise the critics of your campaign, {{and it turns out}} that those very critics embrace your film as demonstrating exactly what they find {{unbearable}} about the climate-obsessed eco-lobby, then you know that you have kicked the ball into your own net".|$|E

500|$|Ross {{has been}} a streaky player {{throughout}} his career.

I've been notorious for that my whole career, where I'll hit five or six in a week, where it seems like I can't miss the pitch and I feel good in the batter's box." [...] The most famous of these came in 2010, when Ross's torrid hitting in the playoffs helped San Francisco win the 2010 World Series.|$|E
