Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as <b>you</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E

50|$|In Blåkulla, people partied {{as if at}} a wedding; they drank, ate, {{danced and}} had sex {{by the light of}} candles that were placed in vaginas while Satan sat under the table and laughed so that the whole room shook and the fire of hell poured up from a hole in the floor, where you could see the tormented souls in hell. You danced with your backs towards each other, as well as doing {{everything}} else backwards, married several people at the same time, and had sex with them and with Satan himself, and with his devils and demons, whose penises were cold and whose sperm was made of water and gave birth to frogs that were swept up from the floor with a broom and were made into butter. When <b>you</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> afterwards, your body ached, the food you had eaten had vanished and made you hungry and the gifts you had received had turned to wood chip.|$|E
5000|$|After Beethoven's 2nd, Daniel {{signed on}} as {{director}} for military comedy McHale's Navy, based on the television series of the same name; he was eventually replaced by Bryan Spicer. He returned to directing television in the 1990s, including episodes of shows like Caroline in the City, Everybody Loves Raymond, and Suddenly Susan. He also directed several television films, such as Genius and Alley Cats Strike, both for the Disney Channel. In 2002, his final directing credit, the television film Home Alone 4, premiered. After the film aired, Daniel retired from the business, noting to the Tribune that he anticipated {{to do much more}} work but found himself receiving very few offers. [...] "And I know why: If you work in the arts for a living, you are paid to know what's in the air, what the mood is, the whole societal thing. And I don't care how hip you are, when it's over, it's over. I couldn't artistically reflect how the world changed.

I was just that excited-we had barbed wire around-I pulled the barbed wire open. It caught my leg. I still got a scar there. I ran into their arms. And they were calling out, [...] "Yea! The war is over." [...] "What war? We didn't-good!" [...] We're no longer prisoners. They gave us lollies and chewing gum and things like that. They just took us up in their arms and they were just marvellous. The most amazing part is that we were free again.
