500|$|The game {{received}} generally negative reviews at release, garnering {{scores of}} 50% and 49/100 by aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Computer and Video Games said [...] "Eorzea {{is a beautiful}} world with huge potential for vast adventures, but it's just a shame that this first voyage into {{it is such a}} mis-step". 1UP.com said that [...] "playing [...] is like playing with a toy stuck in a plastic bag: it can be fun for a while and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> general idea, but you can't appreciate the full experience", stating that future updates would likely rectify this issue. IGN said that [...] "Much of the promise of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned, unfortunately, under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder the experience at nearly every step", further stating that while patches might improve the experience, its state {{at the time of the}} review made it [...] "not a world worth visiting". GameSpot, in addition to warning players away from the game, said that [...] "Final Fantasy XIV is a notable entry to the genre but only for what it lacks".|$|E
500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, a poll {{of fifty}} songwriters {{conducted}} by the magazine Q listed [...] "Hallelujah" [...] among the all-time [...] "Top 10 Greatest Tracks" [...] with John Legend calling Buckley's version [...] "as near perfect as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get.</b> <b>The</b> lyrics to 'Hallelujah' are just incredible and the melody's gorgeous and then there's Jeff's interpretation of it. It's {{one of the most}} beautiful pieces of recorded music I've ever heard." [...] In July 2009, the Buckley track was ranked number three on the 2009 Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, a listener poll held every decade by the Australian radio station Triple J." [...] In 2017, The International Observer named Buckley's version of [...] "Hallelujah" [...] the greatest song of all time.|$|E
