500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-two years later, Williams {{returned}} to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, where she served as head judge for Miss America 2016 and sang [...] "Oh How the Years Go By." [...] After this performance, Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issued a public apology to Williams, stating:I have been {{a close friend of}} this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years. You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984, when you resigned. Though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.Williams responded by stating that she did the [...] "best that I could, in my reign as Miss America, from 1983 to 1984." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-two {{years after}} she resigned, Vanessa Williams {{returned}} to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, for the Miss America 2016 pageant as head judge (where Miss Georgia 2015, Betty Cantrell, won the crown). The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize {{to you and to}} your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview with}} Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy. To think that oh you can look at a scandal and think that that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of credibility and talent that I had and wiped it out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you really}} {{mean to say}} that <b>you</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> {{interest}} in {{what we are going to}} do?" [...] he asked. [...] "Mr. Bruff, you have no more imagination than a cow!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{fence with}} me, Mountjoy! I'll {{put it in}} a milder way, if you prefer being humbugged. Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> {{interest}} in that perverse girl of mine?" ...|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. [With {{a slight}} cough, resuming.] If <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> {{delicacy}} the payment {{need not be}} made merely to you. I quite respect your feelings in the matter.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} does," [...] she said. [...] "I wonder if <b>you</b> ever <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> faint longing {{for what you}} must have left behind you there. One learns to do without a good deal in Canada." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mr.--Mr. Aikin-Payne," [...] said Ruby Estcourt, {{stumbling}} timidly {{over the}} name, as {{we met in}} the salle-Ã -manger at breakfast next day. [...] "I hope <b>you</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> the worse for the chilly air last evening." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Light-headed at times!" [...] said Ormond; [...] "but he {{was asking}} for you. Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> easier now? Here's another {{inquirer}} anxious to hear good news of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now that you've {{had your}} adventure, do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> better?" [...] I {{remember}} asking {{when we had}} changed our clothes and were sitting dry and comfortable again in the cockpit.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what to say. When I think of it all, I am lost in amazement. You tell me that you are not contented;--that you are ambitious for me. Why is it that <b>you</b> should <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> {{interest}} in the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid it's {{rather more}} than likely I'll {{have to pay a}} good price," [...] said Nasmyth. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> anxious for <b>any</b> more {{shooting}} to-night, Wheeler?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not fair, this," [...] he cried. [...] "You do {{not know}} what you are asking. Can't <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> it, <b>any</b> of <b>you</b> others, as I do?"

6000|$|... "Why, to {{tell the}} truth," [...] said Miss Baker, laughing, [...] "she is doing duty at this moment as head butler in the dining-room. If <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> {{vocation}} that way, you may go and help her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> penitent, at <b>any</b> rate. I expect Miss Flossie Lane {{has asked}} {{you what you}} think of her friend, Miss Orford, and told you that she was engaged to Lord Fanleighton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are in the}} gully. You held on to Deering {{until he}} got support for his foot. Then you slipped off the big stone. Something like that, anyhow. Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> pain at <b>any</b> {{particular}} spot?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} what, gentlemen,' replied Brass, {{in a very}} grave manner, 'he'll not serve his case this way, and really, if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> {{interest}} in him, you had better advise him to go upon some other tack. Did I, sir? Of course I never did.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{be afraid}} of harming the girl, sir," [...] he said to Mr. Franklin, {{speaking}} in a loud voice, so that Rosanna might hear him.

6000|$|... 'Really, Berkeley, you're {{the most}} incomprehensible and mysterious person I {{ever met in}} my whole lifetime!' said Herbert, dryly.

6000|$|... "In case <b>you</b> should <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> curiosity on the subject," [...] Wingrave remarked, [...] "I {{may tell}} you that I have those letters which she was so anxious to know about, and I shall keep them safe--even from you!

6000|$|... "It was at {{your request}} that I {{went into the}} law. I have learned to like that profession.

6000|$|... "Ah, here {{is where}} you fell," [...] he said; [...] "a good deal of swelling, and it has cut the skin. However, a little bathing with warm water {{is all that is}} wanted.

6000|$|... "Let {{me ask you}} a question," [...] James Borden demanded suddenly. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> ever <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> {{grudge against}} him? He took you away from a very respectable {{position}} in life. He ruined all sorts of possibilities. He was fifteen or twenty years older than you were, and he knew the world. You pleased him, and he deliberately entrapped your affections. Be honest, now. Don't you sometimes hate him for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|THE DEVIL. [amiably] Fare you well, Don Juan. I shall {{often think}} of our {{interesting}} chats about things in general.

6000|$|... "I {{should say}} it is quite {{impossible}} that any extensive plot could be hatched without its being known {{in a very short}} time to everyone," [...] Nat agreed; [...] "and in any case, although those who live far in the interior of the island might have reason to fear, should the negroes break out, I can hardly think that, within little more than an hour's drive from the city, <b>you</b> need <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> uneasiness whatever." ...|$|R
