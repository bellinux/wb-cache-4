2500|$|The trial, at Newcastle Crown Court, took 19 {{weeks and}} the jury deliberated for four days. Norris was convicted, by a {{majority}} verdict, on 3 March 2008, {{of the murder of}} four women, and the attempted murder of a fifth aged 90. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and ordered to serve a minimum term of 30 years in prison the following day. Judge Mr Justice Griffith rejected any possibility that Norris was practising euthanasia because none of the victims was terminally ill. He told Norris when sentencing: [...] "You are, I have absolutely no doubt, a thoroughly evil and dangerous man. You are an arrogant and manipulative man with a real dislike of elderly patients. The most telling evidence was that observation of one of <b>your</b> <b>patients,</b> Bridget Tarpey, who said 'he did not like us old women'." ...|$|E
40|$|Why has {{my patient}} come up {{reactive}} to foods {{claimed to have}} not been eaten? 1) Many foods that a patient may claim to have not eaten are foods which are commonly hidden, such as dairy, additives and preservatives, wheat/ gluten, corn, various sugars, potatoes, soy and eggs. Be sure <b>your</b> <b>patient</b> has not unknowingly eaten them as hidden ingredients in other foods. Most exposures occur in restaurants, friends’ homes, and eating prepared and commercial foods. 2) <b>Your</b> <b>patient</b> may have a cross-reac-tive response to that particular item. For example, there may be immune recogni-tion of an antigen specific to that item {{that is similar to}} another already immu-nologically reactive antigen. This could be a gut pathogen, related food (similar plant or animal species) or chemical. As an example, <b>your</b> <b>patient</b> may be reactive to potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, and eggplant and claim they have never eaten eggplant. These foods are all in the nightshade family of plants and have similar antigens. Therefore, <b>your</b> <b>patient</b> may be responding to the eggplant due to cross reactivity. 3) <b>Your</b> <b>patient</b> may be reacting to a contaminant in the food item such as a pesticide. Contaminant reactions are not common but are increasingly becoming a problem...|$|R
