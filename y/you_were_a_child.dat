2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} CDC knowingly used flawed data in drafting the report, leading to [...] "scientifically indefensible" [...] claims in the 2004 paper. It also cited the CDC for failing to publicize later research showing that the harm was more serious than the 2004 report suggested. After the investigation's findings were released, the CDC initially stood by the report's findings that no significant harm {{was caused by the}} lead, but acknowledged that the claim that no children with lead poisoning had been found was [...] "misleading". Edwards called for the CDC to retract the paper and for Brown's resignation.

40|$|This {{review article}} {{examines}} how <b>children</b> verify <b>a</b> statement (e. g., <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Right or wrong?) and answer a corresponding question (e. g., Are you <b>a</b> <b>child?</b> Yes or no?) in English, French, Japanese, and Korean. While people verify affirmative statements and answer affirmative questions similarly across the four languages, they answer negative questions differently across the four languages. In English, answering negative questions {{works in a}} way opposite to verification (e. g., Are you not <b>a</b> <b>child?</b> Yes; <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Wrong). In French, si {{is used in the}} place of the yes response in English. In Japanese and Korean, answering negative questions works in a way similar to verification (e. g., Are you not <b>a</b> <b>child?</b> No; <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Wrong). The effects of these linguistic characteristics are examined. Findings are: (1) All children across the four languages appear to start answering negative questions using the English system; (2) English-speaking children find verifying negative statements more difficult than answering the corresponding questions but Japanese-speaking children find it less difficult; and (3) while English-speaking and Korean-speaking children find true negative statements more difficult to verify than false negative statements, Japanese-speaking children find them less difficult. Language-universal and language-specific processes in verification and answering are discussed...|$|R
