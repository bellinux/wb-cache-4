In this paper, we manage to develop procedures and materials that allow focusing on the purely mechanical contribution of the particles to the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid</b> behavior, independently of the physicochemical properties of the materials. This allows us to relate the macroscopic properties of these suspensions to the mechanical properties of the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid</b> and the particle volume fraction, and to provide results applicable to any noncolloidal particle in any <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid.</b> We find that the elastic modulus/concentration relationship follows a Krieger-Dougherty law, and show that the yield stress/concentration relationship {{is related to the}} elastic modulus/concentration relationship through a very simple law, in agreement with results from a micromechanical analysis...|$|E

We use {{magnetic resonance imaging}} techniques to measure velocities and particle concentrations in flowing Newtonian fluid, <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid,</b> and in a concentrated suspension of noncolloidal particles in a <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid.</b> In the Newtonian fluid, we observe that the θ-averaged strain rate component d_r,θ decreases as the inverse squared radius in the gap, in agreement with a Couette analogy. This allows direct comparison (without end-effect corrections) of the resistances to shear in vane and Couette geometries. Here, the mean shear stress in the vane-in-cup geometry is slightly lower than in a Couette cell of same dimensions, and a little higher than when the vane is embedded in an infinite medium. We also observe that the flow enters deeply the region between the blades, leading to significant extensional flow. In the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid,</b> {{in contrast with the}} usually accepted picture based on simulation results from the literature, we find that the layer of material that is sheared near the blades at low velocity is not cylindrical. There is thus a significant extensional component of shear that should be taken into account in the analysis. Finally and surprisingly, in the suspension, we observe that a thin non-cylindrical slip layer made of the pure interstitial <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid</b> appears quickly at the interface between the sheared material and the material that moves as a rigid body between the blades. This feature {{can be attributed to the}} non-symmetric trajectories of the noncolloidal particles around the edges of the blades.

The main goal {{of this paper is}} to propose an alternative op-timization method to existing procedures such as penalization and augmented Lagrangian techniques. It is shown that the minimum principle for Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid</b> steady flows can, indeed, be formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem, for which very efficient primal-dual interior point solvers are available. In particular, the formulation does not require any regularization of the visco-plastic model as is usually the case for existing techniques, avoiding therefore the difficult choice of the regularization parameter. Besides, it is also unnecessary to adopt a mixed stress-velocity approach or discretize explicitly auxiliary variables as frequently proposed in existing meth-ods. Finally, the performance of dedicated SOCP solvers, like the Mosek software package, enables to solve large-scale problems on a personal computer within seconds only.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the peristaltic transport of an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid in an elastic tube. Here the flow is due to three different peristaltic waves and two different types of elastic tube. The constitution of blood suggests a non-Newtonian fluid model and it demands the applicability of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid</b> model. Among the available <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fluid</b> models for blood, the non-Newtonian Casson fluid is preferred. The Casson fluid model describes the flow characteristics of blood accurately at low shear rates and when it flows through small blood vessels. Long wavelength approximation is used to linearize the governing equations. The effect of peristalsis and non-Newtonian nature of blood on velocity, plug flow velocity, wall shear stress and the flux flow rate are derived. The flux is determined as a function of inlet, outlet, external pressures, yield stress, amplitude ratio, and the elastic properties of the tube. Furthermore, it is observed that, the yield stress, peristaltic wave, and the elastic parameters have strong effects on the flux of the non-Newtonian fluid, namely, blood. One of the important observation is that the flux is more when the tension relation is an exponential curve rather than that of a fifth degree polynomial. Further, in the absence of peristalsis and when the yield stress tends to zero our results agree with the results of Rubinow and Keller (1972).
