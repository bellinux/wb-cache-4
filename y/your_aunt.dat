6000|$|... "Nonsense! She is <b>your</b> <b>aunt's</b> friend. Because <b>your</b> father {{once heard}} some cock-and-bull story about her, {{and because he}} has always taken upon himself to criticise <b>your</b> <b>aunt's</b> friends, I am not to be civil to a person I like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; at <b>your</b> <b>aunt's</b> house. They {{live well}} there, {{even in the}} kitchen. Lotta will have for me some hot soup, a mess of cabbage, and a sausage. I wish I could bring it away from <b>your</b> <b>aunt's</b> house {{to the old man}} and yourself." ...|$|R
