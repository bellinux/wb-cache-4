5|$|There {{are many}} {{estimates}} {{of the total number}} of people killed at Treblinka; most scholarly estimates range from 700,000 to 900,000, meaning that more Jews died at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz. The Treblinka museum in Poland states that at least 800,000 people died at Treblinka; <b>Yad</b> <b>Vashem,</b> which is Israel's Holocaust museum, puts the number killed at 870,000; and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gives a range of 870,000 to 925,000.|$|E

5|$|Wiesenthal {{learned from}} a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that {{information}} to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. Fritz Bauer, prosecutor-general {{of the state of}} Hesse in West Germany, received independent confirmation of Eichmann's whereabouts in 1957, but German agents were unable to find him until late 1959. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance and there were no current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February. Zvi Aharoni, one of the Mossad agents responsible for Eichmann's capture in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960, said the photos were useful in confirming Eichmann's identity. On 23 May Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann was under arrest and in Israel. The next day Wiesenthal, while he was being interviewed by reporters, received a congratulatory telegram from <b>Yad</b> <b>Vashem.</b> He immediately became a minor celebrity, and began work on a book about his experiences. Ich jagte Eichmann: Tatsachenbericht (I Chased Eichmann: A True Story) was published six weeks before the trial opened in spring 1961. Wiesenthal helped the prosecution prepare their case and attended a portion of the trial. Eichmann was sentenced to death and was hanged on 1 June 1962.|$|E

50|$|Anti-Semitism was rampant, {{and many}} of the Jewish {{resident}} fled Polish rule. One such family was Rafalin. David Rafalin, a graduate of the Slobodka Yeshiva, became a rabbi in Cuba in 1929, then in 1933 he moved to Mexico, where he was a rabbi for 46 years. In 1931 most of the Jewish section of Puńsk was destroyed by a fire. In <b>Yad</b> <b>Vashem's</b> Central Database of Shoah (Holocaust) Victims, more than six dozen Jewish inhabitants of Puńsk are listed as being murdered during World War II. Some were killed in the town itself, while others were deported to camps and ghettos in Poland and neighboring Lithuania.|$|R
50|$|On March 1, 1954, Auerbakh {{was named}} {{director}} of <b>Yad</b> <b>Vashem's</b> new Department for the Collection of Witness Testimony, {{which was based}} in Tel Aviv where most Holocaust survivors had settled. In this role, she interviewed local survivors and began compiling a database of survivors who lived elsewhere. She introduced new methodologies for collecting witness testimonies and trained Holocaust archivists and researchers. While she encouraged survivors to write their memoirs, she was critical of the popular novels being written about the Holocaust in the genre of historical fiction. She continued to write articles and books about Jewish cultural life {{before and during the}} Holocaust in her native Polish and Yiddish, finding it difficult to attain fluency in Hebrew.|$|R

5000|$|What is most {{contentious}} about Hilberg's work, the controversial implications of which influenced {{the decision by}} Israeli authorities to deny him access to the <b>Yad</b> <b>Vashem's</b> archives, was his assessment that elements of Jewish society, such as the Judenräte (Jewish Councils), were complicit in the genocide. {{and that this was}} partly rooted in long-standing attitudes of European Jews, rather than attempts at survival or exploitation. In his own words: [...] "I had to examine the Jewish tradition of trusting God, princes, laws and contracts ... Ultimately I had to ponder the Jewish calculation that the persecutor would not destroy what he could economically exploit. It was precisely this Jewish strategy that dictated accommodation and precluded resistance." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding Viatrovych's {{statement}} {{that they had}} been told by Chaim Gertner that [...] "no such a separate archive existed and that the documents were scattered throughout the complex", Gertner responded: [...] "Furthermore, I most explicitly stated that <b>Yad</b> <b>Vashem's</b> Archives is not organized according to personal files, but rather organizes its close to 75 million pages of documentation according to archival collections, based on provenance. Among these documents is material from various sources related to Nachtigal's activities during World War II.

50|$|<b>Yad</b> <b>Vashems</b> Righteous Gentiles Department {{informed}} Marchione {{that the}} museum would consider changing the negative presentation of Pius role during the Holocaust if at least two Jews (or their descendants) were {{to come forward with}} proof they were saved from the Nazis due to Pius personal intervention. Marchione claims she has interviewed scores of elderly Italian Jews who expressed gratitude to the pope for {{the fact that they were}} hidden in Vatican institutions during that period. After Pope Benedict XVIs first major meeting with Jewish leaders in 2005, Rabbi David Rosen, director of interreligious affairs for the American Jewish Committee, told the Catholic News Service that “there would be very many people within the Jewish world who would see the beatification of Pius XII as an act of intentional insensitivity”.|$|R

5000|$|In 1933, {{the year}} when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power in Germany, there were still 30 Jews living in Hennweiler. In the years that followed, though, some of the Jews emigrated {{in the face of}} the boycotting of their businesses, the {{progressive}} stripping of their rights and repression, all brought about by the Nazis. On the evening after Kristallnacht (9-10 November 1938), there were excesses in the village at the NSDAP district leader’s urging. In the violence that ensued, the synagogue was desecrated, among other things. The last four Jewish families left Hennweiler in August and September 1939 and moved to Cologne or Nuremberg. The last four members of the Jewish community in Bruschied were deported to the camps in 1942.

2500|$|The {{number of}} Poles who rescued Jews from the Nazi {{persecution}} {{would be hard}} to determine in black-and-white terms, and is still the subject of scholarly debate. According to Gunnar S. Paulsson, the number of rescuers that meet <b>Yad</b> <b>Vashem's</b> criteria is perhaps 100,000 and there may have been two or three times as many who offered minor help; the majority [...] "were passively protective." [...] In an article published in the Journal of Genocide Research, Hans G. Furth estimated {{that there may have been}} as many as 1,200,000 Polish rescuers. Richard C. Lukas estimated that upwards of 1,000,000 Poles were involved in such rescue efforts, [...] "but some estimates go as high as three million." [...] Lukas also cites Władysław Bartoszewski, a wartime member of Żegota, as having estimated that [...] "at least several hundred thousand Poles ... participated in various ways and forms in the rescue action." [...] Elsewhere, Bartoszewski has estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the Polish population was actively involved in rescue efforts; Marcin Urynowicz estimates that a minimum of from 500,000 to over a million Poles actively tried to help Jews. The lower number was proposed by Teresa Prekerowa who claimed that between 160,000 and 360,000 Poles assisted in hiding Jews, amounting to between 1% and 2.5% of the 15 million adult Poles she categorized as [...] "those who could offer help." [...] Her estimation counts only those who were involved in hiding Jews directly. It also assumes that each Jew who hid among the non-Jewish populace stayed throughout the war in only one hiding place and as such had only one set of helpers. However, other historians indicate that a much higher number was involved. Paulsson wrote that, according to his research, an average Jew in hiding stayed in seven different places throughout the war.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the way of}} institutions, {{there were}} a synagogue (see Former synagogue below), a Jewish school, a mikveh and a graveyard. To provide for the community’s {{religious}} needs, a schoolteacher was hired for a time, who also busied himself as the hazzan (and the shochet?). The community belonged to the Rabbinate of Meisenheim. The Jews living in Becherbach bei Kirn, Bärweiler, Schweinschied, Löllbach and Hoppstädten formed outlying parts of this Jewish community. In 1807, the following Jewish families were living in these villages (firm family names {{had not yet been}} adopted): in Bärweiler Loeb Jacob, Lasar Levy, Moyses Jacob and Seuve Gurnberg; in Schweinschied Joseph Nathan, Jacob Salomon, Susel Salomon, Isaac Abraham and Jacob Aaron; in Löllbach Herz Nathan, Jacob Wolff and Daniel Cahen. In 1867, there were 18 Jewish inhabitants in Becherbach bei Kirn, 13 in Bärweiler, 8 in Schweinschied, 6 in Löllbach and 4 in Hoppstädten. Löllbach also had its own Jewish graveyard. About 1924, four more families belonged to the Jewish community in Hundsbach (family names Blum, Adler and Leiser). Still living then in Hundsbach were ten Jewish inhabitants. Some of them left the village in the years after 1933, the year when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power in Germany, though, some of the Jews moved away or emigrated {{in the face of the}} boycotting of their businesses, the progressive stripping of their rights and repression, all brought about by the Nazis.
