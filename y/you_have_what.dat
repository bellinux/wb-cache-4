500|$|In a scene {{featuring}} the two title characters having lunch at Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan, the couple are arguing about a man's {{ability to recognize}} when a woman is faking an orgasm. Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference, and to prove her point, she vividly (fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. The scene ends with Sally casually returning to her meal as a nearby patron (played by Reiner's mother) places her order: [...] "I'll have what she's having." [...] When Estelle Reiner died at age 94 in 2008, The New York Times referred to her as the woman [...] "who delivered {{one of the most}} memorably funny lines in movie history". This scene was shot again and again, and Ryan demonstrated her fake orgasms for hours. Katz's Deli still hangs a sign above the table that says, [...] "Where Harry met Sally... hope <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> she had!" ...|$|E

6000|$|He was {{standing}} before his dresser slowly removing his collar and tie {{when the door}} opened and his mother entered.
