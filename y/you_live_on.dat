The pair dated until February 2009, {{when they decided to}} go on a break. Milian said that they were still really close, and decided to break up because it was [...] "hard to grow together when <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> two different coasts". The singer wanted to take more opportunities and learn more about herself, which she often let go when in a relationship, but felt that she was in a now-or-never situation. Milian described Lyon as an amazing guy, and said that although there was a chance for the couple in the future, she needed to focus on herself.|$|E

Existing border crossings were opened immediately, though their limited capacity caused long tailbacks as millions of East Germans crossed over to the West. Within the first four days, 4.3million East Germans– a quarter of the country's entire population– poured into West Germany. At the Helmstedt crossing point on the Hanover–Berlin autobahn, cars were backed up for some drivers waited 11hours to drive across to the West. The border was opened progressively over the course of the next few months. New crossing points were created at many points, reconnecting communities that had been separated for nearly 40years. At Herrenhof on the Elbe, hundreds of East Germans pushed their way through the border fence to board the first cross-river ferry to run since April 1945. Hundreds of people from the East German town of Katherinenberg surged across the border to see the West German border town of Wanfried, while West Germans poured into East Germany [...] "to see how <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> the other side". East German border guards, overwhelmed by the flood of people, soon gave up checking passports. Special trains were put on to transport people across the border.
