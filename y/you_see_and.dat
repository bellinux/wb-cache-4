After moving to France, she {{became one of the first}} women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris, where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings. As recently as 2012, she was doing readings on major feast days, including Christmas and Easter. [...] "It's a task I love", she once said. In describing her preparation for her readings, she once observed, [...] "You have to convey the deep meaning, <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>and</b> it has to start with your own faith. But first I always pray. I pray before I start to prepare, as well. In fact, I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way." [...] DeHavilland prefers to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style. She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gisèle in the Roman Catholic Church, the faith of each child's father.|$|E

However, he declined further roles, describing acting as [...] "not [...] cup of tea because there's nothing else [...] could act as except a blind man". He also participated in variety television shows in Singapore (notably as a guest judge on Campus Superstar) and Taiwan (such as Happy Sunday), but some Taiwanese hosts rejected him over fears that their jokes would offend him.

500|$|The {{designers}} included role-playing {{elements in}} the game. Similar to Ultima Underworld, another Looking Glass Studios project, the environment in System Shock 2 is persistent and constantly changes without the player's presence. Paper-and-pencil role-playing games were influential; the character customization system was based on Travellers methodology and was implemented in the fictional military branches which, by allowing multiple character paths, the player could receive a more open-ended gameplay experience. Horror was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it. Isolation was deemed primary, {{which resulted in the}} player having little physical contact with other sentient beings. Secondly, a vulnerability was created by focusing on a fragile character. Last were the inclusion of moody sound effects and [...] "the intelligent placement of lighting and shadows". The game's lead designer, Ken Levine, oversaw the return of System Shock villain SHODAN. Part of Levine's design was to ally the player with her, as he believed that game characters were too trusting, stating [...] "good guys are good, bad guys are bad. What <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> perceive is real". Levine sought to challenge this notion by having SHODAN betray the player: [...] "Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the player never is. I wanted to violate that trust and make the player feel that they, and not [...] the character, were led on and deceived". This design choice was controversial with the development team.|$|E

500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> to be able to apply that to music".|$|E

The New Straits Times also appreciated the game's performance with a 3Dfx Voodoo card, praising the graphics of the terrain, as well as water and helicopter movements. GameFan acclaimed the attention to detail and variety in environment graphics' textures. Reviewing the PC version, Allgame called the graphics [...] "decent", but criticised the minimal progress from Soviet Strike which resulted in [...] "a slightly archaic look" [...] and lack of [...] "a feel of individuality". Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64, the website noted that the graphics ably handled numerous explosions and enemies. The reviewer praised the detail, colours and fluid motion. He also acknowledged the use of N64 Expansion Pak, but said [...] "the game still moves and looks very nice" [...] without it. Game Revolution felt: [...] "This is definitely the best-looking 'Strike' game yet." [...] It praised the [...] "gorgeously rendered" [...] maps and the detail on structures and units, while Next Generation complained of [...] "water that doesn't ripple and a few other missing touches" [...] resulting in a somewhat haphazard feel. Daily Radar praised the terrain graphics but called the vehicles [...] "horrible". Power Play praised the impressive graphics and destructible scenery. Game Revolution also praised the persistent battlefields: [...] "What really stands out is the ability to interact with everything. When you shoot water, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> hear the splashes. You can blow up almost anything that they've put on the map" [...] but noted the sometimes unrealistic results, such as ships being launched high into the air upon destruction.

[...] In his review for the Washington Post, Gary Arnold wrote, [...] "A movie that appeared intent on revealing an alarmingly contemporary criminal subculture gradually reverts to underworld cliche, covering its derivative tracks with outrageous decor and an apocalyptic, production number finale, ingeniously choreographed to leave the antihero floating face down in a literal bloodbath." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hildegard {{said that}} she first saw [...] "The Shade of the Living Light" [...] {{at the age of}} three, and by the age of five she began to {{understand}} that she was experiencing visions. She used the term 'visio' to this feature of her experience, and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to Jutta, who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary. Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to [...] "write down that which <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> hear." [...] Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill.

2500|$|The {{composition}} of the first work, Scivias, was triggered by the insistence of her visionary experiences in about 1142, when she was already forty-three years old. Perceiving a divine command to [...] "write down what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> hear", Hildegard began to record her visionary experiences. Scivias is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, {{the structure of the}} universe (famously described as an [...] "egg"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the Trinity, the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in baptism and confirmation, the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the Eucharist, and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions.|$|E
