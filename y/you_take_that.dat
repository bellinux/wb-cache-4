500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] {{addresses}} [...] "insecurity and {{the release}} that comes in admitting it". Jim Farber from New York Daily News opined that Madonna [...] "ponders either running from, or accepting the end of, her career", whereas Adam R. Holz of Plugged In found Madonna [...] "confront confusion, fear and change". Regarding the lyrics [...] "I walk this razor's edge / Will I stand or will I fall?", Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound expressed that: [...] "When the world that you made goes onto change without you, keeping up becomes a bigger and bigger risk. If you're Madonna, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> risk no matter how {{likely you are to}} come out the other side without stumbling." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It shows you what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse can take you down. I think another part of the answer is that parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E

500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to have somebody kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we all felt quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E
500|$|Some criticised {{the visual}} allure of the character, up to {{allegations}} of sexual objectification. Mentioning [...] "the subject of unlockable gym slips for Ayane" [...] in 2002, Edge magazine stated that while it [...] "remains opposed to videogame censorship, the Dead or Alive franchise has certainly challenged the boundaries of taste in games." [...] In 2009, Joe Newman of GamesRadar ranked the series of Team Ninja's controversial Sigma 2 commercials, designed {{to draw attention to}} the fact that the [...] "notoriously big-breasted" [...] Ayane was a playable character (one of which was called by Destructoid [...] "the best and worst thing to have ever been created"), as the fourth most blatantly sexist game advertisement ever, adding: [...] "God forbid a moment goes by where any part of her body might be covered up." [...] Team Ninja's post-Itagaki head Yosuke Hayashi dismissed the criticism, stating in 2012: [...] "With the representation of female characters in the Dead or Alive franchise, we've always wanted to make the girls look as attractive as possible, and that's something that's not going to change for us at all." [...] Hayashi explained: [...] "We are a Japanese developer, and we're making the female characters with our common sense and our creative sense. When <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> to countries outside of Japan, it tends to be very misinterpreted in some cases, people considering it sexist or derogatory, etc." [...] The issue was also dismissed in 2015 by Team Ninja creative director Tom Lee, who said they as well as most of their [...] "fans around the world don’t share the same sentiments" [...] as their critics.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E

Alford told John Tierney of The New York Times, [...] "Once you call yourself a pathetic loser, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> power away from others. You reclaim your pathos."

[...] Tim Gunn, fashion consultant, told Time magazine, [...] "... the Croc – {{it looks like a}} plastic hoof. How can <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> seriously?"

2500|$|On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, {{participated in}} an {{interview}} with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior. She also claimed Edwards had lied in his confession, because the affair was of a longer duration than the timeframe that he had claimed and was still ongoing. Marshall also stated that, {{in the days after the}} story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her. She also called upon Edwards to tell the complete truth about the affair. During that same day, an article from CBS News was published saying, [...] "CBS News legal analyst, Mickey Sherman, told Early Show co-anchor, Maggie Rodriguez, that Edwards may be in legal jeopardy if it could be shown that the funds were used for purposes other than the ones that they had been assigned for. [...] "If you raise money to run for (office)", Sherman explained, [...] "and if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> money that people have contributed to you based upon the fact that they think their money is going to a presidential candidate, and you give it to a girlfriend of a God-knows-what ... that's a crime. The New York Daily News also reported on that same day that, when questioned about the affair by reporters, Mimi Hockman, Hunter's partner in the Midline Groove video production company, [...] "said the contract they signed with John Edwards had a 'hefty' confidentiality clause that bars her from talking." [...] Two days earlier, on August 11, 2008, Hockman had been questioned by reporters from the Star-Ledger at her home.
