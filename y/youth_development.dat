5|$|In Gannon's first match {{back at the}} club, {{the team}} lost a match 2–1 to joint-leaders Fleetwood Town, who {{achieved}} a record attendance in the fixture at Highbury. Gannon managed Stockport to their first back-to-back wins in over three years, since his last stint as manager, with successive 1–0 victories over Wrexham and Darlington. Gannon steered Stockport away from the drop zone, winning eight of the last 15 league games – when the side had only managed to win nine games throughout {{the whole of the}} 2010–11 campaign – to finish 16th in the final table. Gannon again focused on <b>youth</b> <b>development,</b> inducing young players such as Danny Whitehead, Cameron Darkwah, Danny Hattersley and Ian Ormson into the starting eleven. County regained sole tenancy of their Edgeley Park stadium {{for the first time in}} nine years from the beginning of the 2012–13 season, after Sale Sharks relocated for a second time, this time sharing with Salford City Reds at Barton.|$|E
5|$|Maribor's Academy is {{responsible}} for <b>youth</b> <b>development</b> at the club, {{with the goal of}} developing young players for the future. The academy is composed of eleven youth selections, ranging from U7 to U19. Totally, there are over 210 youth players in the system who are trained by professional staff within the club. The vision of the club and its youth system is not only to produce new players but also to prepare young children for the future and life without football. Therefore, each child {{who wants to be a}} member of the academy must also be successful not only on the football field, but also in the field of education. The club has also spread the football school activities to primary schools in the city of Maribor and the surrounding area, where around 500 of the youngest footballers train as part of the Children's Football School.|$|E

His brother Benny Fenton started his career as a player at West Ham in 1937, before moving to Millwall in 1939. After he retired as a footballer, he moved into management, managing Millwall from 1966–74. On 17 January 1967 he was manager of the Lions team that established an English Football League record of 59 games unbeaten at home.

40|$|M. Phil. (Sport Management) <b>Youth</b> {{football}} <b>development</b> {{has developed}} into an important, {{integral part of}} professional football world-wide. Countries such as Spain, Brazil and the Netherlands have proven that an investment in <b>youth</b> football <b>development</b> has resulted in them becoming the world’s best football playing countries as ranked by International Football Association (FIFA). The investment in <b>youth</b> football <b>development</b> by these countries has resulted in sustained football success. The {{aim of this study}} was to survey and analyse the management of <b>youth</b> football <b>development</b> programmes existing in the Gauteng Province, South Africa. Questionnaires were distributed among participants (youth players between the ages of 12 and 20 years) in selected structured <b>youth</b> football <b>development</b> programmes in Gauteng. Structured interviews were undertaken with managers, owners, directors, coaches and any other personnel working in these <b>youth</b> football <b>development</b> programmes to determine how these programmes are managed. Mixed methods were used to gather data from the questionnaire, structured interviews and from documentary analysis (e. g. annual reports, budgets, policies, development plans, minutes of meetings and strategic plans). The study focussed on the management of current <b>youth</b> football <b>development</b> programmes in the Gauteng Province IN South. The stratification of the sample was eight structured, youth football programmes (YFDP) existing in Gauteng Province and 216 participants responded completing the questionnaire. A manager, coach or administrator from each <b>youth</b> football <b>development</b> programme was personally interviewed by the researcher. Results of the mixed methods survey were analysed. Analysis of the data was mainly of a descriptive nature. A computer programme (SPSS version 20) was used to compute the results. The outcomes of the study showed that there are management, administration, financial as well as sport scientific support gaps in the development of young football players in established youth football programmes in the Gauteng Province...|$|R

5|$|The bicycle kick retains popular appeal; Hesse and Simpson {{highlight}} the positive impact a successful bicycle kick has on player notability, and the United States Soccer Federation {{describes it as}} an iconic embellishment of the sport. Defender Marcelo Balboa's bicycle kick in the 1994 FIFA World Cup match between Colombia and the United States received much praise and is even credited with boosting the sport's popularity in the United States. According to former Manchester City defender Paul Lake, a notable bicycle kick performed by English left winger Dennis Tueart in the English Premier League injured hundreds of fans who tried to emulate it. When Italian striker Mario Balotelli, during his <b>youth</b> <b>development</b> years, tried to pattern his skills on those of Brazilian midfielder Ronaldinho and French midfielder Zinedine Zidane, he fixated on the bicycle kick. The manoeuvre is also admired in variants of association football, such as beach soccer and futsal. An action like the bicycle kick is also used in sepak takraw, a sport {{whose objective is to}} kick a ball over a net and into the opposing team's side.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 the Panthers {{became a}} founder {{member of the}} new Ice Hockey Superleague. The new league {{abolished}} the wage cap and restrictions on the number of non-British trained players a club was allowed. Many of Nottingham's British players, who had risen through the ranks of the club's <b>youth</b> <b>development</b> system, were dropped in favour of North American imports. Of Nottingham's locally trained contingent only Randall Weber, Ashley Tait and Simon Hunt were retained. The Panthers began the season by qualifying for the Benson & Hedges Cup final for a third straight year following a 6–3 aggregate victory over archrival Sheffield at the semi final stage. In the final they defeated the Ayr Scottish Eagles 5–3, taking the lead 29 seconds into the game and never relinquishing it. The Panthers finished fourth in the league and qualified for the last four in the playoffs after finishing top of their group with five wins and one overtime loss from six games. Their semi final against the Ayr Scottish Eagles became the longest game in British ice hockey history. The scores were level at 5–5 after regulation time and each of the following five periods of ten-minute overtime ended goalless. Only in the sixth period of overtime, with the two-hour mark of the match nearing, did Jeff Hoad finally score a shorthanded winner for Nottingham ending the game after 115 minutes and 49 seconds. In the final the Panthers met Sheffield where they were defeated 3–1 after taking an early lead.|$|E
