40|$|Context Evaluating {{quality of}} life after surgery for {{gastroesophageal}} reflux is fundamental, since improvement of symptoms is the main goal of treatment. Objective To compare the satisfaction of patients operated for GERD, interviewed at the office, with patients interviewed by telephone. Methods One hundred and seventy-eight patients were submitted to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Ninety patients were found, and 45 agreed {{to come to the}} hospital&# 8217;s office. The other 45 patients were interviewed by telephone. Quality of life was evaluated using three methods: The GERD-HRQL questionnaire, translated to Portuguese; question &# 8220;If you could choose it today, would you do surgery again?&# 8221;; and question &# 8220;If you could classify <b>your</b> <b>symptom</b> improvement between 0 and 10, which grade would you give?&# 8221; Patients were divided in group A (office interview) and B (telephone interview). Statistical analysis was performed. Results The average GERD-HRQL score in group A was 6. 29, while in group B was 14. 09 (P = 0. 002). There was no statistical difference between groups A and B regarding patients choice of doing the surgery again(P = 0. 714) and their grade of postoperative symptom improvement (P = 0. 642). Conclusion The overall postoperative satisfaction was high.

40|$|The {{treatment}} {{options for the}} irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are expanding as new therapies, including probiotics and serotonin receptor agents, become available. Before any new agents gain widespread use, they must be studied in appropriately designed clinical trials. Symptom improvement remains the key clinically but the best technique to measure symptom improvement is unclear. Many IBS therapy studies have used a binary endpoint such as “Have you had satisfactory relief of <b>your</b> IBS <b>symptoms</b> in the past week? Yes/No? ” The study by Whitehead and colleagues in this issue suggests that “satisfactory relief ” is affected by baseline symptom severity and may not always truly reflect the symptom burden. Future research needs to determine whether “satisfactory relief ” is truly adequate, or whether alternatives such as the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50 % reduction in symptom severity would represent a superior approach to capture clinically important improvement. (Am J Gastroenterol 2006; 101 : 1066 – 1068) Based on recent evidence, it appears likely that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an organic gut-brain disorder; key pathophysiologic defects in subsets of IBS patients include increased sensitivity to colonic distention and altered central pain processing, abnormal colonic serotonin receptor signal...|$|R

6000|$|It is this ignorant uppishness {{that does}} the mischief. A {{stranger}} on the planet might expect that its grotesque absurdity would provoke enough ridicule to cure it; but unfortunately quite the contrary happens. Just as our ill health delivers us {{into the hands of}} medical quacks and creates a passionate demand for impudent pretences that doctors can cure the diseases they themselves die of daily, so our ignorance and helplessness set us clamoring for spiritual and moral quacks who pretend that they can save our souls from their own damnation. If a doctor were to say to his patients, [...] "I am familiar with <b>your</b> <b>symptoms,</b> because I have seen other people in your condition; and I will bring the very little knowledge we have to your treatment; but except in that very shallow sense I dont know what is the matter with you; and I cant undertake to cure you," [...] he would be a lost man professionally; and if a clergyman, on being called on to award a prize for good conduct in the village school, were to say, [...] "I am afraid I cannot say who is the best-behaved child, because I really do not know what good conduct is; but I will gladly take the teacher's word as to which child has caused least inconvenience," [...] he would probably be unfrocked, if not excommunicated. And yet no honest and intellectually capable doctor or parson can say more. Clearly it would not be wise of the doctor to say it, because optimistic lies have such immense therapeutic value that a doctor who cannot tell them convincingly has mistaken his profession. And a clergyman who is not prepared to lay down the law dogmatically will not be of much use in a village school, though it behoves him all the more to be very careful what law he lays down. But unless both the clergyman and the doctor are in the attitude expressed by these speeches they are not fit for their work. The man who believes that he has more than a provisional hypothesis to go upon is a born fool. He may have to act vigorously on it. The world has no use for the Agnostic who wont believe anything because anything might be false, and wont deny anything because anything might be true. But there is a wide difference between saying, [...] "I believe this; and I am going to act on it," [...] or, [...] "I dont believe it; and I wont act on it," [...] and saying, [...] "It is true; and it is my duty and yours to act on it," [...] or, [...] "It is false; and it is my duty and yours to refuse to act on it." [...] The difference is as great as that between the Apostles' Creed and the Athanasian Creed. When you repeat the Apostles' Creed you affirm that you believe certain things. There you are clearly within your rights. When you repeat the Athanasian Creed, you affirm that certain things are so, and that anybody who doubts that they are so cannot be saved. And this is simply a piece of impudence on your part, as you know nothing about it except that as good men as you have never heard of your creed. The apostolic attitude is a desire to convert others to our beliefs for the sake of sympathy and light: the Athanasian attitude is a desire to murder people who dont agree with us. I am sufficient of an Athanasian to advocate a law for the speedy execution of all Athanasians, because they violate the fundamental proposition of my creed, which is, I repeat, that all living creatures are experiments. The precise formula for the Superman, ci-devant The Just Man Made Perfect, has not yet been discovered. Until it is, every birth is an experiment in the Great Research which is being conducted by the Life Force to discover that formula.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the association between}} appetite and symptoms of depression and anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, and comorbidities in patients on hemodialysis (HD). DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted. SETTING: The {{study was conducted in}} an outpatient HD service of a tertiary level academic hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 90 patients on HD were evaluated for appetite (during the past week, how would you rate <b>your</b> appetite?), <b>symptoms</b> of depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) and anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HARS]), cognitive dysfunction (Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]), and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relationship between appetite and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, and comorbidities was assessed. RESULTS: In 43 patients, the appetite was very good/good (group 1), in 22, it was fair (group 2), and in 25, it was poor/very poor (group 3). Mean and median BDI were significantly higher in group 3 as well as the percentage of patients with BDI ≥ 16. Mean and median HARS and the percentage of patients with HARS > 13 were significantly higher in group 3. MMSE was significantly lower in group 3 as well as the percentage of patients with MMSE ≤ 23. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a dependence of appetite by age and BDI (P =. 007 and P =. 002, respectively).
