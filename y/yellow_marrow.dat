5000|$|The {{two types}} of bone marrow are [...] "red marrow" [...] (medulla ossium rubra), which {{consists}} mainly of hematopoietic tissue, and [...] "yellow marrow" [...] (medulla ossium flava), which is mainly made up of fat cells. Red blood cells, platelets, and most white blood cells arise in red marrow. Both types of bone marrow contain numerous blood vessels and capillaries. At birth, all bone marrow is red. With age, {{more and more of}} it is converted to the yellow type; only around half of adult bone marrow is red. Red marrow is found mainly in the flat bones, such as the pelvis, sternum, cranium, ribs, vertebrae and scapulae, and in the cancellous ("spongy") material at the epiphyseal ends of long bones such as the femur and humerus. <b>Yellow</b> <b>marrow</b> is found in the medullary cavity, the hollow interior of the middle portion of short bones. In cases of severe blood loss, the body can convert <b>yellow</b> <b>marrow</b> back to red marrow to increase blood cell production.|$|E
50|$|The {{outer shell}} of the long bone is made of {{cortical}} bone also known as compact bone. This is covered by a membrane of connective tissue called the periosteum. Beneath the cortical bone layer is a layer of spongy cancellous bone. Inside this is the medullary cavity which has an inner core of bone marrow made up of <b>yellow</b> <b>marrow</b> in the adult and red marrow in the child.|$|E
50|$|The {{medullary}} cavity (medulla, innermost part) is {{the central}} cavity of bone shafts where red bone <b>marrow</b> and/or <b>yellow</b> bone <b>marrow</b> (adipose tissue) is stored; hence, the medullary cavity {{is also known as}} the marrow cavity. Located in the main shaft of a long bone (diaphysis) (consisting mostly of compact bone), the medullary cavity has walls composed of spongy bone (cancellous bone) and is lined with a thin, vascular membrane (endosteum). However, the medullary cavity is the area inside any bone (long, flat, etc.) that holds the bone marrow.|$|R

The DXA technique uses two different x-ray energy levels to estimate bone density. DXA scans assume a constant relationship between the amounts of lean soft tissue and adipose tissue. This assumption leads to measurement errors, with an impact on accuracy as well as precision.|$|R
2500|$|In humans, {{adipose tissue}} is located {{beneath the skin}} (subcutaneous fat), around {{internal}} organs (visceral fat), in bone <b>marrow</b> (<b>yellow</b> bone <b>marrow),</b> intermuscular (Muscular system) and in the breast tissue. [...] Adipose tissue is found in specific locations, which {{are referred to as}} adipose depots. Apart from adipocytes, which comprise the highest percentage of cells within adipose tissue, other cell types are present, collectively termed stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells. SVF includes preadipocytes, fibroblasts, adipose tissue macrophages, and endothelial cells. Adipose tissue contains many small blood vessels. In the integumentary system, which includes the skin, it accumulates in the deepest level, the subcutaneous layer, providing insulation from heat and cold. [...] Around organs, it provides protective padding. However, its main function is to be a reserve of lipids, which can be oxidised to meet the energy needs of the body and to protect it from excess glucose by storing triglycerides produced by the liver from sugars, although some evidence suggests that most lipid synthesis from carbohydrates occurs in the adipose tissue itself. Adipose depots {{in different parts of the}} body have different biochemical profiles. Under normal conditions, it provides feedback for hunger and diet to the brain.|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{studies have}} used iliac crest {{as the source}} of mesenchymal stem cells. In cases of long bone shaft {{fracture}}, obtaining marrow from the fracture site offers more advantages. Nevertheless, due to the high number of fat cells in long bones, the <b>yellow</b> <b>marrow</b> of long bones is believed to contain lower number of mesenchymal stem cells than red marrow. Therefore the aim {{of this study is to}} compare the potency between red and <b>yellow</b> <b>marrow</b> as the donor site for the isolation of mesenchymal stem cell. Methods: Bone marrow of eight giant Flemish rabbits was aspirated from the iliac crest and femoral shaft.  Mononuclear cells were isolated from both aspirates and expanded in low glucose DMEM. After eight weeks, the cells were harvested and counted using improved Neubauer hemocytometer. Comparison of the cell number between the two donor sites was then performed by t-test. Results: After 8 weeks, an average number of 2. 93 ± 0. 91 x 10 4 and 3. 7 ± 2. 50 x 10 4 cells were obtained from the iliac and femoral group respectively.

40|$|AIM To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} <b>yellow</b> bone <b>marrow</b> on osseointegration of titanium oral implants using a long bone model. MATERIAL AND METHODS The two tibiae of eight sheep were used as experimental sites. Two osteotomies for implant installation were prepared in each tibia. At the control sites, no further treatments were performed while, at the test sites, bone marrow {{was removed from the}} osteotomy site with a curette to an extent that exceeded the implant dimensions. As a result, the apical portion of the implants at the control sites was in contact with bone marrow while, at the test sites, it was in contact with the blood clot. After 2 months, the same procedures were performed in the contralateral side. After another month, the animal was sacrificed. Ground sections were obtained for histological analysis. RESULTS After 1 month of healing, no differences between test and control sites were found in the apical extension of osseointegration and the percentage of new bone-to-implant contact. However, after 3 months of healing, a higher percentage of new bone-to-implant contact was found at the test compared to the control sites in the marrow compartment. The apical extension of osseointegration, however, was similar to that found at the 1 -month healing period both for test and control sites. CONCLUSIONS Osseointegration appeared to be favored by the presence of a blood clot when compared to the presence of <b>yellow</b> fatty bone <b>marrow.</b> Moreover, the contact with cortical bone appeared to be a prerequisite for the osseointegration process in the long bone model...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the functional reasons for the distribution of red and <b>yellow</b> bone <b>marrow</b> in the extremities of mammals and birds. Bone marrow is largely confined to the interior of the skeleton in these species. Exceptions are the physiological occurrence of hemopoietic tissue in the liver and spleen during fetal and neonatal life and in certain diseases such as myelogenous leucemia and the rare heterotopic hemopoietic loci seen in the adrenal gland (1), pelvis (31), and elsewhere. The reasons for this predilection of blood cell forming tissue for cavities in bone are still unknown. In the production of bone by ligation of the renal pedicle in rabbits, caused by the action of renal pelvis epithelium on adjacent fibroblasts (2), hemopoietic marrow is observed (3). At birth, in mammals and birds, all of the bones which contain marrow contain red marrow (4, 6), which is similar in all loci, suggesting that the erythropoietic stimuli are of a general nature; in an examination of more than 50 newborn mammals we found no exception. Soon after birth, a replacement of red marrow by fat takes place, greater in certain regions than in others, but present in normal animals in all bones. In adult life, marrow containing enough chromogens to produce a red color is found in skull, clavicles, scapulae, sternum, ribs, vertebrae, pelvis, and in the proximal portions of the extremities...|$|R

Coronal T 1 -weighted (T 1 W) images and T 1 maps were generated from T 1 relaxometry images. Blinded radiologists visually assessed RM in the distal femoral and proximal tibial metaphyses in T 1 W images using a scale of signal intensity from 0 (homogeneous hyperintensity, no RM) to 4 (all dark, complete RM). Subjects with AN exhibited nearly twofold lower metaphyseal RM scores in both the femur (0. 64 versus 1. 22, p =. 03) and tibia (0. 54 versus 0. 96, p =. 08). In relaxometric measurements of four selected regions (femur and tibia amd epiphysis and metaphysis), subjects with AN showed higher mean epiphyseal but lower metaphyseal T 1. The net AN-control difference between epiphysis and metaphysis was 70 ms in the femur (+ 31 versus − 35 ms, p =. 02) and of smaller magnitude in the tibia. In relaxometry data from the full width of the femur adjacent to the growth plate, AN subjects showed mean T 1 consistently lower than in controls by 30 to 50 ms in virtually {{every part of the}} sampling region.

40|$|International audienceBone marrow {{is found}} either as red bone marrow, which mainly {{contains}} haematopoietic cells, or <b>yellow</b> bone <b>marrow,</b> which mainly contains adipocytes. In adults, red bone marrow is principally {{located in the}} axial skeleton. A recent study has introduced a method to simultaneously estimate the fat fraction (FF), the T 1 and T 2 * relaxation times of water (T 1 w, T 2 *w) and fat (T 1 f and T 2 *f) in the vertebral bone marrow. The aim {{of the current study}} was to measure FF, T 1 w, T 1 f, T 2 *w and T 2 *f in five sites of bone marrow, and to assess the presence of regional variations. MRI experiments were performed at 1. 5 T on five healthy volunteers (31. 6 ± 15. 6 years) using a prototype chemical-shift-encoded 3 D multi-gradient-echo sequence (VIBE) acquired with two flip angles. Acquisitions were performed in the shoulders, lumbar spine and pelvis, with acquisition times of < 25 seconds per sequence. Signal intensities of magnitude images of the individual echoes were used to fit the signal and compute FF, T 1 w, T 1 f, T 2 *w and T 2 *f in the humerus, sternum, vertebra, ilium and femur. Regional variations of fat fraction and relaxation times were observed in these sites, with higher fat fraction and longer T 1 w in the epiphyses of long bones. A high correlation between FF and T 1 w was measured in these bones (R= 0. 84 in the humerus and R= 0. 84 in the femur). In most sites, {{there was a significant difference}} between water and fat relaxation times, attesting the relevance of measuring these parameters separately. The method proposed in the current study allowed for measurements of FF, T 1 w, T 1 f, T 2 *w and T 2 *f in five sites of bone marrow.
