State NA, disease-specific health complaints (e. g., runny nose, congestion, and sneezing), and an associated objective marker of disease severity (mucus secretion weights) were assessed daily during the illness. Baseline trait and state <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> both associated with increased numbers of subsequent complaints. Although greater numbers of complaints among people high in state <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> explicable in terms of greater disease severity, the association of trait <b>NA</b> and symptoms <b>was</b> independent of objective disease. The trait <b>NA</b> complaint association <b>was</b> also independent of state NA and hence not attributable to trait-elicited state affect.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} extracellular sodium concentration (Na) o, osmolality and prostaglandin Ei(PGEi) on basal vascular tone and {{the response to the}} pressor agents, noradrenaline (NA) or angiotensin II (AT-II) using the pref used central artery of the isolated rabbit ear. The following results were obtained. 1) Both the basal vascular tone and the vasoconstrictor response of resistance vessels to <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> enhanced with a decreased extracellular osmolality induced by alteration in both sucrose concentration and(Na) o. 2) While the response to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> not affected by (Na) o under constant osmolality, the response to AT-II was augmented significantly when (<b>Na)</b> o <b>was</b> increased from 102 mM to 132 mM. 3) The inhibitory action of PGE 1 on the response to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> influenced by alteration of the extracellular calcium concentration (Ca) o, and was greater when (Ca) o was less than 2. 0 mM. 4) When 0. 1 μg and 1. 0 μg of <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> applied repeatedly and alternately, the responses were gradually enhanced. However, their enhancement was reduced under perfusion of PGE 1 (10 ng/ml), the responses finally being inhibited. From the results described above, it was concluded that the response of the resistance vessels to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> affected by alteration not in external Na concentration, but in external osmolality and calcium concentration. Further, it may be considered that the inhibitory effect of PGE 1 on the response to <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> probably due to each antagonistic action on calcium ion mobility through the cell membrane or within smooth muscle cells at contraction due to NA...|$|R

5000|$|There is a {{substantial}} amount of empirical research on negative affect (NA) and its role in the tripartite model.

The correlations between the specific anxiety scale (anxious arousal) in the MASQ and <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> moderate (rs= [...]41 and [...]47), supporting that <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> specific to anxiety disorders, congruent with the tripartite model.
