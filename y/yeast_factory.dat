40|$|The {{generation}} of novel <b>yeast</b> cell <b>factories</b> for production of high-value industrial biotechnological products relies on three metabolic engineering principles: design, construction, and analysis. In {{the last two}} decades, strong efforts {{have been put on}} developing faster and more efficient strategies and/or technologies for each one of these principles. For design and construction, three major strategies are described in this review: (1) rational metabolic engineering; (2) inverse metabolic engineering; and (3) evolutionary strategies. Independent of the selected strategy, the process of designing yeast strains involves five decision points: (1) choice of product, (2) choice of chassis, (3) identification of target genes, (4) regulating the expression level of target genes, and (5) network balancing of the target genes. At the construction level, several molecular biology tools have been developed through the concept of synthetic biology and applied for the {{generation of}} novel, engineered yeast strains. For comprehensive and quantitative analysis of constructed strains, systems biology tools are commonly used and using a multi-omics approach. Key information about the biological system can be revealed, for example, identification of genetic regulatory mechanisms and competitive pathways, thereby assisting the in silico design of metabolic engineering strategies for improving strain performance. Examples on how systems and synthetic biology brought yeast metabolic engineering closer to industrial biotechnology are described in this review, and these examples should demonstrate the potential of a systems-level approach for fast and efficient generation of <b>yeast</b> cell <b>factories...</b>|$|R

Among various potential cell <b>factories,</b> <b>yeast</b> has attracted great attention in pharmaceutical protein synthesis due to its unicellular and eukaryotic properties, easy genetic manipulation, fast growth, as well as capability of post-translational modifications. In this review, recent advances in glycoengineering of yeast and secretory mechanisms in yeast for the production of biopharmaceutical proteins with appropriate pharmacokinetic properties are overviewed. To further improve these two aspects of yeast engineering, strain and pathway engineering studies are necessary to unveil engineered <b>yeast</b> cell <b>factories</b> providing humanized glycosylation with appropriate homogeneity and high secretory therapeutic production with high yield. In addition, current systems and synthetic biology tools and omics technologies to enhance the production of pharmaceutical proteins are briefly discussed. Integration of comprehensive systems biology models with omics technologies will open new doors to better understanding of yeast glycosylation and secretory mechanism, which will help obtain valuable information for strain and pathway engineering approaches. On the other hand, the applications of currently available synthetic biology tools such as CRISPR/Cas 9 and TALENs in yeast engineering will further help researchers manipulate yeast strains for high secretory recombinant therapeutic protein production with desired features. All in all, currently available systems and synthetic biology tools can be applied to yeast engineering for improved biopharmaceutical protein production.

40|$|Background: Predictable {{control of}} gene {{expression}} {{is necessary for}} the rational design and optimization of cell <b>factories.</b> In the <b>yeast</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the promoter {{is one of the most}} important tools available for controlling gene expression. However, the complex expression patterns of yeast promoters have not been fully characterised and compared on different carbon sources (glucose, sucrose, galactose and ethanol) and across the diauxic shift in glucose batch cultivation. These conditions are of importance to <b>yeast</b> cell <b>factory</b> design because they are commonly used and encountered in industrial processes. Here, the activities of a series of "constitutive" and inducible promoters were characterised in single cells throughout the fermentation using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. Results: The "constitutive" promoters, including glycolytic promoters, transcription elongation factor promoters and ribosomal promoters, differed in their response patterns to different carbon sources; however, in glucose batch cultivation, expression driven by these promoters decreased sharply as glucose was depleted and cells moved towards the diauxic shift. Promoters induced at low-glucose levels (PHXT₇, PSSA₁ and PADH₂) varied in induction strength on non-glucose carbon sources (sucrose, galactose and ethanol); in contrast to the "constitutive" promoters, GFP expression increased as glucose decreased and cells moved towards the diauxic shift. While lower than several "constitutive" promoters during the exponential phase, expression from the SSA 1 promoter was higher in the post-diauxic phase than the commonly-used TEF 1 promoter. The galactose-inducible GAL 1 promoter provided the highest GFP expression on galactose, and the copper-inducible CUP 1 promoter provided the highest induced GFP expression following the diauxic shift. Conclusions: The data provides a foundation for predictable and optimised control of gene expression levels on different carbon sources and throughout batch fermentation, including during and after the diauxic shift.

40|$|<b>Yeast</b> cell <b>factories</b> {{encounter}} {{physical and}} chemical stresses when used for industrial production of fuels and chemicals.

We investigated the three most commonly encountered industrial stresses for yeast (ethanol, salt, and temperature) to identify the mechanisms of general and stress-specific responses under chemostat conditions in which specific growth rate-dependent changes are eliminated. By applying systems-level analysis, we found that most stress responses converge on mitochondrial processes. Our analysis revealed that stress-specific factors differ between applied stresses; however, they are underpinned by an increased ATP demand. We found that when ATP demand increases to high levels, respiration cannot provide sufficient ATP, leading to onset of respirofermentative metabolism. Although stress-specific factors increase ATP demand for cellular growth under stressful conditions, increased ATP demand for cellular maintenance underpins a general stress response and {{is responsible for the}} onset of overflow metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The {{slow down}} in the drug {{discovery}} pipeline is, in part, owing {{to a lack of}} structural and functional information available for new drug targets.

Unfortunately, however, obtaining high yields of functional, recombinant membrane proteins remains a major bottleneck in contemporary bioscience. While repeated rounds of trial-and-error optimization have not (and cannot) reveal mechanistic details of the biology of recombinant protein production, examination of the host response has provided new insights.
