500|$|The game Action Button {{described}} as [...] "about keeping <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> balls" [...] {{was inspired by}} tennis. It was released with little advanced notice in early November 2012. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com compared it with Sidhe Interactive's Shatter and VG247 called it a rendition of Breakout. Pocket Gamer Mark Brown likened it to both and further compared it with Alleyway, Arkanoid, and Super Hexagon with a [...] "telekinetic power" [...] to alter the ball's direction apart from the panel (as in Shatter). He found the game frustrating at times when unable to control the ball. Though Brown found TNNS fun, different, and addictive, it had [...] "not quite won [...] over".|$|E
500|$|Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now, {{published}} in 1993, is African-American writer and poet Maya Angelou's first book of essays. [...] It was published shortly after she recited her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration. Journey {{consists of a}} series of short essays, often autobiographical, along with two poems, and has been called one of Angelou's [...] "wisdom books". [...] It is titled after a lyric in the song Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>on</b> the Prize. At the time of its publication, Angelou was already well respected and popular as a writer and poet. [...] Like her previous works, Journey received generally positive reviews.|$|E
500|$|The same year, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network, a drama {{based on}} the founders of Facebook. On his character, Garfield remarked that [...] "No one knows who Eduardo Saverin is, and I don't either. Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to my approach because you feel {{a greater sense of}} responsibility". Initially, the film's director, David Fincher, had met Garfield under the auspices of him playing Mark Zuckerberg, having been referred to him by Mark Romanek. However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's [...] "incredible emotional access to his kind of core humanity" [...] better tailored for the role of Saverin. Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role. Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that [...] "everyone knows he's one of the very best things about the Social Network". Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with [...] "great subtlety and rueful charm". Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered [...] "a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie", and proclaimed: [...] "Keep <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Garfield — he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one." [...] He received similar plaudits of the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and The New Yorker.|$|E

On Halloween, Harry and Ron witness Snape entering the door to Fluffy’s chamber, {{and for the next}} few days having a pronounced limp. Harry also overhears him saying [...] "How are you meant to keep <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> all three heads at once?" [...] to Filch. However, it is later revealed that he followed then Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Quirinus Quirrell into the chamber. While Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher’s Stone, Professor Quirrell penetrates Fluffy’s defences by playing a harp, in order to access the trapdoor, while Harry uses a flute that had been given to him by Hagrid.|$|E
2500|$|Denisoff {{subdivided}} protest {{songs as}} either [...] "magnetic" [...] or [...] "rhetorical". [...] "Magnetic" [...] protest songs {{were aimed at}} attracting people to the movement and promoting group solidarity and commitment – for example, [...] "Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>on</b> the Prize" [...] and [...] "We Shall Overcome". [...] "Rhetorical" [...] protest songs, on the other hand, are often characterized by individual indignation and offer a straightforward political message designed to change political opinion. Denisoff argued that although [...] "rhetorical" [...] songs often are not overtly connected to building a larger movement, they should nevertheless be considered as [...] "protest-propaganda". Examples include Bob Dylan's [...] "Masters of War" [...] (which contains the lines [...] "I hope that you die / And your death'll come soon") and [...] "What's Going On" [...] by Marvin Gaye.|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> (<b>on</b> the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. That was the one thing I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets for a moment in time.") However, Open Your Eyes [...] was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The title single [...] managed to reach number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart.|$|E
