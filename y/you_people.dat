Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it.

However, Eric Wilson from the same newspaper commented that the video did not yield a breakout Madonna look compared to her videos from the 1980s.

500|$|In any case, Biden {{would not}} run {{again for the}} {{presidency}} until his 2008 campaign, twenty years later. This time {{he made it to}} the Iowa caucuses, but withdrew after a poor showing. [...] Meanwhile, Biden and Kinnock had become close friends after the plagiarism incident. Meeting in August 2008, after Biden had been chosen by Democratic nominee Barack Obama as his running mate, Biden introduced Kinnock to his Senate staff by saying: “Hey, <b>you</b> <b>people!</b> Do you know this guy? He used to be my greatest speechwriter.” [...] Obama and Biden proceeded to win the general election against the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin; Biden's 1988 campaign lapses were never a significant issue in the race, and Biden invited Kinnock to the inauguration. Additionally, Biden also won the Delaware Senate election the same year, and would've been the longest serving Senator in Delaware history, had the McCain/Palin ticket been elected. In 2015, Biden considered a possible 2016 presidential bid, but declined it on October 21, 2015, the same year his son Beau died of brain cancer. As his term expired in 2017, he is currently considering a possible presidential bid for the 2020 election.|$|E

Carter details a heated exchange between NBC executive Jeff Zucker and O'Brien's agent Rick Rosen during which Zucker told O'Brien's representatives he could enforce O'Brien's contract and [...] "ice him for two years", after details of the conflict were leaked to the media. The author cites O'Brien's disappointment with the perceived unfairness of the situation, and quotes O'Brien's comments at a meeting with NBC Entertainment and Universal Media Studios chairman Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, [...] "I know how hard I worked for this.

[...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together.

[...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the video was similar to Michael Jackson's Dangerous era adding, [...] "While some might say the basic concept of Beyoncé's [...] 'Love On Top' video is too straightforward, we actually think it's amazing – just let Beyoncé sing, dance, look fuhLAWless and wear a cute hat! What else do <b>you</b> <b>people</b> need?!" [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice described the video as a direct homage to New Edition's [...] "If It Isn't Love" [...] but added that when the song's key changes start, [...] "Beyoncé and her posse of backup dancers get a bit brassier and fancier". She further wrote that the video was something that Phil Collins [...] "would be proud" [...] of.|$|E
500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about <b>you.</b> <b>People</b> are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero."

[...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E
