500|$|August Brown of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, commenting that [...] "Kendrick Lamar somehow packs more personality into a halfhearted hook on 'Forbidden Fruit' than Cole {{gets in the}} song". Phillip Mlynar of Spin felt that [...] " [...] quirky bass line and warm-keys motif are so recognizable that it's a brow-furrowing challenge to hear anything other than Q-Tip and Phife's original vocals {{in the space between}} the beat and the new raps." [...] Mlynar further stated that [...] "Cole himself (along with Kendrick Lamar's guest spot) ends up evaporating entirely — he's upstaged by loftier artists who aren't even there." [...] Contrarily, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest expressed his appreciation for Cole's production: [...] " [...] didn't like try to do what was already done. [...] brought other parts to the sample that <b>you</b> <b>caught</b> that I was like, 'Oh, nice!'" ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{behind the}} scenes video, Beyoncé {{revealed}} the reason behind naming the fragrance Heat. According to her, {{it was because the}} scent comes off as [...] "infectious", further elaborating: [...] "It's like something you can't get enough of. It's hot, it's sexy, it definitely makes you feel like <b>you</b> <b>caught</b> the fever." [...] She additionally stated that her favorite fragrance notes are red vanilla orchid, due to its [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "spicy" [...] smell, and honeysuckle, due to its [...] "sensual" [...] and [...] "sweet" [...] smell. She concluded: [...] "It was a lot of work but I was really really happy and I think it's something I'll be proud of 20 years from now." [...] During an interview with Teen Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she loved the perfume because it featured notes of orchid, her favorite flower. She further said that it was suitable for her alter ego Sasha Fierce as it was [...] "fiery".|$|E

He always lived on the edge and I was always waiting for a 'phone call {{to say that he}} had died but I never dreamed it would be under those circumstances. He's never got the credit he deserves. He should be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame because he was the greatest white soul singer that England ever produced. I'm certain that if <b>you</b> <b>caught</b> the likes of Rod Stewart and Paul Rodgers in a private moment and asked them who was the main man, they would say, Steve Marriott."

2500|$|In March 1863, Mosby {{conducted}} a daring raid far inside Union lines near the Fairfax County courthouse. He {{and his men}} captured three Union officers, including Brig. Gen. Edwin H. Stoughton. Mosby wrote in his memoirs that he found Stoughton in bed and roused him with a [...] "spank on his bare back." [...] Upon being so rudely awakened the general indignantly asked what this meant. Mosby quickly {{asked if he had}} ever heard of [...] "Mosby". The general replied, [...] "Yes, have <b>you</b> <b>caught</b> him?" [...] "I am Mosby," [...] the Confederate ranger said. [...] "Stuart's cavalry has possession of the Court House; be quick and dress." [...] Mosby and his 29 men had captured a Union general, two captains, 30 enlisted men, and 58 horses without firing a shot.|$|E
