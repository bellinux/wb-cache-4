2500|$|In {{critical}} reviewing, The New York Review of Books {{stated that}} the book was [...] "compulsively readable", and praised the author by saying [...] "Any writer who can get his audience to ask breathlessly, 'What next?' needs no help from {{this or any other}} envious reviewer." [...] Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "engaging and absorbing family saga", while the Los Angeles Times Review of Books commented that Sheldon was [...] "a genius... at writing potboilers. In Master of the Game he has outdone even himself". The Los Angeles Times also reviewed the lack of sex in the book. [...] "This viewer hoped for a wee spot of sex to relieve the monotony. The business of sexual union is depicted with curious, witless brevity" [...] The New York Times disagreed, stating that [...] "If <b>your</b> <b>reading</b> taste runs to rape, sodomy, homosexuality, and numerous other fleshy diversions, be assured; Mr. Sheldon has something for you." [...] In Massachusetts, the Worcester Sunday Telegram reviews that [...] "the title of this book is an apt description of the author. In the business of creating hard-to-put-down bestsellers, Sidney Sheldon is indeed the master of the game.", while USA Today praises Sheldon by saying that he is"a master storyteller {{at the top of the}} game." [...] In Europe, the London Review of Books categorizes the main protagonist of the novel, Kate Blackwell as being [...] "presented as some kind of role model, but it is the sort of role made popular in olden times by Joan Crawford".|$|E
