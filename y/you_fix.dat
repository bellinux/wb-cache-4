2500|$|During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called [...] "old-school" [...] and [...] "crotchety"—had {{disputes}} over filming. With {{a background in}} independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most {{of the elements of}} the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who felt that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look. Kurtz stated that [...] "In a couple of scenes [...] rather than saying, 'It looks a bit over lit, can <b>you</b> <b>fix</b> that?', [...] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way I think it should be—tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment {{about what to do with}} my lights.|$|E
2500|$|The Tuvaluan delegation, led by Ian Fry, {{played an}} active role in the Conference, {{attracting}} media attention. The country submitted a proposed protocol which would have imposed deeper, legally binding emissions cuts, including on developing nations. The proposal -dubbed by the media and by NGOs as the [...] "Tuvalu Protocol"- was [...] "immediately supported by other small island states, including Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago and several African states", but opposed by countries including China, India and Saudi Arabia. The disagreement caused a suspension in negotiations, and prompted supportive campaign groups to [...] "demonstrate outside the meeting in favour of Tuvalu, chanting: 'Tuvalu is the new deal.'" [...] Tuvalu's position was supported by, among others, East Timor, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Vanuatu, and by Papua New Guinean chief negotiator Kevin Conrad. Tuvalu and its representative Ian Fry [...] "were the toast of the thousands of environmentalists at the conference, who held a noisy demonstration in support of the island state's position". In an article entitled [...] "You caused it, <b>you</b> <b>fix</b> it: Tuvalu takes off the gloves", The Sydney Morning Herald noted that, by asking for a protocol that would legally bind developing countries, Tuvalu had [...] "cracked a diplomatic axiom that has prevailed since the UN climate convention came into being in 1992: rich countries caused global warming, and it was their responsibility to fix it". The Economic Times in India noted that the Tuvaluan proposal had [...] " [...] take centre stage", holding up proceedings for two consecutives days until it was rejected due to opposition from larger nations. Australian Senator Christine Milne described Tuvalu as [...] "the mouse that roared" [...] at the Conference. Fry refused to support the final agreement reached by the Conference, describing it as [...] "30 pieces of silver to betray our future and our people", after delivering a final plea in a speech with tears in his eyes, concluding [...] "The fate of my country rests in your hands". His [...] "tear-jerking performance [...] prompted wild applause among the crowded Copenhagen conference floor".|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis read God's admonition to Cain in [...] to {{describe}} the conflict that one has with one's Evil Inclination (yetzer hara). The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that [...] says of the Torah, [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>fix</b> ( [...] , ve-samtem) these My words in your heart and in your soul." [...] The Rabbis taught that one should read the word samtem rather as sam tam (meaning [...] "a perfect remedy"). The Rabbis thus compared the Torah to a perfect remedy. The Rabbis compared this {{to a man who}} struck his son a strong blow, and then put a compress on the son's wound, telling his son that so long as the compress was on his wound, he could eat and drink at will, and bathe in hot or cold water, without fear. But if the son removed the compress, his skin would break out in sores. Even so, did God tell Israel that God created the Evil Inclination, but also created the Torah as its antidote. God told Israel that if they occupied themselves with the Torah, they would not be delivered into the hand of the Evil Inclination, as [...] says: [...] "If you do well, shall you not be exalted?" [...] But if Israel did not occupy themselves with the Torah, they would be delivered into the hand of the Evil Inclination, as [...] says: [...] "sin couches at the door." [...] Moreover, the Rabbis taught, the Evil Inclination is altogether preoccupied to make people sin, as [...] says: [...] "and to you shall be his desire." [...] Yet if one wishes, one can rule over the Evil Inclination, as [...] says: [...] "and you shall rule over him." [...] The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that the Evil Inclination is hard to bear, since even God its Creator called it evil, as in [...] God says, [...] "the desire of man's heart is evil from his youth." [...] Rav Isaac taught that a person's Evil Inclination renews itself against that person daily, as [...] says, [...] "Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil every day." [...] And Rabbi Simeon ben Levi (or others say Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish) taught that a person's Evil Inclination gathers strength against that person daily and seeks to slay that person, as [...] says, [...] "The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him." [...] And if God were not to help a person, one {{would not be able to}} prevail against one's Evil Inclination, for as [...] says, [...] "The Lord will not leave him in his hand.".
