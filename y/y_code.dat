Since the acquisition {{process is a}} two-dimensional search in time domain and frequency domain, a successful correlator design with a local P-code generator as reference is very important. As a new programmable technology, FPGA {{is a good choice}} for digital system prototyping and design. Especially Xilinx Virtex chip DLL feature is appropriate for GPS application since GPS is a time based ranging system. However, due to the extremely long sequence of P-code, it is a challenging task to efficiently design and verify P-code generator using HDL (hardware description language) and commercial CAD tools. In this paper, an equivalent GPS P-code simulator model is proposed to facilitate design and verification. In addition, a group of mathematical equations are developed to implement a flexible P-code generator, which can start running from any specific time of a week. As a result, it can be extended to massive parallel correlator design for direct GPS P (<b>Y)</b> <b>code</b> acquisition application. ...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{least squares}} (PLS) {{is one of}} the most {{commonly}} used supervised modelling approaches for analysing multivariate metabolomics data. PLS is typically employed as either a regression model (PLS-R) or a classification model (PLS-DA). However, in metabolomics studies it is common to investigate multiple, potentially interacting, factors simultaneously following a specific experimental design. Such data often cannot be considered as a “pure” regression or a classification problem. Nevertheless, these data have often still been treated as a regression or classification problem and this could lead to ambiguous results. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of designing a hybrid target matrix Y that better reflects the experimental design than simple regression or binary class membership coding commonly used in PLS modelling. The new design of <b>Y</b> <b>coding</b> was based on the same principle used by structural modelling in machine learning techniques.

The Moving Vehicle Experiment (MVE) described in this paper is the first in situ test of the STEL Model 5401 C Time Transfer System in both stationary and mobile operations. The primary objective of the MVE was to test the timing accuracy of the newly developed GPS TTR aboard a moving vessel.

Chromosomal aberrations of y 1 -type alleles (null alleles) and y 2 -type alleles {{that give rise to}} characteristic pattern mosaicism of pigmentation were mapped by Southern blot analysis. The y 2 allele is associated with the insertion of a "gypsy" transposable element 0. 9 kb distal to the putative <b>y</b> <b>coding</b> region. A 3. 1 -kb region to which breakpoints of all y 1 -type alleles could be mapped is homologous to a 2. 0 -kb polyadenylylated mRNA, the expression of which is specifically regulated in development. This putative y gene transcript is present at high levels in pupae when melanization of the adult cuticle occurs, but its steady-state levels change dramatically during development, being highest in late embryos prior to hatching.
