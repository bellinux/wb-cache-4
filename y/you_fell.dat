500|$|On January 29, 2008, Variety {{reported}} that Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes production {{company would be}} rebooting the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise with a remake of the original 1984 film. In an interview, producer Brad Fuller initially explained that they were following the same line they did with their Friday the 13th remake, by abandoning {{the things that made}} the character less scary—the film's antagonist, Freddy Krueger, would not be [...] "cracking jokes" [...] as had become a staple of his character in later films—and focusing more on trying to craft a [...] "horrifying movie". Fuller expressed how everyone at the studio loved the concept of being killed if <b>you</b> <b>fell</b> asleep. The producer stated that the film would be a remake of the 1984 film, but clarified that they would be borrowing certain character deaths and dream sequences from the entire Nightmare series.|$|E
500|$|The 1987–88 Devils {{garnered}} the franchise's first winning record. On {{the final}} day of the regular season, they were tied with their rivals, the Rangers, for the final playoff spot in the Patrick Division. After New York defeated the Quebec Nordiques 3–0, the Devils needed to defeat the Chicago Blackhawks for a post-season berth. The Devils were trailing 3–2 midway through the third period when John MacLean tied the game, and with 2:39 left in overtime, he added the winning goal. Although the Rangers and Devils both finished with 82 points, the Devils had two more wins, sending them to the playoffs for the first time in franchise history as the New Jersey Devils. The team made it all the way to the Wales Conference Finals in the 1988 Stanley Cup playoffs, but lost to the Boston Bruins in seven games. In that series, head coach Jim Schoenfeld verbally abused referee Don Koharski after the third game, screaming at him. During the exchange, Koharski fell and Schoenfeld said to him [...] "Good, 'cause <b>you</b> <b>fell,</b> you fat pig! Have another doughnut! Have another doughnut!" [...] Schoenfeld was given a suspension by the NHL, but due to a favorable court order, he was able to coach in the fourth game of the series. In protest, referee Dave Newell and linesmen Gord Broseker and Ray Scapinello refused to work the game. Three off-ice officials – Paul McInnis, Jim Sullivan and Vin Godleski – were tracked down to work the game. After the injunction was lifted, Schoenfeld's suspension was imposed in the following game.|$|E
