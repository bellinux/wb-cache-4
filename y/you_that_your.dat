500|$|The $210 million LIRR plan faced great criticism, and one {{particular}} section received heavy opposition. New York State Senator John J. Santucci, representing the Rockaways, raised concerns that a [...] tunnel for the link, which would {{connect to the}} Rockaway Beach Branch, would require razing part of Forest Park, a plan that was opposed by his constituents. Santucci said that the link's construction would irreversibly destroy part of the park, destroying a community landmark and [...] "stripping away {{the resources of the}} people for the luxury of the few." [...] In October 1974, the president of the Hammel Holland Seaside Civic Association wrote to Mayor Abraham Beame, [...] "It is our earnest plea to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> decision on this rape of Forest Park be rescinded." [...] The association's president further said that although it would be cost-ineffective to create a premium service to JFK Airport, the Rockaway Beach Branch should still be reactivated for local passengers.|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website stated that Eve was the [...] "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" [...] who was enjoying a successful career; [...] she {{was described as}} an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected {{to go along with}} it without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but to mess with them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as if somebody came and told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E

2500|$|In 1785 Leopold visited Wolfgang and Constanze in Vienna, at a {{time when}} his son's career success was at its peak. He {{witnessed}} first hand his son's success as a performer, and on February 12 heard Joseph Haydn's widely quoted words of praise, upon hearing the string quartets Wolfgang dedicated to him, [...] "Before God and as an honest man I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name: He has taste, and, furthermore, the most profound knowledge of composition." [...] The visit was the last time that Leopold saw his son, though they continued to correspond, and Wolfgang sometimes sent copies of his piano concertos and string quartets for Leopold and Nannerl to perform with friends.|$|E
2500|$|As {{described}} by FIRE, [...] "Roger Slatt, Director of the School of Geology and Geophysics, began to unconstitutionally monitor Deming's {{letters to the}} newspaper and include them in three professional evaluations, until directed to stop by OU President David L. Boren. A former US Senator, Boren had stated in a 2001 editorial, [...] "a university {{is a place of}} many diverse viewpoints where free speech is encouraged." [...] In June 2003, Boren wrote to Deming, saying, [...] "I fully agree with <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> political views should not be included as a factor in your post-tenure review." [...] In a July 24, 2003 email, Dean Snow complained that [...] "it is doubly frustrating that President Boren...has shown such sympathy for Deming.", and wrote that he would try to convince Deming's department head to [...] " [...] basically ignore and then marginalize Deming.… As long as we keep our i’s dotted and our t’s crossed, all Deming can really do is make noise and cause a bit more paperwork.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Shizuoka District Court {{discounted}} part of Hakamada's {{confession and}} chided {{the police for}} their interrogation tactics. But, on September 11, 1968, the three-judge panel found Hakamada guilty and sentenced him to death. [...] The Japan Pro Boxing Association alleged that prejudice against boxers was involved, and said the principle of {{innocent until proven guilty}} had been violated because of rampant press reports declaring Hakamada guilty. [...] A subsequent appeal to the Tokyo High Court was denied and the Supreme Court of Japan upheld the death sentence on November 11, 1980. Hakamada maintained his innocence, writing to his son in 1983: [...] "I will prove to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> dad never killed anybody, and it is the police who know it best and it is the judges who feel sorry. I will break this iron chain and return to you." [...] Although Hakamada remained on death row, he was not executed because the Minister of Justice refused to sign his death warrant, suspecting that the conviction was not certain. Like most death row inmates, Hakamada was placed in solitary confinement throughout his prison stay. He was not permitted to talk to guards, and rarely allowed visitors.|$|E

2500|$|After {{an exhilarating}} flight, Carter arrives at last at the abode of the gods, but finds it empty. Finally a great {{procession}} arrives with much fanfare, {{led by a}} pharaoh-like man who explains to Carter that the gods of earth have seen the city of Carter's dreams and decided to make it their home, and have thus abandoned Kadath. The gods walk no more {{in the ways of}} gods, and have become instead mere denizens of the jewelled city Carter had glimpsed in his dreams. The pharaoh commands Carter to find this city, so that the natural order might be restored. [...] "It is not over unknown seas," [...] he says, [...] "but back over well-known years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes. For know <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth... These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love." [...] This mysterious man then reveals his identityhe is Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, the emissary of the Other Gods who dwell in the blackness of space.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} 1968 Program for Action, {{there was}} a {{proposal}} to re-extend the LIRR to John F. Kennedy International Airport via the Van Wyck Expressway. Many Rockaway and central Queens residents wanted the link to run along the disused Rockaway Beach Branch, rather than along the Van Wyck, so that Rockaways residents could simultaneously get express service to Manhattan. The revised plan via the Rockaway Beach Branch {{was approved by the}} New York City Board of Estimate in 1969. [...] The $210 million LIRR plan faced great criticism, and one particular section received heavy opposition. New York State Senator John J.
