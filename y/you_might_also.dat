500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{focuses on the}} yearning desire {{to be with a}} loved one for Christmas, {{regardless}} of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights, trees, snow and presents. The song incorporates various instruments, including piano, drums, violin, oboe, flute, bell chimes, bass effect, and cowbells. The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is set in common time and in the key of G major. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of G5. Carey wrote the song's lyrics and melody, while Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment. Slates Ragusea counts [...] "at least 13 distinct chords at work, resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or 'iv,' chord with an added 6, under the words 'underneath the Christmas tree,' among other places. (<b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> analyze it as a half-diminished 'ii' 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate)." [...] According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic, the song contains [...] "The Beach Boys-style harmonies, jangling bells, and a sleigh-ride pace, injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set." [...] In a piece on the song in Vogue, a writer felt the song's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later: [...] "those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra—well, maybe not Frank, but another singer back then. I think that's what gives it that timeless, classic quality." ...|$|E

You have--unwittingly, I believe--given {{information}} to a man whom the Government suspects of peculation. You have, without knowing it, warned the postmaster at Hickory Hill that he is suspected; and, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have frustrated our plans for tracing a series of embezzlements to their proper source, {{you will see that}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>also</b> done great wrong to yourself as his only neighbor and the next responsible person. In plain words, we have traced the disappearance of money letters to a point when it lies between these two offices. Now, I have not the least hesitation in telling you that we do not suspect Laurel Run, and never have suspected it. Even the result of your thoughtless act, although it warned him, confirms our suspicion of his guilt. As to the warning, it has failed, or he has grown reckless, for another letter has been missed since. To-night, however, will settle all doubt in the matter. When I open that bag in this office to-night, and do not find a certain decoy letter in it, which was last checked at Heavy Tree Crossing, I shall know that it remains in Green's possession at Hickory Hill." ...|$|R

[...] "Give me a bomb and when you hear it burst in this listening post let your men start across No Man's Land slowly. Presently they will hear a commotion in the enemy trench; but they need not hurry, and, whatever they do, have them come quietly. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> warn them that I may be in the trench and that I do not care to be shot or bayoneted." ...|$|E

To act 'as becomes a creature endued with a principle of reason,' eyeing the state or place in which God hath set him; approving of, affecting and complying with the eternal laws of righteousness (p. 6), which eternal laws in page 8 you call 'divine moral laws,' those that were first written in the hearts of men, 'and originally dictates of human nature,' &c. II. 'To do these, from truly generous motives and principles' (p. 7). Such as these, 1. Because 'it is most highly becoming all reasonable creatures (<b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> have added, and those unreasonable) to obey God in everything; (within their spheres) and as much disbecoming them, to disobey him' (p. 8). 2.

5000|$|Onobox is a 1992 {{comprehensive}} 6-disc {{collection of}} Yoko Ono's work from 1968 to 1985. The discs are grouped by era and theme. Disc three features the entire Feeling the Space project, which was originally conceived and recorded as a double album before being edited down, while disc six is the previously unreleased 1974 album A Story, which was later reissued separately with an altered track listing, {{along with the}} rest of Ono's back catalogue. There was also an accompanying concise one-disc [...] "greatest hits" [...] release, entitled Walking on Thin Ice. While the Rykodisc press release for Onobox declared the collection [...] "not as bad as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> think", it <b>also</b> urged the public to [...] "smash your preconceptions".

30|$|I co-authored {{a book on}} {{that which}} I’m sure you’ve read. We tried to study the rules at Stanford University and understand, in a very {{quantitative}} way, what are the factors that produce changes (March et al. 2000). I’m not sure I can reproduce right now all of the results, but we asked questions like, “Is the change more likely if it is done more often? If a rule has changed more often in the past, is it more or less likely to change now? If a rule has changed recently, is it more or less likely to change now?” I think we found, in general, that the more often a rule has changed, {{the more likely it}} will change again. The more recently it changed, the less likely it was to change again. Those results are specific organizations and a specific set of rules, but it’s the kind of question <b>you</b> <b>might</b> want to ask. <b>You</b> <b>also</b> <b>might</b> want to ask, [although] it’s a little harder to ask quantitatively “What are the political conditions for rule change?” One of the things we observed was that rules changed when there were problems. Problems in an organization are often political. You get relatively large numbers of changes under conditions in which there are problems and then those changes and the rules have a certain dynamic of their own, subsequently.|$|R
