And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E

5000|$|Harris {{received}} her first call-up {{to the senior}} national team for a 12-day training camp held from September 21 to October 2, 2009. It was her first national team training camp since June 2006, when she trained with the U-21 before tearing her ACL. Of her first few days at camp, Harris stated: [...] I was very nervous at the beginning. I was very stiff, to say the least. But <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> an opportunity of a lifetime and I feel I'm playing well, and all I can ask for is {{to walk out of}} here knowing that I did what I was supposed to do. As far as what happens next, it's out of my control. I am just going to keep doing what I have been doing, training hard, and improving every day. [...] On September 7, 2010, United States women's national team head coach Pia Sundhage named a 30-player roster for two matches against China in October. The roster would then be narrowed down to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament. The players would take part in a training camp before the two matches starting on September 20. Although Harris was not one of the four goalkeepers on this preliminary roster, she was called into camp on September 23 to replace Hope Solo, who was recovering from a shoulder surgery. She was then named to the 24-player roster for the team's second match against China on October 6 in Philadelphia, although she did not dress for the match. She was not named to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament, but she did travel with the team to train.|$|E
5000|$|On February 27, 2008, {{more than}} four years removed from his time on The Howard Stern Show, Melendez was interviewed over the phone by Adam Carolla on his radio show with {{discussion}} of Melendez's 15 years as Stern's employee dominating the conversation. Carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money Melendez made considering he was down in the show's pecking order, behind Stern, Robin Quivers, Fred, Jackie, and Gary. Melendez revealed that his first salary on The Howard Stern Show in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to his disappointment, he only got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on E! in 1994. Asked explicitly by Carolla if, considering that the station manager Tom Chiusano would not increase his salary, he ever thought, hoped or expected that Stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would [...] "kick something down to him," [...] Melendez answered: [...] "Of course, Adam. I mean, listen, you know, I love Howard and all, but my biggest beef has always been on that show that, you know, they just don't take care of people financially... That bothered me... Well, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the thing, Howard always said that he doesn't want to get involved in people's salaries, but you know what, man, at some point I think you do... I didn't look at Howard bitterly then, but the only problem I had was, then when you would go out and do these ancillary gigs he would then be angry that you're doing them. And that's where it becomes a problem, because in other words he's saying: 'I'm not gonna pay you, I'm not responsible for your pay, but if you do these other gigs I'm not very happy with you to do them'".|$|E
