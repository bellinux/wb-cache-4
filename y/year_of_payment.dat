5000|$|In Welch v. De Blois, 1 Cir., 1938, 94 F.2d 842, {{this court}} allowed a cash method {{taxpayer}} {{to make a}} full deduction of insurance premiums in the year he paid them as an ordinary and necessary business expense, {{despite the fact that}} the insurance covered a three-year period. However, this court is unable to find a basis for distinguishing the prepayment of rentals, bonuses for the acquisition of leases, bonuses for the cancellation of leases, commissions for negotiating leases - all of which need to be prorated over the time period - and prepaid insurance. This court can cite no justification for treating prepaid insurance in a different manner than treating other prepayments. To permit the taxpayer to take a full deduction in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> would distort his income. Moreover, prepaid insurance may be easily allocable. The insurance premium represents the protection of the property for the entire period, and the taxpayer may surrender the insurance policy at any time. Therefore, the insurance is clearly an asset having a longer life than a single taxable year. [...] Furthermore, by treating prepaid insurance as a capital expense, we are obtaining some degree of consistency. We therefore overrule Welch v. De Blois and hold that prepaid insurance deductions must be allocable over the time period for which the policy covers.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the income tax significance to the insider of his payment in satisfaction of a liability arising under section 16 (b). Such taxpayers have usually sought a deduction against ordinary income in the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> When the issue was first raised, the deduction was denied. Section 16 (b) liability was held {{to be in the}} nature of a penalty; allowance of the deduction, it was found, 2 ̆ 2 would weaken an effective method of enforcing the sharply defined policy expressed in sectin 16 (b) [...] 2 ̆ 2 In 1961 the Internal Revenue Service modified its earlier position by ruling that section 16 (b) is not a penal provision. The purpose of the section, the ruling stated, is merely to remove all profit from the insider 2 ̆ 7 s transactions, thereby placing him in the position he would have occupied had he not traded. Allowance of the deduction was held consistent with this purpose. The ruling concluded: 2 ̆ 2 The income tax significance of the capital stock dealings giving rise to the payment determines whether it is deductible as an ordinary loss or as a capital loss. 2 ̆ 2 The Tax Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent refusal to accept this limitation upon the deduction reognized by the ruling gives renewed interest to the topic...|$|E

In 2014, the debt was again restructured in an attempt to get improved interest rates, improved debt ratings, and in the process save 44 million in debt repayment.

The Ottoman Empire did not demand any financial compensation from Bulgaria, which took over the railways run by the Oriental Railway Company and the taxes in Eastern Rumelia. Russia cancelled forty <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> the Ottomans owed on the indemnity for the war of 1877-78. This amounted to 125,000,000 francs (out of a total indemnity of 802,000,000 francs). In turn Bulgaria agreed to transfer its tribute payments—85,000,000 francs over 85 years—to Russia.|$|R

Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas <b>of</b> that financial <b>year.</b> However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled.
