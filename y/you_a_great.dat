[...] Also in {{an interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Avril Lavigne spoke about being included on the song, saying, [...] "It was really exciting because 'I'm With You' is one of my favorite songs that I've done, I always love performing it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for TV Squad, writer Richard Keller gave the episode a mixed to {{positive}} review, calling the installment [...] "pretty unique", {{but that it}} also had its flaws. He enjoyed {{the fact that the}} episode revealed the relationship between Shawn and Henry, that it [...] "reflects the relationship many of us have with our own fathers". He also enjoyed the [...] "fleshing out" [...] of Gus's character, that [...] "we now see Gus as quite the brainiac" [...] and [...] "rather than saying nothing but 'No, Shawn'... Gus actually contributes quite a bit to this episode". However, Keller also criticized parts of the episode, saying that he disliked the [...] "whole fake psychic concept". Keller also criticized Timothy Omundson's character Carlton Lassiter, saying [...] "he just doesn't fit into the whole show", and [...] "Omundson's makes Lassiter look like a cartoon character". In a comment for TV Guide, the show was called [...] "a diamond in the rough", and writer Matt Roush called star James Roday [...] "a delight". The episode was included in Yahoo! TV's list of the nerdiest episodes of Psych. Reviewer Tucker Cummings said that [...] "the wordplay in this episode great" [...] and that [...] "it gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> insight into how Gus and Shawn's friendship has functioned (or dysfunctioned) over the years". In addition, she said that the episode's murder-mystery plot [...] "is actually really engrossing" [...] when compared to later episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars and praised it as [...] "a {{skillful}} thriller", saying that Deep Blue Sea [...] "is essentially one well-done action sequence after another [...] It doesn't linger on the special effects (some of the sharks look like cartoons), but it knows how to use timing, suspense, quick movement and [...] surprise". He concluded that the film keeps spectators guessing in an otherwise predictable genre. In a positive review, Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times considered Deep Blue Sea a return to form for Harlin, especially after the [...] "dismal swamps" [...] of Cutthroat Island and The Long Kiss Goodnight. He described the film as [...] "an example of how expert action filmmaking and up-to-the-minute visual effects can transcend a workmanlike script and bring excitement to conventional genre material". Similarly, Desson Howe of The Washington Post remarked that, while the film's premise feels familiar, it [...] "knows its audience and knows what'll get them going – and even wondering". He said that Deep Blue Sea might not be Harlin's finest two hours, but he managed to build [...] "something that, if nothing else, gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> big shock every few minutes". In a three-and-a-half out of four review, Robert Lasowski of The Florida Times-Union highly praised the film's pacing, intense action, and chase scenes, stating that Deep Blue Sea is [...] "a great popcorn movie" [...] and [...] "what summer at the cineplex is all about".|$|E

Director George Cukor once summed up her {{contributions to the}} film media when he said to her, [...] "Do you know what I especially love about you, Ingrid, my dear?

2500|$|The Passover Haggadah, in the magid {{section of}} the Seder, reports that Israel [...] "went down to Egypt – forced {{to do so by}} the word ," [...] and some {{commentators}} explain that this statement refers to God's reassurance to Jacob in [...] to [...] "fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> nation. I will go down with you into Egypt." [...] Shortly thereafter, the Haggadah quotes [...] for the proposition that Israel did not go down to Egypt to settle, but only to stay temporarily.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, God told Moses what the people had done, saying [...] "let Me be, that My anger may blaze forth against them and that I may destroy them, and make of <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> nation." [...] But Moses implored God not to do so, lest the Egyptians say that God delivered the people only to kill them off in the mountains. Moses called on God to remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and God's oath to make their offspring as numerous as the stars, and God renounced the planned punishment. The fifth open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the English Civil War therefore, {{publishers}} and writers remained answerable to the law. [...] State {{control of the}} press was tightened in the Licensing Order of 1643, but although the new regime was arguably as restrictive as the monopoly that the Stationers' Company once enjoyed, parliament was unable to control the number of renegade presses that flourished during the Interregnum. [...] The freedoms ensured by the Bill of Rights 1689 led indirectly to the refusal in 1695 of the Parliament of England to renew the Licensing of the Press Act 1662, a law which required all printing presses to be licensed by Parliament. [...] This lapse led to a freer press, and {{a rise in the}} volume of printed matter. [...] Jonathan Swift wrote to a friend in New York, [...] "I could send <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of news from the Republica Grubstreetaria, which was never in greater altitude." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Zohar {{compared}} Moses to Noah {{and found}} Moses superior. [...] For when God told Moses in [...] “Now therefore let me alone, that My anger may grow hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> nation,” Moses immediately {{asked whether he}} could possibly abandon Israel for his own advantage. [...] Moses protested {{that the world would}} say that he had killed Israel and did to them as Noah did to his generation. [...] For when God bade Noah to save himself and his household from the Flood, Noah did not intercede on behalf of his generation, but let them perish. [...] It {{is for this reason that}} Scripture names the waters of the Flood after Noah, as [...] says, “For this is as the waters of Noah to me.” Thus, Moses sought mercy for his people, and God indeed showed them mercy.|$|E
2500|$|Singing differs {{by region}} in {{that a high}} falsetto {{is used in the}} north while in the south a lower range is used. [...] "To the {{unfamiliar}} listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend," [...] and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European musics may {{have much to do with}} that difficulty. However, [...] "to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend" [...] while dancers react to changes in the structure of the melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, [...] "If you give me a stink song, I'll dance stink. If you give me good music, I'll give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> show," [...] implying that one can appreciate the music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone. But others say that today's contemporary contest dancers are expected to dance their best no matter how well or poor the drum group is that is singing for their contest. Generally, Native American singing follows a pentatonic scale (as if playing only the black keys on a piano) and while, to the outsider, it may sound like we're just pounding a drum and going [...] "Heya-heya-heya-heya" [...] sometimes there are actual words in Cree, Pikuni, Lushuutsid, Niimipuu, Lakhota, Sahpatin, Salish, Ojibwemowin or many other Native languages.|$|E
