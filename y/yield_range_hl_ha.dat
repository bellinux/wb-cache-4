Objectives: This research looks at the formant bandwidth of people with profound hearing-impairment (HL) compared to people with normal hearing (NH) to see the difference in articulation of vowels. Methods: Forty adults participated in this study: 20 with HL and 20 with NH. They were asked to read 7 Korean vowels five times each (/a, ʌ, o, u, ɯ, i, ɛ/) and their speech was analyzed by Praat to obtain formant bandwidths B 1, B 2, and B 3 —B 1 is the bandwidth of the first formant, B 2 is bandwidth of second formant, and B 3 is bandwidth of third formant. Results: The analysis showed that in B 1 the <b>HL</b> group <b>had</b> wider formant bandwidth range than the NH group. <b>HL</b> males <b>had</b> a wider range across all vowels, the women in the vowels /i, o, u / only.

There were significant differences among lines and varieties.

5000|$|The House of Lords {{considered}} whether <b>HL</b> <b>had</b> been unlawfully detained {{under the}} common law. They heard {{evidence that the}} ruling of the Court of Appeal might mean several {{tens of thousands of}} patients would have to be detained under the Mental Health Act. They considered that this might excessively stigmatise informal patients and have dire resource implications due to the costs of administering the Mental Health Act. In assessing whether <b>HL</b> <b>had</b> been detained, they concluded by a majority verdict that he had not been detained in the meaning of the common law tort of false imprisonment because there must be actual and not just potential restraint to engage the tort. Some commentators have suggested this reasoning might be at odds with other false imprisonment precedents. [...] Lord Steyn dissented from this aspect of the judgment, stating that the Trust's argument that HL, not being formally detained, was always free to go 'stretched credulity to breaking point' and was 'a fairytale'. Unanimously their Lordships also held that even if <b>HL</b> <b>had</b> been found to have been detained, it would have been justified under the common law doctrine of necessity. Although concurring with this finding, Lord Steyn commented that this was an 'unfortunate' result as it left compliant but incapacitated patients without the safeguards of patients detained formally under the Mental Health Act.|$|R

According to the recent final analysis of the HD 10 trial for patients with early-favourable HL, a radiation dose of 20 Gy to the involved lymph node areas preceded by short-term chemotherapy (ABVD x 2) is the standard for these patients. An extensive radiotherapy quality assurance program, performed by the GHSG radiotherapy reference centre in Cologne, has proven to be successful and necessary to ensure that with reduced radiation doses and volumes a precise treatment, as defined by the protocol, can be performed by the participating radiotherapy departments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{circular}} tunnel is {{a common}} structure in civil engineering.

The applicability formulas is gained based on the critical pressures, which can be obtained in other situations or strength thoeries simplified by assuming the parameter value in the formula. An example is analyzed, and the <b>yield</b> <b>range</b> versus the inner pressure and stress distribution are presented.
