30|$|Making {{deductions}} {{and expectations}} about climate {{has been a}} challenge all through mankind’s history. Challenges with exact meteorological directions assist to foresee and handle problems well in time. Different strategies have been investigated using various machine learning techniques in reported forecasting systems. Current research investigates climate as a major challenge for machine information mining and deduction. Accordingly, this paper presents a hybrid neural model (MLP and RBF) to enhance the accuracy of weather forecasting. Proposed hybrid model ensure precise forecasting due to the specialty of climate anticipating frameworks. The study concentrates on the data representing Saudi Arabia weather forecasting. The main input features employed to train individual and hybrid neural networks that include average dew point, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature, average relative moistness, precipitation, normal wind speed, high wind speed and average cloudiness. The output layer composed of two neurons to represent rainy and dry weathers. Moreover, trial and error approach is adopted to select an appropriate number of inputs to the hybrid neural network. Correlation coefficient, RMSE and scatter index are the standard <b>yard</b> <b>sticks</b> adopted for forecast accuracy measurement. On individual standing MLP forecasting results are better than RBF, however, the proposed simplified hybrid neural model comes out with better forecasting accuracy as compared to both individual networks. Additionally, results are better than reported {{in the state of}} art, using a simple neural structure that reduces training time and complexity.|$|E

40|$|Background: Primary {{cemented}} {{total hip arthroplasty}} is {{a procedure}} for non-traumatic and traumatic affections of the hip. Long term follow-up is required to assess the longevity of the implant and establish the procedure. Indo-Asian literature on long term result of total hip arthroplasty is sparse. We present a 10 -year follow-up of our patients of primary cemented total hip arthroplasty. Materials and Methods: We operated 31 hips in 30 patients with primary cemented total hip arthroplasty. We followed the cases for a minimum period of 10 years with a mean follow-up period of 12. 7 years. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 60. 7 years (range 37 - 82 yrs) male to female ratio was 2 : 1. The clinical diagnoses included - avascular necrosis of femoral head (n= 15), sero positive rheumatoid arthritis (n= 5), seronegative spondylo-arthropathy (n= 4), neglected femoral neck fractures (n= 3), healed tubercular arthritis (n= 2) and post traumatic osteoarthritis of hip (n= 2). The prostheses used were cemented Charnley&#x 2032;s total hip (n= 12) and cemented modular prosthesis (n= 19). The results were assessed according to Harris hip score and radiographs taken at yearly intervals. Results: The mean follow-up is 12. 7 yrs (range 11 - 16 yrs) Results in all operated patients showed marked improvement in Harris hip score from preoperative mean 29. 2 to 79. 9 at 10 years or more followup. However, the non-inflammatory group showed more sustained long term improvement as compared to the inflammatory group, as revealed by the Harris hip score. Mean blood loss was 450 ml (&# 177; 3. 7 ml), mean transfusion rate was 1. 2 units (&# 177;. 3). The complications were hypotension (n= 7), shortening&# 62; 1. 5 cm (n= 9), superficial infection (n= 2) and malposition of prosthesis (n= 1). Conclusion: The needs of Indian Asian patients, vary from what is discussed in literature. The pain tolerance is greater than western population and financial constraints are high.

40|$|This study {{examines}} local authority residential and day {{care for the}} mentally ill in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Fieldwork was undertaken between 1 st November 1978 and 31 st December 1979. The first part of the study traces the development of the services from the 1959 Mental Health Act to 1979. It demonstrates {{the way in which the}} Council responded rapidly to Government prescription for policy making. The Authority developed an extensive service more rapidly than did most other comparable local authorities. The second section investigates characteristics of the staff and clients. Most basic grade staffs were lacking in training and relevant work experience and came from the manual working class. Many senior staff had transferred from nursing. Most clients were over 49 and came from the unskilled working class. The sample comprised of similar numbers of male and female clients. Only half the clients had a recent history of psychiatric hospitalisation, but the majority were diagnosed as suffering from chronic mental illnesses. Clients had been referred for services primarily because of difficulties with inter-personal relationships, or in caring for themselves. The aims of the units are examined (as understood by management, staff and clients). The process of communication of aims is analysed, thus exploring the policy making process, the extent to which the theory of Management by Objectives operated and providing performance <b>yard</b> <b>sticks.</b> Communication was best effected through regular staff meetings and better educated senior staff. Aims commonly identified by staff and clients embraced enhancement of personal relationship skills improvement of self-care and preventing psychiatric hospitalisation.

It culminates in a cost-effectiveness study and comparison of costs of hospital and social services care. Aims which were best attained concerned personal relationships within the unit and prevention of hospitalisation. Poor attainment was acknowledged for most aims external to units. There was a positive relationship between the sharing of aims between clients and staff and client's perception of success. Costs were similar in like units and bore no relationship to achievement...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{general risk}} {{measures}} have {{played an important}} role in risk management in both finance and insurance industry. As a consequence, there is an increasing number of research on optimal reinsurance problems using risk measures as <b>yard</b> <b>sticks</b> beyond the classical expected utility framework. In this thesis, the stop-loss reinsurance is first shown to be an optimal contract under law-invariant convex risk measures via a new simple geometric argument. This similar approach is then used to tackle the same optimal reinsurance problem under Value at Risk and Conditional Tail Expectation; it is interesting to note that, instead of stop-loss reinsurances, insurance layers serve as the optimal solution in these cases. These two results hint that law-invariant convex risk measure may be better and more robust to expected larger claims than Value at Risk and Conditional Tail Expectation even though they are more commonly used. In addition, the problem of optimal reinsurance design for a basket of n insurable risks is studied. Without assuming any particular dependence structure, a minimax optimal reinsurance decision formulation for the problem has been successfully proposed. To solve it, the least favorable dependence structure is first identified, and then the stop-loss reinsurances are shown to minimize a general law-invariant convex risk measure of the total retained risk. Sufficient condition for ordering the optimal deductibles are also obtained. Next, a Principal-Agent model is adopted to describe a monopolistic reinsurance market with adverse selection. Under the asymmetry of information, the reinsurer (the principal) aims to maximize the average profit by selling a tailor-made reinsurance to every insurer (agent) from a (huge) family with hidden characteristics. In regard to Basel Capital Accord, each insurer uses Value at Risk as the risk assessment, and also takes the right to choose different risk tolerances. By utilizing the special features of insurance layers, their optimality as the first-best strategy over all feasible reinsurances is proved. Also, the same optimal reinsurance screening problem is studied under other subclass of reinsurances: (i) deductible contracts; (ii) quota-share reinsurances; and (iii) reinsurance contracts with convex indemnity, with the aid of indirect utility functions. In particular, the optimal indirect utility function is shown to be of the stop-loss form under both classes (i) and (ii); while on the other hand, its non-stop-loss nature under class (iii) is revealed. Lastly, a class of nonzero-sum stochastic differential reinsurance games between two insurance companies is studied. Each insurance company is assumed to maximize the difference of the opponent’s terminal surplus from that of its own by properly arranging its reinsurance schedule. The surplus process of each insurance company is modeled by a mixed regime-switching Cramer-Lundberg approximation. It is a diffusion risk process with coefficients being modulated by both a continuous-time finite-state Markov Chain and another diffusion process; and correlations among these surplus processes are allowed. In contrast to the traditional HJB approach, BSDE method is used and an explicit Nash equilibrium is derived. published_or_final_versionMathematicsMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
