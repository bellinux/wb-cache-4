40|$|We present {{altitude}} dependent lifetimes of NO x, determined with MIPAS/ENVISAT, for {{the southern}} polar region after the solar proton event in October–November 2003. Varying in latitude and decreasing in altitude they range from about two days at 64 km to about 20 days at 44 km. The lifetimes are controlled by transport, mixing and photolysis. We infer dynamical lifetimes by comparison of the observed decay to photolytical lifetimes calculated with the SLIMCAT 3 -D Model. Photochemical loss contributes to the observed NO x depletion by 10 % at 44 km, increasing with altitude to 35 % at 62 km at a latitude of – 63 ° S.

40|$|The present problem {{arises from}} a {{consideration}} {{of some of the}} experimental and theoretical results which were obtained previously, some of which will now be briefly mentioned. Fission fragment mass distributions which were derived from data obtained from double ionization chambers using argon plus carbon dioxide gases disagree with those obtained by means of radiochemical analysis of the fission products. Fission fragment velocity distributions which were also derived from double ionization chamber data disagree with those obtained from a direct measurement of velocities. Further, these double ionization chamber measurements of the total kinetic energy of fission give lower values than those estimated from calorimetric measurements. These disagreements are explained by assuming the W (average energy <b>per</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pair)</b> values of fission fragments stopped in an ionization chamber gas are of the order of 5 percent larger than those for alpha particles which were used as the basis to calculate fission energies. On the basis that fission fragments lost greater percentages of initial energy through elastic collisions and that recoil argon gas atoms had reduced ionization efficiencies, a theoretical calculation in terms of an ionization defect appeared to justify this viewpoint.

This type of irradiation leads to the generation of nanometer-sized tracks around the ion trajectory. In situ optical reflection measurements during systematic irradiation of silica samples allowed us to monitor the irradiation-induced compaction, whereas ex situ optical absorption measurements provide information on colour centre generation. In order to analyse the results, we have developed and validated an atomistic model able to quantitatively explain the experimental results.

We show the collapse of all Ttr values into a single master curve when plotted against the ratio of water molecules <b>per</b> intrinsic (PAH+-PAA-) <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> for all pH values explored.

In this paper the influence of electron emission from the wall (i. e. of an ''active'' surface) on the parameter of the space charge sheath is investigated, applying simple balance equations, as a first step towards an explanation of the transition from a homogeneous into an inhomogeneous {{boundary layer}}. Several variations of such models are calculated, using typical plasma parameters. Essential result is the dependence of the sheath potential and of the surface power density on the emission yield and on the net current density. Irrespective of the chosen constants the potential drop between plasma and wall turns out to become the higher the lower is the electron emission and the higher is the net current. Opposite is the dependence of the energy flux to the wall which, however, passes a minimum and increases rapidly again near the maximum net current j_m_a_x (with j_m_a_x#approx#j_i_s(#gamma#- 1), where j_i_s=ion saturation current, and #gamma#=emission <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>ion).</b> As a consequence, the wall loading is strongly enhanced as well in case of high negative net currents and intense electron emission, as near the maximum net current.

Although numerous three-dimensional structures show <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> at functionally important sites of biological macromolecules and their complexes, the physicochemical properties of the <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> are not well understood. Crystal structures typically show a single state for each <b>ion</b> <b>pair.</b> However, recent studies have revealed the dynamic nature of the <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> of the biological macromolecules. Biomolecular <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> undergo dynamic transitions between distinct states in which the charged moieties are either in direct contact or separated by water. This dynamic behavior is reasonable {{in light of the}} fundamental concepts that were established for small ions over the last century. In this review, we introduce the physicochemical concepts relevant to the <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> and provide an overview of the recent advancement in biophysical research on the <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> of biological macromolecules...|$|R
40|$|Constrained {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{have been used}} to investigate <b>ion</b> <b>pairing</b> in water - DMSO mixtures. The potentials of mean force between the sodium - chloride <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> are constructed by estimating the mean forces between the <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> at various interionic separations and then integrating the mean forces. Two compositions of the solvent mixture with DMSO mole fractions of 0. 21 and 0. 35 are considered. Two model potentials for water and DMSO have been considered. One of the main observations is that the contact <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> which is dominantly present in both the individual solvents is conspicuously absent in the mixture compositions studied. While solvent separated <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> dominate in all the mixture compositions, there is a presence of a second solvent separated <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> in the water-DMSO mixture of composition with mole fraction of DMSO = 0. 21. The potentials of mean force are verified by dynamical trajectories of the <b>ion</b> <b>pair.</b> The dynamics of the solvation shells has also been investigated in detail...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of the Na+-Cl- <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> in DMSO {{have been performed}} to obtain the potential of mean force (PMF) and the mean force between the Na+ and the Cl- ions at room temperature. The reaction field method {{has been used to}} estimate the effect of the long-range interactions. The results obtained are compared with the reported potential of mean force of Na+-Cl- <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> in water. The mean force potential in DMSO shows that the contact <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> (CIP) is much stabler than the solvent-separated <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> (SSIP), whereas in water, the SSIP is as stable as the CIP. The barrier for crossing from the contact <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> to the solvent-separated <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> in DMSO is much larger than the corresponding value in water, whereas the barriers for crossing from the SSIP to the CIP are similar in both these solvents. The density profiles of all the interaction sites around the <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> at the first minimum in the PMF have also been presented...|$|R
50|$|The solvent and the {{counterion}} (the gegen ion) have {{a significant}} effect on the rate of propagation. The counterion and the carbenium ion can have different associations according to intimate <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> theory; ranging from a covalent bond, tight <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> (unseparated), solvent-separated <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> (partially separated), and free ions (completely dissociated).|$|R
40|$|First, it {{is shown}} that the {{creation}} of the spinless <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> in the lattice, which are hold by the binding with neighbor <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> together regarded as covalent. These <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> are created by the repulsive potential interaction of two ions which is bound as linear oscillator. The repulsive S-wave scattering between <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> and electrons is transformed to the attractive effective interaction between electrons which leads to a creation of electron pairs by a binding energy depending on the condensate fraction of <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> N 0. In this respect, the absence of <b>ion</b> <b>pairs</b> in the condensate N destroys a binding energy of electron pairs and in turn so-called superconductimg phase. As new result presented theory is that the number of the superconducting bosons is not changed in the superconducting phase. PACS: 78. 20. Ci 1 1. Introduction...|$|R
40|$|Solvation {{structures}} of Na+-Cl- <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> are investigated in acetonitrile (AN) -dimethylformamide (DMF) isodielectric mixtures. The potentials of mean force of Na+-Cl- {{in the five}} compositions of mixtures show minima corresponding to a contact <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> (CIP) and a solvent-shared <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> (SShIP). The solvent-separated <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> minima are present in lower mole fractions of AN (x(AN) <= 0. 50). CIPs {{are found to be}} more stable than the SShIPs. From a thermodynamic decomposition of the potentials of mean force, we find that the formation of the <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> is entropically driven in these compositions. The most stable CIP is in pure AN. The local solvation structures around the <b>ion</b> <b>pair</b> are analysed through the running coordination numbers, excess coordination numbers, solvent orientational distributions and density profiles. We find that both Na+ and Cl- are preferentially solvated by DMF...|$|R
