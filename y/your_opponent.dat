5|$|I {{believe in}} all sincerity {{that if you}} do not deflate the {{opposition}} candidate before your own campaign gets started, the odds are you are doomed to defeat. I believe it is a smear to attack an individual on matters that have no relationship whatsoever to the campaign... {{but it is not a}} smear if you point out the record of <b>your</b> <b>opponent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kevin Nash went on {{to fight}} Monty Sopp, newly dubbed The Outlaw, in a First Blood match at Destination X, in which {{the only way to}} win is to make <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> bleed. The match was officially {{announced}} on the March 11 episode of Impact!. The Outlaw would claim victory in the match.|$|E
5|$|The feud between John Cena and Umaga {{continued}} on Raw the next night, where Umaga assaulted Cena after his match with The Great Khali and also interfered in Cena's match with Jonathan Coachman two weeks later. Due to the Umaga assault, Cena injured his spleen, which was portrayed as real in their storyline. At Royal Rumble, a Last Man Standing match, a match {{where the only}} way to win is to beat up <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> so much they can not get to their feet before the referee counts to ten was scheduled for the WWE Championship between Cena and Umaga. Cena won the match and retained his title, ending their rivalry.|$|E
50|$|Duke's {{coaching}} staff places a priority on ground ball statistics in their post-game reviews.

5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} object is to place <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> on a {{stretcher}} and wheel the stretcher across a finish line. The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher. Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher.|$|E

25|$|These {{counter-attack}} {{techniques are}} performed by executing a strike after responding or avoiding an attempted strike by <b>your</b> <b>opponent.</b> This {{can also be}} achieved by inducing the opponent to attack, then employing one of the oji-waza.|$|E

25|$|This {{provides}} a surprise attack, by lifting the shinai {{over your shoulder}} before striking. Here a skilful use of the kensen and spirited attack is crucial for effective katsugi-waza or luring <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> into breaking his/her posture.|$|E
25|$|If {{you have}} a choice between a fifteen-two or pairing, make the fifteen. This {{prevents}} <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> from scoring a possible three-of-a-kind. An exception to this strategy is if you can make a four of a kind.|$|E
25|$|The Liberal {{advertising}} {{strategy was}} highly risky. While conventional wisdom {{says the only}} way to successfully respond to a negative campaign is with even more negative ads against <b>your</b> <b>opponent,</b> McGuinty ran only positive ads {{for the duration of the}} campaign.|$|E

5000|$|Fateseal - Similar to the Scry ability from Fifth Dawn, Fateseal X {{lets you}} look at the top X cards of <b>your</b> <b>opponent's</b> library (as opposed to your own, as with Scry) and place the cards either at the bottom or the top of <b>your</b> <b>opponent's</b> library in any order you choose.|$|R

25|$|So it is {{said that}} if you know your enemies and know {{yourself}}, you will not be put at risk even in a hundred battles.If you only know yourself, but not <b>your</b> <b>opponent,</b> you may win or may lose.If you know neither yourself nor your enemy, you will always endanger yourself.|$|E
25|$|In Stoical Go, {{invented by}} {{abstract}} game designer Luis Bolaños Mures, standard ko rules don't apply. Instead, it's illegal {{to make a}} capture if <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> made a capture on the previous move. All other rules {{are the same as}} in Go. Suicide of one or more stones is not allowed, and area scoring is used.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} involves striking <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> as you realise he/she {{is about}} to strike. This is because their concentration will be on striking and their posture will have no flexibility to respond. Thus debana-waza is ideal. This can be to any part of your opponent's body, with valid strikes being: debana-men, debana-kote, and debana-tsuki.|$|E

25|$|Gin rummy, or Gin for short, is {{a simple}} and popular two-player card game with a {{standard}} 52-card pack. The objective of Gin Rummy is to score more points than <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> improving one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Gin rummy was invented by Elwood T. Baker and his son, C. Graham Baker in 1909.|$|E
25|$|With {{a bishop}} opening, it's common to {{exchange}} bishops by having one capture the other. This allows each player {{to put their}} newly captured bishop into play anywhere on the board, although {{care must be taken}} to avoid weaknesses in defense which may allow for a bishop drop. However, it is not advantageous to exchange bishops if <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> has a better defensive setup, or more lines of attack. Moreover, making a bishop exchange constitutes one turn loss, so it's not advised without a good reason.|$|E
25|$|First-class cricket {{also has}} a number of {{strategic}} elements not found in baseball, simply because the maximum time duration of the game is fixed (which can be up to five days for Test cricket) and a match not completed {{by the end of the}} time duration results in a draw regardless of the relative score (Although, in domestic competitions a 1st innings lead is beneficial a team's final standings). By contrast, baseball games are played to completion regardless of the time duration and there is no possibility for a tie or draw (with the exception of certain exhibition games such as the MLB All-Star Game, or in the case of Japan, where games are declared ties after 12 innings). There are no equivalents in baseball of, for example, deciding when to declare or whether or not to make <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> follow on.|$|E

25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics {{that you had to}} offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|E
500|$|After the match, {{the final}} contest in the [...] "Redneck Triathlon" [...] was held. Originally it was {{supposed}} to be a singing contest, though both men agreed to change it into a pigpen contest, where the objective was to throw <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> into a pigpen. Austin threw Bischoff into a pigpen set up near the Bad Blood entrance stage, thus Austin won the triathlon 2–1.|$|E
500|$|At the event, John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) {{defeated}} Eddie Guerrero {{to begin}} his first reign as WWE Champion, which would last nearly ten months. JBL began feuding with The Undertaker following the event, and the two faced off for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam. JBL won the match and retained the title after Undertaker was disqualified for hitting JBL with the title belt. The two faced off again at No Mercy in a Last Ride match, in which {{the objective is to}} place <b>your</b> <b>opponent</b> in a hearse and drive out of the arena. JBL defeated The Undertaker and concluded their storyline after interference from Heidenreich.|$|E

The {{first is}} for {{moving to the}} next waza after a failed first strike, and the second holds <b>your</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{attention}} and posture to create the suki for a second strike. The former requires a continuous rhythm of correct strikes. The latter requires continuous execution of waza, {{to take advantage of}} <b>your</b> <b>opponent's</b> suki.|$|R
