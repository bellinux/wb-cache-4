"I {{have always}} resented that jarring unattractive name [...] for <b>years.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first plied paddle across the gunwale {{of a light}} canoe and idled about the margin, I named the {{sheltered}} little cove Lost Lagoon. This was just to please my own fancy for, as that perfect summer month drifted on, the ever restless tides left the harbor devoid of any water at my favorite conoeing hour and my pet idling place was lost for many days; hence my fancy to call it Lost Lagoon.|$|E
2500|$|Under his {{captaincy}} in 1939, Surrey made {{an excellent}} start, but then faded to finish eighth, having been third the previous season. Nevertheless, his Wisden obituary is complimentary about his leadership. He {{is described as}} displaying [...] "a touch of unorthodoxy {{in the tradition of}} Percy Fender". He was liked by the professional players, showing no sign of any amateur aloofness. According to David Lemmon, he wrote: [...] "For myself, I loved every moment of 1939 and other <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> played for Surrey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some dancers {{themselves}} {{make this}} historical connection. [...] "When I do the dances, {{it reminds me}} of my younger <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was doing similar dances during the Cultural Revolution," [...] a retired driver in her mid-60s told the Los Angeles Times in 2014. [...] "I feel the same kind of spirit and emotions." [...] Another woman, whose troupe used the [...] "red songs" [...] written during that era, was more political.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} conducted by Contemporary Authors, Terpening said: “My desire to create imaginary worlds through fiction springs, as I suspect {{it does for}} most writers, from a love of reading. From early grade school <b>years,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was given my first books (most still in my library today) and when I lived one house away from the public library in Gresham, Oregon (where I {{spent most of my}} free time), to the present, when I teach Italian literature for a living, my addiction has been not to candy, rock 'n' roll, TV, drugs, sex, or gambling, but to the book—both as an artifact and as a source of delight, a distraction from the constraints of life. A good book carries you away and never lets you down.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Zhou Yu {{personally}} welcomed Jiang Gan {{and told}} him, [...] "Ziyi, you tried hard. You travelled {{all the way}} here just to be {{a spokesman for the}} Caos?"

Are you suspecting my intentions when you called me a 'spokesman'?" [...] Zhou Yu said, [...] "I may not be as good as the musicians of ancient times, but I still know how to appreciate a beautiful piece of music." [...] Zhou Yu then invited Jiang Gan to dine with him. After the meal, before he left, Zhou Yu told Jiang Gan, [...] "I've something confidential to attend to, and I need to leave now.

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{seems to}} have {{genuinely}} loved Regine {{but was unable to}} reconcile the prospect of marriage with his vocation as a writer, his passionate, introspective Christianity and his constant melancholy. [...] Regine was shattered by his rejection of her, and was unwilling to accept Kierkegaard's breaking of their engagement, threatening to kill herself if he did not take her back. [...] Kierkegaard attempted to quell her interest, he later wrote, [...] "there was nothing else for me to do but to venture to the uttermost, to support her, if possible, by means of deception, to do everything to repel her from me in order to rekindle her pride." [...] He wrote her cold, calculated letters {{in order to make it}} seem that he didn't love her anymore, but Regine clung to the hope that they would get back together, desperately pleading to him to take her back. [...] On October 11, 1841, Kierkegaard met with her and again broke off the engagement in person. [...] Her father tried to persuade him to reconsider after assessing Regine's desperate condition, claiming that [...] "It will be the death of her; she is in total despair" [...] Kierkegaard returned the next day and spoke with Regine. To her query as to whether he would ever marry, Kierkegaard icily responded: [...] "Well, yes, in ten <b>years,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have begun to simmer down and I need a lusty young miss to rejuvenate me." [...] In reality, Kierkegaard had no such plans, and would remain a celibate bachelor for the rest of his life.|$|E
