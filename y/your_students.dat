60|$|DEAR BRANDER,--I haven't {{been out}} of my bed for four weeks, but--well, I have been reading, a good deal, and {{it occurs to me}} to ask you to sit down, some time or other when you have 8 or 9 months to spare, and jot me down a certain few {{literary}} particulars for my help and elevation.

6000|$|Or again, {{you might}} {{entrance}} <b>your</b> <b>students</b> still, had you concentrated your attention on Mrs. Rushworth, who eloped with Henrv Crawford. These {{should have been}} the chief figures of 'Mansfield Park.' But you timidly decline to tackle Passion. 'Let other pens,' you write, 'dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can.' Ah, there is the secret of your failure! Need I add that the vulgarity and narrowness of the social circles you describe impair your popularity? I scarce remember more than one lady of title, and but very few lords (and these unessential) in all your tales. Now, when we all wish to be in society, we demand plenty of titles in our novels, at any rate, and we get lords (and very queer lords) even from Republican authors, born in a country which in your time was not renowned for its literature. I have heard a critic remark, with a decided air of fashion, on the brevity of the notice which your characters give each other when they offer invitations to dinner. 'An invitation to dinner next day was despatched,' and this demonstrates that your acquaintance 'went out' very little, and had but few engagements. How vulgar, too, is one of your heroines, who bids Mr. Darcy 'keep his breath to cool his porridge.' I blush for Elizabeth! It were superfluous to add that your characters are debased by being invariably mere members of the Church of England as by law established. The Dissenting enthusiast, the open soul that glides from Esoteric Buddhism to the Salvation Army, and from the Higher Pantheism to the Higher Paganism, we look for in vain among your studies of character. Nay, the very words I employ are of unknown sound to you; so how can you help us in the stress of the soul's travailings? ...|$|E

Whether a student chooses to work, attend college, join the military, or explore other kinds of learning in an interim year, there are many factors that go into the decision. This is a guide to that planning process. We are pleased to introduce Family Connection, a web-based service designed especially for students and families. Family Connection is a comprehensive website that <b>your</b> <b>student</b> will be using to research and make plans regarding their future aspirations. Family Connection is linked with Naviance Succeed, a service that we use in our office to manage the college application process. We also use Naviance to track and analyze data about college and career plans, so it provides up-to-date information that is specific to our school. Family Connection/Naviance will allow <b>your</b> <b>student</b> to: • Get involved in the planning process- build a resume, complete on-line surveys, and manage timelines and deadlines for making decisions about colleges and careers. • Research colleges- Use college search/match capabilities to find colleges that meet criteria the student sets.
