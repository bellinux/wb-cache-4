500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy called Doctor Strange [...] "an engaging, smartly {{cast and}} {{sporadically}} eye-popping addition" [...] to the franchise, adding [...] "this action movie ostensibly {{rooted in the}} mind-expanding tenets of Eastern mysticism is different enough to establish a solid niche alongside the blockbuster combine's established money machines." [...] McCarthy, in addition to praising the acting, felt that there were certain sequences that [...] "go far beyond [...] in visual spectacle" [...] and that the time manipulation sequences, [...] "seen to outstanding advantage in 3D, [...] mind-trip-seeking audiences back in Doctor Strange's origin days would have called 'far-out' but today's fans will simply deem 'amazing'." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety called the film [...] "Marvel’s most satisfying entry since Spider-Man 2," [...] and wrote that despite having [...] "the same look, feel, and fancy corporate sheen" [...] as the other MCU films, it [...] "boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from the increasingly cookie-cutter comic-book realm of late." [...] Debruge also praised the casting along with the multitude of visual effects the film was able to achieve. Alonso Duralde, reviewing for TheWrap said, [...] "True, Doctor Strange is an origin story, and occasionally hemmed in by the genre's narrative requirements, but it's smart enough to bring in great British actors to make the predictable paces and life lessons feel fresh and fascinating." [...] Regarding the film's visuals, Duralde praised them, exclaiming, [...] "In a year where bloated, empty spectacles have induced a crushing level of CG fatigue, this funny, freaky adventure reminds us of how effective VFX can be when they've got some imagination behind them." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "The giddily enjoyable Doctor Strange... is part of Marvel's strategy for world domination, yet it's also so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>even</b> briefly forget the brand. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Within the familiar narrative contours of the origin story, writer-director Scott Derrickson crams in enough out-of-body experiences, spatial-temporal shenanigans and dazzlingly kaleidoscopic visuals to make you wonder if he and his co-writers ... were dropping acid behind the scenes." ...|$|E
