Integrating the dq/dp～η curve numerically, the η-U_p(η) relationship was obtained, by which a family of <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> was constructed.

25|$|There is {{no single}} <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> {{describing}} the cost of money for everybody. The {{most important factor in}} determining a <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the <b>yield</b> <b>curve.</b> Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their creditworthiness. The yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government bond <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> (government curve). Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.|$|E

25|$|A bond's {{market value}} at {{different}} times in its life can be calculated. When the <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> is steep, the bond is predicted to have a large capital gain {{in the first years}} before falling in price later. When the <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> is flat, the capital gain is predicted to be much less, and there is little variability in the bond's total returns over time.|$|E
25|$|Adjustable rate {{mortgages}} are typically, but not always, {{less expensive}} than fixed-rate mortgages. Due to the inherent interest rate risk, long-term fixed rates will tend {{to be higher than}} short-term rates (which are the basis for variable-rate loans and mortgages). The difference in interest rates between short and long-term loans is known as the <b>yield</b> <b>curve,</b> which generally slopes upward (longer terms are more expensive). The opposite circumstance is known as an inverted <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> and is relatively infrequent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> {{may also}} be flat or hump-shaped, due to {{anticipated}} interest rates being steady, or short-term volatility outweighing long-term volatility.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a study on}} the least-squares construction of the <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> for Italian government securities from 1957 to 1967. The author provides a general introduction to the Italian financial system and the initial results, before considering the technical aspects. In the first section of the paper a brief outline of the Italian bond market is provided, so as to give the reader a brief knowledge of the institutional system in Italy. The main features of the estimated <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> are then detailed and some implications of the data are considered with regard to recent attempts of the monetary authorities to prevent the increase in interest rates. Some general considerations are made before the free-hand interpolation of Durand’s “basic yields” and the U. S. treasury securities curves is considered. The linear interpolation of Grant’s British government securities <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> is then assessed. Finally, the method for least-squares interpolation is explained before the regression model used for Italian B. T. P. and the resulting estimated <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> are presented.   JEL: G 12, H 63, E 43 </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{opposite}} position (short-term {{interest rates}} higher than long-term) can also occur. For instance, in November 2004, the <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> for UK Government bonds was partially inverted. The yield for the 10-year bond stood at 4.68%, but was only 4.45% for the 30-year bond. The market's anticipation of falling interest rates causes such incidents. Negative liquidity premiums can also exist if long-term investors dominate the market, but the prevailing {{view is that}} a positive liquidity premium dominates, so only the anticipation of falling interest rates will cause an inverted <b>yield</b> <b>curve.</b> Strongly inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic depressions.|$|E
25|$|Bonds {{are also}} subject to various other risks such as call and {{prepayment}} risk, credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk, event risk, exchange rate risk, volatility risk, inflation risk, sovereign risk and <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> risk.

In the first chapter, we define {{some of the basic}} concepts and provide description of available data. These are historical data on spot interest rates of zero-coupon bonds for various times to maturity which will be used for the construction of the <b>yield</b> <b>curves.</b> Based on these bond <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> we evaluate the bond, thus obtaining a picture of the evolution of its price. Later on, we try to estimate its price tomorrow. We present two approaches how to deal with this problem. First approach is the normal {{interest rate risk}} analysis based on duration and convexity, second approach is the method of principal components which will be applied to the historical daily changes in <b>yield</b> <b>curves.</b> The method of principal components is introduced in detail...|$|R
25|$|The {{shape of}} the <b>yield</b> <b>curve</b> is {{influenced}} by supply and demand: for instance, {{if there is a}} large demand for long bonds, for instance from pension funds to match their fixed liabilities to pensioners, and not enough bonds in existence to meet this demand, then the yields on long bonds can be expected to be low, irrespective of market participants' views about future events.|$|E
500|$|The first {{important}} work on element 103 {{was carried out}} at Berkeley by the nuclear-physics team of Albert Ghiorso, Torbjørn Sikkeland, Almon Larsh, Robert M. Latimer, and their co-workers on February 14, 1961. The first atoms of lawrencium were reportedly produced by bombarding a three-milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron-10 and boron-11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC). The Berkeley team reported that the isotope 257103 was detected in this manner, and that it decayed by emitting an 8.6MeV alpha particle with a half-life of (8±2)s. This identification was later corrected to be 258103, as later work proved that 257Lr {{did not have the}} properties detected, but 258Lr did. This was considered at the time to be convincing proof of the synthesis of element 103: while the mass assignment was less certain and proved to be mistaken, it did not affect the arguments in favor of element 103 having been synthesized. Scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (then in the Soviet Union) raised several criticisms: all but one were answered adequately. The exception was that 252Cf was the most common isotope in the target, and in the reactions with 10B, 258Lr could only have been produced by emitting four neutrons, and emitting three neutrons was expected to be much less likely than emitting four or five. This would lead to a narrow <b>yield</b> <b>curve,</b> not the broad one reported by the Berkeley team. A possible explanation was that there was a low number of events attributed to element 103. This was an important intermediate step to the unquestioned discovery of element 103, although the evidence was not completely convincing. The Berkeley team proposed the name [...] "lawrencium" [...] with symbol [...] "Lw", after Ernest Orlando Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. The IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry accepted the name, but changed the symbol to [...] "Lr". This acceptance of the discovery was later characterized as being hasty by the Dubna team.|$|E

Taking the {{periodic}} payment practice in Japan as a particular calendar liquidity event, this paper empirically examines {{the effects of}} liquidity demand on <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> of money market rates. The sample period is the decade between the late 1980 s and the late 1990 s, during which a passive liquidity provision from the Bank of Japan caused serious liquidity events among market participants {{at the end of}} each payment month (March, September, or December). According to the estimation results, <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> were made steeper over daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies at the turn of the payment months not only by expectation effects, but also by strong demand for liquid assets maturing just at each end of these months.

40|$|Abstract. The large basis spreads {{observed}} on {{the interest rate}} mar-ket since the liquidity crisis of summer 2007 imply that different <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> are required for market coherent estimation of forward rates with different tenors (e. g.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new benchmark <b>yield</b> <b>curves</b> 1 To properly guide decisions to borrow and invest in an economy, capital markets should incorporate all available information about the future prospects of borrowers and the willingness of investors to postpone consumption and take risks.
