Over time he created a series of layout techniques sketched on pieces of paper which he taped up near his drawing table. These [...] "visual notes," [...] collected on three pages, reminded Wood (and select assistants he showed the pages to) of various layouts and compositional techniques to keep his pages dynamic and interesting. (In the same vein, Wood also taped up another note to himself: [...] "Never draw anything you can copy, never copy anything you can trace, never trace anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>cut</b> out and paste up.") ...|$|E
2500|$|The offset is {{the index}} of the first term given. For some {{sequence}}s, the offset is obvious. For example, if we list the sequence of square numbers as 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 0; while if we list it as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 1. The default offset is 0, and most sequences in the OEIS have offset of either 0 or 1. Sequence , the magic constant for n×n magic square with prime entries (regarding 1 as a prime) with smallest row sums, {{is an example of}} a sequence with offset 3, and , [...] "Number of stars of visual magnitude n." [...] {{is an example of a}} sequence with offset -1. Sometimes there can be disagreement over what the initial terms of the sequence are, and correspondingly what the offset should be. In the case of the lazy caterer's sequence, the maximum number of pieces <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>cut</b> a pancake into with n cuts, the OEIS gives the sequence as 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... with offset 0, while Mathworld gives the sequence as 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... (implied offset 1). It can be argued that making no cuts to the pancake is technically a number of cuts, namely n = 0. But it can also be argued that an uncut pancake is irrelevant to the problem. Although the offset is a required field, some contributors don't bother to check if the default offset of 0 is appropriate to the sequence they are sending in. The internal format actually shows two numbers for the offset. The first is the number described above, while the second represents {{the index of}} the first entry (counting from 1) that has an absolute value greater than 1. This second value is used to speed up the process of searching for a sequence. Thus , which starts 1, 1, 1, 2 with the first entry representing a(1) has 1, 4 as the internal value of the offset field.|$|E
2500|$|Another classic Monsoon comment {{regularly}} heard {{just after}} he would sign on for an important event was, [...] "Pandemonium is running wild! The electricity in here is {{so thick that}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>cut</b> it with a knife!" [...] Another was [...] "This place has gone bananas!", which was preceded by an event in which the audience had erupted in cheers or jeers, such as the entrance of a wrestler or the finish of a match. Many times, Monsoon would also substitute simple words with needlessly complex and obscure equivalents – for example, he memorably used [...] "external occipital protuberance" [...] {{as an alternative to}} [...] "back of the head." [...] Or when a wrestler suffered a knee injury, he would state, [...] "He may have temporarily dislocated the patella!" [...] Heenan mocked this, once sarcastically calling a move to the [...] "cervial dervial part of the back." [...] However, Monsoon also employed several homegrown substitutes for body part terminology – for example, describing the mouth as a [...] "kisser" [...] and the abdomen as [...] "the bread basket." [...] When a wrestler put his finishing hold/maneuver on a jobber, he would say [...] "Get the (hot) shower ready, this one is history!" [...] or [...] "Stick the fork in (losing wrestler), he's done!". While commentating a match where a title changes hands, Monsoon might declare [...] "History has been made!" [...] When discussing something he didn't believe would happen, he would say [...] "highly unlikely." [...] If a babyface wrestler was attacked from behind or by surprise, he would refer to it as a [...] "Pearl Harbor Job." [...] When a babyface wrestler used an illegal tactic on a heel wrestler that was used on the babyface earlier in the match, Monsoon would state [...] "What's good for the goose is good for the gander." [...] Also, when a wrestler or tag team (usually the face) lost a match through illegal tactics (such as being hit with [...] "The Mouth of the South" [...] Jimmy Hart's megaphone), Monsoon would often proclaim {{that there had been a}} [...] "miscarriage of justice". Monsoon generally put more emphasis on this when the heel(s) won a championship match, or retained their title(s). When referring to the heel managers/on screen personalities (Bobby Heenan, Luscious Johnny V, Jimmy Hart, Brother Love, etc.), he would refer to them as [...] "That fountain of misinformation" [...] or [...] "That piece of garbage".|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of modern-day home sewing patterns contain multiple sizes in one pattern. Once a pattern {{is removed from}} a package, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> either <b>cut</b> the pattern based on the size you will be making or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> preserve the pattern by tracing it. The pattern is traced onto fabric using one of several methods. In one method, tracing paper with transferable ink on one side is placed between the pattern and the fabric. A tracing wheel is moved over the pattern outlines, transferring the markings onto the fabric with ink that is removable by erasing or washing. In another method, tracing paper is laid directly over a purchased pattern, and the pieces are traced. The pieces are cut, then the tracing paper is pinned and/or basted to the fabric. The fabric <b>can</b> then be <b>cut</b> to match the outlines on the tracing paper. Vintage patterns may come with small holes pre-punched into the pattern paper. These are for creating tailor's tacks, a type of basting where thread is sewn into the fabric in short lengths {{to serve as a}} guideline for cutting and assembling fabric pieces.|$|R
