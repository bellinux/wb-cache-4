[...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. <b>You</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1940s, Duke Ellington's {{music had}} transcended {{the bounds of}} swing, {{bridging}} jazz and art music in a natural synthesis. Ellington called his music [...] "American Music" [...] rather than jazz, and liked to describe those who impressed him as [...] "beyond category." [...] These included many of the musicians {{who were members of}} his orchestra, some of whom are considered among the best in jazz in their own right, but it was Ellington who melded them {{into one of the most}} well-known jazz orchestral units in the history of jazz. He often composed specifically for the style and skills of these individuals, such as [...] "Jeep's Blues" [...] for Johnny Hodges, [...] "Concerto for Cootie" [...] for Cootie Williams (which later became [...] "Do Nothing Till <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>from</b> Me" [...] with Bob Russell's lyrics), and [...] "The Mooche" [...] for Tricky Sam Nanton and Bubber Miley. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol's [...] "Caravan" [...] and [...] "Perdido", which brought the [...] "Spanish Tinge" [...] to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.|$|E
