6000|$|One day, late in March, Flower, who {{had been}} using my stories in almost every issue of his magazine, said to me: [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> some of your tales of the west, and let us bring them out in book form?

6000|$|Merril, who {{lay in a}} big lounge chair, little, portly, and immaculately dressed, {{looked up}} at him quietly. [...] "If it's any {{consolation}} to you, I'm holding as much stock as the rest of <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together.</b> The thing hits me rather hard, but, as you say, we can only stand up under it--that is, if the appropriation grants are thrown out by the House." ...|$|E

[...] "I am sure you have, for it was only {{yesterday}} Skinner was holding you up as an example to some of us. He said, 'You ought all to be ashamed of yourselves. Why, look at that lazy beggar Easton, he works as hard as the whole lot of <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together.</b> If it was not for him I should say we had better chuck it altogether.'" ...|$|E

For, Pa is too magnanimous to feel envy and spite towards my generous friends, and Pa is {{delicate}} enough and gentle enough to remember the sort of little claim they thought I had upon them and the unusually trying position in which, through no act of my own, I had been placed. And I always did love poor dear Pa better than all the rest of <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together,</b> and I always do and I always shall!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no doubt}} that many of them are worth a good deal of money," [...] the Rajah said. [...] "It is certain that Tippoo's {{treasuries}} are full of the spoils he has carried off, from the states he has overrun, and the ladies of the harem, no doubt, possess a store of the jewels, and could afford to be liberal to those whom they considered had saved their lives. Those seven, which <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> as the best, must alone be worth a large sum. I should think that the total value of the whole cannot be less than forty or fifty thousand rupees, so that, if those in your casket are handsomer than these, Dick, they must be valuable, indeed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The rest of <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> {{what you}} would save from the enemy, and is not too heavy to carry." [...] One man made some attempt at {{growling}} at a mere lad being consulted, while the stout warriors were kept in ignorance; but the spirit of discipline and confidence had returned with Sigbert, and no one heeded the murmur. Meantime, Sigbert followed the young Lord Walter up the rough winding stairs to the chamber where Mabel lay on her cushions. [...] "What! what!" [...] demanded the boy, pausing to enter. Sigbert, by way of answer, quietly produced from some hidden pouch two figs. Walter snatched at one with a cry of joy. Mabel held out her hand, then, with a gasp, drew it back. [...] "Has Roger had one?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Also {{working with}} Camart, Black {{designed}} DJamm software in 1998, which Coldcut used on laptops for their live shows, providing the audio bed alongside VJAMM’s audiovisual samples. Matt Black explained they designed DJamm so they [...] "could perform electronic {{music in a}} different way - i.e., not just taking a session band out to reproduce what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> in the studio using samples. It had a relationship to DJing, but was more interactive and more effective." [...] Excitingly at that time, DJamm was pioneering in its ability to shuffle sliced loops into intricate sequences, enabling users to split loops into any number of parts.|$|E

50|$|Nonetheless, {{participants}} on {{both sides}} hailed the conference and its final dinner in the Galerie des Batailles as an “incontestable success.” Rockefeller wrote Davis that the conference was “very useful” and followed up two days later with a second letter stating more directly, “I want to commend <b>you</b> on <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> an assemblage of European and American businessmen {{the likes of which}} I have never seen in one place in Europe”.|$|R
5000|$|..... History enters my writing, as {{it ought}} to enter the writing of others, because of its {{importance}} in our lives. I {{go back to this}} point about the historical moments we occupy. As a former colony, a multi-racial one, created by the British, we need history for a sense of things; to re-inscribe ourselves; discover and, in certain areas, define ourselves as individuals, as groups in a multi-racial society. They {{give you a sense of}} their belonging, which also happens to be mine. They give you an inherited identity that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> by being conscious of what you have absorbed, or taken. I live in Singapore; I have likes and dislikes, a set of interests, a set of values, a set of responsibilities and so on. History I see as fully inclusive, fully in terms of one's personal limits. And it includes beliefs, and anything of significance ... nothing is irrelevant.|$|E
5000|$|At Sutter's Hall of Fame {{induction}} that July, Sutter was {{the only}} former MLB player inducted. However, he was joined by 17 Negro league baseball personalities. During his induction speech, Sutter said, [...] "I haven't played baseball for 18 years now and I'm getting more sentimental as I get older. You start losing family members and you start losing friends. There are teammates who have passed on. You start thinking of them as <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a speech. I'm not usually an emotional guy. My kids said {{the first time they}} ever saw me cry was when I got that phone call him that he was elected. Now today. I guess {{a lot of people have}} seen me crying now." [...] Johnny Bench and Ozzie Smith wore decorative beards to the induction speech in honor of Sutter. Sutter's Hall of Fame plaque depicts his wearing a Cardinals cap, although the Hall considers his [...] "primary team" [...] (the team he represents as a Hall of Fame member) to be the Cubs.|$|E
5000|$|... 1963-1964 8th grade- we turn 14. This is {{the year}} that you talk me into buying my first guitar in a pawn shop on Market st. and you start {{teaching}} me how to play. At some point during this year, we start playing with Rick Euphrasio, {{because he had a}} drum set and his father had a restaurant with a PA system where we would sometimes practice. We called ourselves The Playboys, and even once played on the stage at Friends School. During the summer we often spent some time down on the Elk River. 1964-1965 9th grade- we turn 15. Rick E is now gone and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a new band with John B.,Bill G., Charley and you asked me to switch to drums. We started to practice regularly in John-O's basement. We started getting little gig's here and there and it was now that we (or you) came up with the name “Enfields”, and we got hooked up with V. Rago through my father who was his lawyer. The summer after we play some gig's and spend even more time on the Elk River. During this year, Charley and John got their driver's licenses, which was very important, since we no longer had to rely on your parents for transportation. By the end of the summer, we were starting to get pretty well known in the party scene.|$|E

5000|$|American Aftermath writes, [...] "Every {{single track}} tells its own story and could easily stand by itself, but when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> them all <b>together,</b> this becomes a magnum opus. Some bands spent their entire career trying to <b>put</b> <b>together</b> {{material}} this strong.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the origin, we know from deconstruction, is problematic. The differantial logic of the trace suspends any pursuit of it, {{inviting}} us instead (as if {{there really is a}} choice) to succumb to its play. Within universities we have explained the postmodern to our children but haven't done it very well. Or perhaps we have done it too well. They interactively embrace the idea that knowledge precedes them and are aware that scholarship is a tissue of interconnected, reflexive quotations. For many of the bright young things that pass through our halls of learning, writing an essay {{is not so much a}} discipline of research and composition as a language game; the permutation of an archive of readymade words and phrases on the myriad topics likely to be encountered in any course of study you care to name. To essay something is not an attempt, a speculation, the trying out of new ideas. It is a process of assembling, or rather dissembling, like a model that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>together,</b> without having any role in its design. All the big guys are quoting other people, so what's the buzz? And the French ones don't even cite the sources they quote anyway. Our students have read their Calvino and can spot a combinatory process a mile away. They got all the hip theoretical references in The Matrix. Postmodern Theory 101 has its avatars and its messages are clear: knowledge, like everything else in hyperreality, is an appearance adrift from the real, a simulacrum. Get with it and get over it. Neo doesn't have to learn Kung Fu as a discipline of mind and body, refining its motor skills and philosophical wisdom from years of training at the local dojo. He just 'knows Kung Fu', having acquired its techniques as store-bought second nature, programmed from a simulation package that does the work for him. In other words, his expertise is not grounded in any actual effort on his part. Wicked. Does this sound jaded? I can't tell any more. It's certainly not meant to be. What do we expect of our students when we force-feed them on diets of Baudrillard, Lyotard and Derrida like so many fattened foie gras geese? As with the logos, they have taken us at our word. Go forth and appropriate. And then we sting them for plagiarism. Within universities plagiarism is without question public enemy number one. Plagiarism is defined and applied in the academy as the unacknowledged use of someone else's ideas and/or words as if they are your own (unlike their customers, our learned line managers aren't hip to allusion, pastiche, collage, sampling and the cut-up-fold-in method). In the long and venerable tradition of belles-lettres there is an unspoken ethics and integrity associated with original research. If you use secondary sources or paraphrase them it is the scholarly and ethical convention to acknowledge them appropriately. 1 The imprimatur of these principles (“best practice” in today's parlance) is the signature of the author. To name is to mark writing with an unimpeachable authority, quod scripsi scripsi. In signing off on an essay, we presume that our students make a pledge in the name of presence. The signature is their seal of authenticity, the confirmation that their written words originate from the fount of their internal resources. But writing is far from being a reliable guarantor of originality and our students know this. Anyone can forge a signature and a plagiarised essay presented in your name is a consequence of the signature effect. It is, in every sense of the word in this context, the mark of an absent presence...|$|E
