25|$|Sometimes an {{exhibition}} race is held {{after all the}} meaningful races are run with all the amateur class winners from Novice up to Expert and including the Open, girls classes and perhaps Cruiser classes race together once. This is called the Trophy Dash. Like in the Open Classes, no points are rewarded in this case, just a chance for bragging rights and to match <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> against people that are at a higher skill level. Only one race for a single first-place trophy is awarded. As in the Opens the Expert usually wins with the Intermediate winner pulling one out {{every once in a}} while. Novices usually win only when a major, catastrophic pile up occurs on the track and even then the mass smash up has to happen quite close to the finish line.|$|E
500|$|Paige {{has named}} reality {{television}} series such as Any Dream Will Do, which aim {{to find an}} unknown actor to play the lead role in a musical, as {{the greatest threat to}} theatre today, believing that [...] "actors already striving in the theatre wouldn't dream of putting themselves on these shows". In a later interview, she questioned the seriousness of the actors auditioning for this type of show: [...] "you wouldn't put <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> for one of those shows in case you got bumped off the first week and all your colleagues saw it". She has also expressed a wish for more new musicals to be put into production, instead of frequent revivals.|$|E
500|$|Richard Buxton of Tracksounds {{wrote an}} {{ambivalent}} review, calling the album a [...] "valiant effort" [...] and Djawadi's [...] "most consistently satisfying work to date". The soundtrack {{also received a}} score of 4.5/5 from Heather Phares of AllMusic. Jørn Tillnes, writing for Soundtrack Geek, highlighted the opening theme as [...] "one of the better main themes for any television series out there. It is epic and massive, and that theme is just something you give <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> to. It’s that good and can’t be missed." [...] Jonathan Weilbaecher praises the soundtrack as doing [...] "a supreme job mixing emotion with epic, a trick that even the very best {{have a hard time}} with." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Thunder" [...] {{is a song}} by British {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Leona Lewis from her fifth studio album, I Am (2015). The song was written by Lewis and Toby Gad, who also produced the track. Lyrically, [...] "Thunder" [...] is about finding the strength to pick <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> after falling on difficult times. Lewis explained that the song is about self-reflection and self-empowerment and finding the ability to look within in order to decide what is best to do next. Def Jam released [...] "Thunder" [...] on 24 July 2015 as the lead single in United States, {{but it is the}} third single to be released from the album overall. Remixes by Danny Verde and Tom Swoon were also released.|$|E
500|$|In March 1998, André 3000 and Big Boi {{purchased}} a studio off Northside Drive in Atlanta which had formerly belonged to R singer Bobby Brown. [...] The studio had sentimental {{value for the}} duo, {{as it was the}} first place the two had ever recorded vocals together, on a remix of TLC's [...] "What About Your Friends" [...] (1992). [...] The two named the studio [...] "Stankonia", a word created by André 3000 as a combination of the words [...] "stank", a slang synonym for [...] "funky", and [...] "Plutonia", the title of a poster in his bedroom depicting a futuristic city. [...] He explained, [...] "Stankonia is this place I imagined where you can open <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> and be free to express anything".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios. [...] "Roar" [...] was {{recorded}} in four other studios: Luke's in the Boo, Playback Recording Studio and Secret Garden Studios, all located {{in the state of}} California, as well as MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden Perry co-wrote the song with Bonnie McKee and its producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut. All its development took place in March 2013. McKee told MTV that [...] "Roar" [...] is [...] "kind of a 'pick <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> and dust yourself off and keep going', female-empowerment song" [...] and [...] "kind of an epiphany song." [...] Perry said she wrote the song after undergoing therapy, saying she was [...] "sick of keeping all these feelings inside and not speaking up for myself".|$|E

500|$|The album explores gloomy lyrical {{subjects}} such as death, violence, and occultism. Speaking about the themes on the album, author Bob Larson asserted that Megadeth [...] "cranks out songs about spilling blood and stomping guts with venomous anger". The album's title, {{as well as its}} lyrics, led to accusations whether the band was promoting Satanism. These allegations were rigidly denied by Mustaine, who said that the band consciously kept away from the Satanic image. [...] "I mean, it's great to thrash and pound, cut <b>yourself</b> <b>up,</b> scream and have fun, but you don't have to take out a Pagan attitude. Why support the Devil? He's already there. I'd rather just fucking thrash and be a metalist and listen to whatever I want to than be forced to listen to one style of music." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Over and Over", Madonna sings about {{determination}} and picking <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> from disappointments. The song consists of instrumentation from drums, synths {{and has a}} three-chord progression. An emotional moment occurred in the recording studio when Madonna covered the 1978 Rose Royce song [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore". Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, {{you go out there}} and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." [...] The song features Madonna's vocals supported by acoustic guitars and synth strings, with Thompson playing the drum in the second verse. Towards the end, Madonna emotes in the voice of a soul singer.|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{described}} the collaboration {{as one of}} the more confusing releases of 2010, due to how the song was connected to three different projects, including the Dorito's campaign and both Guetta's and Rihanna's albums. Copsey praised Guetta's ability to provide a [...] "proper dance-pop stonker" [...] and was complimentary of the its composition. He concluded his reviewing with [...] "It's a good job, then, that bopping along to this – and warming <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> in the process – is pretty much impossible to resist." [...] A reviewer for Popjustice was divided on the song's lyrics; though he found the line [...] "beating like a disco drum" [...] fantastic, he remained unconvinced by the line, [...] "who's that chick", which he labelled as being stupid. Becky Bain for Idolator praised the song for not sounding as [...] "generic" [...] as Katy Perry's releases [...] "California Gurls" [...] and [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] (2010). Tom Byron for The Vine compared the song to Australian singer Guy Sebastian's [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] and Madonna's 1987 smash hit [...] "Who's That Girl".|$|E

500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Parker and Stone {{received}} feedback that audiences felt [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] was especially unkind to Struthers. Although {{they did not}} speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was {{a fan of the}} show until [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin' Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, you're really setting <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> if you're going to be that fat and go on the air talking about [...] ... We don't think she's a bad person, she's probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the Twinkies a little bit before going on the air." ...|$|E
500|$|Declaring {{the song}} Gaga's [...] "most stirring" [...] release, Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound called the track: [...] "a {{sweeping}} and intensely powerful number— it's {{not just any}} ordinary pop song". Christopher Tapley from Variety praised both Gaga and Warren's songwriting, describing it as: [...] "something of an anthem for the cause... It {{is one of the}} strongest contenders in this year's race for best original song [...] But far more than that, it is a rally cry for a movement." [...] Lisa Wright wrote in NME that the song is: [...] "a somber piano ballad befitting of the topic with lyrics that depict the frustration of being told to pick <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> and carry on by people who couldn't possibly understand your situation." [...] Idolator's Robbie Daw claimed that the [...] "powerful, unsettling" [...] visuals were complimented by a [...] "strong vocal performance" [...] from Gaga. Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone called it an [...] "evocative track", which highlighted Gaga's vocals and believed it to be [...] "a perfect follow-up to [...] with Tony Bennett". Spanos added that [...] " [...] following [...] critical and commercial miss with most recent album Artpop and help break Warren's losing streak at the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk {{in front of people}} or to open <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> to your closest friends. But to open <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand.

2500|$|Banville {{is highly}} scathing {{of all of}} his work, stating of his books: [...] "I hate them all ... I loathe them. They're all a {{standing}} embarrassment."

[...] He does not read reviews of his work as he already knows – [...] "better than any reviewer" [...] – the places in which its faults lie.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1995, {{the group}} had {{completed}} their 10-month tour and returned to their headquarters in Amsterdam to begin recording a second album. The group was soon dropped, however, by their record label, Rough Trade World Service. With this development, bassist John Carco left the group and moved to Los Angeles where he formed and played with Frankie O. and Pete Stahl (singer of D.C.H.C. group Scream) in the group Metro. Carco would later pursue an acting career. Songs written by Dee Dee and Carco for the never released second I.C.L.C. album would eventually be recorded by the Ramones on their final album ¡Adios Amigos!. One of these songs, [...] "Born to Die in Berlin", would ultimately be the final song on the final Ramones' album, and featured Dee Dee singing in German {{on the bridge of}} the song.

In its November 1992 issue, The Source magazine rated it 4½ out of 5 [...] "mics", with writer Matty C declaring the album as living up to the expectations it accumulated in the previous year. Although he was un-favorable of its skits, he praised the album's [...] "funky" [...] production, and Redman's charismatic lyrics and flow, stating [...] "...not only has he mastered the laid back, homicidal flow, but he can also have you picking <b>yourself</b> <b>up</b> from the floor from his hysterical punchlines". In his review for The Washington Post, Gil Griffin wrote [...] "EPMD produced this album and give it their trademark, thick hard funky stamp, while Redman kicks it with his deep, convincing voice, likening himself to a psycho, a lover and a fighter. The booming drums come in extra handy on [...] "Blow Your Mind," [...] "Time 4 Sum Aksion" [...] and [...] "So Ruff," [...] where he flows with free-style rhymes".|$|E
