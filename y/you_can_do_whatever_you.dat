2500|$|RWBY {{had been}} a long-standing concept of Oum's for years before it began development. Towards {{the end of his}} work on the 10th season of Rooster Teeth's Red vs. Blue, he {{developed}} the color-coding approach to character names and design as a hook for the series. During production on Red vs. Blue season 10, Oum asked series creator Burnie Burns if they could produce RWBY following the conclusion of that season. Burns, worried for the production schedule, told Oum [...] "If you finish Season 10, then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want." [...] Production on RWBY began as intended, with the first trailer being finished within two weeks and premiering after the credits of the Red vs. Blue season 10 finale on November 5, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> but <b>whatever</b> they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|R

Albarn said: [...] "All of the vocals were sung outside ... It was nice. When its nice weather, its nice to be outside. I think the big studios are a con. They charge people to make less exciting records. That doesnt {{make any sense to}} me. I mean, recording as it is now, you <b>dont</b> need studios. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it on <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want, whenever you want. Thats a great liberation that computers and technology have given us. It basically means that its just going back to where it comes from, which is music on the streets and in the houses." ...|$|R
