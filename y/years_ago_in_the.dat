5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes {{used to refer to}} all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E

5|$|The {{dromedary}} has {{not occurred}} naturally {{in the wild}} for nearly 2,000 years.

The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden.|$|E

While the exact origin of the word Narcissus is unknown it is frequently linked to its fragrance which was thought to be narcotic, and to the legend of the youth of that name who fell in love with his reflection.

5|$|The waterfalls are on {{the section}} of Kitchen Creek that flows down the Allegheny Front, a steep {{escarpment}} between the Allegheny Plateau {{to the north and}} the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. The glens are made of sedimentary rocks from the Huntley Mountain and Catskill Formations that formed up to 370million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The waterfalls are the result of increased flow in Kitchen Creek from glaciers enlarging its drainage basin during the last Ice Age.|$|E

5|$|A 2015 genetic {{study by}} {{evolutionary}} biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of C.violaceus and its closest relatives {{suggests that the}} group (section Cortinarius) originated in Australasia and began diverging from a common ancestor around 12 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Miocene, with C.violaceus itself diverging from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates {{that some form of}} dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants (angiosperms), and C.violaceus—or its direct ancestor—developed a symbiotic relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Behnke in his {{salmon and}} trout {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native to a separate geographic area. Not {{all of them were}} scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the cutthroat trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs. These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in the upper Oldman Formation and lower Dinosaur Park Formation of Canada. The Oldman Formation dates to the Campanian, about 77.5 to 76.5 million years ago, and the Dinosaur Park Formation dates from 76.6 to 74.8 million years ago. Corythosaurus lived from ~77–75.7 million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Dinosaur Park Formation C. casuarius lived from 76.6 to 75.9 mya, with C. intermedius living from 75.8 to 75.7 mya. In the Oldman Formation C. casuarius, the only species of Corythosaurus from the deposits, lived about 77 to 76.5 mya. The holotype {{specimen}} was clearly a carcass that had floated up on a beach, as Unio shells, water-worn bones, and a baenid turtle were preserved all around. Corythosaurus probably lived in a woodland forest, and might have occasionally wandered into swampy areas.|$|E
5|$|Many Smilodon {{specimens}} {{have been}} excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore traps. Animals were accidentally {{trapped in the}} seeps and became bait for predators that came to scavenge, but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such traps are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 Smilodon fatalis specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Pleistocene. Though the trapped animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.|$|E
