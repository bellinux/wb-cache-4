25|$|Most mammals such as calves, sheep, goats, foals, pigs, cats, cavies, rats, {{mice and}} humans can be infested by the Australian Paralysis Tick. Fatalities {{resulting}} from a single engorged adult female tick are mostly reported in the young animals of the larger species and all ages and sizes of the pet species (dogs and cats). Larvae and nymphs can also produce toxic reactions in the host. Fifty larvae or five nymphs can kill a 40g rat, larger numbers of either can induce paralysis in dogs and cats. They can be quite easy to find on short-haired animals, but very difficult to find on long-haired animals like Persian cats. If <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tick-prone area, and your pets are allowed outdoors, {{it is suggested that}} you physically check your pets daily for ticks. Unfortunately they are often not discovered until the tick is large enough to be felt. By this time the tick has subjected the animal to a large amount of toxins. One adult female can kill four susceptible rats during engorgement. Although it is not typical, an engorging adult female apparently can re-attach several times to different dogs.|$|E
500|$|The Marble Index [...] "failed to {{challenge}} the supremacy of Nashville Skyline, From Elvis in Memphis, Abbey Road and Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations on the album charts of 1969". Although Holzman {{was pleased with the}} album, Nico's longevity with the label was unlikely; he was increasingly concerned with her heroin use and she had a difficult, irresponsible attitude. Nico left the United States before she was officially released from Elektra, after a violent incident in a New York City bar. Biographers refer to her leaving the U.S. as an exile; Nico said, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dangerous place, you also become increasingly dangerous. You might just wind up in jail." [...] In London she recorded two more albums with Cale in the same vein: Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974), now considered parts of a trilogy. The album was reissued as a CD in 1991 with two bonus tracks. Songs off The Marble Index have been included in Nico compilations, including The Classic Years (1998), Femme Fatale (2002), and The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970 (2007). To celebrate Elektra's 60th anniversary, [...] "Frozen Warnings" [...] was released as a single on October 25, 2010, with [...] "No One Is There" [...] as its B-side.|$|E

In general, all banks are beautiful things, and will reward work better than large landscapes. If <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lowland country, you must look for places where the ground is broken to the river's edges, with decayed posts, or roots of trees; or, if by great good luck there should be such things within your reach, for remnants of stone quays or steps, mossy mill-dams, etc. Nearly every other mile of road in chalk country will present beautiful bits of broken bank at its sides; better in form and color than high chalk cliffs. In woods, one or two trunks, with the flowery ground below, are at once the richest and easiest kind of study: a not very thick trunk, say nine inches or a foot in diameter, with ivy running up it sparingly, is an easy, and always a rewarding subject.|$|E
