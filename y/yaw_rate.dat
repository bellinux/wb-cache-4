Anti-lock brakes enable ESC to brake individual wheels.

However, ESC serves a different purpose from that of ABS or Traction Control.|$|E

P. and named it the KEITEN-MARU, which replaced the old KEITEN-MARU of 300 tons and 500 H. P. The new KEITEN-MARU made its maiden voyage across the Pacific Ocean from December, 1974 to March, 1975 and {{set out on the}} second ocean navigation to the Indian Ocean from April, 1975 to July, 1975. Between the two voyages we made investigation into the relation between the weather adjustment and direction of wind and waves and also the relation between the ship’s speed (3, 7 and 12 knots) and <b>yawing</b> <b>rate,</b> while steering the ship with auto pilot. We got the following results: 1) The yawing angle is little influenced by the forces outside the ship in case of the weather adjustment under the dial at 1, 2 and 3. 2) The <b>yawing</b> <b>rate</b> is comparatively little when the forces outside the ship come on the bow and very large when the forces outside the ship come on the stern. 3) The <b>yawing</b> <b>rate</b> is reduced when the ship’s speed is increased and the forces outside the ship come on the bow. 4) The <b>yawing</b> <b>rate</b> increases very much when the ship is sailing at the half speed (7 knots) and the forces outside the ship come on the stern. 5) The steering error is large when the fbrces outside the ship are on the beam or stern 45 degree and also large when the ship’s speed is slow. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new technology is}} the electronically controlled 'active differential'. An electronic control unit (ECU) uses inputs from multiple sensors, including <b>yaw</b> <b>rate,</b> steering input angle, and lateral acceleration—and adjusts the distribution of torque to compensate for undesirable handling behaviours like understeer.

25|$|ESC {{is built}} {{on top of an}} {{anti-lock}} brake system, and all ESC-equipped vehicles are fitted with traction control. The ESC components include a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, Federal regulations require that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as $250 USD. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and was generally not available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and it might pay for itself in reduced insurance premiums.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Handling {{behaviour}} of articulated vehicles {{combination is}} more complex and less predictable than that of non-articulated vehicles. It is usually difficult for drivers to maneuver a tractor semi-trailer during high speed emergency braking on split-mu road surface. Braking on this type of road surface, the conventional anti-lock braking systems will cause the vehicle deviate from the desired direction, or overmuch stopping distance. In this paper, a 3 -dof of tractor semi-trailer model was used to produce desired <b>yaw</b> <b>rates</b> which were compared with actual <b>yaw</b> <b>rates.</b> An active front steering control and four-channel ABS were integrated to improve the tractor semi-trailer lateral stability while braking on split-mu road surface, which will produce maximum braking force. A full function tractor semi-trailer model was built and assembled in multi-body dynamics software, and the dynamic analysis was performed on split-mu road surface. The simulation {{results show that the}} integrated system can improve the tractor semi-trailer lateral stability under braking on split-mu road surface...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the use of visual flow cues as an aid to ground and vertical drift awareness during helicopter flight and targeting while using night vision goggles (NVG's). Three displays were compared: 1) NVG display: simulated NVG image of cockpit and external environment; 2) Overlay display: NVG image with an overlay of a flow cue field and a surrounding wire-frame globe; 3) Cut-out display: same as the Overlay display but with symbology removed from the central region (leaving an unobscured 20 degree field-of-view of the NVG image). Three levels of contrast were also compared using each display type. The visual scenery was displayed to subjects using a helmet-mounted virtual reality device that had a 40 X 50 degree field-of-view liquid crystal display The study involved six pilots. Three tasks were given: 1) Search task: designate enemy targets with a helmet-mounted sight (no flight control inputs); 2) Hover task: null out all translational and <b>yaw</b> <b>rates</b> while in a hover; 3) Search/Hover task: perform both Search and Hover tasks simultaneously. These tasks were conducted in a fixed-based helicopter simulator which used the dynamics of a small-scale model helicopter. The following performance measures were collected: 1) Pilot ability to detect and recognize targets (Search and Search/Hover tasks); 2) Pilot ability to null translational and <b>yaw</b> <b>rates</b> (Hover and Search/Hover tasks); 3) Time scanning the instrument panel (Hover and Search/Hover tasks).

50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> sensor (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The yaw damper uses <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the <b>yaw</b> <b>rate</b> sensor to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{demonstrates}} that the vehicle sideslip can be estimated through the kinematic relationship of velocity measurements from two low-cost GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers. To compensate for the low update rate of low-cost GPS receivers, acceleration/angular rate measurements from an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) are merged with the GPS measurements using an Extended Kalman Filter. Two technical challenges were addressed: (i) unsynchronized updates of the two GPS receivers and (ii) significant delays in GPS velocity measurement. A stochastic observability analysis reveals that the proposed method guarantees the observability when a vehicle has non-zero <b>yaw</b> <b>rates.</b> Experimental verification shows that the vehicle sideslip is estimated regardless of surface friction levels under several maneuvers...|$|R

The effect of tangential blowing was estimated using existing wind tunnel data on normal forebody blowing and analytical studies of tangential blowing over conical forebodies. Incorporation of forebody blowing into the flight control system was investigated by adding this additional yaw control and sideforce generating actuator into the existing F- 18 HARV simulation model.
