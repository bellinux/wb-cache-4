25|$|Sly {{recorded}} {{two more}} albums for Epic: High on You (1975) and Heard <b>You</b> <b>Missed</b> Me, Well I'm Back (1976). High On You {{was billed as}} a Sly Stone solo album; Heard <b>You</b> <b>Missed</b> Me was a Sly and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate {{with some of the}} original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalists Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva, who parted with Sly in 1977 and formed The Brides of Funkenstein in 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released 10 Years Too Soon, a remix album featuring disco versions of the 1960s Family Stone hits.|$|E

500|$|After Harrison {{has named}} Rolling Stone {{as the main}} {{perpetrator}} of his anguish, Leng suggests that {{he is unable to}} sustain the previous [...] "artifice", whereby the lyrics' shift in perspective from first-person to third-person represented the apparently [...] "happy" [...] private man versus the [...] "wounded" [...] musician, as [...] "personified by his guitar". Instead, Harrison [...] "flays his detractors" [...] in the song's subsequent verses. These final verses contain the rhyming couplets [...] "Thought by now you knew the score / <b>You</b> <b>missed</b> the point just like before" [...] and [...] "While you attack, create offence / I'll put it down to your ignorance". Music critic Lindsay Planer describes the lines as [...] "suggesting that there is more to Harrison's music than is being taken into consideration by narrow-minded journalists".|$|E
500|$|Shearsmith {{identified}} [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] {{as one of}} his two favourite {{episodes of}} the series, along with [...] "The Devil of Christmas". For the writers, the episode was not comedic, and they expressed awareness of the differences between episodes of Inside No. 9 like [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] and the expectations of viewers for television comedies. The pair acknowledged the particular complexity of the plot, with Pemberton saying [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> two sentences in a row, you'd be like 'what?' Even I was thinking how are people following this? It's insane." [...] Pemberton also noted that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence [...] "I always hated cryptic crosswords. Why can't people just say what they mean instead of trying to trick you all the time?" [...] from Shearsmith's Tyler.|$|E

The documentary series The Blues, produced by Martin Scorsese, depicts the recording band for Electric Mud performing with Chuck D and members of The Roots.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Olivia called the single an [...] "empowering women's song" [...] for inspiring women to leave unfulfilling relationships. She said she wrote it: [...] "for {{all the people who}} don't know how to tell the other person to 'bounce' [...] ". An article in Vibe magazine noted lyrics, like: [...] "I can't take this shit no more / Picture frame broken daddy 'cause I can't trust you / I'm ridin' high now / So nigga fuck you", as creating an impression of Olivia as a [...] "potty-mouth". NMEs John Mulvey commented that Olivia's [...] "ruthlessness rather than her vocabulary" [...] was the standout, especially in the lyric: [...] "Shoulda known what <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> at home / Now you're all alone with no-one to bone". Mulvey joked that the amount of censorship on the radio edit made Olivia sound [...] "avant-garde".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} widely noted as both very dark, and very clever. Dessau characterised {{it as the}} cleverest episode of Inside No. 9, and the {{freelance}} journalist Dan Owen described it as [...] "undoubtedly the most complex and surprising instalment of , favouring attention to detail and narrative precision"; similarly, Mellor called it [...] "the most complicated tale Inside No. 9 has ever spun". The plot offered [...] "much to admire" [...] for crossword fans, but viewers' enjoyment, it was suggested, may depend on how much they enjoys crosswords. The {{latter half of the}} episode introduced a very wide array of twists; Owen speculated that the episode could lose viewers at the end due to its [...] "minimal hand-holding", suggesting {{that there may have been}} too many twists. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> just one line of dialogue", he explained, [...] "it would've left you scrambling to understand exactly what's going on between the three characters".|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{gave the}} album four stars {{out of a}} {{possible}} five, calling it was a [...] "frequently thrilling return" [...] with songs that [...] "crackle, fizz, and bulge with priapic exuberance". Likewise, AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album four stars out of five and wrote: [...] "Van Halen are using their history to revive their present and they succeed surprisingly well on A Different Kind of Truth." [...] The A.V. Club's Steven Hyden stated, [...] "After so many years of fumbling dysfunction that reduced the once-proud Van Halen name to a laughingstock, A Different Kind Of Truth matters because it's a reminder of why this band mattered," [...] while noting that, [...] "Roth deserves some of the credit for that. For whatever reason, when Roth is in the band, Eddie Van Halen plays guitar like the world wants him to play guitar." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Rob Sheffield stating, [...] "Van Halen's 'heard <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> us, we're back' album is not only the most long-awaited reunion joint in the history of reunion joints, it is – against all reasonable expectations – a real Van Halen album." ...|$|E

500|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex {{received}} mixed to favourable reviews, {{with some}} critics criticizing {{the game for}} making little changes to the formula established by its predecessors. Louis Bedigian of GameZone wrote a positive review, saying that [...] "any Crash Bandicoot fan would be a fool not {{to go out and}} buy this game. I started playing at 2am one night and did not stop until three in the afternoon!" [...] Doug Perry of IGN described the game as [...] "a decent-playing and pretty-looking Crash Bandicoot game. It's nothing terribly special, but it's not bad, not bad at all." [...] Official US PlayStation Magazine felt that [...] "when the strongest feeling I get from a game is the desire to play its predecessors, something's not quite right." [...] Game Informer criticized the [...] "outrageously bad load times", saying that they [...] "keep the game from being average." [...] Star Dingo of GamePro cautioned that [...] "if you were hoping the new management would give Crash a big kick in the pants, however, this is one pair of pants you will find quite unkicked."

[...] He concluded with [...] "TNA's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action, {{catering to the}} variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans." [...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. Now, this is the part where I go into a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was." [...] Regarding the Four Way Elimination match, Lacroix believed Johnny Candido's participation was [...] "a nice gesture", but wonder [...] "if they could have come up with something else, preferably outside of the match." ...|$|E
