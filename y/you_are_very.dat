25|$|Parking in the Jewellery Quarter is {{predominantly}} pay and display and permit holders bays. There {{are a variety}} of cheaper off-road options at around 50p per hour. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> lucky you will sometimes find one of the very limited Free parking space on one of the side streets. Free bays are marked by a white P in a blue square on a nearby sign. Visitors should be aware that traffic wardens are very vigilant in this area.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{independence}} being declared, a Committee of Five {{was charged with}} drafting the Declaration, and included Adams, along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman. The Committee, after discussing the general outline that the document should follow, decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document; but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, [...] "Why will you not? You ought to do it." [...] To which Adams responded, [...] "I will not – reasons enough." [...] Jefferson replied, [...] "What can be your reasons?" [...] And Adams responded, [...] "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear {{at the head of}} this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." [...] "Well," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." [...] Adams concluded, [...] "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting." [...] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself is uncertain – accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are otherwise contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a primary role in its completion. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 4. Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as [...] "the pillar of [...] support on the floor of Congress, [...] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." ...|$|E

2500|$|The abrupt {{change in}} Prince Henry's {{somewhat}} carefree life {{up to that}} point was made clear by the new King on the very first evening of his reign. [...] "If you two think that, now that I have taken this new job on, you can go on behaving just as you like, in the same old way, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> much mistaken! You two have to pull yourselves together", the King warned his two brothers at dinner.|$|E
2500|$|On Tuesday we welcomed Pulpit Minister John Dole [...] from Murray's Glendale Church of Christ. We had all pews full as many Glendale Church of Christ members came {{to support}} both John Dale and our Revival. His topic was [...] "Jubilee--What We Can Do Here in Murray/Calloway County?" [...] Rev. Dole [...] commented, [...] "I {{appreciate}} this opportunity. Ray had told me, 'Just come, {{do whatever you}} want to do, say whatever you want to say. I trust you. You are not on trial.' I appreciate that. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> warm and welcoming." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a 2006 {{concert in}} Canada, Ronstadt told the Calgary Sun {{that she was}} [...] "embarrassed George Bush (was) from the United States.... He's an idiot.... He's {{enormously}} incompetent on both the domestic and international scenes.... Now {{the fact that we}} were lied to about the reasons for entering into war against Iraq and thousands of people have diedit's just as immoral as racism." [...] Her remarks drew international headlines. In an August 14, 2007, interview, she commented on all her well-publicized, outspoken views, in particular the Aladdin incident, by noting, [...] "If I had it to do over I would be much more gracious to everyone … you can be as outspoken as you want if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>very,</b> very respectful. Show some grace".|$|E

2500|$|Compute!'s Gazette in 1986 called Temple of Apshai Trilogy for the Commodore 64 [...] "a classic {{series of}} {{computer}} games made even better", stating that improved graphics and game play made it worthwhile {{even for those}} who had played them before. Amiga World criticized the Amiga version of Trilogys repetitiveness, stating that [...] "unless <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> easily amused you will probably lose interest fairly soon". Bill Kunkel, Arnie Katz and Joyce Worley for Analog Computing, on the other hand, listed Trilogy {{as one of the best}} Atari ST games of 1986, lauded the improved graphics and interface, while asserting that [...] "the actual content is timeless". In Dragon #114's [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in 1986, reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser also stated that the game was [...] "well-worth your interest." [...] Info gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, stating that the trilogy [...] "has been admirably Amiga-tized". The magazine approved of the graphics, sound, and user interface and concluded that the game would be [...] "more likely to appeal to novices than Ultima". In 1991 and 1993 Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia stated that the graphics [...] "caused a sensation when it first appeared", but also criticized a lack of polish in the programming and slow speed due to the use of BASIC, issues which were improved upon in the Atari 8-bit version.|$|E
2500|$|Bruner {{has said}} that school shootings in the United States occur because {{students}} are being taught the science of evolution. Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. I believe there was a Great Flood. How do YOU explain fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How do you explain the Grand Canyon? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon. I believe it took a lot more water than that to carve out the Grand Canyon and other land and rock formations formed by water erosion. You can call me ignorant or intolerant or whatever you want, but I did not make fun of YOUR religion." ...|$|E
