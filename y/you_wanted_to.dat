The film also won three awards {{at both the}} New York Film Critics Awards and the Oklahoma Film Critics Awards, and {{received}} a record 12 Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations. At the latter, the film was nominated in vastly different categories, ranging from its production design, to costumes and makeup to music featured in it. Black Swan performed similarly at the 64th British Academy Film Awards, again with 12 nominations, and was also nominated in similar categories. Another organization to laud the film with {{the same amount of}} nominations was the Alliance of Women Film Journalists. They recognized Black Swan in categories including Most Beautiful Film and its depiction of sexuality, but despite Arnonofsky's feature winning Best Film, it was also nominated in their Movie <b>You</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>To</b> Love But Just Couldn‘t category.|$|E

25|$|Turn of {{the century}} {{baseball}} attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the 1901 season was 3,247. However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built {{for many of the}} larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Shibe Park in Philadelphia, Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Boston's Fenway Park along with Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago. Likewise from the Eastern League to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising Negro Leagues professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre World War I peak of 5,836 in 1909, before falling back during the war.

500|$|The episode {{produced}} varying {{responses from}} television commentators. [...] "Lisa Goes Gaga" [...] provoked The A.V.

In his B– review, Kaiser asserted that [...] "Lisa Goes Gaga" [...] used a straightforward interpretation of the singer, and felt that Lady Gaga's appearance was superior to previous guest appearances. [...] "So many Simpsons celebrity voices," [...] he stated, [...] "show up for a few minutes at most, with Extras-style 'Wow, Chris Martin of Coldplay, what are you doing here?' Or they voice one-off characters without enough flair to be memorable. Instead, Gaga was the focus of the entire episode, to the point where if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> call it a half-hour commercial for Lady Gaga, you probably wouldn’t be wrong. Fortunately for 'Lisa Goes Gaga', the celebrity at its heart is entertaining enough that it being her commercial isn’t a complete waste of time." [...] A writer for HLN avouched that The Simpsons managed to culminate its season [...] "with a lot of style"; David Greenwald of Billboard echoed similar sentiments. Gaga's performance was frequently mentioned in the critiques. Idolator's Becky Bain, Tracy Gilchrist of SheWired, and Caroline Westbrook of Metro issued favorable assessments of her acting: the latter affirmed that Gaga had many memorable moments throughout the episode.|$|E
