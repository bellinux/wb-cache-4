500|$|The Manfred Symphony {{would cost}} Tchaikovsky more time, effort and soul-searching than {{anything}} else he would write, even the Pathetique Symphony. It also became the longest, most complex work he had written up to that point, and though it owes an obvious debt to Berlioz due to its program, Tchaikovsky {{was still able to}} make the theme of Manfred his own. Near the end of seven months of intensive effort, in late September 1885, he wrote Balakirev, [...] "Never in my life, believe me, have I labored so long and hard, and felt so drained by my efforts. The Symphony is written in four movements, as per <b>your</b> <b>program,</b> although—forgive me—as much as I wanted to, I {{have not been able to}} keep all the keys and modulations you suggested ...
