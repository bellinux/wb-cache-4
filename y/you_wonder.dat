Lawrence said the All of Us project was wholly inspired by the Cronulla riots. “You watch this stuff on TV and <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> why people are doing this - this is no way for a multicultural society to behave,” said Lawrence.|$|E

Where Catherine Tate's Donna in last year's special was overbearing, Kylie Minogue's Astrid is hardly there at all. It does make <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> why casting Kylie {{was regarded as a}} coup. She's a pop star– of course she's going to say yes to being beamed into millions of homes in the run-up to Christmas. She's got a duff album to sell. In truth, Kylie should be grateful to [...]|$|E
500|$|Although Turner's {{lyrics are}} found to be [...] "far from wholly discernable", his vocals have [...] "mellowed". Robin Jahdi writes that [...] "Turner's vocals are growing as well, {{sounding}} eerily like Steve Brodsky, from Isis' peers Cave In. These journeys into melody are so successful (vocal harmonies, no less) that <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> why Turner still bothers with the pseudo-death metal vocals at all. They add little to the music and must serve to turn off more potential fans than they attract." [...] Nate Chinen, however, sees this variety as a vital component of the album's success, attesting that [...] "Aaron Turner expertly alternates between a death-metal roar and a more human wail, using whichever better suits the needs of a song".|$|E

Speaking of Jacqui's sudden change of heart, Cooper states: [...] "He pulls out a knife. That changes the situation - the dynamic changes immediately. He could do something really horrible to her - it's not necessarily about killing someone, he could slash her face or anything. In a situation like that, your mind plays tricks as <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what someone could do to you." [...] Cooper has spoken of her feelings of responsibility to portray it correctly and stated [...] "I wanted to show how horrendous it was for Jacqui. She wonders whether she could die like this - all to protect her family…" ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Hochman of Los Angeles Times {{credited}} the album's catchy melodies {{for being}} smartly and effectively handled, commenting that [...] "it almost makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> {{what would have}} happened if Television and Peter Frampton had worked together". Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, although the band [...] "can still knock out a noisy punk stomper when the mood strikes" [...] like on the track [...] "Sleepin Around", the cleaner and quieter melodies are the ones that [...] "really rip up your emotions". Slants Jimmy Newlin stated similar pros, noting that [...] "quiet is the new loud", and felt that the band's shift towards romantic poignancy was [...] "a welcome growth as the band advances well into its second decade of existence".|$|E
500|$|... "Is It Scary" [...] {{generally}} received {{positive to}} mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Jim Farber, {{writer for the}} New York Daily News, commented that [...] "Is It Scary' boasts a few innovative sounds but no real melodies". Roger Catlin of The Hartford Courant stated that [...] "the most intriguing pairing" [...] was [...] "Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Is It Scary" [...] because Jackson [...] "asks those who've only read about him in tabloids if he seems monstrous". Anthony , a writer for The Buffalo News, remarked that Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mixs songs [...] "Superfly Sister", [...] "Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Is It Scary" [...] were [...] "programmed plastic soul that makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how someone as talented as Jackson can churn out such tracks".|$|E

500|$|Leslie Felprin of The Hollywood Reporter {{praised the}} film as an [...] "affecting if {{somewhat}} soft-soaped comedy drama, elevated by excellent performances." [...] The Reporter wrote that [...] "Emma Thompson takes charge of {{the central role of}} P. L. Travers with an authority that makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how anybody else could ever have been considered." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has all the makings of an irresistible backstage tale, and it's been brought to the screen with a surplus of old-fashioned Disney showmanship...", and that Tom Hanks's portrayal captured Walt Disney's [...] "folksy charisma and canny powers of persuasion— at once father, confessor and the shrewdest of businessmen." [...] Overall, he praised {{the film as}} [...] "very rich in its sense of creative people and their spirit of self-reinvention." ...|$|E

[...] Kim Alessi from Common Sense Media considered the music video for [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] worth seeing for its caricature of contemporary Asian and American urban lifestyles, but also warned that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] contains sexually suggestive images and [...] "degrading messages" [...] which could be inappropriate for children and teenagers.|$|E
500|$|For {{background}} Boyd {{read all}} the Bond stories in chronological order; and had researched Fleming and the literary Bond's background. Boyd was a child when his father introduced him to Fleming's works. As a result, Boyd found himself also becoming fascinated with Ian Fleming. He told reporters that {{he was interested in}} Bond as a human being. [...] "Bond is not just a superhero. He has flaws, he has weaknesses, he makes mistakes.... That was Fleming's genius." [...] The novel is set in 1969 when Bond is 45; Boyd intentionally picked the year, further adding that [...] "there are no gimmicks, it's a real spy story." [...] Boyd criticised how the filmmakers have portrayed Bond onscreen as a [...] "cartoon character"; he also believes that Bond should be [...] "troubled and a massive boozer." [...] The novel reflects Boyd's view, where Bond [...] "drinks enough to float a boat. He drinks so much <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> that he ever has the time or inclination to do anything else".|$|E

500|$|The main titles were {{designed}} by Nick Livesey, {{a graduate of the}} Royal College of Art who worked for one of Scott's production companies in London. The sequence, shot in Florence by Livesey himself was intended as the film's second promotional trailer. The studio thought it not [...] "quite right", but it remained on Scott's mind and would eventually end up as the main title sequence. Livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence early one morning which, in the final cut, would morph into the face of Hannibal Lecter. Scott believed it a good idea, as it fundamentally asked the question: 'Where is Hannibal Lecter?' Scott explains: [...] "And of course this story tells it, with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere, where <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> where that is...and there he is his face appears." [...] The titles are said to have been influenced by the film Seven.|$|E
500|$|Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. While calling the case-of-the-week [...] "predictable", the {{reviewer}} also called Keith and Alicia's new relationship [...] "perhaps the most fun" [...] {{part of the}} episode. In addition, Kaiser commented on Veronica and Logan's relationship. [...] "I'm not entirely sold on the relationship, either from a character point of view or a quality point of view. Obviously it's just a kiss {{in the heat of}} the moment…but it doesn't seem to have much motivation beyond [...]" [...] IGN placed the episode 2nd in its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, second to only [...] "Leave It to Beaver". The publication praised the new Logan-Veronica dynamic and said [...] "The few episodes just before this one showed the softer, vulnerable side of Logan and just when <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> if he's really so bad, he saves the day and an innocent peck turned into a passionate embrace." ...|$|E
500|$|The film drew {{a number}} of {{negative}} reactions from the film critics. Subhra Gupta gave the film a half-star out of five in The Indian Express, saying [...] "After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> if there's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick. Or are we heading for a third-time-in-Mumbai-Tibara?" [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 out of five stars, describing the film as the [...] "equivalent of getting a root canal". He criticised the naivety of the three leads: Kumar for his [...] "in-your-face flamboyance", Khan for playing an [...] "urban rich kid slumming it out at a dress-up party" [...] and both for [...] "rat-a-tat punch lines", but praised Sonali Bendre's cameo as Mumtaz. Mohar Basu gave the film two out of five stars in Koimoi, criticising the melodrama and the [...] "lacklustre chemistry", remarking that the film [...] "lacks the effervescence and naturalness of its prequel".|$|E

500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{returning}} for the sequel, Larter was chosen by New Line Cinema over her co-star Devon Sawa, who played as Alex Browning in the first film. [...] "We’ve brought back Clear in an interesting way and we just felt that to bring both of them back would make <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> too much just what the hell they’d {{been doing for the}} past few months," [...] producer Craig Perry conveyed on developing the cliffhanger of Final Destination. Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script. As a result, Sawa's character was killed off-screen in Final Destination 2, as divulged by Clear to Kimberly during their first meeting.|$|E
500|$|The Post {{was worried}} about how the episode would affect Pakistan: [...] "This is going to ratchet up {{religious}} sentiments, and could lead to increased polarization between the moderates and extremists in the country, the former including General Musharraf {{under the banner of}} 'enlightened moderation'." [...] The Islam newspaper criticised the government, stating, [...] "The government cannot absolve itself of the tragedy. If it wanted, the matter could have been resolved at the start. But this was not done and, {{for the first time in}} the history of Pakistan, our own security forces not only bombarded a mosque and religious seminary, but also brought in armored personnel carriers, tanks and helicopter gunships in numbers that made <b>you</b> <b>wonder.</b> This shows that all this activity was masterminded by some satanic minds. This incident is tragic, shameful and dangerous. How much it has harmed the country and the nation, and how worse an impact it will leave on the country on the future, can at this point only be imagined." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} game's combat and pacing. G4 called the game's combat [...] "sublime," [...] {{and said that}} [...] "no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such {{interesting}} and intricate tactical combat." [...] GameSpot called it [...] "expertly paced." [...] PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that [...] "the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight." [...] The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that [...] "IWD II has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game is it more apparent than with character development," [...] and PC Gamer said it had [...] "a dazzling implementation of the D 3rd Edition rules." [...] GameSpot called the interface [...] "a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games," [...] and IGN said that [...] "the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> why they weren't thought of before."

5000|$|The film beautifully {{exposes the}} materialistic {{attitude}} of people.

500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage commented overall {{that the}} episode was [...] "about as deliciously old-fashioned as new Who gets," [...] {{stating that the}} script was [...] "a deftly simple premise that makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> why you didn't think of it yourself", and that Tate's {{character}} {{moved away from the}} caricature in [...] "The Runaway Bride". Wright also praised Agyeman for [...] "effortlessly" [...] portraying Martha and her evil cloned counterpart. A fan of the Sontarans, Wright reacted positively to their return and redesign. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy rated the episode four stars out of five. Rawson-Jones felt the narrative was well plotted and paced, and felt Helen Raynor's writing had improved from [...] "Daleks in Manhattan". Rawson-Jones also praised the reintroductions of UNIT, Martha, Donna's family and the Sontarans, the interaction between Donna and Martha, and Christopher Ryan's portrayal of Staal, but felt Skorr's voice was [...] "distinctly lacklustre." [...] The episode's direction by Douglas Mackinnon also received criticism, particularly the scenes in the clone room. In the end, Rawson-Jones felt that the first part's effectiveness lies on how much the viewers wish to tune in to see [...] "The Poison Sky".|$|E
500|$|Minot's full NSI {{took place}} {{beginning}} on 17 May 2008, and {{was conducted by}} inspectors from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the USAF's Air Combat Command (ACC). On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed {{in the area of}} nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, [...] "Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some things we need to work on in the areas of training and discipline". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, [...] "It makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base." [...] Minot passed the follow-up inspection on 15 August 2008.|$|E
500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions.

Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out.

[...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E
