In a 2002 interview, guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy." [...] Vs. was the first Pearl Jam album to have production duties handled by producer Brendan O'Brien. It was also the band's first album with drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who had joined the band in August 1991 and toured for the album Ten. Rehearsals for Vs. began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in Seattle, Washington. The band then moved to The Site in Nicasio, California in March 1993 to begin recording.

He wrote and directed the one-off radio sitcom [...] "The Bitter Half" [...] for Stern's Howard 101 in 2006. Simon had his own show on Radioio.

500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path.

[...] The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in Mexico, and just one day after they sent it out for consideration, 20th Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin greenlit the screenplay.

The U.S. military originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's Area 51 references.|$|E

500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do {{at the beginning of the}} game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in that you do not know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E

[...] PewDiePie's stunt received negative reception from Fortune. The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who has noticed that his videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting {{him as much as}} he thinks they should." [...] On 18 December 2016, he received a Ruby Play Button from YouTube as a reward for hitting 50 million subscribers.|$|E
500|$|... "Make Your Move" [...] {{was written}} by Mac Powell and {{composed}} by Third Day. It was produced and programmed by Paul Moak, while Moak also engineering the song along with Andy Hunt. [...] "Make Your Move" [...] was recorded at The Quarry in Kennesaw, Georgia. with additional recording conducted at The Smokestack in Nashville, Tennessee. Mixing was handled by F. Reid Shippen at Robot Lemon in Nashville, Tennessee, while mastering was handled by Chris Athens at Sterling Sound in New York City. [...] "Make Your Move" [...] is a southern rock song with a length of three minutes and forty-five seconds. It is set in common time in the key of E minor and has a moderately fast tempo of 142 beats per minute, with a vocal range spanning from D4-E5. The song is propelled by a heavy kick drum, also featuring a grunge-influenced half time chorus and distorted vocals during the bridge; the vocals also take on a [...] "muffled" [...] effect. Lyrically, [...] "Make Your Move" [...] depicts evangelism {{from the perspective of}} a non-believer, with the non-believer urging: [...] "You got love and I got time / Won't <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> move before I change my mind".|$|E

500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E
500|$|Antonov {{described}} his inspiration from London as [...] "a big metropolis, it's messy, it's chaotic and intense...and it's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans". He highlighted {{the importance of}} that familiarity to different cultures because [...] "you want to communicate {{to a lot of}} people when <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> new piece of fiction". He said that Edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs, which were combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov said was not comparable to the brass, rivets, and steam of steampunk design. Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh for research, taking photographs of people, places, and objects. The pair avoided the busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that would better suit the game's world. Mitton stated: [...] "We were trying to design the game from a rat's viewpoint...if we have a small city, from a constrained viewpoint, what are all the different angles that we can explore?". Inspiration also came from the artwork of John Atkinson Grimshaw, Canaletto, and Gustave Doré. The world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so the designers were clear on where each mission takes place.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore decided next {{to star in}} Hamlet on stage, with Arthur Hopkins directing. They {{spent six}} months preparing, cutting over 1,250 lines from the text as they did so, and Barrymore opted to play Hamlet as [...] "a man's man", {{according}} to Norden. Barrymore later described his Hamlet as a [...] "normal, healthy, lusty young fellow who simply got into a mess that was too thick for him... {{he was a great}} fencer, an athlete, a man who led an active, healthy life. How can <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sickly half-wit out of a man like that?" [...] Barrymore again used Carrington as a vocal coach; rehearsals started in October, and the play opened on November 16. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. Woollcott, writing for the New York Herald, opined that it was [...] "an evening that will be memorable {{in the history of the}} American theater". while John Corbin, the drama critic for The New York Times, agreed, writing that [...] "in all likelihood we have a new and a lasting Hamlet". The reviewer for Brooklyn Life stated that Barrymore had [...] "doubtless won the right to be called the greatest living American tragedian". In 1963, Orson Welles said that Barrymore was the best Hamlet he had seen, describing the character as [...] "not so much princely– he was a man of genius who happened to be a prince, and he was tender, and virile, and witty, and dangerous".|$|E

One person makes a mistake and this happens. You [...] have to get killed if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> mistake. It was madness." [...] Former Formula One and IndyCar driver Mark Blundell agreed, claiming that the Las Vegas circuit was unsuitable for IndyCar racing – this was the last race for the Dallara IR05 – while NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson called for the series to leave oval racing altogether, though he clarified his statement by saying that the open-wheel type cars on a resurfaced [...] track built for the heavier Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series cars was a bad idea. However, former champion Mario Andretti said that the accident was a [...] "freakish" [...] one-off incident and that facilities at the circuit were adequate for racing. While he admitted surprise that more drivers were not seriously injured, he also cautioned against what he called [...] "knee-jerk reactions" [...] to the accident, calling for any changes to the sport to be carefully considered before being introduced, rather than being rushed into action. Former Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) President Max Mosley, a long-time advocate of increased safety in motorsport, agreed with Andretti, urging a [...] "calm and scientific" [...] approach to any proposed changes, particularly when asked about the proposed introduction of closed canopies for open-wheel racing cars.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{previously}} {{announcing his}} international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Antonio Conte, Pirlo {{returned to the}} Italian squad. On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second Euro 2016 qualifying match, which ended in a 2–1 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy. Pirlo assisted Chiellini's first goal of the match from a corner kick. In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1–0 home victory over Malta on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy; this was his final international appearance. In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan. On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. Regarding their omission, Conte commented in a press conference: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint". In response to Conte's comments, Pirlo stated to Sky Italia: [...] "I have spoken to Conte {{and there is no}} disappointment on my part, he knows {{what he has to do}} and what he should not do. We had discussions during the season and both parties made their own decisions. He is the coach and it's only right he makes his decisions and decides what is best for him. I hope Italy win although the favourites are other teams such as Germany, Spain and France." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of the game's {{inspiration}} {{came from}} the fantasy worlds that the lyrics and album covers of metal bands implied but rarely made it to music videos, thus allowing Brütal Legend to [...] "fulfill the promise" [...] of such lore. Schafer also credits a Megadeth roadie named Tony he once met as having given him the idea to make a game about a roadie, with the character of Eddie Riggs becoming a re-imagined version of him. Schafer had previously explored {{the idea of a}} roadie sent back in time with the character of Hoagie from Day of the Tentacle, but Brütal Legend represented an opportunity to expand on it further. The 2003 movie School of Rock also reminded Schafer of his idea for Brütal Legend, and made him more excited to publish it. [...] Double Fine's philosophy on game development was also another reason for Brütal Legends creation, as Schafer has stated that his team attempts to make each game radically different from the company's previous release, contrasting Brütal Legend to Psychonauts. Schafer stated that the commercial tie-ins of Brütal Legend, such as [...] "hot babes and Jack Black", is due to this philosophy and not due to market pressures. Schafer was not concerned about the commercial success of Brütal Legend, as despite poor sales of Psychonauts, [...] "as long as <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> cool game, publishers want to talk to you". When Schafer was pitching the game before 2006, he received feedback about changing the game's style to hip hop or country. He credits Harmonix Music Systems for influencing the rhythm game market through the release of the widely successful Guitar Hero with a soundtrack that heavily emphasized metal music; with the popularity of Guitar Hero, the metal approach in Brütal Legend was readily accepted.|$|E
