25|$|One of {{his drawing}} pupils was Margaret Lindsay, eldest {{daughter}} of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick and Amelia Murray (granddaughter to David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont and sister to the naval officer John Lindsay). He later eloped {{with her and}} on 1 March 1752 they married in the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh; her father never forgave her for marrying an artist. Ramsay already had to maintain a daughter from his previous marriage and his two surviving sisters, but told Sir Alexander that he could provide Margaret with an annual income of £100. He said it would increase ‘as my affairs increase, and I thank God, {{they are in a}} way of increasing’ and that his only motive for the marriage was ‘my love for <b>your</b> <b>Daughter,</b> who, I am sensible, is entitled to much more than ever I shall have to bestow upon her’. Three children survived from their long and happy marriage, Amelia (1755–1813), Charlotte (1758–1818?), and John (1768–1845).|$|E

[...] "I wrote it in about three minutes", states Dickinson, [...] "I don't know where the title 'Bring <b>Your</b> <b>Daughter</b> to the Slaughter' came from, but it just popped into my head. I thought, 'Bloody hell, straight out of AC/DC!' And I thought, Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah, that'll do.' Impressed with the results, Zomba asked Dickinson if he was willing to record a whole album as well. With the same line-up and producer, Dickinson's solo debut, Tattooed Millionaire, was written and recorded within two weeks, and released in May 1990, followed by a supporting tour.|$|E

500|$|Oldham contrasted the Rolling Stones' {{independence}} {{with the}} Beatles' obligation to record in EMI's studios, saying {{it made them}} appear as [...] "mere mortals... sweating in the studio for the man".

He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as [...] "Would you let <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> marry a Rolling Stone?", although Wyman says [...] "Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally.... never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively". In a 1972 interview, Wyman stated [...] "We were the first pop group to break away from the whole Cliff Richard thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called {{the scene where}} the office realizes Michael's loneliness [...] "absolutely one of the saddest moments I've seen in recent memory" [...] and noted that [...] "you can't help but feel for him". M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A". Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict called the entry [...] "another great episode" [...] for the series and awarded it an [...] "A–". He noted that by bringing the supporting characters' kids into the office [...] "hilarity ensues". Babish applauded {{the lack of an}} arching plot, allowing [...] "Michael's faux pas" [...] to take center stage. Michael Sciannamea of AOLTV called [...] "Take <b>Your</b> <b>Daughter</b> to Work Day" [...] the [...] "best episode yet this season" [...] and noted that [...] "the writers will be hard-pressed {{to come up with a}} better story than this one." [...] Sciannamea called [...] "the transformation of Michael's indifference over the kids to one of acceptance and pure enjoyment of having them around" [...] as the [...] "most interesting aspect of the episode".

500|$|Other {{members of}} the Enterprise crew include James Doohan as chief {{engineer}} Montgomery Scott, Walter Koenig as navigator Pavel Chekov, and Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, the communications officer. Uhura was supposed to give a dramatic speech in Klingon during the film, but midway through production the element was scrapped and a scene where Uhura is speaking garbled Klingon, surrounded by books, was added for extra humour. Nichols protested the scene, wondering why there were still books in the 23rd century, but accepted the change since {{it would be the}} last Star Trek film she would appear in. Nichols was more uncomfortable with some of the dialogue's racial undertones. Her character was originally to speak the line, [...] "Guess who's coming to dinner," [...] as the Klingons arrive on the Enterprise, but refused to say the part and it was given to Koenig's character instead. Nichols also refused to say the line [...] "yes, but would you like <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> to marry one [...] ", and it was dropped from the film altogether. George Takei also returned as former helmsman Hikaru Sulu, though his character is now commander of the USS Excelsior, which includes former Enterprise yeoman Janice Rand (again played by Grace Lee Whitney) as a communications officer.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included three cut scenes from [...] "Company Picnic" [...] {{within a week}} of its original release. The first clip, one minute and fifty seconds long, is an extended sequence of company picnic scenes, including Michael talking about how excited he is to see Holly, Stanley convincing Creed to stand in his sunlight to provide shade, and Dwight and Andy mocking the Utica team by calling them [...] "You-sucks-ti-ca!" [...] The clip also featured a brief appearance of Meredith's son Jake, played by Spencer Daniels, who has not appeared in the show since the second season episode, [...] "Take <b>Your</b> <b>Daughter</b> to Work Day"; after he rudely and pointedly addresses her by her first name, Meredith orders him to spend the picnic locked in their car. In the second one-minute long deleted scene clip, Andy yells at his volleyball teammates when they make a mistake, a Buffalo branch player snaps at his own team, and Charles makes fun of Jim from the sidelines. In the third 30-second clip, Dwight bullies and pesters everyone about the final point of the volleyball game against corporate, prompting Meredith to throw the game by throwing the ball at Dwight during her serve. Within a week of the original broadcast of [...] "Company Picnic", the official NBC store website made the red Scranton branch T-shirts and black New York City corporate T-shirts worn by characters in the episode available for sale.|$|E
