500|$|It was in New Hampshire where Huntsman adopted his new [...] "Country First" [...] {{campaign}} slogan. The slogan was {{borrowed from}} John McCain's 2008 campaign, though {{the context of}} the slogan was different. Huntsman, who, as Governor of Utah at the time, endorsed McCain over Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, had hoped McCain would return the favor; however, McCain endorsed Romney in a rally at Manchester's Manchester Central High School on January 4. Huntsman later characterized McCain's endorsement of his main rival as a [...] "petty betrayal". He told McCain [...] "I don't care if you support Romney, that's great – but just to have given me the dignity of waiting until after the New Hampshire primary." [...] McCain replied, [...] "I didn't mean to offend. I hope <b>your</b> <b>family</b> <b>is</b> well." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, {{the song}} is {{influenced}} by the Sly and the Family Stone track [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971). It starts as the sound of slap bass plays along with sequenced synth bass, as Madonna sings the opening lines, [...] "Keep, keep it together, keep people together forever and ever". As the first verse starts, a guitar comes into play with Madonna's voice being backed by percussion and banjo. After the second chorus comes near the end, Madonna utters the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They hold the key, To your heart and your soul, Don't forget that <b>your</b> <b>family</b> <b>is</b> gold", the percussion sound is thinned out and a mixture of the sound from a live drummer and conga comes into the picture. The song ends with the main groove sound gradually fading out.|$|E

[...] He became exceedingly pessimistic about the outlook for his command and he complained frequently to Washington, D.C. about shortages while providing exaggerated estimates {{of the strength of}} the rebel forces. [...] Critical press reports appeared about him after an October visit to Louisville by the secretary of war, Simon Cameron, and in early November 1861 Sherman insisted that he be relieved. [...] He was promptly replaced by Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell and transferred to St. Louis, Missouri. [...] In December, he was put on leave by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, commander of the Department of the Missouri, who considered him unfit for duty. [...] Sherman went to Lancaster, Ohio, to recuperate. [...] While he was at home, his wife Ellen wrote to his brother, Senator John Sherman, seeking advice. [...] She complained of [...] "that melancholy insanity to which <b>your</b> <b>family</b> <b>is</b> subject". [...] Sherman later wrote that the concerns of command [...] "broke me down", and he admitted contemplating suicide. [...] His problems were compounded when the Cincinnati Commercial described him as [...] "insane".|$|E
