5|$|The lungs {{also play}} {{a pivotal role in}} speech by {{providing}} air and airflow for the creation of vocal sounds. Lungs also provide the airflow that enables the expression of many emotions such as sighing, <b>yawning,</b> sobbing, laughing in humans and the vocal sounds in other animals.|$|E
5|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} patch of grass, the right-hand figure's toothed mouth is stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester {{has suggested that}} it may be <b>yawning.</b> Its mouth is open to a degree impossible for a human skull. The orange background of this panel is brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames, and the figure's neck opens up into a row of teeth, while a protruding ear juts out from behind its lower jaw. This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon, Untitled, c. 1943, which was thought destroyed until it re-emerged in 1997.|$|E
60|$|The Tiger {{looked at}} him {{steadily}} and then <b>yawned</b> a wide, wide <b>yawn.</b>|$|R
60|$|He <b>yawned,</b> {{went out}} {{to look at the}} thermometer, slammed the door, patted her head, unbuttoned his waistcoat, <b>yawned,</b> wound the clock, went down to look at the furnace, <b>yawned,</b> and clumped up-stairs to bed, casually {{scratching}} his thick woolen undershirt.|$|R
60|$|This <b>yawn</b> was so effusive that Dougall, {{refusing to}} be led even by sympathy, <b>yawned</b> {{internally}} with his lips closed and swallowed it.|$|R
5|$|Tomb of Horrors is an {{adventure}} module written by Gary Gygax for the Dungeons & Dragons (D) role-playing game. It was originally written for and {{used at the}} 1975 Origins1 convention. Gygax designed the adventure both to challenge the skill of expert players in his own campaign, and to test players who boasted of having mighty player characters able to best any challenge. The module, coded S1, {{was the first in}} the S-series, or special series of modules. Several versions of the adventure have been published, the first in 1978, and the most recent, for the fifth edition of D, in 2017 as one of the included adventures in Tales from the <b>Yawning</b> Portal. The module also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The gods then {{do battle}} with the invaders: Odin is {{swallowed}} whole and alive fighting the wolf Fenrir, causing his wife Frigg her second great sorrow (the first being {{the death of her}} son, the god Baldr). Odin's son Víðarr avenges his father by rending Fenrir's jaws apart and stabbing it in the heart with his spear, thus killing the wolf. The serpent Jörmungandr opens its gaping maw, <b>yawning</b> widely in the air, and is met in combat by Thor. Thor, also a son of Odin and described here as protector of the earth, furiously fights the serpent, defeating it, but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing. The god Freyr fights Surtr and loses. After this, people flee their homes, and the sun becomes black while the earth sinks into the sea, the stars vanish, steam rises, and flames touch the heavens.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed <b>yawning</b> and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
60|$|Walter Upton {{pushed aside}} books and papers, <b>yawned,</b> stretched, <b>yawned</b> again, then settled {{back in his}} chair comfortably, his hands clasped behind his head.|$|R
60|$|She {{began to}} <b>yawn,</b> for after her {{simulation}} of vivid {{interest in them}} the visit {{of the young men}} had fatigued her. In the midst of her <b>yawn</b> her daughter went out of the room, with an impatient gesture, and she suspended the <b>yawn</b> long enough to smile, and then finished it.|$|R
60|$|On {{the second}} time of wakening Ruby rose to a sitting posture, <b>yawned,</b> looked about him, <b>yawned</b> again, {{wondered}} what o'clock it was, and then listened.|$|R
5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts <b>yawning,</b> a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
25|$|Few {{hundreds}} {{have filled}} such a <b>yawning</b> gap...Dexter so dominated a stand with Barrington {{that more than}} two-thirds of the 161 runs came from his masterful bat before he was stumped trying to lift Simpson's leg-break on to some distant fairway.|$|E
25|$|The airway of Dis is there, {{and through}} the <b>yawning</b> gates the pathless route is revealed. Once you cross the threshold, you are {{committed}} to the unswerving course that takes you to the very Regia of Orcus. But you shouldn’t go emptyhanded through the shadows past this point, but rather carry cakes of honeyed barley in both hands, and transport two coins in your mouth.|$|E
6000|$|Soon after, Jack {{moved his}} bulky frame, rolled round, threw out his arms, and <b>yawned.</b> The <b>yawn</b> awakened Buckley, who {{immediately}} followed suit--such is {{the force of}} example! ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{day they}} paid more {{attention}} than usual when they heard her talk, and put their ears close to {{a crack in the}} wall between the rooms, and heard the Queen say quite plainly, 'When I <b>yawn</b> a little, then I am a nice little maiden; when I <b>yawn</b> half-way, then I am half a troll; and when I <b>yawn</b> fully, then I am a troll altogether.' ...|$|R
60|$|But as we floated on, {{it looked}} the place described. We <b>yawned,</b> and <b>yawned,</b> as crews of vessels may; as in warm Indian seas, their {{winnowing}} sails all swoon, when by them glides some opium argosie.|$|R
25|$|As {{with other}} opiate-based pain killers, chronic use of codeine can cause {{physical}} dependence. When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur {{if a person}} suddenly stops the medication. Withdrawal symptoms include: drug craving, runny nose, <b>yawning,</b> sweating, insomnia, weakness, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle spasms, chills, irritability, and pain. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, long-term users should gradually reduce their codeine medication {{under the supervision of}} a healthcare professional.|$|E
25|$|After the vacuous traveller, an idle lord appears, <b>yawning</b> {{with the}} pain of sitting on an easy chair. He does nothing at all. Immediately after him, Annius speaks. He is the natural {{predator}} for idling nobles, for he is a forger of antiquities (named for Annio di Viterbo) who teaches the nobles to value their false Roman coins above their houses and their forged Virgil manuscripts above their own clothing. He serves Dulness by teaching her servants to vaunt their stupidity with their wealth.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} of {{citalopram}} include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased sex drive, anorgasmia, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive <b>yawning,</b> severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime {{rather than in the}} morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares.|$|E
60|$|The young woman, whose eyelids were {{apparently}} inclined to fall {{together on the}} smallest provocation of silence, <b>yawned</b> without parting her lips to any inconvenient extent, whereupon Gabriel caught the infection and slightly <b>yawned</b> in sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|Bartley <b>yawned</b> a <b>yawn</b> of {{satisfied}} sleepiness, {{and rubbed}} {{his hand over his}} face. [...] "I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "if I'm going to write anything about Camp Kinney, I had better see all there is to see." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Yawn</b> {{is one of}} {{the common}} fatigue sign phenomena. The common {{technique}} to detect <b>yawn</b> is based upon the measurement of mouth opening. However, the spontaneous human action to cover the mouth during <b>yawn</b> can prevent such measurements. This paper presents a new technique to detect the covered mouth by employing the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features. Subsequently, the facial distortions during the <b>yawn</b> process are identified by measuring the changes of wrinkles using Sobel edges detector. In this research the Strathclyde Facial Fatigue (SFF) database that contains genuine fatigue signs is used for training, testing and evaluation of the developed algorithms. This database was created from sleep deprivation experiments that involved twenty participants...|$|R
25|$|His {{concern to}} provide music for children, already noted, was pursued in Little Songs for Little Voices {{published}} in three volumes, including 76 short and simple songs. They were his earliest compositions and appeared in Aunt Judy's Magazine, edited first by his mother, then by his sister. Two of these songs, The Sneezing Song and Three Little Pigs were sung by Scott-Gatty {{himself in a}} concert at Doncaster Grammar School on 21 June 1870, long before they were published. He sang Three Little Pigs again in 1871 along with Camomile Tea, Tittle Tattle and The <b>Yawning</b> Song.|$|E
25|$|During {{the speech}} former General {{secretary}} Jiang Zemin seemed very tired, was constantly <b>yawning,</b> {{and was not}} paying much attention. Jiang seldom talked to Wen Jiabao, who was sitting to his left. Wen was paying full attention to Hu's speech for its entire length. Hong Kong media noted that Jiang left the Great Hall without shaking anyone's hand, {{and that no one}} came up to shake his. Surprisingly, Mao's successor Hua Guofeng also attended the Congress as a delegate. All the surviving members of the 14th and 15th PSC's were present, including former Premiers Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, but with the exception of Jiang rival Qiao Shi.|$|E
25|$|Activists such as Alex Au, {{a member}} of People Like Us, the first gay {{equality}} organisation in Singapore, saw {{the potential of the}} Internet as a vehicle to unite the gay community and foment intellectual discussion. The Singapore Gay News List (SigNeL) was started on 15 March 1997 and has been instrumental in discussing issues of interest to the community. On 15 October 1998, RedQuEEn!, an e-mail list for queer-identified women was established. Au also launched his <b>Yawning</b> Bread website in November 1996, to which he would contribute the most thorough analyses of issues facing the local gay community. It would also serve as a defacto chronicle of Singapore gay issues and history as they unfolded.|$|E

6000|$|While she worked, Toto sat by {{the hearth}} and growled low at Crinklink, and Crinklink sat {{in his chair and}} growled at Dorothy because she moved so slowly. He {{expected}} her to break a dish any minute, but as the hours passed away and this did not happen Crinklink began to grow sleepy. It was tiresome watching the girl wash dishes and often he glanced longingly at the tiny bed. Now he began to <b>yawn,</b> and he <b>yawned</b> and <b>yawned</b> until finally he said: ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} that attempt to explain why humans and other animals <b>yawn.</b> It is likely that there {{are a number}} of triggers for the behavior. However, there are comparatively few theories that attempt to explain the primary evolutionary reason for the <b>yawn.</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} wide intraregional disparities. Women make up 52% of {{researchers}} in the Philippines and Thailand, for instance, and are close to parity in Malaysia and Viet Nam, yet only one in three researchers is a woman in Indonesia and Singapore. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, two countries characterized by high researcher densities and technological sophistication, as few as 15% and 18% of researchers respectively are women. These are the lowest ratios {{among members of the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Republic of Korea also has the widest gap among OECD members in remuneration between men and women researchers (39%). There is also a <b>yawning</b> gap in Japan (29%).|$|E
25|$|Contracting muscles produce {{vibration}} and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions {{per second}} (equivalent to 10 to 30Hz sound frequency). Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (equivalent to 30 to 70Hz sound frequency). The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one's muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound {{can be heard}} by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound. Some individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. The rumbling sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed as when <b>yawning</b> deeply.|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} symptoms associated with morphine addiction are usually experienced {{shortly before the}} time of the next scheduled dose, sometimes within as early as a few hours (usually 6h to 12h) after the last administration. Early symptoms include watery eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, runny nose, <b>yawning,</b> dysphoria, sweating, and in some cases a strong drug craving. Severe headache, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tremors, and even stronger and more intense drug craving appear as the syndrome progresses. Severe depression and vomiting are very common. During the acute withdrawal period, systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase, usually beyond premorphine levels, and heart rate increases, which have potential to cause a heart attack, blood clot, or stroke.|$|E
