5|$|The {{extreme length}} of Æthelberht's reign {{also has been}} {{regarded}} with skepticism by historians; {{it has been suggested}} that he died in the fifty-sixth <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life, rather than the fifty-sixth <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign. This would place the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> birth approximately at 560, and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and Æthelberht also solve another possible problem: Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburh, seems likely to have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at Æthelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.|$|E

5|$|The {{rise of the}} Hittite {{kingdom in}} the north posed {{the biggest threat to}} Yamhad, {{although}} Yarim-Lim III and his successor Hammurabi III were able to withstand the aggressions of the Hittite king Hattusili I through alliances with the Hurrian principalities. Hattusili chose not to attack Halab directly and began with conquering Yamhad's vassals and allies, starting with Alalakh in the second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Syrian campaigns c. 1650 BC (Middle chronology) or slightly later. Hattusili then turned to attack the Hurrians in Urshu northeast of Halab, and won in spite of military support from Halab and Carchemish for the Hurrians. The Hittite king then defeated Yamhad in the battle of Mount Atalur, and sacked Hassum along with several other Hurrian cities in the sixth <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Syrian wars. After many campaigns, Hattusili I finally attacked Halab during the reign of Hammurabi III. The attack ended in a defeat, the wounding of the Hittite king and his later death c. 1620 BC. Hattusili's campaigns considerably weakened Yamhad, causing it to decline in status: the monarch ceased to be styled a Great King.|$|E

5|$|After {{a disappointing}} season, the Rockets {{had to make}} some {{significant}} changes to their roster. Howard wasn't happy with his role and the team overall still lacked an identity.

Harden reaffirmed {{his commitment to the}} franchise when he signed a four-year, $118.1 million contract extension in July.
