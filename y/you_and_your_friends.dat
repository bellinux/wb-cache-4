2500|$|On 8 January 1896, in {{conversation}} with L. A. Tollemache, Gladstone explained that: [...] "I am not so much afraid of Democracy or of Science as of the love of money. This {{seems to me to}} be a growing evil. Also, there is a danger from the growth of that dreadful military spirit". On 13 January, Gladstone claimed he had strong Conservative instincts and that [...] "In all matters of custom and tradition, even the Tories look upon me as the chief Conservative that is". On 15 January Gladstone wrote to James Bryce, describing himself as [...] "a dead man, one fundamentally a Peelâ€“Cobden man". In 1896, in his last noteworthy speech, he denounced Armenian massacres by Ottomans in a talk delivered at Liverpool. On 2 January 1897, Gladstone wrote to Francis Hirst on being unable to draft a preface to a book on liberalism: [...] "I venture on assuring you that I regard the design formed by <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> with sincere interest, and in particular wish well to all the efforts you may make on behalf of individual freedom and independence as opposed to what is termed Collectivism".|$|E
2500|$|On 13 May 1938, {{while riding}} his {{motorcycle}} {{down the streets}} of Tokyo, a very intoxicated Sorge clashed into a wall and was badly injured. As Sorge was carrying around notes {{given to him by}} Ozaki at the time, had the police discovered the documents his cover would have been blown, but a member of his spy ring was able to get the hospital to remove the documents before the police arrived. In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan was due to over-zealous officers in the Kwantung Army and there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war with the Soviet Union. Unaware that Berzin had been shot as a [...] "Trotskyite" [...] in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938 reading: [...] "Dear Comrade! Don't worry about us. Although we are terribly tired and tense, nevertheless we are disciplined, obedient, decisive and devoted fellows who are ready to carry out the tasks connected with our great mission. I send sincere greetings to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends.</b> I request you to forward the attached letter and greetings to my wife. Please, take the time to see to her welfare". Sorge never learned that his friend Berzin had been shot as a traitor.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is nothing. It has no {{connection}} with this hideous business to-night. If <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> will sit down, I will tell you all I can.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{have some}} friends here,' replied Mr. Winkle, 'and I should {{not like to}} leave them to-night. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> will join us at the Bull.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish, Mr. Caldigate, I could invite <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> to come astern {{among us}} sometimes, {{but it would}} be {{contrary}} to rule.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in," [...] she said, {{leading the}} way inside. [...] "Even sweethearts are {{forgotten}} after a time, but <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> are welcome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's been {{annoying}} for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends,</b> I reckon. What {{about the}} other girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I have {{no doubt}} he will be {{committed}} after his next appearance, Bill; {{but what is the}} plan that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> Luke were thinking of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} much subdued. You don't thank me, I dare say, for keeping <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> here; but <b>you</b> couldn't go, you know, until father returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the Temple, Mr Morley, {{asking for}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> more than once. I {{think you had}} better go up. I know he wishes to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to give the order to entrain. This is my compartment. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> had better slip into your places at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I am {{very glad}} I can do any thing, however slight, to please <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends.</b> I like them all; but {{particularly}} Lady Corisande." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Without a doubt," [...] he admitted, [...] "it {{would be}} more {{comfortable}} for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> {{to feel that the}} document in question was no longer in existence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't say so!" [...] exclaimed Joe, laughing; [...] "why, Bob, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> {{act with}} as much promptitude {{as if you had}} been {{regularly}} trained in the Fire-Brigade." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And perhaps <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> will join, too?" [...] said Clarence timidly to the {{passenger}} who had explained; [...] "and you too, sir?" [...] he added to the dark man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Beckendorff never takes {{anything}} {{after his}} noon meal, sir; but I {{am sure that}} if <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> are hungry, sir, I hope there is never a want in this house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have fought}} against this divorce, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends,</b> so zealously. Yet your {{life has been}} unhappy. Release could {{scarcely}} have been anything but a relief to you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you lose, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> {{will find}} the Butte pretty hot. But you feel you have a chance, a {{fighting}} chance, and you mean to take it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, Randy; I {{can walk}} {{a good way}} now I've found a friend." [...] Fred arose {{as quickly as he}} could. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> all {{together}} yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{said nothing}} during {{the moment in}} which she met my eyes; but then: [...] "Time, it seems to me, is exactly what <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> want. If <b>you</b> haven't talked with her--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you think," [...] he asks, sternly, [...] "'that I am fool {{enough to}} disturb the Master over his books for such a little matter as {{bringing}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> into this house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was alone}} with his aide-de-camp and in his coach," [...] {{retorted}} St. Genis, [...] "whilst that traitor Emery, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> Mr. Clyffurde were on horseback--you gave him the slip easily enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] Vine answered, [...] "that I {{need not}} enter into too close details. It is a {{document}} which <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> signed at Phineas Duge's house, not many nights ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's nonsense," [...] said Hetty. [...] "How could I go myself? <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> haven't made {{everybody}} nice {{to everybody}} yet. I'm not going, anyway, {{and if you}} worry me I'll be cross." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she replied}} in a lifeless tone, which {{nevertheless}} had in it {{a touch of}} bitterness, [...] "I guess there's no reason why <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> should have known he was sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I trust I {{shall have}} the {{pleasure}} of seeing <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> at my rooms, and of spending a pleasant evening with you, after this awkward mistake,' said the little doctor; 'are you disengaged this evening?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{same spirit}} appears to animate <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> Sir Richard Fulke," [...] Rupert said quietly. [...] "He {{did not care}} about {{fighting}} a boy, and so employed a dozen of his soldiers to murder him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To Versailles. The king {{will be on}} fire to {{know how}} we have fared. You have the best right to tell him, since without <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> yonder {{it would have been}} but a sorry tale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{lieutenant}} and I {{count on}} leaving the fort shortly before midnight. If <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> have {{any desire to}} see us set out, {{go down to the}} new works at about that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't doubt it. But I won't trouble you--so <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> {{can just}} lie {{back and enjoy}} yourselves," [...] {{returned}} Jasper Van Blott, smoothly. [...] "No use in working, when you are on a vacation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Trust a {{woman to}} have the best of it,' muttered Merton admiringly. 'And now, Clancy, may I offer a hasty luncheon to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> before we go to Lord's? Your {{business}} has been rather rapidly despatched.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Start {{by telling}} me what you did yesterday, before I met <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> {{on the road to}} this place," [...] replied Mr. Hawbury. [...] "We will say, <b>you</b> got up <b>and</b> had <b>your</b> breakfast. What next?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better {{wait and}} see the game first, but don't forget that we've got {{to turn up the}} two men who whipped <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> last night, or stand the chance of being hauled up for the robbery ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{have heard}} is so {{extraordinary}} {{as to be}} almost incomprehensible," [...] he said. [...] "It seems that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> must have spent a very large {{amount of money to}} set these fourteen boys at liberty." ...|$|R
