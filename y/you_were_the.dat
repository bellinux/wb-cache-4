Like many of Swift's songs, the lyrics invoke princess imagery with lines such as [...] "Today was a fairytale/ <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> prince/ I {{used to be}} a damsel in distress." [...] Bertoldi said the lyrics were [...] "driven more by sweeping emotion than [...] specific, youth-focused imagery". Occasionally, Swift does interrupt the fairytale construct with modern day, real world details like the time her date arrives or the color of his shirt.|$|E

500|$|Sir George Edward Wade, CBE (20 September 1869– 29 November 1954), known professionally as George Robey, was an English comedian, {{singer and}} actor in musical theatre, who {{became known as}} one of the {{greatest}} music hall performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a comedian, Robey mixed everyday situations and observations with comic absurdity. Apart from his music hall acts, he was a popular Christmas pantomime performer in the English provinces, where he excelled in the dame roles. He scored notable successes in musical revues during and after the First World War, particularly with the song [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> Only Girl (In the World)", which he performed with Violet Loraine in the revue The Bing Boys Are Here (1916). One of his best-known original characters in his six-decade long career was the Prime Minister of Mirth.|$|E
500|$|Davuluri, {{the first}} Indian American {{to win the}} Miss America pageant (and the second Miss New York in a row), held the title of Miss America 2014 from September 15, 2013 to September 14, 2014. In doing so, she {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} a previous Miss Syracuse/Miss New York, Vanessa Williams, who (as Miss America 1984) was the first African American winner of the pageant. She is also the second Asian American contestant to be crowned Miss America (the first was Filipino American Angela Perez Baraquio in 2001). NPR's Michael Martin commented on this aspect of her win by noting that “there were five Asian-Americans competing for the crown. That's the highest number in pageant history. Three of you were in the top five. Two of <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> finalists, and this in a contest where initially the requirements were that contestants be of good health and of the white race." ...|$|E
500|$|By the First World War, {{music hall}} {{entertainment}} {{had fallen out}} of favour with audiences. Theatrical historians blame the music hall's decline on the increasing salaries of performers and the halls' inability to present profitably the twenty or thirty acts that the audiences expected to see. [...] Revue appealed to wartime audiences, and Robey decided to capitalise on the medium's popularity. Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue The Bing Boys Are Here at the Alhambra Theatre, London. Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre. He was cast as Lucius Bing opposite Violet Loraine, who played his love interest Emma, and the couple duetted in the show's signature song [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> Only Girl (In the World)", which became an international success.|$|E

500|$|In June 1951, now aged 81, Robey {{starred in}} a midnight gala {{performance}} at the London Palladium in aid {{of the family of}} Sid Field who had died that year. For the finale, Robey performed [...] "I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened" [...] and [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> Only Girl in the World"; the rest of the three-hour performance featured celebrities from the radio, television and film mediums. The American comedian Danny Kaye, who was also engaged for the performance, called Robey a [...] "great, great artist". The same month, Robey returned to Birmingham, where he opened a garden party at St. Mary and St. Ambrose Church, a venue in which he had appeared {{at the beginning of his}} career. [...] On 25 September he appeared for the BBC on an edition of the radio series Desert Island Discs for which he chose among others [...] "Mondo ladro", Falstaff's rueful complaint about the wicked world in Verdi's opera Falstaff. [...] For the rest of the year Robey made a number of personal appearances opening fetes and attending charity events.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1919, Robey {{completed}} a book of memoirs, My Rest Cure, which was published later that year. During the run of Joy Bells he was awarded the Legion of Honour for raising £14,000 for the French Red Cross. He declined a knighthood that same year because, according to Cotes, he was worried that the title would distance him from his working-class audiences; he was appointed a CBE by George V at Buckingham Palace instead. On the morning of the penultimate Joy Bells performance, Robey was invited to Stoll's London office, where he was offered a role in a new revue at the Alhambra Theatre. On the journey, he met the theatre impresario Sir Alfred Butt, who agreed to pay him £100 more, but out of loyalty to Stoll, he declined the offer and resumed his £600 a week contract at the Alhambra. On 28 July 1919, Robey took part in his second Royal Command Performance, at the London Coliseum. [...] He and Loraine sang [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> Only Girl (In the World)".|$|E
500|$|Along with Spears's {{performance}} specifically, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was generally}} well received by television critics. In television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoler Seitz's 2016 book TV (The Book), Sepinwall singles out this episode (along with Slap Bet) as episodes where he [...] "will still laugh, and be touched, and marvel at just how inventive a traditional-looking sitcom can be". [...] Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted is a master of romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> one being wooed. I wanted to like it more than I did. Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce heavy on the trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode, adding that the show returned to full form.|$|E

500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{that was}} written by Clarkson, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke and {{produced}} by the latter two. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F sharp minor with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from F#3 to F#5. The bridge was {{the only part of}} the song that was written by Dr. Luke and Martin together with Clarkson face to face. The song begins with Clarkson wailing [...] "oh oh oh" [...] over a restless percussion. In the first verse, the music becomes quiet to focus on Clarkson's vocal as she wails [...] "Seems like just yesterday/You were a part of me/I used to stand so tall/I used to be so strong/Your arms around me tight/Everything it felt so right/Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong." [...] During the chorus, the sound of electronic guitar is dominant as she vocalizes [...] "Here I am/Once again/I’m torn into pieces/Can’t deny it/Can’t pretend/Just thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> one/Broken up deep inside/But you won’t get to see the tears I cry/Behind these hazel eyes."

500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E
500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this is what a post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E
