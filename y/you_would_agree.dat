2500|$|At 8:05pm EDT, {{the letter}} drafted {{earlier in the}} day was delivered. The message read, [...] "As I read your letter, the key {{elements}} of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba." [...] The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be [...] "delayed." [...] With the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. However, as Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to [...] "have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there." ...|$|E
6000|$|HESTER. I didn't {{know you}} had heard it. But I knew <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with me. A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn't she? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with me {{when you}} understood," [...] murmured Diana, and her {{expression}} was so smug and satisfied that Patsy was seized with an irresistible spirit of mischief.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is greater}} humbug," [...] said Rachel. [...] "But I knew <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>agree,</b> at least beforehand, it is {{appreciation}} that I want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I {{must not}} say. In any case <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>agree</b> with me. Wasn't it you who once scoffed at my idyll in the wilderness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Jonas, [...] "I will. And I {{wish that}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>agree</b> {{to sell him}} to any body else, without letting me know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was in {{hope that}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> {{to let our}} {{marriage}} be known,' said Swithin, with some disappointment. 'I thought that these circumstances would make the reason for doing so doubly strong.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. But I am not {{the keeper}} of his conscience. Come, Anne, if this affair did not concern Leslie--if it were a purely {{abstract}} case, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with me,--you know you would." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lawford {{took out}} his watch, 'You are really very kind,' he said. 'But, perhaps--well, {{whatever}} that history may be, I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> that mine is even--but, there, I've talked too much about myself already. Perhaps to-morrow?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} {{permission}} to think, Sir Peregrine," [...] said Mr. Furnival, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>agree</b> with Mr. Graham {{if you had}} given to the matter much deep consideration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} wish mean?" [...] she asked. [...] "Do {{you mean that}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>agree</b> with me, or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like to be twenty-nine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{certainly}} beautiful," [...] said Theodora. [...] "But, do you know, I do {{not feel}} altogether content in these fine gardens? The principle of exclusion on which they are all founded is to me depressing. I require in all things sympathy. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> not <b>agree</b> with me in this. The manners of your country are founded on exclusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is no necessity,' {{said the}} Duke, 'to fly from Miss Dacre for amusement. By-the-bye, {{you make a}} good repartee. You must permit me to {{introduce}} you to my friend, Lord Squib. I am sure <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Montfort sprang {{forward with}} a glance radiant with hope and energy, and kissed her on both cheeks. [...] "Dearest Lady Roehampton," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "dearest Myra! I knew <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with me. Yes! it must be done." ...|$|E
60|$|CRAMPTON (subsiding piteously). I didn't mean you, my dear. (Pleading earnestly to Bohun.) But the {{two younger}} ones! {{you have not}} seen them, Mr. Bohun; and indeed I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with {{me that there is}} {{something}} very noticeable, something almost gay and frivolous in their style of dressing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's just it!' he said vehemently. 'It is a trap--you feel it so, {{and that}} though you wouldn't {{be able to}} get away from me you might {{particularly}} wish to! Ah, if I had asked you two years ago <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>agreed</b> instantly. But I thought I was bound to wait for the proposal to come from you as the superior!' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> {{there is}} no basic {{difference}} here on intervening—on federal government intervening {{in what might be}} seen by others to be a private financial crisis? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is {{something}} that I had set my heart on, though I hardly like to propose it on so short an acquaintance; but from what people have told me, I thought that you and I might keep house together comfortably, if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> only <b>agree</b> to try. I have several fields belonging to me, {{and if they are}} kept well watered they bear wonderful crops.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it is all}} we can do to {{make him}} wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with me that he needed it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Tommy thoughtfully. [...] "Though {{infinitely}} simpler for me, I did {{not really}} think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> to that plan. Very well, we must arrange a compromise. How would it be if you attached little Conrad here to my person. He's a faithful fellow, and very ready with the fist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{did want}} to consult you, mother. But then, you see, he wanted to consult his books even more, and he knew very well that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with him; {{and you know you}} would too. So please don't say {{anything}} more about it, but let Ruth run upstairs and see to our things at once.|$|E
5000|$|If Iraq's {{president}} Saddam Hussein {{were found}} to be developing weapons of mass destruction, Governor Bush has said he would, quote, [...] "Take him out." [...] <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with such a deadly policy? ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{explains}} some {{portions of}} Dooyeweerd’s positive philosophy which author has found useful in understanding IS. It covers Dooyeweerd’s theory of modal spheres (aspects), {{his theory of}} things, his theory of knowing, experience and assumptions, and, {{on the basis of}} these, it draws together his approach to everyday life. What it does not cover is his notion of cosmic time and the relationship between the self and the Divine, nor his extensive discussion of the State. As a result of its different flavour, Dooyeweerd’s philosophy is able to give due respect to ontology, epistemology, philosophical ethics, methodology and anthropology. 3. 1 DOOYEWEERD’S THEORY OF MODAL ASPECTS If you were to reflect on what you are doing now, reading this, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> most probably <b>agree</b> that there is a lingual aspect to what you are doing. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>agree</b> there is also a biotic aspect [...] you are breathing, digesting food, etc. Generosity in your reading...|$|R

6000|$|Gerard {{was very}} awkward in {{conveying}} his meaning to his father. [...] "And as," [...] he continued,--"as it {{must come to}} me, I suppose, some day, {{and it will be}} the proper sort of thing that we should live there then, I thought that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> that if we went and lived there now {{it would be a good}} sort of thing to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No doubt, {{but it has}} its {{disadvantages}} now and then, as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> if a {{crowd of}} savage strikers had chased you about your mill. Then, if it weren’t for my business ties, I’d send the captain word to get steam up on the yacht, and take you all {{to the land of}} mist and glaciers, where you can get fresh air to breathe.” ...|$|E
60|$|CYRIL. I {{think that}} view might be questioned. I am rather {{inclined}} to believe in 'the impulse from a vernal wood,' though of course the artistic value of such an impulse depends entirely {{on the kind of}} temperament that receives it, so that the return to Nature would come to mean simply the advance to a great personality. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with that, I fancy. However, proceed with your article.|$|E
6000|$|... "You give me credit, I fear," [...] she said, [...] "for being a cleverer woman than I am, but as {{a matter}} of curiosity, supposing I am able to hand you over Jeanne very shortly, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to double the little amount we have spoken of?" ...|$|R
50|$|In November 1822 he {{commissioned}} Beethoven {{to write}} string quartets. He wrote in French from Saint Petersburg to the composer:Being as passionate an amateur as {{an admirer of}} your talent, I am taking the liberty of writing to you to ask <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be willing to compose one, two or three new quartets. I shall be delighted to pay you for the trouble whatever amount <b>you</b> <b>would</b> deem adequate.Beethoven <b>agreed</b> to this, requesting 50 ducats for each quartet.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{not much}} {{ceremony}} between us, before I told her all the material circumstances that had happened in her absence, especially about the girl's imprisonments which she had contrived, and how she had got my letter at the Quaker's, the very day she had been there. [...] "Well," [...] says Amy, when I had told her all, [...] "I find nothing is to ensue, if she lives, but your ruin; <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>agree</b> to her death, so I will not make myself uneasy about her life; {{it might have been}} rectified, but you were angry with me for giving you the best of counsel, viz., when I proposed to murder her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Mabel. I {{was quite}} sure that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with us, {{but at the same}} time I thought it was right before we refused the offer you should know that it was made. Whatever our sentiments on the subject might be, we should not have been {{justified}} in refusing without your knowledge an offer that might, from a worldly point of view, be your interest to accept." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} is free. Of course such a {{marriage}} never {{can take place}} now. It is quite out of the question. You {{say that it is}} all over, and you are quite right. Why not let this be settled in a friendly way between you and me, so that we might be friends again? I should be so glad to help you in your difficulties if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with me about this." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{gunpowder}} {{is strong}} sometimes: but not always. You may carry it in a flask, {{or in your}} hand, and then it is weak enough. It only becomes strong by being turned into gas and steam. But steam is always strong. And {{if you look at}} a railway engine, still more if you had ever seen--which God forbid you should--a boiler explosion, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with me, that the strongest thing we know of in the world is steam.|$|E
5000|$|... "Lynne from Floydian_Hemptress asks: <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> {{that the}} instrumental, Let's Get Metaphysical, on your About Face cd, was a precurser to the later alleged phenomenon, known as Pink Floyd's Publius Enigma? sicDavid Gilmour: No {{it had nothing}} to do with it, there was no connection. The second thing was some silly record company thing that they thought up to puzzle people with." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} example, the four bytes represent a KLV set where {{the key is}} one byte, the length field is one byte (or possibly BER - you cannot tell from the example), and the value is two bytes: a zero and a three. In your application <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have previously <b>agreed</b> to a) use one-byte keys and b) use one-byte length encoding. Also presumably the key value [...] "42" [...] would mean something to you, perhaps it indicates that the value bytes 0x00 and 0x03 are an integer representing {{the value of your}} bicycle's odometer.|$|R
40|$|JUST imagine: Your boss {{asks you}} to run a series of special {{training}} days for other employees. At first you feel rather flattered that your boss is considering you for this task. But you soon realise that there are costs involved: for one, {{it is clear that}} you are expected to prepare for the training in your own time, for no extra payment. What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> do if this happened to <b>you?</b> <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> take on the job without a second thought? Or, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to do it with a mind to how it <b>would</b> help <b>you</b> get that promotion you are after? Or, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> tell your boss to find someone else for the job? One of the factors in your decision in this example, and many others like it, will be your position within the organisation. To what degree are you ‘prototypical’...|$|R
