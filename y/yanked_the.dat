5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane <b>yanked</b> <b>the</b> car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E
25|$|Mercury-Redstone 1A and Mercury-Redstone 2 both {{experienced}} overacceleration in flight, {{the former}} {{due to a}} problem with an accelerometer, the latter due to {{a problem with the}} LOX regulator which oversupplied the engine with oxidizer and caused thrust termination to occur 1.2 seconds early. The ASIS system activated and the escape tower <b>yanked</b> <b>the</b> capsule away, subjecting its chimpanzee passenger to high G loads. The third flight, Mercury-Redstone BD, was designed as an engineering test to correct these problems before the booster could be considered man-rated.|$|E

2500|$|Xiahou Dun {{lost his}} left eye {{when he was a}} hit by a stray arrow during a battle against Lü Bu in the late 190s, and {{subsequently}} became known among the rank and file as [...] "Blind Xiahou".

2500|$|Just 24 {{hours after}} being re-activated, Cowgirl was sent {{on a mission}} {{alongside}} pilots [...] "Sugarsnap" [...] and [...] "Whims" [...] to take down {{the same group of}} terrorists that took her captive. During the mission her jet was hit and the Air Force lost contact, causing Jordan to go after her, in his Green Lantern guise, when he found out. When he made it to the crash site and nearby camp {{there was no sign of}} her, the terrorists having immediately taken off with her in a jeep when they realized the Green Lantern was coming. Cowgirl <b>yanked</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel, sending the jeep into a tree and herself into a frozen lake, from which she was saved by Hal Jordan, whom she recognized beneath the mask.

2500|$|In the {{commentary}} booth, the producers supplied only one microphone to Walker and Hunt, {{to avoid them}} talking over each other. On one occasion, Hunt wanted the microphone {{and went up to}} Walker, who had continued for longer than expected, and grabbed him by the collar, with Walker having his fist near to Hunt. On another occasion, Hunt grabbed the microphone cord and cracked it like a whip, which <b>yanked</b> <b>the</b> microphone out of Walker's hand. Viewers were regularly exposed to his knowledge, insights and dry sense of humour during broadcasts, bringing him a whole new fan base. He was famous for 'rubbishing' drivers he did not think were trying hard enough – during the BBC's live broadcast of the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix he described René Arnoux's comments that non-turbo cars didn't suit the Frenchman's driving skills as [...] "bullshit". He also had a reputation for speaking out against back-markers who held up race leaders and not holding back on any of his commentaries - {{in sharp contrast to the}} gentlemanly Walker.|$|E

I whipped out my note-book and pawed around among the floral tributes, turn-ing up the tickets on the wreaths and seeing who had sent them.

5000|$|Like that era’s “site constructions,” Peterson’s bum (bad) shelters blended {{architecture}} and landscape, further expanding sculpture {{into the realm}} of practical art, which Carrie Rickey recognized as dangerous territory in 1980. Peter Plagens noted, “Practicality—actually, survival—obviously trumped aesthetics in the demimonde of the downtown homeless. Almost immediately someone <b>yanked</b> <b>the</b> sculpture out of its hole, laid it flat on the ground, and slept in it.” [...] Envisioning a future where artists remade our world, Constance Mallinson responded thus to his art in 1980: “In an over-populated, polluted, resource-depleted world, the visionary power of artists in environmental engineering, urban planning, industrial designing, sociology and behavioral psychology could help solve persistent social dilemmas.” ...|$|E

He completed 15 hazardous extractions, was wounded in a barrage of enemy fire and momentarily lost control of his helicopter, but when it was over, he had rescued 29 men, for which he would be awarded the Medal of Honor.
