25|$|In Rationality in Action (2001), Searle {{argues that}} {{standard}} notions of rationality are badly flawed. According {{to what he}} calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something like a train track: you get on at one point with <b>your</b> <b>beliefs</b> and desires and the rules of rationality compel you all the way to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.|$|E

In this article Wynter argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe, which would prevent Britain from sending sufficient resources to Singapore. He contended that Singapore was vulnerable, especially to attack from the land and the air, and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN. [...] "Henceforward", wrote Australian official historian Lionel Wigmore, [...] "the attitude of the leading thinkers in the Australian Army towards British assurances that an adequate fleet would be sent to Singapore at the critical time was (bluntly stated): 'We do not doubt that you are sincere in <b>your</b> <b>beliefs</b> but, frankly, we do not think {{you will be able to}} do it.|$|E

40|$|On many {{traditional}} theories of <b>belief,</b> <b>your</b> <b>belief</b> state {{is represented by}} an assignment of credences to propositions, or sets of possible worlds. If you are rational, your credence distribution will be a probability measure. Traditional theories of belief fit with a standard Bayesian theory of rational belief change: on learning a proposition, you must update <b>your</b> <b>belief</b> state by conditionalizing your credence distribution on the proposition you learn. That is, you must update by assigning 0 credence to those worlds incompatible with what you learn, and re-normalizing your credence distribution over the remaining worlds. Following Quine 1969, Lewis 1979 argues that we should instead represent <b>your</b> <b>belief</b> state by an assignment of credences to sets of centered worlds: world-timeindividual triples. For instance, if you have. 5 credence that it is 3 : 00 pm, <b>your</b> <b>belief</b> state should be represented by a measure that assigns. 5 to the set of centered worlds with that time coordinate. Unlike traditional theories of belief, Lewis’s theory does not fit with a standard Bayesian theory of rational belief change. For instance, Bayesian conditionalization preserves certainties...|$|R

500|$|American Idiot is {{a concept}} album that {{describes}} {{the story of a}} central character named Jesus of Suburbia, an anti-hero created by Billie Joe Armstrong. It is written {{from the perspective of a}} lower-middle-class suburban American teen, raised on a diet of [...] "soda pop and Ritalin." [...] Jesus of Suburbia hates his town and those close to him, so he leaves for the city. The second character introduced in the story is St. Jimmy, a [...] "swaggering punk rock freedom fighter par excellence." [...] Whatsername, [...] "a 'Mother Revolution' figure," [...] is introduced as a nemesis of St. Jimmy in the song [...] "She's a Rebel". The album's story is largely indeterminate, as the group was unsure of where to lead the plot's third quarter. In this sense, Armstrong decided to leave the ending up to the listeners' imagination. The two secondary characters exemplify the record's main theme—"rage versus love"—in that while St. Jimmy is driven by [...] "rebellion and self-destruction," [...] Whatsername is focused on [...] "following <b>your</b> <b>beliefs</b> and ethics." [...] Jesus of Suburbia eventually decides to follow the latter, resulting in the figurative suicide of St. Jimmy, which is revealed to be a facet of his personality. In the album's final song, Jesus of Suburbia loses his connection with Whatsername as well, to the point in which he can't even remember her name.|$|E

'We have lost the joy and power that makes real disciples and we've become consumers of religion, not disciples of Jesus-Christ', he said.

[...] The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that the decision [...] "swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees." [...] A Fox News columnist wrote, [...] "..., with all of the debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees? They are just as important, and should not be trampled upon." [...] The director of the United Church of Christ's Washington, D.C. office, {{said that the}} ruling [...] "may embolden private employers to claim religious objections to particular health care services, in effect forcing their own religious views upon their employees." [...] Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, [...] "It's the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means that the ... corporation's employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees." [...] The Center for American Progress said that the ruling [...] "moves in the direction this court has been moving already, which is talking about corporate personhood—really treating corporations like people, saying that the corporation has a religion itself and that should be imposed on its employees." [...] Interfaith Alliance leader Rev. Welton Gaddy said, [...] "The First Amendment is at its best when it is used {{to protect the rights of}} minorities from the whims of the powerful.
