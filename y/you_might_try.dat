60|$|SIR PETER. A {{very honest}} confession--truly--but pray madam was there {{no one else}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>tried</b> to ensnare but me.|$|R
5000|$|Im not {{an expert}} but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> want to <b>try</b> {{restarting}} your computer. (clause) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>try</b> {{to rewrite}} Hamlet. It {{will be a}} waste of time.|$|R
6000|$|... "The use of my Christian name," [...] she murmured, [...] "would perhaps {{make your}} persuasions more effective. At any rate, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try.</b> I have never {{forbidden}} {{you to use}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it will be}} too late," [...] I sobbed wildly. [...] "The {{wedding is}} to be at twelve--and it's nearly that now--and oh, Johnny, I do think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> to comfort me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is one chance," [...] she answered, [...] "a sort of forlorn hope, but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> it. He has a secretary, a {{young man}} named Aynesworth. If he were on our side--" ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. Oh, {{all that}} means nothing. <b>You</b> fool. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>try</b> with your bare hands {{to stop the}} flow of the Yangtze.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm GOOD enough,' the King said, 'only I'm {{not strong}} enough. You see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>try</b> {{to stop a}} Bandersnatch!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want Lillian to ride soon, and Roger {{is rather}} old for an escort {{to such a}} little horsewoman. Don't <b>you</b> think we <b>might</b> <b>try</b> Paul?" [...] she said, turning to Hester.|$|R
6000|$|Through a tiny hole in {{the plate}} of the {{distributor}} he dripped two drops of oil--only two drops. [...] "I guess maybe that's what it needed. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> her now, and see how she runs," [...] he said mildly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] agreed Ghek; [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try.</b> I do {{not wish}} you to try. Possibly {{it will be better}} if we return to the tower at once. It would go hard with me should you escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{find a way}} out of it," [...] {{said the}} skipper, confidently. [...] "Meantime, just as an {{exercise}} for your wits, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> and puzzle out what would be the best thing to do in such a case." ...|$|E
50|$|Many law reviews, {{other legal}} {{journals}} and magazines, and legal newspapers place content on the web. Not all law journals provide their {{text on the}} web, however.

6000|$|... "That will do all right. I {{carry this}} big bore double-barrelled pistol loaded with slugs. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>try</b> to stop {{one of these}} fellows with a pea-shooter as with a service revolver." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What I {{was going}} to suggest," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Maturin, quietly, [...] "was that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> Silliston. There's {{a chance for a}} good stenographer there, and I'm sure you are a good one. So many of the professors send to Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at any rate, Mike, as {{we shall}} most likely land at Cork, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> to find your sister out. If she went through the siege, she will {{know the names of}} many of the officers. She may have heard of a Kennedy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why,' {{said the}} Dodo, 'the {{best way to}} explain it is to do it.' (And, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> like to <b>try</b> the thing yourself, some winter day, I {{will tell you how}} the Dodo managed it.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Petru, my dear brother,' {{at length}} said Florea, 'would {{it not be}} better if we carried the water for <b>you?</b> Some one <b>might</b> <b>try</b> to take it from you on the road, while no one would suspect us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you needn't," [...] said Asaph. [...] "It won't do no good. If {{you don't}} have me to back <b>you</b> up <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>try</b> to twist that tree as to move her. You can't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--that is just it. And {{therefore}} {{she might}} come round without accounting for it. At any rate, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try.</b> You might {{tell her that}} it is ruining me;--that I shall have to go about wandering over all the world because she is so hard-hearted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> to pump him, Patsy, {{and see if}} you can get him to talk of the murder. Some {{careless}} remark {{might give}} us just the clue we need and guide us to the real criminal. That would free Thomas from all suspicion, you see." ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. By Jove! You can be {{the most}} maddening thing in all the world! [Taking up a pack of cards, he lets them fall with a long slithering flutter] After {{behaving}} as you have this evening, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> to make some amends, I should think.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes; <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>try</b> to say {{something}} cheerful, which might {{do away with the}} impression. Not that I think it will be of any use; only do not let him think it has been under discussion." ...|$|R

I didn't know what you would do. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> have <b>tried</b> to follow me and I didn't think I could run--not up hill--not then." ...|$|R
40|$|Sometimes one {{supercomputer}} is not enough. Or {{your local}} supercomputers are busy, or not configured for your job. Or you don't have any supercomputers. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> be <b>trying</b> to simulate worldwide weather changes in real time, requiring more compute power {{than you could}} get from any one machine. Or <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be collecting microbiological samples on an island, and need to examine them with a special microscope located {{on the other side}} of the continent. These are the times when you need a computational grid...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a vaquero in yonder field," [...] said Christie's escort, who {{was riding}} {{with her a}} little {{in advance of the}} others, [...] "and those fellows know every trail that a horse can follow. I'll ride on, {{intercept}} him, and try my Spanish on him. If I miss him, as he's galloping on, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> your hand on him yourself. He'll understand your eyes, Miss Carr, in any language." ...|$|E
6000|$|The clerk {{handed her}} an envelope, which she opened. [...] "I {{hope to be}} able to send you your grandfather's address very soon," [...] wrote O'Gorman. [...] "You will {{probably}} stay in Dorfield; perhaps with the Conants, with whom you lived before. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> sending Colonel Weatherby a letter in care of Oscar Lawler, at Los Angeles, California. In any event, don't forget my card or neglect to wire me in case of emergency." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] he said, while Sarah Quintal {{assisted}} {{to get out}} {{the bait}} and Bessy Mills to arrange the line. [...] "No, no, we don't want no idlers here. You be off to the rocks, Matt and Dan, an' see what you can catch. Remember, he who won't work shall not eat. There should be lots o' crawfish about, or <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>try</b> for a red-snapper. Now, be off, both of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You had for me; {{even for}} me,' she answered. 'I quite believe it. I {{said the words}} you have repeated, when my {{distress}} was very sharp and hard to bear; I say them now for others; but I cannot urge them for myself. You spoke to me after you had seen and watched me day by day. There was great consideration in that. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> have spoken, perhaps, more kindly; <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>tried</b> to invite my confidence by greater gentleness; but the end {{would have been the}} same.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Reviewers {{decried the}} game's lack of originality, but offered some praise for its {{aforementioned}} multiplayer mode. GameSpot said, [...] "If you're starved for more vehicular shooter action then <b>you</b> <b>might</b> want to <b>try</b> this title out." [...] They awarded this game {{a score of}} 5.4 (mediocre).|$|R
6000|$|... "And if we haven't the money," [...] remarked Euphemia, [...] "it {{would be}} of no earthly use {{to look at the}} book. It would only make us doubt our own calculations. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>try</b> to make brick without mortar, as the {{children}} of Israel did." ...|$|R
