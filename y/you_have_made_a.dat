2500|$|With the {{permission}} of the court, Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at the home of Cotton, where Reverend Davenport was also staying. [...] All week, the two ministers worked with her, and under their supervision she had written out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that brought objection from all the ministers. [...] She stood at the next meeting, on Thursday, 22 March and read her recantation to the congregation. [...] Following more accusations, the proposal was made for excommunication, and the silence of the congregation allowed it to proceed. [...] Wilson delivered the final address, [...] "Forasmuch as you, Mrs. Hutchinson, have highly transgressed and offended... and troubled the Church with your Errors and have drawen away many a poor soule, and have upheld your Revelations; and forasmuch as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> Lye...

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Unesco Courier, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the René Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne) explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy, as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: [...] "Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him {{to do the same for}} you tomorrow. Once <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity." [...] Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—"economic rationality"—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by [...] "economic rationality." [...] This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{summoned the}} generals to his office, and Khánh sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Vice Admiral Cang, the {{commander}} of the navy. He asked the four to sit down and then asked [...] "Do all of you understand English?". The ambassador then angrily denounced the generals. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal" [...] and said that [...] "... <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you do things like this." [...] Taylor believed that the HNC was {{an essential part of the}} governance of the country, because as an American, he believed that civilian legitimacy was necessary. He declared that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity to the HNC or another civilian institution, then aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Hồ Chí Minh trail that was being used to infiltrate communists into the south would be suspended.|$|E
2500|$|Originally from Chicago, Illinois, Lewis {{had several}} run-ins {{with the law}} during the 1880s and early 90s. In 1880, Lewis was arrested for the {{shooting}} of Boston thief Billy Flynn in Detroit but was acquitted by a jury who ruled he had acted in self-defense. He later made the acquaintance of Gen. John A. Logan and, one night while dining {{with him at the}} Fifth Avenue Hotel, a hotel detective informed Logan of Lewis's identity. Logan scoffed at the detective's claim and remarked [...] "Why sir, that man is one of my best friends. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> terrible mistake here". Lewis excused himself after borrowing $500 from him and disappeared. He similarly befriended Charles Francis Adams and lured the elderly man into a Boston Common banco game where he and his friends swindled him out of several thousand dollars. Later in Philadelphia, he represented himself to Samuel J. Randall as the son of banker A.J. Drexel. He was apparently so convincing that, when the actual son of Drexel called on the house by chance, Ramsden believed the young man was the impostor and threw him out of his home.
