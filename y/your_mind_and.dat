Streep lived with actor John Cazale for three years until his death from lung cancer in March 1978. Streep said of his death, [...] "I didn't get over it. I don't want to get over it.

Jesus tells {{his followers to}} adhere to Jewish law, although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the Sabbath. When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: [...] "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all <b>your</b> <b>mind...</b> <b>And</b> a second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself" [...] (...) [...] Other ethical teachings of Jesus include , refraining from hatred and lust, turning the other cheek, and forgiving people who have sinned against you (Matthew 5–7).|$|E

500|$|The band {{said that}} while {{producing}} the song, they attempted to find out [...] "how to make dance music" [...] without turning themselves into a dance act. Armstrong {{said it was the}} first time the band had written a dance song. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter. It blows <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> pisses you off. It’s a song about being drunk, going through this chaos, feeling fucked up and all you want to do is get more drunk".|$|E
500|$|Among Dylan's contemporaries, Phil Ochs was {{impressed}} by Highway 61, explaining: [...] "It's {{the kind of music}} that plants a seed in <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> then you have to hear it several times. And as you go over it you start to hear more and more things. He's done something that's left the whole field ridiculously in the back of him." [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine described Highway 61 as [...] "one of those albums that changed everything", and placed it at numberfour in its list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time".

500|$|The musicians {{created the}} album tracks through {{improvisation}} and experimentation. As a result, the initial plan {{to release a}} single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material. Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He stated that Reznor's instructions to him were to [...] "build a drumkit. Piece together any stuff {{that you want to}} bang on; rent what you want to rent. Have fun and... be creative—See where <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> your ideas take you." [...] Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and a cookie tray with a chain across it. Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from Ghosts for his contributions on guitar, bass guitar, dulcimer, and electronics. Cortini was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and his involvement evolved from [...] "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" [...] and eventually into [...] "a collaboration on [...] tracks noted in the booklet". Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.|$|E

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E
500|$|... "The Open Boat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} discussed works in Crane's canon, and is regularly anthologized. Wilson Follett included the story in the twelfth volume of his 1927 collection of Crane's work, and it also appeared in Robert Stallman's 1952 volume Stephen Crane: An Omnibus. The story and its subsequent eponymous collections received high acclaim from contemporary critics and authors. Praising the merit of the story and his friend's literary importance, journalist Harold Frederic wrote in his review for The New York Times that [...] "even if he had written nothing else, [...] have placed [...] where he now undoubtedly stands." [...] English poet Robert Bridges likewise praised the story in his review for Life, stating that Crane [...] "has indelibly fixed the experience on <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> that is the test of a literary artisan". American Newspaperman and author Harry Esty Dounce praised the story as chief among Crane's work, despite its seemingly simple plot, writing for the New York Evening Sun that [...] "those who have read 'The Open Boat' will forget every technical feat of construction before they forget the long, heartbreaking mockery of the day, with land so near, the bailing, the egg-shell changes of seats, the terrible, steady cheerfulness and brotherhood of the queer little human group".|$|E
500|$|The first movement, [...] "" [...] (You shall love God, your Lord), carries Bach's {{statement}} {{on the most important}} law, on which, according to the parallel , [...] "hang all the law and the prophets". The words translate to [...] "You shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength and with all <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> your neighbor as yourself". Bach had enlarged on the [...] "dualism of love of God and brotherly love" [...] already in his monumental cantata in 14 movements, , {{at the beginning of his}} first cycle. In order to show the law's universality, Bach introduces Martin Luther's chorale [...] "" [...] (These are the holy ten commandments), referring to the commandments of the Old Testament, as a foundation of the movement's structure. The tune is played in a strict canon, the most rigid musical law as one more symbol. The canon is performed [...] by the trumpet in the highest range, and the continuo, representing the lowest range. The tempo of the trumpet is twice as fast as the tempo of the continuo, therefore the trumpet has time to repeat first single lines and finally the complete melody of the chorale. The trumpet enters ten times, to symbolize once more the completeness of the law. The voices, representing the law of the New Testament, engage in imitation of a theme which is derived from the chorale tune and first played by the instruments. John Eliot Gardiner, who provides an extended analysis of the movement, concludes: ...|$|E

500|$|Upon Bert Berns' death, Ilene Berns {{inherited}} the contracts of Bang Records. Morrison's annual option on his recording contract was also due {{less than a}} week after Berns' funeral. Legally bound to Bang Records, Morrison was not only kept out of the studio, but he also found himself unable to find performing work in New York as most clubs refrained from booking him, fearing reprisals. Ilene Berns then discovered that her late husband had previously been remiss in filing all the appropriate paperwork to keep Morrison (still a British citizen) in New York. She contacted Immigration and Naturalization Service and attempted to have Morrison deported. However, Morrison managed to stay in the U.S. when his then-girlfriend Janet (Planet) Rigsbee Minto agreed to marry him. Once married, Morrison and his wife moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he found work performing in local clubs. Morrison began performing with a small electric combo doing blues numbers, songs from Blowin' <b>Your</b> <b>Mind!</b> <b>and</b> from Morrison's Them band days. Two of the musicians soon left but Morrison retained the bassist, Tom Kielbania, a student at the Berklee School of Music. At that juncture, Morrison decided to try an acoustic sound, and he and Kielbania began performing shows in coffee houses in the Boston area as an acoustic duo with Morrison playing guitar and Kielbania on upright bass. [...] Before this, Morrison had primarily recorded and performed with electric musicians. The acoustic medium would provide him [...] "greater vocal improvisation and a freer, folkier feel".|$|E
