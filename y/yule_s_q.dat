40|$|Although {{empirical}} studies often use Tobin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Q</b> {{as a proxy}} for operating performance, our theoretical framework highlights its ambiguity when evaluating corporate Governance. In particular, capital in the denominator of Tobin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Q</b> is endogenous since entrenched managers can enjoy the quiet life and underinvest (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003). Firms that underinvest operate below their firm 2 ̆ 7 s profit-maximizing scale. Despite reducing a firm 2 ̆ 7 s net present value, underinvestment increases Tobin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Q.</b> Furthermore, strong governance can either decrease Tobin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Q</b> by mitigating underinvestment or increase Tobin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Q</b> by lowering costs. Therefore, the net impact of governance on Tobin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Q</b> is ambiguous. Our framework then provides measures of operating efficiency to assess a firm 2 ̆ 7 s scale decisions and cost discipline. These measures capture the benefits of acquisitions that improve scale and lower costs as well as the inefficiencies associated with empire building.

If one includes complex conjugation, then one has a group of symmetries of ζ(s) of order 4.

The stable Pontrjagin-Thom theorem identifies it with stably normally framed submanifolds of a sphere. Here we see how stable normal framings are equivalent to stable tangential framings, and so define a ring Ωfr • of stably tangentially framed manifolds with no reference to an embedding. The image of the J-homomorphism gives some easy classes in the stable stem from the stable homotopy groups of the orthogonal group. We describe some low degree classes in terms of Lie groups. At the end of the lecture we introduce the concept of a spectrum, which is basic to stable homotopy theory. A reference for this lecture is [DK, Chapter 8].
