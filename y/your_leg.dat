500|$|Staff from E! Online seemed {{impressed}} with the video's concept and choice of background scenery. They said [...] "what better place for some introspection than the desert, right? No sexy bikini-clad ladies or blue-haired Nicki Minajs to distract you, and when you're done, just call up the helicopter {{to pick you up}} (Pro tip: Hang <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> outside of the chopper for extra cool points.)". Stephen Gottlieb from Video Static said [...] "It's a nice bookend with Diddy's – then Puff Daddy – first solo video, [...] "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down," [...] which featured him and Mase introducing an era of big budget hip-hop while driving a Rolls convertible across the desert." [...] While Ed Easton Jr. from 92.3 Now FM drew comparisons to Diddy's earlier video for his 1997 hit single [...] "Been Around the World", thus awarding the video six out of ten. However Easton was annoyed with the number of videos being released and said that fans were waiting for the actual album to be released.|$|E
500|$|Lajoie led the AL in {{batting average}} {{five times in}} his career and four times {{recorded}} {{the highest number of}} hits. During several of those years with the Naps he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other, most notably coming in 1910, when the league's batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson. Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league players to record 3,000 career hits. He led the NL or AL in putouts five times in his career and assists three times. He has been called [...] "the best second baseman in the history of baseball" [...] and [...] "the most outstanding player to wear a Cleveland uniform." [...] Cy Young said, [...] "Lajoie {{was one of the most}} rugged players I ever faced. He'd take <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> off with a line drive, turn the third baseman around like a swinging door and powder the hand of the left fielder." [...] He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking". Herc has noted that [...] "breaking" [...] was also street slang of the time meaning [...] "getting excited", [...] "acting energetically," [...] or [...] "causing a disturbance". Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out <b>your</b> <b>leg.</b> Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to {{try to come up with}} something better."In the early 1980s, the media began to call this style [...] "breakdance," [...] which in 1991 the New York Times wrote was [...] "an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz." [...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|E

2500|$|James P. Allen commented [...] "Sometimes you weren't {{sure whether}} Omm Sety wasn't pulling <b>your</b> <b>leg.</b> Not {{that she was}} a phoney in what she said or {{believed}} – she was absolutely not a con artist – but she knew that some people looked on her as a crackpot, so she kind of fed into that notion and let you go either way with it...She believed enough to make it spooky, and it made you doubt your own sense of reality sometimes." [...] Barbara Lesko wrote, [...] "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance." [...] William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were [...] "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." [...] When [...] "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that she had something." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1995, Cuomo had {{extensive}} surgery {{to extend his}} left leg, which was 44mm shorter than the right. This involved the surgical breaking of the leg bone, followed by months of wearing a steel brace and painful physiotherapy sessions; the procedure affected his songwriting, as he would spend long periods hospitalized {{under the influence of}} painkillers. At the end of 1995, Cuomo enrolled in Harvard University to study classical composition. His right leg was still in a brace following surgery, and he required a cane to walk; he described it as [...] "like having, I think, about seven arrows lodged into <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> bone, and then having to walk around with them lodged in like that for thirteen months, with only Advil." [...] Between classes, Cuomo took painkillers, rested in bed, and listened to opera. He told The New York Times: [...] "The only time I could write songs was when my frozen dinner was in the microwave. The rest of the time I was doing homework." [...] He auditioned for the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum chorus but was not selected. He became introverted and grew a beard, and wrote in his diaries how students wearing Weezer T-shirts did not recognize him.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Leone of 1UP.com said of a pre-release {{version of}} the game's PS3 port at E3 2009: [...] "The first thing I noticed was that, {{at the end of}} a normal combo, you can hold down the final button in the string to {{continuously}} fire gunshots—which looks incredibly cool when you kick someone and then keep <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> pointed at their face as your foot pours bullets on it." [...] He added, [...] "I'll be amazed if Bayonetta doesn't end up being one of the best action games this year." [...] Staff at GameSpot UK were also generally impressed with the PS3 port, which they played on June 3. [...] They called the [...] "Witch Time" [...] mechanic a [...] "cool move" [...] and one of the two boss battles they fought were [...] "pretty intense", and said [...] "it's easy to see the similarities between the two over-the-top action games [...] ". [...] They added, [...] "Rampant violence and sexism is par for the course" [...] in the game. [...] 1UP's staff again played a PS3 version for 15 minutes on the weekend of August 31 that year, at PlatinumGames's [...] "Feel Bayonetta" [...] event in Tokyo's Roppongi district. [...] They said that it [...] "was very blurry" [...] compared to a 360 version displayed there, and that its frame rate [...] "was all over the place.... it was often hard to keep track of the action [...] because of the graphical issues on PS3." ...|$|E
