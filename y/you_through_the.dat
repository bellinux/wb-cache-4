500|$|In {{his opening}} scene, Cagney spoke fluent Yiddish, a {{language}} {{he had picked}} up during his boyhood in New York City. Critics praised the film. Taxi! {{was the source of}} one of Cagney's most misquoted lines; he never actually said, [...] "MMMmmm, you dirty rat!", a line commonly used by impressionists. The closest he got to it in the film was, [...] "Come out and take it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give it to <b>you</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door!" [...] The film was swiftly followed by The Crowd Roars and Winner Take All.|$|E
500|$|On January 24, {{an audio}} tape {{said to be}} from Osama bin Laden praised the bombing attempt and warned of further attacks against the United States, but did not claim {{responsibility}} for it. The short recording, which was broadcast on Al Jazeera television, said: [...] "The message delivered to <b>you</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> plane of the heroic warrior Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was a confirmation of the previous messages sent by the heroes of the September 11." [...] An adviser to the U.S. President {{said he could not}} confirm whether the voice was that of bin Laden. In the past, the CIA has usually confirmed Al Jazeera reports on tapes attributed to bin Laden.|$|E
500|$|Mega Man X {{received}} {{criticism from}} some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the EGM review panel all {{noted that the}} game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well. Super Play editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. [...] "A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see <b>you</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> harder bits," [...] Nicholson explained. [...] "Within the level you'll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit {{to put pressure on}} your performance. Couple this with a password system that records your level completion, status and weapon accumulation and you'll see we're not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player." [...] Nintendo Power criticized how little the game had changed stating that [...] "the theme remains the same as the Game Boy and NES Mega Man titles." ...|$|E

I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot <b>you</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> head." ...|$|E

In October 2009 Iommi and his colleague Ian Gillan were awarded the Orders of Honor – Armenia's highest order, which were delivered to them by the Prime Minister of Armenia for their help after the Spitak earthquake. They formed the supergroup WhoCares and recorded a single called [...] "Out of my Mind", which was released 6 May 2011 {{for the benefit of the}} music school to be built in Gyumri, Armenia.

2500|$|Favreau had a {{clear vision}} of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark {{was more of a}} rock star than a {{traditional}} superhero, and [...] "there’s Spider-man, Batman and all these superhero movies. This superhero movie’s different. I want to do something completely different, instead of going down the orchestral route. I want to do more rock and roll." [...] Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi composed several themes for the character of Tony Stark, representing his different moods and attitudes, all inspired by Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance. Other themes for the film are [...] "not so much character based, but rather plot based that carry <b>you</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> movie". Musicians John O'Brien and Rick Boston, frequent collaborators with Favreau, provided a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes for a scene where Stark attends a casino.|$|E

2500|$|During {{interviews}} {{with one of}} her official fansites, Lopez also revealed that fans could expect a mixture of musical styles like her previous albums. [...] "Expect pop records, R and a little hip hop." [...] When Billboard previewed the album in January 2010, Ben-Yehuda Ayala said [...] "Lopez sings, talk-sings and broods (within pop reason) on the subject of love," [...] while Rap-Up said it is very much in keeping with the title, [...] "a love roller coaster, taking <b>you</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ups and downs of a relationship." [...] Following her move to Island Def Jam, Lopez said she would still be pressing ahead with the album under the title Love?. [...] "I just feel like it's an endlessly fascinating topic that all my albums have been about. It's still very confusing to me and so I explore that on this album, probably more than my other albums." [...] She also revealed that her husband Marc Anthony initially disapproved of the title because he felt that it may imply that the couple were having marital problems. However in {{interviews with}} DJ Skee, she said [...] "love has always been a theme of my career and this record wasn't going to be different. The album has a lot of up-tempo, dancy, urban tracks." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} provided embarrassing {{details of}} the crime to the jury. He described how Hitchen and Williamson moved from Royal Oak in the Strand to Rummer Tavern {{and came to the}} Talbot Inn, where the under-marshal ordered a bedroom. Along the way in each bar Hitchen offered either beer or wine and showed disgraceful manners. Williamson said he wanted to leave the marshal but was not allowed to, being forced to leave his hat with him and receiving a little money in return. According to Williamson's testimony he was persuaded to follow the marshal into the room, where he [...] "did all that a beastly appetite could prompt him to". Williamson reported going to his relative, Joseph Cockrost, who took him back to the tavern and asked to be informed as soon as the prisoner appeared, which happened the following Saturday. In his testimony Cockrost mentioned knocking at the door after seeing [...] "filthy actions" [...] through the keyhole. When opening the door he took the marshal by the collar and threatened him, saying, [...] "I'll whip <b>you</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Gills" [...] when he laid his hand on the sword. Testimonies were given by a servant of the tavern proving to have seen the same scene with the prosecutor, a constable, John Carter, watchmen and some character witnesses. Interestingly, the constable opposed the watchmen, who were probably trying to accuse Williamson of inventing the story. At last, the prisoner was acquitted of actual sodomy and found guilty on the second charge, assault. For [...] "sodomitical practices" [...] Hitchen was fined [...] £20 and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment and standing in the pillory near the end of Catherine Street, in the Strand.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} review and said, [...] "Scott {{did a great}} job reviving the Roman sand-and-sandals epic when he made the Oscar-winning Gladiator. This Egyptian saga is not quite in the same league, but it confirms the director's flair of widescreen imagery. Exodus has the added kick of 3D technology, and it has enough eye-popping set pieces to please adventure fans." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was positive of the film and said, [...] "Exodus is a biblical epic that comes at you at maximum velocity but stays stirringly, inspiringly human." [...] Reagan Gavin Rasquinha of The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Exodus: Gods and Kings is 'spectacle' with a capital 'S' and in more ways than one, definitely epic." [...] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "It’s impossible not to feel some awe at the spectacle, but more shocks would have helped see <b>you</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> two-and-a-half hour running time." [...] Phillips Hawker of The Sydney Morning Herald gave a mixed review and awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying, [...] "Exodus: Gods And Kings... lacks Gladiator's full-on intensity and committed central performances, however; it's a mixture of the grand and the bland, and when it's not spectacular it's a little plodding." [...] Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "Some may well desire a purer, fuller version of the story, one more faithful to the text and less clearly shaped by the demands of the Hollywood blockbuster. But on its own grand, imperfect terms, [...] "Exodus: Gods and Kings" [...] is undeniably transporting, marked by a free-flowing visual splendor that plays to its creator’s unique strengths: Given how many faith-based movies are content to tell their audiences what to think or feel, it’s satisfying to see one whose images alone are enough to compel awestruck belief." [...] Jim Vejvoda of IGN said, [...] "Director Ridley Scott gets lost in the desert at times in Exodus: Gods and Kings, his epic, but not entirely effective take on the story of Moses' journey from Prince of Egypt to Hebrew leader." ...|$|E
