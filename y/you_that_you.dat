25|$|Hence, the {{combination}} of object te with subject você in informal BP: eu te disse para você ir (I told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should go). In addition, in all the country, the imperative forms {{may also be the}} same as the formal second-person forms, but it is argued by some that it is the third-person singular indicative which doubles as the imperative: fala o que você fez instead of fale o que você fez ("say what you did").|$|E
25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not as committed to them as you thought you were.|$|E

25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I can assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all {{in his power to}} save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E
25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|Regarding her {{approach}} to acting, Moore {{said in a}} 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: [...] "I {{want to have a}} sense of who a character is, and then I want to get there and have it happen to me on camera." [...] The aim, she said, is to [...] "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [...] to <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't bring the emotion to it... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2007, Microsoft {{issued its}} Game Content Usage Rules, a license {{intended}} {{to address the}} legal status of machinima based on its games, including the Halo series. Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, you can expect to hear from Microsoft's lawyers who will tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E
5000|$|This epistemic closure {{principle}} {{is central to}} many versions of skeptical arguments. A skeptical argument of this type will involve knowledge of some piece of widely accepted information to be knowledge, which will then be pointed out to entail knowledge of some skeptical scenario, such as the brain in a vat scenario or the cartesian evil demon scenario. A skeptic might say, for example, <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands, then <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a handless brain in a vat (because knowledge <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands implies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know you are not handless, and if <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not handless, then <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a handless brain in a vat). [...] The skeptic will then utilize this conditional to form a modus tollens argument. For example, the skeptic might make an argument like the following: ...|$|R

500|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} are two important themes in Little Busters!. The opening {{video of the}} visual novel starts with two lines written in English: [...] "What 'Adolescence' do you have?" [...] and [...] "Do you remember 'Childhood'?". Riki Naoe, the male protagonist, has four childhood friends with whom he grew up together through adolescence and still hangs out with when the story begins. Thus, friendship is another theme presented {{in the form of}} Riki's relationships with his friends in high school, and is thought to be irreplaceable. The opening video of the original visual novel contains a third line written in English, [...] "The irreplaceable one existed there," [...] though another line was added into the opening video of Little Busters!

500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858.

Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders.

When Stone approached, Sykes stated [...] "I have now the most disagreeable duty to perform that I ever hadit is to arrest you." [...] When Stone angrily asked why, Sykes said [...] "I don't know.

500|$|Following the video's premiere on MTV, Gaga {{explained}} {{some of the}} its {{scenes and}} her inspiration: [...] "The video is quite complex {{in the way that}} the story is told, and it's meant to be slightly linear and slightly twisted and confusing, which is the way that love is." [...] Regarding the sexual intercourse scenes between actor Taylor Kinney and the singer as a mermaid, Gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work. [...] "No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary between you and someone else. So that's what it's about, perceiving in your imagination that there's something magical inside of <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can make it work," [...] she said. After revealing that the wedding dress shown in the video belonged to her mother, Gaga explained the scenes involving the ice cream truck.

500|$|Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas {{was interviewed}} four times {{by members of}} the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and {{by members of the}} Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), {{accompanied}} by Pakistani officials. During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas [...] "we told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to prove it... that you are not a terrorist... you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and why you are sitting here." [...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{understands that}} co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. [...] "You often write songs with {{collaborators}} {{that you would}} never write by yourself.

One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. [...] "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness {{out of it and}} make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have [...] ". Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, Songs from the South, with [...] " [...] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?" [...] In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.|$|E
