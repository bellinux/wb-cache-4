500|$|The club {{were drawn}} in Group H, along with UEFA Cup holders Sevilla, Slavia Prague of the Czech Republic and Romania's Steaua București. Arsenal started their {{campaign}} in good stead, beating Sevilla 3–0 {{and followed the}} result with a 1–0 victory against Steaua București. Against Slavia Prague at the Emirates, Arsenal equalled their best ever victory in a European competition, scoring seven goals. Walcott, who scored his first two goals {{of the season in}} the match, earned the praise of manager Wenger: [...] "Once Theo scored his first, <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> much more. When they opened up the space, you could see his runs and pace, and the fact he is clinical in front of goal." [...] Qualification into the knockout stages was ensured with a draw away to Slavia Prague on 7 November 2007. Defeat against Sevilla at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium was Arsenal's first loss since April 2007, ending a run of 28 matches undefeated in all competitions. The result moved them down into second place, and in spite of winning their final group match against Steaua at home, Arsenal ended two points behind group winners Sevilla.|$|E
2500|$|What is {{the meaning}} of [...] "Acher {{destroyed}} the plants"? Of him scripture says: [...] "Do not let your mouth make your flesh sin". What does this mean? Acher saw that Metatron happened to be granted authority to sit while he record the merits of Israel, and he said: [...] "We have been taught that in heaven there is no sitting.... Perhaps there are — God forbid! — two supreme powers". They brought him to Metatron and they smote him with sixty bands of fire. They said to Metatron: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> why did you not stand up before him?" [...] Then authority was granted Metatron to erase the merits of Acher. Then a heavenly voice was heard: [...] "'Repent, O backsliding children!' except for Acher." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, Hay was {{described}} as being a very serious and private man, some thought he may have a dark side due to his demeanour. Peter Ustinov, who made his film debut in The Goose Steps Out as a straight man to Hay, said in a 1990 interview when asked about working with him [...] "Well, Will Hay wasn't very funny but I found that very few comics are." [...] as well as [...] "And Will Hay was always {{wrapped in a blanket}} at certain hours and had his tea, and we all stopped talking while he was having his tea, and then we went on shooting. I don't remember him saying anything memorable, nothing I could remember at all. He was very funny when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> on the screen, but in life all those people are very, very strange." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lor' lumme," [...] {{said the}} incensed Mr. Kidd, pushing Mr. Gibbs forward. [...] "Here he is. Same as <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>'im</b> last, except for 'is whiskers. Don't make that sobbing noise; people'll be coming in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Too late!' she cried, wildly, {{clapping}} {{her hands}} together; 'too late! Here--tell <b>him</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me; tell <b>him</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> Mary; tell <b>him</b> where {{and in what}} a pretty place, too, for maid, master, or man! [...] What are you doing here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that was}} evident," [...] said Carroll, firing up. [...] "I never could {{understand}} what <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>him.</b> Why, Sheldon's no good. He----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} had a formed {{character}} when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> last. The twelve years before five-and-forty don't alter the nature." ...|$|E
6000|$|KEITH. [Drawing up a {{chair and}} sitting] This, man, your--your husband, before he came here the night before last--how long since <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} {{improved}} since <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> last; for then, if I remember rightly, you found him 'lazy, cross, selfish," [...] and conceited.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} told <b>you</b> once <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> for a moment, at the town {{residence}} of my sisters," [...] replied Wharton, with a lurking smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{not thought}} of it. But <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> since he had you in his arms as a baby. You cannot mourn for him in heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{looking as}} he looked this morning, Herbert. When I went in he was speechless, and he {{remained}} so, I should say, for some minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> You {{recognized}} him for your own, since {{you set the}} people on to kill those whom you believed had slain him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} {{you to say}} that major Willoughby was at the mill when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> last, and that this was only half an hour since?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When was it <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> last?" [...] Scarborough {{asked the}} {{question}} with an abruptness which was predetermined, but which did not quite take Harry aback.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't; <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> never saw--" [...] {{her lips}} quivered {{so that she}} had to stop and bite them, to keep back a rush of tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay; you are jealous. The old story. Don't tell me. Now do you bide here. I'll send Fitzpiers to <b>you.</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{smoking in}} front of his house but a minute by-gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{gave you}} the knife. I was there under the bar. <b>Saw</b> <b>you</b> hit <b>him.</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>you</b> both fall. He dropped his old knife. I gave it to you. Why didn't you stick him?" [...] said Mliss rapidly, with an {{expressive}} twinkle of the black eyes and a gesture of the little red hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Master Everett, collect yourself," [...] said Topham; [...] "for as I think, {{you said}} <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> at a consult of the Jesuits in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That was all I {{wished to}} say. Perhaps {{it would be}} as well if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> now, Mr Burns. You will find him in the study.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was here}} on Tuesday; <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> at Mrs. Saunders's on Wednesday; {{he was at}} your at-home on Thursday; and he sends a bouquet on Saturday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'The only redeeming {{point in}} the matter is, that the Vicomte de Tulle in no way troubled or molested you, and that <b>you</b> only <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> for a few minutes, {{on the first day}} of your confinement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{understand}} why if <b>you</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{at a party}} or a picnic," [...] said Felicity, [...] "trying to pass plates and dropping them whenever a woman looked at him. They say it's pitiful to see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mir. Have I so far {{offended}} you already, [...] That he offends {{you only}} for my sake?-- [...] Yet {{sure you would}} not hate <b>him,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> [...] <b>Him</b> as I've done, so full of youth and beauty.|$|R
6000|$|... "You take a {{good look}} at him," [...] urged her brother, [...] "and don't forget that it's four years since <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> Isn't that Bert's nose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have missed}} a bit,' {{interrupts}} Jane, who now knows the story better than her mother. 'When <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{sitting on the}} floor crying what did you say?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, look at {{that black}} scoundrel!" [...] exclaimed R.C. [...] "Standing up! Looking around! Wagging his head!... Say, <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> first. Suppose you take some pegs at him." ...|$|E
25|$|It wasn't a {{surprise}} to me. It really wasn't. I didn't really have any relationship with the AD. The guy — <b>you</b> guys <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> (Sunday) — the guy's a total p----. I mean, he is. He's a total c---.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{confessed to}} my sergeant," [...] said Claverhouse, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> and entertained <b>him,</b> knowing {{him to be}} an intercommuned traitor; why are you not so frank with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Antony laughed, {{and there}} was a triumphant ring very like {{insanity}} in his laughter. Humfrey, with a moment's idea that to hint that the conspiracy was known would blast it at once, if it were real, said, [...] "I see not Cuthbert Langston among your six. Know <b>you,</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> only yestereven going into Secretary Walsingham's privy chamber." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And was it {{concern for}} me," [...] he asked her, [...] "that laid you swooning when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> return wounded from the meeting? That was what opened my eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It was a capitally-managed plan, Will, {{and had it}} {{been for}} a {{legitimate}} object I should have given it unstinted praise. And so <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> fairly off from England?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{thing is}} singular," [...] {{observed}} Beth, calmly. [...] "There {{has been no}} train since last <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> If Count Ferralti has left the hotel, where could he be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you ken {{that she}} has bewitched him; do <b>you</b> ken I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> trying to put his arms round her; do you ken they have a trysting- place in Caddam wood?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1941, James Thurber {{described}} Harley's running {{skills for}} the New York City newspaper, PM, [...] "If <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{run with a}} football, I can't describe it to you. It wasn't like Red Grange or Tom Harmon or anybody else. It {{was kind of a}} cross between music and cannon fire, and it brought your heart up under your ears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{has that}} to do with it? <b>You</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> inside our counter. What a name to appear along with yours in such an affair as this! If it hadn't been for that, you might have got over it. Young men will be young men. Faddle! I think {{you will have to}} go abroad for a time, till it has been forgotten." ...|$|R
