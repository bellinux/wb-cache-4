5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E

500|$|The {{commission}} {{began work}} in early January 1871 and {{spent six months}} taking evidence. After Josephine testified on 18 March, {{a member of the}} committee, Liberal MP Peter Rylands, stated: [...] "I am not accustomed to religious phraseology, but I cannot give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of the effect produced except by saying that the spirit of God was there". Nevertheless, the commission's report defended the one-sided nature of the legislation, saying [...] "...there is no comparison to be made between prostitutes and the men who consort with them. With the one sex the offence is committed as a matter of gain; with the other it is an irregular indulgence of a natural impulse." [...] The report accepted the findings that the sexual health of men in the 18 areas covered by the Acts had improved. In relation to the compulsory examinations, the commission was swayed by the descriptions of [...] "steel rape", and suggested it should be voluntary not compulsory. The commission heard significant evidence that many prostitutes were as young as 12 and recommended that the age of consent should be raised from 12 to 14. Bruce took no action on the recommendations for six months.|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

2500|$|The {{march of}} the athletes showed a clear example of CCTV proudly {{emphasizing}} a cultural particularity that NBC strained to contain {{within the bounds of}} the acceptable. When the athletes entered the stadium, CCTV [...] pointed out that the banners carrying the names of the countries were written by brush in Chinese and English, reflecting another Chinese cultural particularity. NBC described the arrangement not as an expression of Chinese cultural pride, but in pragmatic terms that covered a sense of dismissiveness. [...] As the athletes began marching into the stadium, Bob Costas explained why Guinea followed Greece: [...] "There is no alphabet here. So if you're expecting one nation to follow another, the way they generally do at an opening ceremony, think again." [...] Matt Lauer added [...] "You're out of luck. So we're going to have the graphics {{at the bottom of the}} screen which will give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> if you look to the right, which countries are approaching the tunnel." [...] In this way, the NBC commentators' coverage intoned that China was not doing things the way they were generally done, and as a viewer, you might be [...] "out of luck" [...] if not for the graphics that NBC provided.|$|E
2500|$|After signing onto Hypnotic Records in 1999, Quo Vadis {{received}} {{a budget of}} around $20,000 to record their second album. Recorded at Victor Studios and produced again by Quo Vadis and Pierre Rémillard, Day into Night was released on March 30, 2000 in Canada. Whereas the composing duties for Forever were credited to all members, {{a majority of the}} songs on the Day Into Night album were in fact written and recorded by Arie. However, due to logistical problems, the album was released to Europe in December. To promote the album a video for [...] "Dysgenics" [...] was made. Remy commented on the making of the video, [...] "It was long! We did two days of shooting. It's not the most pleasant thing to do lipsing and pretend to be playing, but it's all worth it in the end. What's really fun is the editing, seeing the whole thing take shape. We did a video release in Music Plus studios in December, but what people saw that day wasn't the finished version. We changed it a lot since and it looks really cool." [...] Day into Night also sold much more than Forever...; Bart compared them: [...] "The reactions have been excellent, to give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> we sold as many copies of the new album in the 6 months as of Forever... in 2 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips <b>you,</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
