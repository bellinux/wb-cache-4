5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E

When marking the fabric it is advised that you use a fabric marker, which is a marker that washes out when the quilt is washed or will fade away after repeated washes.|$|E
500|$|While {{other films}} {{tend to use}} only one {{storyboard}} artist, Jumper required six, who each worked on an individual action sequence. The artists were given specific instruction on {{the rules of the}} teleportation used in the film, to ensure accuracy in the storyboarding. One of them, Rob McCallum, reflected on the instructions: [...] "I was just thinking, 'How would a guy that can teleport fight?' So you were really pushing yourself to try to think of inventive, cool, spectacular ways that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> this jumping talent that these characters have." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{fifteen years}} Nolan {{had wanted to}} shoot in the IMAX format, and he also used it for [...] "quiet scenes which pictorially we thought would be interesting." [...] The use of IMAX cameras {{provided}} many new challenges for the filmmakers: the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras, and produced noise which made recording dialogue difficult. In addition, the cameras had short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes {{and the cost of}} the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film. Nevertheless, Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: [...] "if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> it in a feature movie." [...] In addition, Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative, which by eliminating generation loss, raised the film resolution of those sequences up to 18 thousand lines.|$|E
500|$|When Asche {{reached the}} major leagues, he was {{regarded}} as having decent potential at the plate, perhaps comparable to Mariners' third baseman Kyle Seager. While he hit for power in the minor leagues, his big league power {{was expected to be}} adequate, perhaps averaging 12–14 home runs per season. Baseball Prospect Nation reported that he [...] "gets pull happy when he sells out for power and ultimately swings too hard at times." [...] Like most left-handed hitters, Asche performed better against right-handed pitchers than left-handed pitchers, hitting [...]238 off the former and [...]219 off the latter in the major leagues during 2013. FanGraphs columnist Michael Barr summarized Asche's offensive potential by writing, [...] "He's certainly {{not going to be a}} world beater, but having double digit home run and speed potential while hitting something in the [...]275 range is likely the kind of hitter than many of <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> at third base." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Some of {{the waste}} is already vitrified. There is, in my mind, no {{economical}} reason why you would ever think of pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E

500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> sorcery, what do you think would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: A power that can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's nothing out of the ordinary. But if I had to explain it to this girl using terminology she knew.....it's a kind of magic." [...] have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them. Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Beck (The Yardbirds/solo) {{purchased}} {{his first}} Les Paul, a 1959 model, for [...] £150 while still {{a member of}} The Yardbirds. Beck's fascination with the guitar sprang as much from his interest in Les Paul, the man, as from his love of the guitar itself. Beck told an interviewer: [...] "It had a deep powerful sound and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> it to imitate just about anything - violin, sax, cello, even a sitar." [...] Beck also used an [...] "oxblood" [...] coloured 1954 Les Paul Standard, with PAF pickups, from 1972 to 1976 and is pictured with the guitar on the cover artwork of his Blow by Blow album.|$|E

2500|$|The first natural problem {{proven to}} be NP-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem. As noted above, this is the Cook–Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is NP-complete {{contains}} technical details about Turing machines {{as they relate to}} the definition of NP. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, proof by reduction provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also NP-complete, including the Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that if you could solve Sudoku in polynomial time, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> this to complete Latin squares in polynomial time. [...] This in turn gives {{a solution to the problem}} of partitioning tri-partitite graphs into triangles, which could then be used to find solutions for 3-sat, which then provides a solution for general boolean satisfiability. [...] So a polynomial time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other NP-complete problem in polynomial time. [...] Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense [...] "the same problem".|$|E
