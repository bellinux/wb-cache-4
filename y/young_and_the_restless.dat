5|$|Cane Ashby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Restless.</b> He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard, who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As the World Turns but was recommended {{for a role}} on The <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Restless</b> instead. The role was to be portrayed as an American, but Goddard's Australian descent influenced the character's background. Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12, 2007 as an Australian bartender {{in search of his}} family. Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) but the character's background was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell in 2009, re-establishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson (Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis).|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{it being}} owned by The Walt Disney Company, which also owns ABC, Soapnet cross-promoted All My Children and One Life to Live using the tagline [...] "weekdays on ABC and weeknights on SOAPnet" [...] when both shows aired on ABC. The same slogan {{continued}} {{to be used in}} promotions for General Hospital until the week of April 30, 2012 (inclusively). After a three-month hiatus, the [...] "weekdays on ABC and weeknights on SOAPnet" [...] slogan was revived in August 2012, but was used only for General Hospital promos airing on Soapnet and not those seen on ABC. References to Days of our Lives's first-run airings on NBC (and until it was dropped from Soapnet in July 2013, <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Restless's</b> first-run airings on CBS) {{were not included in the}} channel's promos, instead only advertising their telecasts on Soapnet.|$|R

During February 2011, the TV Land sitcom Hot in Cleveland and All My Children did a crossover event. On <b>the</b> 16th, <b>and</b> February 23, Lucci, Michael E.

50|$|Brooke {{continued}} with Number 96 until the series ended in 1977, also {{appearing in the}} film adaptation in 1974. After this she remained a frequent face on Australian television, with roles in television programs like the soap operas <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> Doctors <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Restless</b> Years in <b>the</b> late 1970s. Brooke was specially written into the Young Doctors episode as a clown, she so impressed Grundy Organization executive Reg Watson with her knowledge of clownsmanship. Ten years prior she wrote a play about a clown {{in a bid to}} entice the very young into theatrical appreciation about a clown who had a skip acting parlance from a clothes basket. So successful was the play she did another naming her clown Trumbo and had him looking for his red nose. Finding such enthusiastic responses from audiences in small theater venues around Melbourne, Brooke then wrote a third clown play. She also played various roles in films, miniseries, and TV movies. She acted in the feature film Dawn!, about Olympic Swimmer Dawn Fraser, playing the role of Fraser's mother.|$|R
60|$|He went once {{or twice}} with his mother to visit their relatives: and though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for Christmas his mood of embittered silence did not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote and near. He was angry with himself for being <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prey of <b>restless</b> foolish impulses, angry also with the change of fortune which was {{reshaping}} the world about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.|$|R
60|$|The {{circumstances}} which {{rendered the}} period that occurred between <b>the</b> years 1790 <b>and</b> 1815 <b>the</b> most eventful of modern times are familiar to all; though the incidents which chequered that memorable {{quarter of a century}} have already passed into history. All the elements of strife that then agitated the world appear now to have subsided as completely as if they owed their existence to a remote age; and living men recall the events of their youth as they regard the recorded incidents of other centuries. Then, each month brought its defeat or its victory; its account of a government overturned, or of a province conquered. The world was agitated like men in a tumult. On that epoch the timid look back with wonder; <b>the</b> <b>young</b> with doubt; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>restless</b> with envy.|$|R

5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Tracey E. Bregman was {{the first}} winner of this award for her role of Lauren Fenmore on The <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Restless.</b> The awards {{ceremony}} had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award was originally called Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series, the criteria of the new category were deemed confusing; performers of differing ages were nominated and critics argued some were of supporting or lead actress standards. Adding to the confusion, the first winner, Bregman, and the Outstanding Supporting Actress winner that year, Beth Maitland, played characters near to the same age. The category was renamed Outstanding Juvenile Female in a Drama Series in 1989 and began using its current title in 1991. The criteria were later altered, requiring that the actress be aged 25 or below.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Chris Engen began portraying Adam as an adult.

Controversy arose two weeks after Muhney's debut when Adam seduced male character Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman). The media accused Engen of homophobia, but the actor dispelled these rumors, saying he was unhappy with his storyline long before the homosexuality plot twist was aired. In 2013, Muhney was fired from the role and made his last appearance on January 30, 2014; later that year, Justin Hartley was cast as Adam, who portrayed Adam for an additional two years before vacating the role on September 1, 2016.|$|E
