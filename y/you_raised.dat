500|$|One analyst {{said that}} the {{settlement}} was likely to mute his public pronouncements and lawsuits against the company. However, upon the game's 2008 release, Thompson called Grand Theft Auto IV [...] "the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio," [...] and asked Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to [...] "pursue and file criminal charges against [...] Target and Best Buy". He also {{sent a letter to}} Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick's attorney, addressed to Zelnick's mother, in which Thompson accused her son of [...] "doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of GTA: IV to teen boys in the United States, a country in which your son claims <b>you</b> <b>raised</b> him to be a 'a Boy Scout'. ... More like the Hitler Youth, I would say." [...] On May 1, 2008 Thompson appeared on the CNN Headline News program Glenn Beck, asserting that the game's sexual content made its sale to minors illegal, and that he was working with law enforcement to have criminal prosecutions brought. Thompson also {{filed a complaint with the}} Chicago Transit Authority about poster ads for the game at Chicago, Illinois bus stops.|$|E

In his weekly column for the Catholic New York, Cardinal John O'Connor sharply denounced Drinan. [...] "You could have raised your voice for life; <b>you</b> <b>raised</b> it for death," [...] the cardinal wrote, [...] "Hardly the role of a lawyer. Surely not the role of a priest." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the Wei Shu, Guo Jia advised Cao Cao on how {{to handle}} Liu Bei when Liu Bei came to join Cao Cao in 196, after Lü Bu seized control of Xu Province from Liu's general Zhang Fei. On Cao Cao's suggestion, Emperor Xian {{appointed}} Liu Bei as the Governor (牧) of Yu Province (豫州). Someone told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has the ambition of a hero. If you don't eliminate him now, he'll become a threat to you in the future." [...] Cao Cao asked Guo Jia for his opinion, to which Guo replied, [...] "That's true. However, when <b>you</b> <b>raised</b> an army in the name of righteousness and pledged to help the common people eliminate tyrants, you attracted talented and capable people to serve under you based on your sincerity and integrity. Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so if you kill him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to doubt you and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help you achieve your goals? Therefore, it's imperative that you carefully consider the consequences of ruining your good reputation for the sake of eliminating one man who poses a threat to you." [...] Cao Cao laughed and said, [...] "I understand." ...|$|E
