Gay male characters were portrayed as flighty with high voices, existing merely as buffoonish supporting characters.|$|E

5|$|During {{a tour of}} the Philippines {{the month}} after the <b>Yesterday</b> and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had {{expected}} them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, Madlib {{moved away}} from hip-hop music and {{began a series of}} {{releases}} from <b>Yesterdays</b> New Quintet, a Jazz-based, hip-hop and electronic-influenced quintet made up of alter egos or fictional musicians played by Madlib. Over the next several years, through several record releases on Stones Throw and other labels, the growing number of pseudonyms and fictional players {{came to be known as}} <b>Yesterdays</b> Universe. Madlib was later invited to remix tracks from the Blue Note Records archive in 2003, which he released as Shades of Blue. In addition to the remixes, the album contained newly recorded interpretations of Blue Note originals, many of which were credited to members of <b>Yesterdays</b> New Quintet. Beginning with the 2007 album The Funky Side of Life by <b>Yesterdays</b> New Quintet spinoff group Sound Directions, the <b>Yesterdays</b> Universe also began incorporating additional session musicians who were not pseudonyms of Madlib.|$|R

Dr. Cushing, who was called, found her injuries to be internal, and of a severe nature, inducing spasms and internal suffering.

5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess <b>yesterday.</b> It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers.

5|$|We {{believe the}} enemy has {{undoubtedly}} suffered a crushing defeat. We thank Admiral Kinkaid for his intervention <b>yesterday.</b> We thank Lee for his sturdy effort last night. Our own aircraft has been grand in its relentless hammering of the foe. All those efforts are appreciated but our greatest homage goes to Callaghan, Scott and their men who with magnificent courage against seemingly hopeless odds drove back the first hostile attack and {{paved the way}} for the success to follow. To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yesterday,</b> as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E
