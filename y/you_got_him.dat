6000|$|... "Good.--Rifle got long arm. He talk so, Ingin mind him. When you t'ink red-skin come ag'in your fort, cap'in, now <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{easy enough}} done, Ephraim," [...] the trader replied, [...] "all except finding the sober and steady decent man {{to put him}} under. However, I will do my best. Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't say so, Mark! Well, I {{congratulate you}} heartily, both on your having caught the fellow and for having {{got rid of}} such horrid work. Where is he? Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> lodged in jail?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, I'll {{tell you}} what. You {{come back with}} me. I've got rather a decent dog I want to show <b>you.</b> Only <b>got</b> <b>him</b> yesterday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{taken to}} you," [...] replied the rider, seriously. [...] "I've {{heard of the}} like, but not so quick. Was he in a bad fix when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to <b>him</b> yesterday?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE [stopping in the doorway]. Do {{you mean}} to say that you've had some of my father's tea? that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> round <b>him</b> before <b>you</b> were ten minutes in the house? ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Alfred {{made his}} reply {{almost in a}} whisper. 'If you ask me, I don't think he could. If <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> down and trampled on him, you might make him mild. I don't think there's any other way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him,</b> Bill?" [...] she said, {{which in}} my present {{frame of mind}} {{struck me as a}} jolly creepy way of putting it. The sort of thing Lady Macbeth might have said to Macbeth, don't you know.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Gaylord {{found herself}} upon {{the point of}} {{experiencing}} a painful emotion of sympathy, but she saved herself by saying: [...] "Well, Mr. Gaylord, I don't know as you've got anybody but yourself to thank for it all. <b>You</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> here, in the first place." [...] She {{took one of the}} kerosene lamps from the table, and went upstairs, leaving him to follow at his will.|$|E
5000|$|Here comes a poor soldier from Botany Bay:What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to give <b>him</b> to-day? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless {{your poor}} heart! Think of that now! But I'm afeard we can't {{do nothing for}} you. My master would be nigh about killing me if I harboured <b>you</b> and <b>got</b> <b>him</b> into trouble, with the gentry." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{could sleep}} in the air without falling, by merely {{lying on his back}} and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if <b>you</b> <b>got</b> behind <b>him</b> and blew he went faster.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} {{encouraged}} {{him in his}} confidential position here," [...] said Maruja. [...] "You forget, my mother, how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to 'duena' Euriqueta with the Colonel Brown; how you let him frighten the young Englishman who was too attentive to Dorotea; how you set him even upon poor Raymond, and failed so dismally that I had to take him myself in hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no use {{pulling off}} a rough-house," [...] he counselled. [...] "I don't {{want to lose}} Jackson and he'll put you into {{hospital}} if he ever gets started. Send the dog back where <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him.</b> Your wife's told me about him. Stick him into a box and send him back collect. Collins won't mind. He'll take the singing out of him and work him into something." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other man}} laughed a little. [...] "Ferris has struck {{a streak of}} luck, but I wouldn't be very sorry if <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> away, Mr. Courthorne. He has had {{as much as he}} can carry already, and I don't want anybody broke up in my house. The boys can look out for themselves, but the Silverdale kid has been losing a good deal lately, and he doesn't know when to stop." ...|$|E
60|$|And I'm {{bringing}} him up right, I tell <b>you.</b> I <b>got</b> <b>him</b> a little savings box a while ago, and have <b>got</b> <b>him</b> taught {{to put all}} his money in it, and not give any of it away, {{so that when he}} grows up he'll be all right.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} is your man," [...] he said, with a clear English intonation. [...] "Couldn't <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>him</b> up a little more smartly? That man-o'-war cap, for instance, is {{a little out of}} keeping {{with the rest of his}} things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mustn't be squaw, Bourdon--bad for warrior be squaw. Alway bess be man, and be patient, like man. What <b>you</b> t'ink, Bourdon? <b>Got</b> <b>him</b> at last!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said feebly. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> {{with the}} axe. Nailer {{had been on}} the whisky, and that gun of his was a little stiff on the magazine-spring; but he was the best partner I ever had, and I left a good claim behind when you and the boys chased me right out of that part of Washington. Now you've got the beginning. Give me a little more brandy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am {{furious with}} myself {{for not having}} guessed that much,” I said bitterly. “I suppose <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> {{out of the house}} about five minutes after you heard I was coming here. Rose ought to have turned back when she saw him on his way to cheer your solitude. That girl is stupid after all, though she has got a certain amount of low cunning which no doubt is very useful at times.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Sir, I'm {{glad you}} do. I don't believe in crowdin' a man because <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> in a corner, an' I don't believe in bearin' malice. Never did. All I wanted {{was what the}} place was wo'th--to him. 'Twa'n't wo'th nothin' to me! He's got {{the house and the}} ten acres around it, and he's got the house on Lion's Head, includin' the Clearin', that the poottiest picnic-ground in the mountains. Think of goin' up there this summer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I never!" [...] {{burst out}} Dick. [...] "Isn't he the slick one, though! Just when <b>you</b> think you've <b>got</b> <b>him</b> hard and fast, you haven't at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, do {{you mean}} to say you couldn't have done it, if you had chosen?' demanded Monks, sternly. 'Haven't you done it, with other boys, scores of times? If you had had {{patience}} for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn't <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>him</b> convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?' ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{suspicion}} {{of a smile}} upon her face {{was the one thing}} needed to set Ezra's temper in a blaze. [...] "You won't have me," [...] he cried savagely. [...] "I haven't got the airs and graces of that fellow, I suppose. <b>You</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>him</b> out of your head, though he is off with another girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} weren't {{very fond of}} him. Who was? Only she, poor young lady. She'll be better now, Mr John, a deal better. He wasn't a {{wholesome}} lover,--not like you are. Tell me, Mr John, did you give it him well when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him?</b> I heard you did;--two black eyes, and all his face one mash of gore!" [...] And Hopkins, who {{was by no means}} a young man, stiffly put himself into a fighting attitude.|$|E
6000|$|Elsie {{was getting}} {{deeper into the}} motives and private {{opinions}} of her father than ever before, and, as he spoke, her mind reverted to the handsome figure of the young soldier as he stood before her in the studio, asking for a kindlier good-bye. His head was really beautiful, {{and his eyes were}} deep and sincere. She looked up at her father with frowning brows. [...] "I thought you liked Mr. Sennett? He told me <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> his place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Hello, hello!' says he. 'Oh, that's Perkins, at Milldale. I {{told you}} $800 {{was too much}} for that horse. Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> there? Good. Let me see him. Get away from the transmitter. Now make him trot in a circle. Faster. Yes, I can hear him. Keep on--faster yet. ... That'll do. Now lead him up to the phone. Closer. Get his nose nearer. There. Now wait. No; I don't want that horse. What? No; not at any price. He interferes; and he's windbroken. Goodbye.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He was a {{very nice}} horse in every way, an {{absolutely}} picture perfect individual. A lovely horse to look at once <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to know <b>him</b> he was very nice to deal with.|$|R
60|$|I don't think I've {{ever been}} so bucked by {{a bit of}} news. I felt I had misjudged Rollo. Evidently, when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to know <b>him</b> better, {{he had a lot}} of {{intelligence}} in him.|$|R
5000|$|Of his {{professional}} career in newspapers, LeDuff states: [...] "I’m not a journalist, I’m a reporter. The {{difference between a}} reporter and a journalist is that a journalist can type without looking. The problem with journalism is its self-importance. Like in the New York Times, there’s style guides; you can’t call a doctor a physician, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to call <b>him</b> a doctor- too high falutin’. You can’t call an undertaker a mortician- too high falutin’; <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to call <b>him</b> an undertaker. You can’t call a lawyer an attorney, {{you have to call}} him a lawyer. But somehow, since we control it, and we’re very self-important people, you can call a reporter a journalist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucy {{ran through}} the house like a whirlwind," [...] replied his mother, with a smile. [...] "The truth is, my son, she has been quite beside herself since she heard of her father's release from jail. She knew <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> out. She stared at me with her eyes black and wide. 'Mother, he laughed at me--at my fears. He said it'd be easy to free Dad.' ... So she knows, Pan, and I rather think she didn't want us to see her when she meets you. You'll find her in the orchard or down by the brook." ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{people are}} too much the other way. I knew a fellow once whose natural {{tendency}} {{to laugh at}} everything {{was so strong that}} if you wanted to talk seriously to him, you had to explain beforehand that what {{you were going to say}} would not be amusing. Unless <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to clearly understand this, he would go off into fits of merriment over every word you uttered. I have known him on being asked the time stop short in the middle of the road, slap his leg, and burst into a roar of laughter. One never dared say anything really funny to that man. A good joke would have killed him on the spot.|$|E
6000|$|Commissions from Mervyn had pursued Robert {{since his}} arrival in town, all for Bertha's amusement, and he brought down, by special orders, a musical-box, all Leech's illustrations, and a small Maltese dog, like a spun-glass lion, which Augusta had in vain {{proposed}} to him to exchange for her pug, which was getting fat and wheezy, and 'would amuse Bertha just as well.' Lady Bannerman hardly contained her surprise when Maria, as well as Mervyn and Phoebe, met her in the hall, seemingly quite tame and at her ease. Mervyn looked better, and in answer to inquiries for Bertha, answered, 'Oh, getting on, decidedly; we have her in the garden. She might drive out, only she has such a horror of meeting any one; but her spirits are better, I really thought she would have laughed yesterday when Maria was playing with the kitten. Ha! the dog, have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>him,</b> Robert. Well, if this does not amuse her, I {{do not know what}} will.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to what you've {{done for}} him," [...] replied Father Brown, rising and shaking {{himself in a}} floppy way, [...] "you've saved him from the {{electrical}} chair. I don't think they can kill Drugger Davis on that old vague story of the poison; {{and as for the}} convict who killed the warder, I suppose it's obvious that <b>you</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>him.</b> Mr Davis is innocent of that crime, at any rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t know, Benjamin,” {{returned}} the sheriff; “a haul of one thousand Otsego bass, without counting pike, pickerel, perch, bull- pouts, salmon-trouts, and suckers, is no bad fishing, {{let me tell}} you. There may he sport in sticking a shark, but what is he good for after <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>him?</b> Now, {{any one of the}} fish that I have named is fit to set before a king.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I am so glad,' said Anita, 'that <b>you</b> {{have not}} <b>got</b> <b>him</b> now, for {{we can have}} our first meal in the cot all by ourselves. I'll run up-stairs and dress, and then I will come down and do my first cooking.' ...|$|R
