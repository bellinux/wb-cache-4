5000|$|This module {{introduces}} two new sorts, {{and a set}} of rewrite rules. We {{also include}} our previous module, to illustrate how equations and rewrite rules differ. The rewrite rules is thought of as a set of legal state changes, so while equations hold the same meaning {{on both sides of the}} equality sign, rewrite rules do not (rewrite rules use a => token instead of an equality sign). You are still the same person after you're married (this is open for debate), but something has changed, your marital status at least. So this is illustrated by a rewrite rule, not an equation. Rewrite rules do not have to be confluent and terminating so it does matter a great deal what rules are chosen to rewrite the term. The rules are applied at [...] "random" [...] by the Maude system, meaning that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sure that one rule is applied before another rule and so on.

The monsters can be fused with Eldin, Torma or Rami for three turns in combat once a character's Installation Points ("IP") reach their maximum. These points are visible by a gauge just beneath a characters hit points and ability points, and fill up when they are hit by an enemy. In your new merged state, you lose control of the character but gain two abilities. The first is invincibility: while you're merged with your monster partner, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> hurt or given status ailments in any way. The second is a special attack (depends on what form you're in) {{that may or may not}} do more damage than your characters normally can: this same move is repeated until all three turns pass.

It's important to note that you can't merge with your selected partner unless he or she has built up at least three hearts worth of Loyalty with the character (Loyalty can be found on the monster's status menu; the max number of hearts is five). Loyalty is raised by simply having your partner accompany your party and earn experience from fights (the partner does not have to actually be an active fighter to raise its Loyalty).|$|E

40|$|This Msc. Thesis builds upon a work-in {{progress}} called collocal which researched room-level indoor-localization. Localization is {{the action}} of estimating {{the position of a}} certain entity on a map. For example tracking the postion of furniture and other inventory in a building {{over a long period of}} time. To localize these entities other static nodes are employed that know their own location. These static nodes, called anchors, beacon their coordinates periodically. Mobile nodes are the entities that try to estimate their position based on these beacon messages. In conventional systems this beaconing is done asynchronously. System designers employ complex schemes to prevent anchor nodes from beaconing at the same time to avoid interference. These systems consume lots of energy at the mobile node, because they have to keep their radio on for a longer time. A deployment of such a localization system is expected to last for a long term period without replacing batteries of the used device. Counterintuitive to what asynchronous system designers do, in collocal the anchor nodes beacon at the same time on purpose. Collocal reduces the energy consumption considerably by shortening the listening interval at the mobile node. Collocal however suffers from two major drawbacks: a dead zone area (an area where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> localized) between anchor nodes and a very high bit-error rate. In this Msc. thesis the two problems are solved with the use of orthogonal codes. I was able to improve the battery lifetime of the mobile node from 3 months in the asynchronous case to 2 years using a localization period of 1 second. The proposed method is evaluated against five state-of-the-art localization algorithms. Embedded SystemsEmbedded SoftwareElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

Number of pages: 46 Author: Helena HuhtaTutor: Martin FredrikssonCourse: Media and Communication Science CPeriod: Autumn of 2009 University: Division of Informatics and Media, Uppsala UniversityPurpose/Aim: The {{aim of this study}} has been to investigate to what degree women and menparticipate in the newscasts of Aktuellt and Rapport, broadcast on the Swedish public servicechannels of SVT 1 and SVT 2. Furthermore, I have also looked into how social identities, such asage and ethnicity, affect the degree of representation for each gender, respectively. Some of thebasic research questions comprise: 1. how much space is given to men compared to women in termsof: number of participants for each gender, speaking time and position in the news order? 2. Howdo the roles differ for male and female participants in terms of position and topic? 3. How do ageand ethnicity affect the degree of visibility for men and women in Aktuellt and Rapport?Material/Method: This study has been carried out as a quantitative content analysis of Aktuellt andRapport, during ten weekdays in October and November of 2009. The research units included in thestudy consist of all people visible and talking actively, on screen during the domestic news, of saidperiod, in Aktuellt and Rapport. Main results: The results show that men are more visible than women, due to there being a largernumber of male participants, and men also having a tendency to get longer speaking times. Regarding roles, women participate to a much greater extent as private persons than men - the latterrather being made visible as representatives. The main subject areas between the genders also differ, where women usually occur in a “soft news” context, and men in “hard news” context. When looking into the intersection between gender and age, the newscasts have a tendency todisplay younger females and older males. Hence, the female participants seem to have adiminishing chance of being seen as they grow older, while there is an opposite tendency for maleparticipants. Finally, regarding the intersection between ethnicity and gender, the study has shown that thegenders are more evenly represented among people of a non Swedish origin. The ethnic minoritiesare, however, underrepresented in these newscasts as a whole. Keywords: gender, ethnicity, age, intersectionality, news, media, representation...|$|E

The optical cleanliness checked by visual examination with normal eye-sight should be sufficient. In the present study resepectively seven brand-new bone-cutters made of hard-metal without coating and hard-metal with zirconium-nitride-hard-coating were examined before contamination and after contamination with different techniques of cleaning. All bone-cutters were clean before contamination. 63 bone-cutters, seven per material, were examined after contamination and nine following techniques of cleaning (A -I). The bone-cutters were cleaned twice in the washer-disinfector after contamination and were examined for cleanliness after each cycle of cleaning (experiment A and B). In the following experiments different manual steps were added: In experiment C an instrument-brush made of stainless steel, in experiment D an instrument-brush made of nylon, in experiment E the storage of the bone-cutters in a cleaning/disinfecting solution, in experiment F {{the use of an}} ultrasonic bath filled with deionized water, in experiment G an ultrasonic bath filled with cleaning/disinfecting solution. This experiment was repeated (experiment H). In experiment I the experimental setup of experiment H has been extended to the use of an device holder in the washer-disinfector. The control of the cleaning performance was carried out visually with and without different magnifications up to 40 -fold magnification under a stereo light microscope. Without magnification 96 % bone-cutters were clean. However, only 31, 4 % in the 40 -fold magnification were clean. With a probability of 68, 6 % must be expected, that clean bone-cutters without magnification are deemed to be dirty in the 40 x magnification. Experiment H, which was of the same experimental setup as experiment G, provided no assurance of the experimental results. None of the techniques of cleaning that have been examined in this study is suitable for a validated cleaning process. Also it could be shown that the results of all experiments do not differ significantly to experiment A. Comparing the types of bone-cutters in 40 -fold magnification zirconium-nitride-hard-coating shows less contamination unambiguously with a p-value < 0, 001. At lower magnifications, both materials showed comparable results. This means that contamination on the hard-metal alloy is more difficult to remove and thus can trigger a higher risk of infection. It {{should be noted that the}} visual inspection without additional magnification for daily control of cleaning results, as required from KRINKO- / BfArM is not sufficient.

40|$|Abstract This essay {{begins with}} a {{presentation}} of the complex set of problems which relate to the interaction between {{freedom of speech and}} the ban against discrimination based on a person's race, the colour of their skin or ethnic origin, confession of faith or sexual preference (BrB 16 : 8, incitement to racial hatred). Can conflicts arise between freedom of speech and the ban against discrimination? To shed light on this question, we have chosen to look at the issue from a new perspective. This perspective is based on the new challenges faced by Swedish society {{as a result of the}} changed composition of our population, our membership in the EU and our acknowledgment of certain international conventions concerning human rights. Fifty years ago our population almost solely comprised of “native Swedes”. Today, because of massive immigration, our country can be described as multiracial and multicultural. This gives rise to questions concerning protecting minority groups from discrimination whilst also attempting to ensure that the non-discrimination acts do not compromise our freedom of speech. Our membership in the EU and our acknowledgement of certain international conventions means that European law and international law sometimes override Swedish law. This restricts our freedom to decide the extent of our non-discrimination statutes, but can have positive effects on the right to freedom of speech and religion. The arguments that are put forward in our essay may give rise to many questions but we will focus on two major issues. First, where does the law draw the line between the freedom of speech and the ban against discrimination based on a person's race, the colour of their skin or ethnic origin, confession of faith, or sexual preference? Second, are there inherit flaws in the law as a result of both the inner changes our society has gone through and our new responsibilities due to our membership in the EU and our acknowledgement of certain international conventions? The purpose of this essay is to answer these questions through studying and reflecting on the theory of law (doctrine). We will also analyse the existing written law and its sources, and consider court rulings and related judicial decisions. This analysis will enable us to make the following conclusion concerning the previously mentioned questions. The freedom of speech is extensive and is not explicitly defined. Without explicit definition, no specific statements automatically become illegal. Therefore a person's freedom to express his own opinion in public is wide-ranging. Unfortunately our freedom of speech is not guaranteed for ever and therefore we have to both treasure and guard it from potential threats. Popular public opinion, populist interests or other specific interests may seek changes, which might effect our freedom of speech. The ban against discrimination based on a person's race, the colour of their skin or ethnic origin, confession of faith, or sexual preference is a specific interest of this kind. The purpose of this ban is based solely on good intentions. None the less, this ban could be a wolf in sheep’s clothing, as it might have a negative influence on the freedom of speech. When two justifiable causes come into conflict with one another – in this case the freedom of speech versus non-discrimination – a society must make difficult choices. Do we sacrifice part of our freedom of speech which will effect the whole population in order to protect minority groups, or do we sacrifice the rights of the minority in order to secure freedom of speech for all? During the last few years there has been an increase in Nazi-organisations in Sweden, which have grown strong in terms of both the number of their supporters and the amount of attention which is paid to them by the press. These groups have used our democratic rights – which includes our freedom of speech – in order to spread their scornful opinions based on a person's race, the colour of their skin or ethnic origin, confession of faith, or sexual preference. Through our study of court rulings concerning Nazis, we came to the conclusion that there is a strong tendency to convict Nazis. This is certainly the case if they call out “Sieg Heil” or salute Hitler. They are also often convicted if they are wearing the Nazi cross. When the courts find that they are unable to convict a Nazi for the actions just mentioned, they often base their judgement on either one or two premises. If the prosecutor can not prove that it has been the Nazi's intention to spread a scornful message concerning a group defined by it's race, the colour of their skin or ethnic origin, confession of faith, or sexual preference, he can not be convicted with reference to the non-discrimination act (uppsåtsrekvisitet). Moreover, if it can not be proven that the message has reached a considerable number of people and not just the Nazis private sphere, this also warrants the verdict of acquittal (spridningsrekvisitet). From our study of court rulings however, we found that the non-discrimination statute does fulfil its purpose. Most scornful or hate-filled messages are in fact disseminated to the wider public. This being the case, the Nazi is almost certain to be convicted. Religious fundamentalism is not something entirely new in our society. Sweden has always had a few religious groups free from the state church and the members of the free churches have often held conservative religious beliefs, much like some Muslim movements today. Freedom of speech and religious freedom are of course two important elements of any democratic society, but through a court case concerning a Christian priest in a free church, the freedom of speech related to preaching has arguably become unacceptably extensive. In effect this court case means that as long as you can relate your scornful statement about a specific group included in the non-discrimination statute to a religious scripture like the Bible or the Koran, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted. This somewhat unsatisfactory conclusion is a result of Sweden adopting the European Convention of Human Rights. In this case the European Rights Law overrides the Swedish non-discrimination law and this leads to a flaw in our legal system relating to the protection of certain minority groups. It must be mentioned, however, that the European Convention of Human Rights is part of Swedish law, and therefore Swedish law can not contradict European law, RF 2 : 23. Given that we are bound by the European Rights Law, there is nothing Sweden can do about this flaw, which in the future might have even greater consequences in and on our multicultural society. For instance, what would happen if messages filled with hatred were spread by priests from the Christian free churches and fundamentalist Muslims. If these statements concerned the other group and the origin of the statements could be traced to the Bible and the Koran, the courts would have no way of convicting the preachers as this would go against the European Convention on Human Rights. This could result in serious social instability. Indeed, riots could break out as a result of such religious propaganda. The law would be powerless to halt the dissemination of the religious scorn which caused the riots. We have come to three conclusions concerning intrinsic flaws in the law concerning the ban against discrimination based on a person's race, the colour of their skin or ethnic origin, confession of faith or sexual preference. We therefore recommend that the following changes should be made: 1. Concerning BrB 16 : 8, this act should include an unmistakable and transparent definition of the word “missaktning” (scornfulness or disrespect). 2. With reference to the High Court’s ruling regarding the priest and the European Convention on Human Rights, we recommend that Sweden should attempt to find a legal solution which will enable our courts to more easily convict scornful statements regarding certain minority groups, even if the origin of the statement can be traced to religious writings. 3. With reference to the instruction in the Freedom of Press Act (TF 1 : 4), we find it necessary to clarify which statements that can be looked upon as legal and which statements are unlawful...|$|E
