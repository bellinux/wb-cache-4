500|$|During Agnew's playing career, {{a dispute}} with team-mate Phillip DeFreitas {{attracted}} media attention: when DeFreitas poured salt over Agnew's lunch, Agnew responded by throwing DeFreitas' cricket bag and kit from the dressing room balcony. Former England cricketer Derek Pringle has written about Agnew's sense of humour, describing him as [...] "hysterical". The pair toured Sri Lanka together on England B's 1986 tour. Pringle recalls that one hot day when England were in the field, Agnew came in for lunch: [...] "It's ****ing [...] red hot on the field, and when you come off it's ****ing red hot in the dressing-room," [...] Agnew screamed. [...] "Then, what do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>for</b> lunch, ****ing red hot curry?" ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Patrizio of IGN {{awarded the}} DVD {{six out of}} ten commenting, [...] "Tom Araya lost his {{piercing}} shriek that opens 'Angel of Death' {{and the end of}} 'Necrophobic'", praising Lombardo's return by saying the drummer [...] "...hasn't lost a step at all. With barely any breathing time between songs, the underground drum legend shows that an impending 40th birthday (next month) isn't going to slow him down." [...] Patrizio stated the production was not of the highest caliber, as the rapid [...] "MTV-style" [...] cuts were distracting, as was the switch from black and white to color shots. Patrizio ended the review with the comment, [...] "This is what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>for</b> letting Uwe Boll direct your music video", Boll being a heavily criticized film director.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene of}} the crime was visited by Father Michael Lewis of the Stella Maris Church, who was {{accompanied}} by Williamson's sister Gradryn Williams; she was convinced not to look at the body by Williamson's friends. Crowds assembled outside the apartment block, made up of individuals who were laughing and celebrating Williamson's death. Some of the assembled people shouted out statements such as [...] "This is long overdue", [...] "Battyman he get killed", [...] "Let's get them one at a time", [...] "That's what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>for</b> sin", and [...] "Batty man fi dead!" [...] ("Faggots should die!"). Others sang [...] "Boom Bye Bye", a line from a dancehall song by Buju Banton that discusses shooting and burning gay men. Rebecca Schleifer, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher, had a meeting with Williamson planned for that day, and arrived at his home to find the assembled crowd; she noted that [...] "It was like a parade. They were basically partying".|$|E

500|$|The musical {{structuring}} of [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] {{uses the}} AABA form, {{in which the}} song's title serves as {{the main source of}} needed repetition. When used to the maximum, this structuring, also known as the thirty-two-bar form, has the title repeat itself in the same place, in {{at least two of the}} three A verses. Author Sheila Davis' book, The Craft of Lyric Writing, notes that [...] "the repeated title line simultaneously outlines the framework of the design and drives home the main point of the lyric". Jackson's [...] "She's Out of My Life" [...] also uses this musical structuring, as does [...] "Body and Soul", [...] "Oh, Lady Be Good!" [...] and [...] "Try a Little Tenderness". The musical chords in [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] are seen in several songs written by Jackson. [...] "That's What <b>You</b> <b>Get</b> <b>for</b> Being Polite", from The Jacksons' Destiny album, and two unreleased songs ("Why Can't I Be" [...] and [...] "Thank You for Life") used the chords before [...] "The Girl Is Mine".|$|E
500|$|In Homilies on Ecclesiastes, he wrote: [...] "'I got me slave-girls and slaves.' For what price, tell me? What did {{you find}} in {{existence}} {{worth as much as}} this human nature? What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>for</b> selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1966, Jennings {{released}} his debut album for RCA Folk-Country, followed by Leavin' Town and Nashville Rebel. Leavin' Town resulted in significant chart success {{as the first}} two singles [...] "Anita, You're Dreaming" [...] and [...] "Time to Burn Again" [...] both peaked at no. 17 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The album's third single, a cover of Gordon Lightfoot's [...] "(That's What <b>You</b> <b>Get)</b> <b>For</b> Lovin' Me", became Jennings's first top 10 single, peaking at no. 9. Nashville Rebel was the soundtrack to an independent film of the same name, starring Jennings. The single [...] "Green River" [...] charted on Billboard country singles at #11. In 1967, Jennings released a hit single, [...] "Just to Satisfy You". During an interview, Jennings remarked that the song was a [...] "pretty good example" [...] {{of the influence of}} his work with Buddy Holly and rockabilly music. Jennings produced midchart albums that sold well, including Just to Satisfy You, that included the same-named hit single of 1967. Jennings's singles enjoyed success. [...] "The Chokin' Kind" [...] peaked at number eight on Billboard's Hot Country Singles in 1967, while [...] "Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line" [...] hit number two the following year. In 1969, his collaboration with The Kimberlys on the single [...] "MacArthur Park" [...] earned a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group.

500|$|Presley was keen {{to resume}} regular live performing. Following {{the success of}} the Comeback Special, offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker $28,000 for a one-week engagement. He responded, [...] "That's fine for me, now how much can <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>for</b> Elvis?" [...] In May, the brand new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest {{showroom}} in the city, announced that it had booked Presley, scheduling him to perform 57 shows over four weeks beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups, The Imperials and The Sweet Inspirations. Nonetheless, he was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal, and he had neither forgotten nor forgiven that failure. To revise his approach to performances, Presley visited Las Vegas hotel showrooms and lounges, at one of which, that of the Flamingo, he encountered Tom Jones, whose aggressive style was similar to his own 1950s approach; the two became friends. Already studying karate at the time, Presley recruited Bill Belew to design variants of karatekas's gis for him; these, in jumpsuit form, would be his [...] "stage uniforms" [...] in his later years. Parker, who intended to make Presley's return the show business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. For his part, hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.|$|E

[...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music criticized the band for mixing [...] "cast-off recordings with previously released album tracks and present it as a new mini-album" [...] and felt that the Saturdays are [...] "in some kind of decline". He said [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>for</b> your money are two potential future hits, four songs you probably already own, one slightly mad album track – Puppet – and a solid-gold clunker" [...] and noticed that it is not [...] "a mini-album, it's a double A-side, or an EP at best." [...] Simon Gage of the Daily Express said that although the album is [...] "not exactly bad", it sounds [...] "much like everything else out there" [...] and [...] "in the parlance of the kids it’s aimed at, a bit “whatever”". [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music complimented the songs [...] "Higher" [...] and [...] "Puppet", but said that [...] "if the intention is to whip up a storm of excitement, [...] then it's a case of mission unaccomplished". Hazel Sheffield of NME called the album [...] "a summer hatchet-job" [...] and although she praised the single [...] "Missing You", she felt that [...] "the rest is filler in Rihanna's slipstream" [...] and awarded the album five out of ten.|$|E
