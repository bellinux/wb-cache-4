500|$|Reviews for the Saturn and PlayStation ports {{were mostly}} {{positive}} although some were mixed. Sam Hickman from the Sega Saturn Magazine {{commented that the}} game manages to be extremely creepy and terrifying despite having almost no bloodshed. He predicted that the game would be outclassed by Resident Evil (still in development {{at the time of}} the review), but concluded that D was the best horror game presently on the market. Four reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the Saturn version had reduced the load times seen in the 3DO version to almost nothing. They highly praised the storyline and intelligently designed puzzles, and described it as [...] "scary enough to make you an insomniac." [...] GamePro staff gave positive reviews for both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, recommending it to those looking for a horror experience. Maximum staff likewise gave positive reviews to both versions, saying that D is similar to Myst (1993) and Mansion of Hidden Souls (1993) but ultimately better due to its more enticing story. They also praised the FMV graphics and cinematic presentation, but criticized it for its lack of longevity. The reviewers felt its short length, addictive gameplay, and lack of overly challenging puzzles ensured that the player will be finished with it very quickly. A Next Generation reviewer gave the same praises for the scary storyline and graphics, and also said the puzzles [...] "are just challenging enough to satisfy and yet not so difficult as to impede <b>your</b> <b>progress</b> for very long." [...] However, he felt the slow character movement and lack of longevity kept the game from being truly exceptional. Staff at Game Informer were more critical in their review of the Saturn version. They found the gameplay tedious but did praise the graphics and the storytelling, concluding the [...] "story would make a great movie or book, but not a game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirty {{years after}} the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte {{suggested}} in The Daily Beast that [...] "we owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer {{when it comes to}} showing the world how to recover when you’ve been unjustly shamed for being sexual. Williams could have slunk off into the shadows in shame, which no doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of." [...] In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight by stating that [...] "you can't give up ... you always have to remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay <b>your</b> <b>progress</b> for the moment, but you always have to remember who you are, and that will give you the eyes on the prize." ...|$|E
