25|$|Wheat {{is widely}} {{cultivated}} as a cash crop because {{it produces a}} good <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> area, grows well in a temperate climate even with a moderately short growing season, and yields a versatile, high-quality flour that is widely used in baking. Most breads are made with wheat flour, including many breads named for the other grains they contain, for example, most rye and oat breads. The popularity of foods made from wheat flour creates a large demand for the grain, even in economies with significant food surpluses.|$|E

The Scanian plains are an important resource for the rest of Sweden since 25–95% of the total production of various types of cereals come from the region. Almost all Swedish sugar beet comes from Scania; the plant needs a long vegetation period. The same applies also to corn, pea and rape (grown for its vegetarian oil), although these plants are less imperative in compare with sugar beets. The soil is among the most fertile in the world.|$|E

25|$|Soft hammer {{finished}} {{pieces are}} usually balanced, symmetrical {{and can be}} relatively smooth. Soft hammer works {{first appeared in the}} Acheulean period, allowing tools with these markings {{to be used as a}} post quem estimation, but with no greater precision. The main advantage of a soft hammer is that a flintknapper is able to remove broader, thinner flakes with barely developed heels, which allows a cutting edge to be maintained or even improved with minimal raw material wastage. However, a high-quality raw material is required to make their use effective. No studies compare the two methods in terms of <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> weight of raw material, or the difference in energy use. The use of a soft hammer requires greater use of force by the flintknapper and a steeper learning curve, although it offers more flakes for less raw material.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} wheat (Triticum aestivum) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus) strip intercropping on yield components, seed and biological yields of oilseed rape, field experiments were carried out as factorial based on randomized complete block design with three replications at Research Farm of Tabriz University, Tabriz, Iran during 2010 - 2012 cropping seasons. The first factor consisted of four types of wheat and oilseed rape cropping system, sole crop of oilseed rape (A 1),: strip intercropping with 8 : 3 (A 2), 12 : 4 (A 3) and 16 : 5 (A 4) of wheat and oilseed rape rows, respectively and the other factor consisted of two fertilizer levels, B 1 : 100 % chemical fertilizers (urea and triple superphosphate) and B 2 : 50 % chemical fertilizers + biofertilizers (Nitrazhin and Barvar 2). The results showed that strip intercropping of wheat- oilseed rape resulted in significant increase in yield components, seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> occupied <b>unit</b> area and biological <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> occupied <b>unit</b> area of oilseed rape as compared with mono-cropping. The number of silique per plant in intercropping systems {{was significantly higher than}} that of mono-cropping. The highest seed yield was obtained in the 16 : 5 rows of wheat-oilseed rape with 343. 76 g. m- 2 and the lowest mean was observed in mono-cropping of oilseed rape with 260. 21 g. m- 2. Biological <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> occupied <b>unit</b> area and seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> intercropped <b>unit</b> area in B 1 were significantly greater than that of B 2, but this treatment had no significant effect on the other traits. Because, B 1 and B 2 had no significant difference in seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> occupied <b>unit</b> area and due to the importance of reduction in chemical fertilizers consumption and food and environmental health care, strip intercropping of wheat-oilseed rape under 50 % chemical fertilizers + biofertilizers can be recommended as a suitable cultural method...|$|R
