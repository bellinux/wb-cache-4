25|$|As the war progressed, with no hope {{of joining}} the {{rebellion}} due to power of the Royal Navy (in the letter he had addressed to Bermudians soliciting the theft of the gunpowder, George Washington had written We would not wish to in volve <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Opposition, in which from your Situation, we should be unable to support you: – We knew not therefore to what Extent to sollicit your Assistance in availing ourselves of this Supply), with increasing numbers of American loyalists in Bermuda (such as the privateer Bridger Goodrich), and with their economic opportunities dwindling, Bermudians overcame their sympathies for their erstwhile countrymen and unleashed their privateers (which, {{by the middle of}} the 18th century already outnumbered those of any of the mainland colonies) upon American shipping. The Bermudian effectiveness was such that, when the US sued British privateers for wrongful seizures in British courts, following the war, a sizable part of the damages they were awarded were to have come from Bermudians, like Hezekiah Frith (although, with the local authorities tasked with collecting these damages being in sympathy with the defendants, most of these damages were never paid).|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Aaron Boulding {{scored the}} game 8.5 out of 10, giving the PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award. He called it [...] "a great game, {{not just a}} great horror game," [...] writing [...] "it succeeds as both a horrific thrill ride and fun action experience." [...] He concluded [...] "In a genre that's overrun with sequels and lame attempts at horror, The Suffering is {{a breath of fresh}} death rattle. The action is intense, the creatures are actually creepy, and the story does not shy away from truly macabre elements. One cannot say enough about the horrific world that's been created here. Everywhere you look, every little thing you do, has been placed there to ratchet up the suspense and put <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> eerie state of mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|One such theory {{concerns}} Alf Boxall, who {{was reportedly}} involved in intelligence work during {{and immediately after}} World War II. In a 1978 television interview Stuart Littlemore asks: [...] "Mr Boxall, you had been working, hadn't <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intelligence unit, before you met this young woman [...] Did {{you talk to her}} about that at all?" [...] In reply, Boxall says [...] "no," [...] and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies [...] "not unless somebody else told her." [...] When Littlemore suggests in the interview {{that there may have been}} an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: [...] "It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?" [...] Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from Lance Corporal to Lieutenant within three months.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{destinations}} within Second Life which {{are dedicated to}} those who enjoy role-playing. Some of these are sexual in nature, while others focus on themes such as fantasy, history, science fiction, or other subjects. Many {{of these types of}} worlds have very specific sets of rules that each avatar who visits is expected to follow. [...] Such rules can include things such as a dress code, a code of behavior, and world guidelines. If these rules are not followed, the avatar can be booted from the world by a game administrator. One example of one of these role-playing worlds is [...] "The Realm of Valahari". [...] This particular world takes place in a fantasy medieval setting. [...] In order to exist within that world, your avatar must be dressed in fantasy or medieval attire. [...] In case your avatar does not already own such clothing, the world provides clothing shops for <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area which you visit before you actually enter the world. However, none of these clothing shops provide free items; all of them cost Linden Dollars (L$). Within the world, everyone is also expected to maintain the role-playing atmosphere. [...] Anyone who is using [...] "regular" [...] or [...] "everyday" [...] language tends to be frowned upon and seen as an outsider by {{the other members of the}} Realm. [...] "Regular" [...] language is to be kept in private chat windows, so that the fantasy/medieval atmosphere is not polluted by it.|$|E
