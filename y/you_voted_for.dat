60|$|And I {{say here}} to you, {{if any one}} expects of me--in case of my election--that I will do {{anything}} not signified by our Republican platform and my answers here to-day, I tell you very frankly that person will be deceived. I do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that I have secret purposes or pledges that I dare not speak out. Cannot the Judge be satisfied? If he fears, in the unfortunate case of my election, that my going to Washington will enable me to advocate sentiments contrary to those which I expressed when <b>you</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> and elected me, I assure him that his fears are wholly needless and groundless. Is the Judge really afraid of any such thing? I'll {{tell you what he}} is afraid of. He is afraid we'll all pull together. This is what alarms him more than anything else. For my part, I do hope that all of us, entertaining a common sentiment in opposition to what appears to us a design to nationalize and perpetuate slavery, will waive minor differences on questions which either belong to the dead past or the distant future, and all pull together in this struggle. What are your sentiments? If it be true that on the ground which I occupy--ground which I occupy as frankly and boldly as Judge Douglas does his,--my views, though partly coinciding with yours, are not as perfectly in accordance with your feelings as his are, I do say to you in all candor, go for him, and not for me. I hope to deal in all things fairly with Judge Douglas, and with the people of the State, in this contest. And if I should never be elected to any office, I trust I may go down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation, notwithstanding the hard opinions Judge Douglas chooses to entertain of me.|$|E

Sweetheart, I’m sending you a package containing the following items: copies of Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes, a York magazine, your suede brush, a spoon from the English ship, Union Castle, which brought us over, and some German Kodak film which I purchased. It’s size 620 and 120 which are actually interchangeable. Also I have enclosed coins of the various countries I have visited including a German coin. You know, darling, it’s a real thrill to hear news broadcasts coming over the radio telling all about your outfit and what they are doing. I have to spend time in the S- 2 ’s office and watch the battle lines changing, you know you forget that men and material is out there and the map takes on the aspect of a checkerboard. We had a “shit house” full of mail to cencor [sic] tonight which accounts for my going to bed late— 10 : 00 P. M. Actually, darling, we’re in a funny position. We’re at war and yet are spectators at all the action. I’m sorry to hear that your [sic] having trouble with our little “baby. ” I chuckle to myself when I think of you swearing. I know your complete repetoire [sic] and wonder if you have added any new acquisitions. Truly dear, I go to sleep with you in my arms and nothing in this war can harm me. I’m going to write you a V-Mail, too, so watch for the date. I love you Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
