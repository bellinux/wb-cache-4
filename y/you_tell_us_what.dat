6000|$|... 'Tell <b>us</b> <b>what's</b> the matter, sir,' said John, 'or I'll kill <b>you.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what's</b> the matter, sir, or {{in another}} second I'll have your {{head under the}} biler. How dare you look like that? Is anybody a-following of you? What do you mean? Say something, or I'll be the death of you, I will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for this promptitude, Don Luis, having some need of your services. Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> hath befel the Señor Christoval Colon, the Genoese navigator, with whom, they inform me, you have some intimacy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Instead of {{continuing}} such ridiculous threats {{as you have}} been making since the funeral, suppose <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> happened this afternoon {{to put you in}} such a state of excitement. Has some other Britisher refused to pay your master's bill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Grey!" [...] and Mrs. Curtis turned round eagerly, {{with the}} comfort of having some one to support her, [...] "will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> is to be done? Here has poor dear Rachel been taken in by this wicked scheme, and these poor--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, what {{we wanted}} to ask you specially, Johnson, was whether <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the {{servants}} at the Hall thought about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What else is {{the world}} than a figure? Life itself is but a symbol. You must be a wise man if <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> is reality.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He can't do that,' {{said the}} King, 'or else he'd {{have been here}} first. However, now you've got your breath, <b>you</b> may <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what's</b> {{happened}} in the town.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have an income, have you? And now, Mr. Scott, will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> {{profession}} {{you follow}} {{at this moment}} with the object of increasing your income? I think we may surmise, by the tone of your voice, that your income is not very abundant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be thankful that he is," [...] said Old Mother Nature, [...] "for the holes he has dug have saved your life more than once. By the way, Peter, since you are so well acquainted with those holes, suppose <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> kind of a home Johnny Chuck has." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, Clinton," [...] Easton said; [...] "that is {{the view}} I take of it myself, and I am very {{glad to see that}} you have come to see it in that light. And now will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> there was in that letter that gave us the news of your brother's being out here. How came the {{sergeant}} to write to you? How did he know you were his brother? It seems an unaccountable business all through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hadn't {{you better}} sit down, {{and if you}} want {{anything}} to eat we'll get it you," [...] he said. [...] "Then <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> your errand is." ...|$|R

6000|$|... '"We've been {{thorough}} enough," [...] says Lord Lundie. [...] "The {{evidence against}} both accused is conclusive. Any other country would give 'em {{seven years in}} a fortress. We should probably give 'em eighteen months as first-class misdemeanants. But their case," [...] he says, [...] "is out of our hands. We must review our own. Mr. Zigler," [...] he said, [...] "will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> steps you took {{to bring about the}} death of the first accused?" [...] I told him. He wanted to know specially whether I'd stretched first accused before or after he had fired at Mankeltow. Mankeltow testified he'd been shot at, and exhibited his neck as evidence. It was scorched.|$|E
60|$|He {{was popular}} at school, as boys of spirit always are, and {{impressed}} his companions {{with a sense}} of his power. They thought he would one day be a famous soldier. This may have been owing to the stories he told them of the heroic uncle, whose deeds, we may be sure, were properly famoused by the boy Homer, and whom they probably took for an admiral at the least, as it would have been well for Keats's literary prosperity if he had been. At any rate, they thought John would be a great man, which is the main thing, for the public opinion of the playground is truer and more discerning than that of the world, and if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the boy was, we will tell you what the man longs to be, however he may be repressed by necessity or fear of the police reports.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first man}} who spoke {{began at the}} middle of the story told by the {{witnesses}} in court. [...] "I am for acquitting the captain, gentlemen; he ordered out the boats, and saved the lives of the crew."--"And I am for finding him guilty, because the ship struck on a rock in broad daylight, and in moderate weather."--"I agree with you, sir. The evidence shows that the vessel was steered dangerously near to the land, by direction of the captain, who gave the course."--"Come, come, gentlemen! let us do the captain justice. The defense declares that he gave the customary course, and that it was not followed when he left the deck. As for his leaving the ship in moderate weather, the evidence proves that he believed he saw signs of a storm brewing."--"Yes, yes, all very well, but what were the facts? When the loss of the ship was reported, the Brazilian authorities sent men to the wreck, on the chance of saving the cargo; and, days afterward, there the ship was found, just as the captain and the crew had left her."--"Don't forget, sir, that the diamonds were missing when the salvors examined the wreck."--"All right, but that's no proof that the captain stole the diamonds; and, before they had saved half the cargo, a storm did come on and break the vessel up; so the poor man was only wrong in the matter of time, after all."--"Allow me to remind you, gentlemen that the prisoner was deeply in debt, and therefore had an interest in stealing the diamonds."--"Wait a little, sir. Fair play's a jewel. Who {{was in charge of the}} deck when the ship struck? The second mate. And what did the second mate do, when he heard that his owners had decided to prosecute? He committed suicide! Is there no proof of guilt in that act?"--"You are going a little too fast, sir. The coroner's jury declared that the second mate killed himself in a state of temporary insanity."--"Gently! gently! we have nothing to do with what the coroner's jury said. What did the judge say when he summed up?"--"Bother the judge! He said what they all say: 'Find the prisoner guilty, if you think he did it; and find him not guilty, if you think he didn't.' And then he went away to his comfortable cup of tea in his private room. And here are we perishing of hunger, and our families dining without us."--"Speak for yourself, sir, I haven't got a family."--"Consider yourself lucky, sir; I have got twelve, and my life is a burden to me, owing to the difficulty of making both ends meet."--"Gentlemen! gentlemen! we are wandering again. Is the captain guilty or not? Mr. Foreman, we none of us intended to offend you. Will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{not going}} to worry 'bout what you call it," [...] said {{the man who had}} not spoken yet. [...] "We have come here so <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} glad, sir, if <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> has been {{happening}} here. All {{we know is that}} the fort of Coomassie is surrounded, and that we have come up to relieve it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas!--for {{three of}} them at least," [...] ejaculated Mrs. Aleshine; [...] "they have left us, but they are all right. And now, sir, if <b>you</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> {{relation}} <b>you</b> are to Emily, and what Lucille--" ...|$|R

5000|$|When {{asked about}} the live shows in {{interviews}} The Knife had repeatedly been unforthcoming. Filter asked 'Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the live show will be like?' and Karin responded 'That is a huge secret'.It was, however revealed {{in an interview with}} The Guardian that the live shows have 'been devised in collaboration with an all-female collective of choreographers and set designers'.

40|$|ANTAE: We {{are aware}} that you have {{recently}} published John Keats: A New Life. Could <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> led you to this new biography, and what one may expect upon reading it? NICHOLAS ROE: John Keats: A New Life grew out of my sense {{that there was more}} to find out, to see, and more to say about the poet’s early childhood in London, and how those experiences may have helped shape the poet he became and the poetry he later wrote. Keats has often been described as a ‘liminal’ poet who haunted borderlines and thresholds of various kinds; what I wanted to explore was whether there were any aspects—of the places he lived in, visited, or simply saw as he passed through—that might have fostered that imagination. So readers can expect a fuller account of Keats’s early years at Keats’s Livery Stables in Moorfields and the suburban streets of north London, and more on the influence of various places in which Keats chose to write. peer-reviewe...|$|E
