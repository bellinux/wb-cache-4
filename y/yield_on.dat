5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969, {{the last one}} was {{the most powerful and}} had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|E
5|$|The {{match against}} England was causing the Natives' players and {{management}} problems {{before it had}} even begun. The team manager, Scott, was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played– the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at Blackheath's ground, but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval, where a larger crowd, and therefore higher gate receipts, could be secured. The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit-making motives of the Natives, and were unwilling to <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> the selection of venue. The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over {{the formation of the}} International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). Following a disputed try in an England–Scotland international match in 1888, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891, when, following arbitration, the RFU relented and joined the IRFB. The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the Natives on 16 February 1889.|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of Alcell (R) lignin in iso-propanol/formic acid mixtures (1 : 1 mass ratio) was explored in a batch set-up using Ru/C as the catalyst (673 K, 4 h, 28 % mass lignin intake on solvent). Lignin oils were obtained in good yields (71 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) and shown {{to consist of}} a mixture of mainly aromatics (10. 5 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), alkylphenolics (6 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), catechols (8. 7 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), guaiacols (1. 3 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), and alkanes (5. 2 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), the remainder being soluble higher molecular weight compounds (GCxGC-FID and GPC). The results for the catalytic experiments using formic acid were {{compared with those of}} a non-catalysed experiment and a catalytic hydrotreatment with molecular hydrogen and Ru/C {{in the absence of a}} solvent. Distinct differences in product yields and compositions were observed, and highest lignin oil yields were obtained by catalytic solvolysis (71 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) versus 18 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input for noncatalytic solvolysis and 63 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input for catalytic hydrotreatment. The effect of reaction time <b>on</b> oil <b>yields</b> and product composition was established and a reaction network involving depolymerisation, and hydro(-deoxy) genation pathways is proposed to explain the product yields and composition. Besides iso-isopropanol, the use of ethanol and methanol in combination with formic acid was also explored for catalytic solvolysis. Best results were obtained in methanol (4 h, 673 K) leading to a lignin oil (68 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) containing 11 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input of alkylphenolics and 19 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input of aromatics.

5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 kilotons, 1962), Kennebec (<5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38, kilotons, 1964), Barbel (<20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (<20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20-200 kilotons, 1969), {{the last one}} was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10−7 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> the amount of retrieved radioactive rock.

25|$|Takeover paper. Convertibles have a {{place as}} the {{currency}} used in takeovers. The bidder can offer a higher income on a convertible than the dividend <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the dividend <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> all the bidder’s shares.

40|$|The Reagan Administration entered {{office in}} 1981 {{with one of}} the clearest and moat ambitious agendas in recent times. The new {{administration}} advanced five economic/budgetary goals to rebuild America economically and militarily: (1) reduce inflation, (2) deregulate the economy, (3) cut taxes, (4) increase military spending and (5) reduce nondefense spending sufficiently to balance the budget. Achieving, or not achieving, these economic/budgetary goals likely {{had a significant impact on}} interest rates. Six specific hypotheses are investigated in this paper. During the first Reagan term, the battle to lower inflation acted to maintain the high real interest rates carried over from the Carter years and, while the increase in structural deficits did not raise real rates much, the reduction in private saving due to the unwinding of the second OPEC shock and an aggressive foreign policy that heightened fear of nuclear war raised real interest rates to levels not seen since the late 1920 s. Moreover, the increased volatility of interest rates during this protracted battle with inflation raised <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> callable fixed-rate mortgages by over a percentage point relative to the already inflated <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> noncallable Treasuries. By the end of Reagan's second term, inflation, marginal tax rates, nuclear fear, and interest rate volatility were all down. As a result, nominal Treasury rates have plunged (real bill rates since 1986 are below their average values for the previous quarter century), and <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> callable securities have receded to more normal levels relative to noncallable Treasuries. <b>Yields</b> <b>on</b> tax-exempt securities are one and a quarter percentage points higher relative to Treasuries than in the pre-Reagan years, and <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> fixed-rate mortgages are up by a half percentage point.

This led to hot spots on the pellet which were imprinted into the imploding plasma, seeding Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities and thereby mixing the plasma so the center did not collapse uniformly.|$|E
