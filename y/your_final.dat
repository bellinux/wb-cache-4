2500|$|Millionaire {{has made}} catchphrases out of several lines {{used on the}} show. The most {{well-known}} of these catchphrases is the host's question [...] "Is that <b>your</b> <b>final</b> answer?", asked whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified. The question is asked because the rules require that the contestants must clearly indicate their choices before they are made official, {{the nature of the}} game allowing them to ponder the options before committing to an answer. Regularly on tier-three questions, a dramatic pause occurs between the contestant's statement of their answer and the host's acknowledgement of {{whether or not it is}} correct.|$|E

It doesn't make sense that she'd still be loving toward you if you killed her in cold blood." [...] However, it was also important that the player never feel locked into one morality; they could begin the game with bad morality and finish with good morality; [...] "you can travel down different moral paths, and both the beginning you started with and the choices you make during Ties that Bind will affect <b>your</b> <b>final</b> outcome.
