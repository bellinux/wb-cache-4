25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

Bono introduced it as [...] "a song about a religious man, a fanatic, who gets {{into his head}} the idea he calls 'the hands of love'." [...] It was next performed on 2 April 1987 in Tempe, Arizona, during the first concert of The Joshua Tree Tour. Clayton noted that {{the manner in which}} they created the song inadvertently caused a problem for U2, saying [...] "when you're in a touring situation <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> numbers that were never actually written so much as spontaneously created." [...] "Exit" [...] was played at all 109 concerts on the tour, and was frequently followed by a snippet of the Them song [...] "Gloria", which was written by Van Morrison Following the conclusion of the Joshua Tree Tour, U2 performed [...] "Exit" [...] on only one more occasion; 14 October 1989 in Melbourne, Australia, on the Lovetown Tour, almost two years after the previous performance of the song. In 2007, U2's manager Paul McGuinness said that the song had been [...] "slightly tainted" [...] after the trial of Robert John Bardo, speculating that it had fallen out of favour with the band following the incident.|$|E

Märta Birgit Svensson combined her middle name with Nilsson to form her new stage name. Her teachers at the Academy were Joseph Hislop and Arne Sunnegårdh. However, she considered herself self-taught: [...] "The best teacher is the stage", she told an interviewer in 1981. [...] "You walk out onto it, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to project." [...] She deplored her early instruction and attributed her success to native talent.

2500|$|After being {{spotted by}} Geoff Cook, Durham's coach, Onions made his second XI debut {{for the club}} {{at the age of}} 18. He was offered a {{contract}} with the club and opted to become a professional cricketer rather than take a sports science choice at university, which was his other option. Onions started in the team as the fourth bowler. Looking back on his early career, he felt that he tried too hard early on. On one occasion he recalled how [...] "I remember being thrown the ball at an important stage of a game at Scarborough, and Phil Jaques hit me for four successive fours. I was thinking 'I'm not sure I can do this.' But Dale Benkenstein was a huge influence as captain, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from all those experiences. Otherwise I could not have done what I did in my first season of Test cricket. I often went for 15 to 20 runs in my first three overs, but always came back strongly." [...] In 2006, Onions regularly opened the bowling for Durham with Ottis Gibson.|$|E

Swimming with Butch O'Hare meant that at eight o'clock in the morning, you swam out into the ocean off Maui; he would still be out there {{at three in the}} afternoon! If he got hungry, Butch would roll over and dive, {{and the next thing you}} knew, he would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they tasted like old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the team's {{efforts to}} make The Settlers II {{as good as they}} {{possibly}} could, however, speaking in 2006, Häuser comments that, as with the original game, there were elements with which he was unhappy; [...] "things like the help system. There was none, to be honest. The player had to work really hard to get into the game, and there's lots of details in the game <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the hard way. It would have been a great help to a new gamer if we had some put in." [...] He also agreed with many fans of the game that the shipping system didn't work very well, even after it was patched in the Gold Edition; [...] "it didn't work as we wanted it to work. I remember the ships did not transport the things you wanted to other islands, we couldn't solve this problem at the time. Because at this time, the development systems were much more difficult to use and we didn't have the ability to debug code as we do today. It was just not working as we wanted it to work." [...] When The Settlers III went into development in 1997, Blue Byte again sought feedback from fans, {{and one of the most}} requested aspects for the new game was that the shipping system from The Settlers II be reprogrammed.|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have {{to make it clear that}} from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E

But somehow life is warmer and closer; the hearth burns more redly; the lights of home shine softer on the rainy street; the very names, endeared in verse and music, cling nearer round our hearts. An Englishman may meet an Englishman to-morrow, upon Chimborazo, and neither of them care; but when the Scotch wine-grower told me of Mons Meg, it was like magic.|$|E

Agassiz has found lately, not in the sea, but in the river Amazon; and then think carefully enough over their bones and teeth, and their history from the time they are hatched--why, you would find out, I believe, a story about the river Amazon itself, more wonderful than all the fairy tales you ever read.|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas More.--Enlarged as our faculties are, {{you must}} not suppose that we partake of prescience. For human actions are free, and we exist in time. The future is to us {{therefore}} as uncertain as to you; except only that having a clearer and more comprehensive knowledge of the past, we are enabled to reason better from causes to consequences, and by what has been to judge of {{what is likely to}} be. We have this advantage also, that we are divested of all those passions which cloud the intellects and warp the understandings of men. You are thinking, I perceive, how much <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> and what you should first inquire of me. But expect no revelations! Enough was revealed when man was assured of judgment after death, and the means of salvation were afforded him. I neither come to discover secret things nor hidden treasures; but to discourse with you concerning these portentous and monster-breeding times; for it is your lot, as it was mine, to live during one of the grand climacterics of the world. And I come to you, rather than to any other person, because you have been led to meditate upon the corresponding changes whereby your age and mine are distinguished; and because, notwithstanding many discrepancies and some dispathies between us (speaking of myself as I was, and as you know me), there are certain points of sympathy and resemblance which bring us into contact, and enable us at once to understand each other.|$|E

'It is you poets, Kahn, with your love songs which turn the sweet {{fellowship}} of comrades into this woman-centred excitement. But there is something in women, in many women, which responds to these provocations; they succumb to a peculiarly self-cultivating egotism. They become the subjects of their own artistry. They develop and elaborate themselves as scarcely any man would ever do. They LOOK for golden canopies. And even when they seem to react against that, they may do it still. I have been reading in the old papers of the movements to emancipate women that were going on before the discovery of atomic force. These things which began with a desire to escape from the limitations and servitude of sex, ended in an inflamed assertion of sex, and women more heroines than ever. Helen of Holloway was at last as big a nuisance in her way as Helen of Troy, and so long as you think of yourselves as women'--he held out a finger at Rachel and smiled gently--'instead of thinking of yourselves as intelligent beings, you will be in danger of--Helenism. To think of yourselves as women is to think of yourselves in relation to men. You can't escape that consequence. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to think of yourselves--for our sakes and your own sakes--in relation to the sun and stars. You have to cease to be our adventure, Rachel, and come with us upon our adventures. ...' He waved his hand towards the dark sky above the mountain crests.|$|E
