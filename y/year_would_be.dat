5|$|In October 2011, the {{neighboring}} city of Alexandria, Virginia, approved plans to deploy 54 bicycles at six {{stations in the}} Old Town and Carlyle neighborhoods in 2012, then add six more stations in 2013. The cost of the first <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> $400,000, including operating costs of $100,440. The first eight Alexandria stations were deployed in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was later}} {{introduced}} {{to amend the}} type of data collected and stored in the National Register of Electors. On 17 May 2007, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act submitting a letter in which she criticised the proposed changes to the Elections Act. One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in the voter lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sufficient. The second problem she raised was inclusion of the date of birth in the voter lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} institutions, the Parliament's seat {{was not yet}} fixed. The {{provisional}} arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing {{to be closer to}} these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.|$|E
50|$|After the {{controversy}} over the 1996 pre-qualifying round, the European Broadcasting Union introduced a new system for 1997: countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> excluded from the 1997 contest, and those with the lowest averages over the previous five <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> excluded from future contests (save that every country so excluded for one <b>year</b> <b>would</b> automatically <b>be</b> allowed to participate the following year), with so many countries being omitted as would reduce the number of participants each year to 25.|$|R

5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
25|$|The mayor {{objected to}} this, {{arguing that the}} {{increased}} cost of $5 million to $10 million a <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unduly burdensome for the city.|$|E
25|$|That {{year was}} rounded {{off with his}} final {{first-class}} match against Scotland and the Triple Crown Tournament in July.

50|$|Adolphe Augustin Marie Billault {{was born}} on 12 November 1805 in Vannes, Morbihan, to an obscure family. As a young lawyer he asked for {{the hand of a}} rich heiress, Françoise Bourgault-Ducoudray. He told his {{prospective}} father-in-law, Guillaume Bourgault-Ducoudray, that he had little money and no reputation, but in three <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the leading lawyer in Nantes, in another three <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a national representative, and three <b>years</b> later <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a minister. Impressed by his determination, the young woman accepted him. He kept his word. By 1830 he was a municipal Councillor in Nantes. He became President of the Bar of his order, and member of the General Council of the Loire-Inférieure.|$|R
25|$|To take {{an extreme}} example , while a dollar {{invested}} in bonds in 1801 would be worth nearly a thousand dollars by 1998, a dollar invested in stocks that same <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> worth {{more than half a}} million dollars in real terms. Meanwhile, a dollar invested in gold in 1801 would by 1998 be worth just 78 cents.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{rookie of}} this <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Brenton Sanderson, who would play over 200 games {{by the end}} of career, {{retiring}} at the end of 2005, and be recognised with selection into the Geelong Hall of Fame.

25|$|On 29 September, police {{adopted a}} less {{aggressive}} approach, sometimes employing negotiators to urge protesters to leave. 89 protesters were arrested; there were 41 casualties, including 12 police.

25|$|In Winter 1959/60, {{against a}} {{background}} of a continuing drop in passenger numbers, a study was undertaken to determine the actual numbers using the line and the savings to be made by closing it to passenger traffic. The results showed that 321 passengers per day were using the Allhallows line to travel to and from Gravesend, and that a saving of £25,500 per <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> made, were the line closed.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 the Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965–68) {{issued the}} Todd Report, which {{examined}} {{the possibility of}} a medical school being established at Keele. It was considered that North Staffordshire would be a good site, having a large local population and several hospitals. However, a minimum intake of 150 students each <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> necessary to make a medical school economically and educationally viable, and the university was at that time too small to support a medical school of this size.|$|E

25|$|Although the Lost Year {{had come}} to a close, the black {{students}} who returned to the high schools were not welcomed by the other students. Rather, the black students had a difficult time getting past mobs to enter the school, and, once inside, they were often subject to physical and emotional abuse. The students were back at school and everything would eventually resume normal function, but the Lost <b>Year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a pretext for new hatred towards the black students in the public high school.|$|E
25|$|Ginsburg was {{followed}} in 1955 by A. Fruichter, in 1957 by Dr. Eli Kahn, and in 1959 by Bertram G. Fink.

After a two-year hiatus, Abraham Mandelbaum joined as rabbi in 1969, but served only until 1970. Saul Aranov served from 1970 to 1976 and {{was followed}} by Rabbis Rosenberg (1976–1977) and Sultan (1977). Milton Polinsky served from 1977 to 1982, followed by Akiva Mann (1982–1989).|$|E
25|$|Thiele's {{reckoning}} {{is based}} on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which was used for most but not all of the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his first partial year; his first full <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 597/596 BCE, and his eleventh year, the year Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BCE. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from Tishri in autumn, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BCE.|$|E

The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of Southampton, as Southampton were a relatively small club. The club were beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be, especially when Keegan captained England in the 1980 European Championships in Italy.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} that to {{diminish}} deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon would require enormous financial resources to compensate the loggers and given them an economic incentive to pursue other areas of activity. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has estimated that a total of approximately US$547.2 million (1 billion Brazilian reais) per <b>year</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required from international sources to compensate the forest developers and establish a highly organized framework to fully implement forest governance and monitoring, and the foundation of new protected forest areas in the Amazon for future sustainability.|$|E
