500|$|In April 2012, The Independent {{reported}} that Simon Cowell, the group's manager, had challenged prominent songwriters {{to compete for}} space on One Direction's second album. Dee Demirbag, responsible for repertoire at BMG Rights Management, a music publisher, in Scandinavia, said: [...] "Breaking a boy band in the U.S. is about as big as it gets in the music industry, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> competition to get cuts on the next One Direction album is immense". In addition, the article {{reported that}} Syco Records was working on candidates with Max Martin and Kristian Lundin. By August 2012, {{it was confirmed that}} album would feature work from veterans such as Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and Shellback.|$|E
500|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Downs {{music is}} rooted in Americana and draws {{on a number of}} styles, {{including}} blues, folk, ragtime, norteño, rock, and country music. For the songs, Cooder adapted musical language from historical sources and incorporated styles from both North and South American traditions. In his interview on Marketplace, he explained his stylistic approach for Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, stating [...] "to me, these musical styles and sounds are narratives as well. I mean everything about them — if it's an accordion, horns, the banda horns for the immigrant tunes — they all are part of the story. And you can see it then, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> Arizona border that's hot, 120 degrees in the shade, dusty. The banda horns are coming from some truck over there." [...] According to him, musical settings for certain songs were decided based on their respective compositions, such as when [...] "the words would come to me in ¾ time, that meant corrido, that means accordion; banda horns because they’re exciting." ...|$|E

[...] A subsequent military inquiry countered FBI's allegations by saying that the prisoner treatment was degrading but not inhuman, without addressing the allegation of DIA staff regularly impersonating FBI officers—usually a felony offense.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{during the}} tour, Chappell sent an email to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which criticised Ganguly as being [...] "mentally and {{physically}} unfit" [...] {{to lead the}} team. Chappell stated that Ganguly's [...] "negative attitude" [...] would hamper India's development as a unit for the 2007 World Cup and that the injuries suffered by Ganguly are [...] "imaginary". He also accused Ganguly of desperately trying to retain captaincy {{and that he had}} [...] "lost the trust and respect of his teammates". The email was leaked, and upon returning to India, both Ganguly and Chappell were summoned to a BCCI board meeting in Mumbai. Before the meeting, Ganguly told a Kolkata-based newspaper, [...] "I will say whatever I want to to the board. I hope the board will {{give me a chance to}} explain. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> character of a person who within hours of a truce goes and writes such an e-mail.".

2500|$|... "Miami" [...] has a trip rock style. It {{begins with}} a drum loop, with Mullen's hi-hats playing {{backwards}} through a very extreme equalization filter. Howie B explained, [...] "The main groove is actually just Larry's hi-hat, {{but it sounds like}} a mad engine running or something really crazy – about as far away from a hi-hat as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine...</b> <b>the</b> task in 'Miami' was to make it unlike anything else on the album, and also unlike anything else you'd ever have heard before." [...] Edge also comes in with a frenetic guitar riff and Bono's affected vocal style singing about Miami in metaphors and descriptions of loud, brash Americana. D. Leurssen described it as a [...] "sonic travelogue," [...] while the Edge termed it [...] "creative tourism." [...] In 2005, Q magazine included the song [...] "Miami" [...] in a list of [...] "Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists". However, Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine acknowledged the inclusion of the song in Q's list and said [...] "I’m pretty sure they gave this album some super-glowing review when it was first released, so clearly they’re not to be trusted in the first." ...|$|E
