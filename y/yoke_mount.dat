5000|$|The English mount or <b>Yoke</b> <b>mount</b> has a frame or [...] "yoke" [...] {{with right}} {{ascension}} axis bearings {{at the top}} and the bottom ends, and a telescope attached inside the midpoint of the yoke allowing it to swing on the declination axis. The telescope is usually fitted entirely inside the fork, although there are exceptions such as the Mt. Wilson 2.5 m reflector, and there are no counterweights as with the German mount.|$|E
50|$|The IRTF {{is mounted}} on a large English yoke {{equatorial}} mount. The mount is very stiff, reducing flexure and allowing for accurate pointing of the telescope. Since the telescope is on an equatorial mount, the telescope can observe targets through the zenith without concern for field rotation. The <b>yoke</b> <b>mount</b> prevents the telescope from pointing north of +69 degrees declination. Since the telescope was primarily intended for planetary science, this restriction {{was considered to be}} acceptable. Since the telescope is on a heavy mounting, it is relatively immune from vibration or wind shake.|$|E
5000|$|The Hale {{telescope}} uses {{a special}} type of equatorial mount called a [...] "horseshoe mount", a modified <b>yoke</b> <b>mount</b> that replaces the polar bearing {{with an open}} [...] "horseshoe" [...] structure that gives the telescope full access to the entire sky, including Polaris and stars near it. The optical tube assembly (OTA) uses a Serrurier truss, then newly invented by Mark U. Serrurier of Caltech in Pasadena in 1935, designed to flex {{in such a way}} as to keep all of the optics in alignment. [...] Theodore von Karman designed the lubrication system to avoid potential issues with turbulence during tracking.|$|E

5000|$|Alt-alt mounts, or altitude-altitude mounts, are designs {{similar to}} {{horizontal}} equatorial <b>yoke</b> <b>mounts</b> or Cardan suspension gimbals. This mount {{is an alternative}} to the altazimuth mount that has the advantage of not having a blind spot near the zenith, and for objects near the celestial equator the field rotation is minimized. [...] It has the disadvantage of having all the mass, complexity, and engineering problems of its equatorial counterpart, so is only used in specialty applications such as satellite tracking. These mounts may include a third azimuth axis (an altitude-altitude-azimuth mount) to rotate the entire mount into an orientation that allows smoother tracking.|$|R
50|$|Tilting {{the polar}} axis adds {{a level of}} {{complexity}} to the mount. Mechanical systems have to be engineered to support one or both ends of this axis (such as in fork or <b>yoke</b> <b>mounts).</b> Designs such as German equatorial or cross axis mounts also need large counter weights to counterbalance {{the mass of the}} telescope. Larger domes and other structures are also needed to cover the increased mechanical size and range of movement of equatorial mounts. Because of this, equatorial mounts become less viable in very large telescopes and have been pretty much replaced by altazimuth mounts for those applications.|$|R
40|$|Bird attitudes, with roll, pitch, and yaw angles, are {{required}} for modeling the measured electromagnetic response of the earth. Global Positioning System (GPS) antennas {{can be used in}} airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems to monitor airborne platform attitude and bird maneuver. We have found evidence from photographic sequences that four GPS antennas, three on the bird and one on the aircraft, generally are adequate for angular and altitude geometry control. The mounting system for the bird frame introduces vibration noise. We have developed a model that predicts bird maneuver from the use of GPS antennas already present during routine airborne surveys. The bird motion, whether inline or crossline, is modeled from the difference between the aircraft location and the mean location of the bird. This also accurately predicts the roll of the bird when an inline <b>yoke</b> <b>mounting</b> is used. The minimum number of GPS antennas required to monitor the motion of a cylindrical electromagnetic (EM) bird typical of frequency-domain systems is two, one on the aircraft and one on the bird. We have defined optimum locations of GPS antennas to enable geometric monitoring of towed-bird systems. The findings suggest that the bird be mounted with two aerodynamically efficient GPS antennas, one on the nose and one on the tail. This enables the measurement of the pitch and yaw of the bird, with roll deduced using the third GPS on the helicopter...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a surface magneto-optical Kerr effect (SMOKE) setup designed {{to study the}} magnetic properties of ultrathin films in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). As in earlier systems, a crossed-poles electromagnet is used, which allows measurements in the longitudinal or polar configurations {{to be carried out}} without displacing the sample or changing the optical path. The poles are mounted in-vacuum, while the coils and <b>yoke</b> are <b>mounted</b> externally to obtain a higher magnetic field (~ 2. 8 ?kOe).

On the M1903 carriage the pivot <b>yoke</b> is <b>mounted</b> in the pedestal and rests upon a ring of ball bearings {{on the base of}} the pedestal. The entire weight of the gun and top part of the carriage rests upon this ring of ball bearings. The bushings for the pivot yoke form two supports against the thrust of firing. At {{the upper end of the}} pivot yoke, on either side, trunnion bearings are provided for the cradle trunnions. The shield and shield supports are bolted to the pivot yoke. The opening for the gun in the shield is prolonged underneath to allow for the removal of the piston and springs from the recoil cylinder.|$|R

5000|$|The {{equatorial}} mount has north-south [...] "polar axis" [...] tilted to be {{parallel to}} Earth's polar axis {{that allows the}} telescope to swing in an east-west arc, with a second axis perpendicular to that to allow the telescope to swing in a north-south arc.

40|$|AbstractThe {{applicability}} of second-generation high-temperature superconductors (HTS) made from YBCO coated conductors in accelerator magnet technology was demonstrated by a consortium under {{the lead of}} Danfysik. A 3 T demonstrator dipole magnet was designed, built and tested by the consortium. In total 2. 5 km HTS tape was manufactured and tested by SuperPower.

Development of this satellite started in 1978 and was culminated in the recent (May 81) completion of testing of the first flight unit. The attitude control system for this synchronous orbit spacecraft is a three-axis zero momentum, general microprocessor controlled concept that not only provides attitude and velocity control during the normal seven year orbital life, but also provides provisions to operate and maintain control during special circumstances such as failed battery eclipses, lunar eclipses, and nuclear events. In addition, the attitude control system electronics and embedded software system provides the capability to drive the single axis solar array, two axis gimbal dish antenna, and translates ground commands into beam pattern reconfiguration driver signals for the phase shifters and variable power dividers of the payload multiple beam antennas. The control system equipment compliment consists of a redundant passive radiation balance earth sensor, solar array <b>yoke</b> <b>mounted</b> analog sun sensors, and a yaw rate gyro as the sensing elements, the aforementioned general purpose microprocessor (Attitude Control Electronics containing 8 K of PROM memory and 1 K of RAM in which is implemented the control logic and algorithms, four skewed reaction wheels for normal orbital control torquing/momentum storage and 16 one-pound hydrazine thrusters for initial acquisition and orbit adjust maneuvers and wheel unloading. The basic requirements to which this system {{was designed}} are to (i) acquire an earth pointing reference from arbitrary initial attitudes and rates of 1. 1 °/sec per axis, maintain control during initial inclination error removal (maximum of 2. 5 degrees) to within 1, 1 and 2 degrees for the roll, pitch, and yaw axes respectively for all times of year and orbit positions, (ii) maintain pitch, roll, and yaw errors to less than 0. 08, 0. 08, and 0. 8 degrees during normal orbital operations (iii) maintain orientation of the solar array to within 1 ° of the sunline, (iv) establish and control station latitude and longitude to within + 0. 1 °, (v) provide the capability {{to recover from the}} effects of a nuclear event via autonomous detection and corrective action, (vi) provide the capability to reorient/reconfigure the payloac gimballed dish antenna and multiple beam antennas and (vii) provide the capability to modify up to 1 K of the PROM stored software using a ground commanded mode.

50|$|Plugged tooth coils are {{frequently}} {{used in a}} star-shaped stator design where a final ring or <b>yoke</b> is <b>mounted</b> after the assembly of the coils. Inside slotted stator laminations can also be fitted with plugged tooth coils. But in that case, fill factor losses can be registered due to the plug-in direction from the inside to the outside. Conical windings are only possible and beneficial, if the plug-in direction is from the outside to the inside. As {{for the type of}} insulation, it is possible - as with the classical single teeth - to work with paper insulations or insulating end plates. If insert molding is applied with a star-shaped package, it is not referred to as plugged tooth coils anymore because of the necessary direct winding with a needle winding system, flyer winding technique or linear winding technique.Plugged tooth coils eventually require at least two contact points per coil, just as the single teeth. Toothed chains of a phase connected in series are rarely produced since, compared with the already difficult assembly of phase-wise wound T-segments, they will be followed by further assembly movements (pushing onto the stator pack) and the changing length ratios of the connecting wires between the coil sections of a phase. Therefore, two cut-and-clamp contacts per coil {{are frequently}} used for plugged tooth coils which finally reach into a control card or a lead frame via pin-like forms of the contacts.|$|R
40|$|Many {{companies}} find {{it difficult}} to maintain commonality and economies of scale in products with strict customer design requirements that may vary greatly from contract-to-contract or piece-to-piece. These strict and varied requirements typically result in highly customized products that are costly to manufacture, involve small production runs, and require long delivery times. In this paper we discuss how the strategic incorporation of product platforms into the design process can leverage the design effort of individually customized products. The example involves the design of cross-sections for <b>yokes</b> used to <b>mount</b> valve actuators in the nuclear power industry. Through this example we demonstrate the process of creating a market segmentation grid, choosing a targeted segment, creating a product platform for the yoke cross-section, and subsequently defining the yoke product family. Reducing the number of yoke patterns when manufacturing yoke castings will generate the most significant savings since the proposed modular architecture for pattern construction reduces the number of new yoke patterns. Implementation of the yoke platforms will also reduce design cycle time and costs, shorten quotation and lead times, and improve overall customer satisfaction and good will. The end result is a product platform design process that will improve response to customer requests, reduce design cost, and improve time to market for companies that make small production runs of highly customized products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] - Walking Line Assembly (WLA) is {{performed}} by positioning workers along assembly line at every process {{stations in the}} production line as and when required. This has benefitted the assembly and fabrication industry {{without the need for}} a dedicated layout, thereby leading to reduction in the fixed costs. This paper describes the application of WLA in prototype fabrication of yoke sub-assembly and details its effectiveness. The WLA procedure is described in two parts: Part I presents the technical aspects and challenges involved in development and fabrication of engine <b>mount</b> <b>yoke</b> tube assembly for a civil aircraft. This highlights the importance and significance of the parts, brackets, dimensional robustness, procedures, assembly, jigs and fixtures associated and the necessity of categorizing it as Class- 1. Activities representing reverse engineering process and fabrication of yoke tube are detailed comprehensively. Part II presents the WLA model adopted for this assembly. Comparison with conventional methods and layouts of fixed and walking line assembly are done. Further, WLA is modified with a common stage set on every process where the expected capability of the task in shop floor is brought out in consensus with the operational demand and standards. This is achieved with very little disturbance to the existing aircraft fixed line fabrication set up. This model has given encouraging results by expediting the processes and provides an ideal option for building of prototypes in development stage of an aircraft project.
