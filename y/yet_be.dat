5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the FÃ¼hrerbunker that there might <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are {{generally}} globular proteins, acting {{alone or in}} larger complexes. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> predicted from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users {{for their ability to}} function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs or fork-crowned lemurs are strepsirrhine primates; {{the four}} species {{comprise}} the genus Phaner. Like all lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, {{where they are}} found only in the west, north, and east sides of the island. They are named for the two black stripes which run up from the eyes, converge {{on the top of}} the head, and run down the back as a single black stripe. They were originally placed in the genus Lemur in 1839, later moved between the genera Cheirogaleus and Microcebus, and given their own genus in 1870 by John Edward Gray. Only one species (Phaner furcifer) was recognized, until three subspecies described in 1991 were promoted to species status in 2001. New species may <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> identified, particularly in northeast Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{has been}} accused by several {{newspapers}} of having embellished her life story. A journalist with the same name, Heather Mills, at that time at The Observer, accused Mills of impersonating her {{for over a year}} in the late 1990s, showing people cuttings of articles the journalist had written, which helped Mills secure a job presenting The General, a BBC TV programme about Southampton General Hospital. There were also doubts about Mills's claim that she had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, because the Heather Mills Health Trust had given away thousands of prosthetic limbs to landmine victims, but the nomination cannot <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> proven because the identities of all nominees remain secret for 50 years.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Solar System {{is still}} unknown. The Sun's {{gravitational}} field {{is estimated to}} dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light years (125,000 AU).

5|$|Of {{eukaryotic}} groups, the protists {{are most}} commonly unicellular and microscopic. This {{is a highly}} diverse group of organisms that {{are not easy to}} classify. Several algae species are multicellular protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> discovered.|$|E

5|$|Although Myotis alcathoe was {{initially}} known only from Greece and Hungary and {{was thought to}} be restricted to southeast Europe, records since then have greatly expanded its range, and it is now known from Spain and England to Sweden and European Turkey. In several European countries, focused searches were conducted to detect its occurrence. Its habitat generally consists of moist, deciduous, mature forest near streams, for example in ravines or in alluvial forest (forest near a river), where there are many decaying trees that the bat can use as roosting sites. In Germany, its preferred habitat consists of mixed deciduous forest. In the south of the continent, it usually occurs in mountain ranges, but the factors affecting its distribution in the north are less well known. Its range appears to be similar in shape to those of the greater and lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and R. hipposideros) and Myotis emarginatus. It may <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> found in other European countries, such as the Benelux countries, Ireland, and Moldova. Although there are abundant records from some areas, such as France and Hungary, the species appears to be rare in most of its range.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 proton shell can be {{obtained}} from two sources: the variation in the partial spontaneous fission half-lives for isotones and the large gap in the alpha Q value for isotonic nuclei of hassium and darmstadtium. For spontaneous fission, it is necessary to measure the half-lives for the isotonic nuclei 268Sg, 270Hs and 272Ds. Since the isotopes 268Sg and 272Ds are not currently known, and fission of 270Hs has not been measured, this method cannot <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> used to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z=108 shell. Good evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 shell can nevertheless be found from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for 270Hs, 271Ds and 273Ds. More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the decay energy for the unknown nucleus 272Ds.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E

While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the EncyclopÃ¦dia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E

5|$|The concert {{tour was}} being {{discussed}} by executives {{as early as}} January2007. It was announced on August8,2007 via press release. It was confirmed that the tour would be promoted by AEG Live and Buena Vista Concerts, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It also featured American band and labelmates the Jonas Brothers as opening act. The tour would expand throughout North America, from October18,2007 in St. Louis, Missouri to January9,2008 in Albany, New York, {{with a total of}} fifty-four dates; fifty-three of which were in the United States and one which was in Canada. In October2007, another date was annexed in order to meet demand. In December2007, a fourteen-date extension of the tour was announced, with American duo Aly & A.J. opening seven of them; the opening act for the remaining dates was <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> announced. The extension featured new opening acts because the Jonas Brothers pulled out to record their then-forthcoming album A Little Bit Longer (2008). Subsequently, in the same month, one final date was annexed, and the American band Everlife was announced to as the final opening act. One dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer. In total, the Best of Both Worlds Tour raised over US $2million for the center.|$|E
5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the Inuit near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, {{but none of the}} Franklin expedition survivors he believed would be found among the Inuit. Though he concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed that the official expedition records would <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered hundreds of pages of Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party of white men {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, Unravelling the Franklin Mystery (1992) and Strangers Among Us (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The fission-survived isotope 298Fl, long {{expected}} to be doubly magic, is predicted to have alpha decay half-life around 17 days. The direct synthesis of the nucleus 298Fl by a fusionâevaporation pathway is currently impossible since no known combination of target and stable projectile can provide 184 neutrons in the compound nucleus, and radioactive projectiles such as calcium-50 (half-life fourteenseconds) cannot <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> used in the needed quantity and intensity. Currently, one possibility for the synthesis of the expected long-lived nuclei of copernicium (291Cn and 293Cn) and flerovium near {{the middle of the}} island include using even heavier targets such as curium-250, berkelium-249, californium-251, and einsteinium-254, that when fused with calcium-48 would produce nuclei such as 291Mc and 291Fl (as decay products of 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv), with just enough neutrons to alpha decay to nuclides close enough to the centre of the island to possibly undergo electron capture and move inwards to the centre, though the cross sections would be small and little is yet known about the decay properties of superheavy nuclides near the beta stability line. This may be the best hope currently to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability, but it is speculative and may or may not work in practice. Another possibility is to use controlled nuclear explosions to achieve the high neutron flux necessary to create macroscopic amounts of such isotopes. This would mimic the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability after polonium bypassed, as it would bypass the gaps of instability at 258â260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108). Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10â12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E
