[...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful.

Rogers declined Lajoie's request {{for an increase in}} salary and as a result, Lajoie jumped to the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics, owned by former Phillies' part-owner Benjamin Shibe and managed by Connie Mack. Frank Hough offered Lajoie the contract on behalf of Mack.

[...] "The Phillies opened their season and drew 6,000 fans. A week later, when we opened, there were 16,000 in the stands. The American League was here to stay", Lajoie later said. Lajoie's batting average that year was [...]426 (it was originally recorded at [...]405, later changed to [...]422 before finally revised again to [...]426). The batting average mark became the all-time AL record after the number was revised. Previously, Ty Cobb and George Sisler had been credited with having the AL's all-time mark. That same year in a game against the Chicago White Sox' Clark Griffith, Lajoie became the second Major Leaguer to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 117 game after Abner Dalrymple in 1881. For the 1901 season, Lajoie led the majors in doubles (48), and led the majors in hits (232), batting average (.426), runs (145), on-base (.463) and slugging percentage (.643), and total bases (350). His 125 RBIs led the AL and his 14 home runs were a career-best and his 48 doubles are a Philadelphia Athletics' record. Mack said of Lajoie, [...] "He plays so naturally and so easily it looks like lack of effort." [...] Author Robert Kelly writes: ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, pocket watches were {{commonly}} unreliable for timekeeping {{and were}} worn more as fashion accessories. In response to this, Beaumarchais spent {{nearly a year}} researching improvements. In July 1753, {{at the age of}} twenty one, he invented an escapement for watches that allowed them to be made substantially more accurate and compact. The first man to take an interest in this new invention was Jean-André Lepaute, the royal clockmaker in France. If there was a clock chiming in the wealthy homes of Paris, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> Lepaute built it himself. Lepaute had been a mentor to Beaumarchais after discovering the boy’s talent in a chance encounter. He encouraged him as he worked on the new invention, earned his trust, and promptly stole the idea for himself. You can imagine Beaumarchais’ surprise when he read in the September issue of Le Mercure de France that M. Lepaute had just invented the most wonderful mechanism for a more portable clock. Beaumarchais was enraged. “C’est normal,” said his father, “C’est comme ca.” It’s normal for the upper class to step on those beneath them. Well, Beaumarchais did not want any of that life. He wrote a strongly worded letter to that same newspaper defending the invention as his own and urging the Royal Academy of Sciences to see the proof for themselves. “In the interests of truth and my reputation,” he says, “I cannot let such an infidelity go by in silence and must claim as mine the invention of this device." [...] After further examination, the Academy indeed ruled that the mechanism was his and not Lepaute’s. The public had just watched this young nobody take down the biggest clockmaker in Europe. Beaumarchais had become a celebrity overnight. One of his greatest feats was a watch mounted on a ring, made for Madame de Pompadour, a mistress of Louis XV. The affair first brought Beaumarchais to national attention and introduced him to the royal court at Versailles Louis XV was impressed with Beaumarchais’s skill and audacity, and hastily hired him as the court's royal watchmaker.|$|E
