500|$|After much research, Nolan's {{brother and}} co-writer, Jonathan, {{suggested}} the Joker's first two appearances, {{published in the}} first issue of Batman (1940), as the crucial influences. Christopher had Jonathan watch Fritz Lang's 1933 crime film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker, with the Joker resembling Mabuse's characteristics. Christopher Nolan referred to Lang's film as [...] "essential research for anyone attempting to write a supervillain". Jerry Robinson, one of the Joker's co-creators, was consulted on the character's portrayal. Nolan decided to avoid divulging an in-depth origin story for the Joker, and instead portray his rise to power so as to not diminish the threat he poses, explaining to MTV News, [...] "the Joker we meet in The Dark Knight is fully formed... To me, the Joker is an absolute. There are no shades of gray to him– maybe shades of purple. He's unbelievably dark. He bursts in just as he did in the comics." [...] Nolan reiterated to IGN, [...] "We never wanted to do an origin story for the Joker in this film," [...] because [...] "the arc of the story is much more Harvey Dent's; the Joker is presented as an absolute. It's a very thrilling element in the film, and a very important element, but we wanted to deal with the rise of the Joker, not the origin of the Joker." [...] Nolan suggested [...] influenced a section of the Joker's dialogue in the film, in which he says that anyone can become like him given the right circumstances. Nolan also cited Heat as [...] "sort of an inspiration" [...] for his aim [...] "to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city": [...] "If you want to take on Gotham, you want to give Gotham a kind of weight and breadth and depth in there. So <b>you</b> <b>wind</b> up dealing with the political figures, the media figures. That's part of the whole fabric of how a city is bound together." ...|$|E

She made a guest appearance onstage with the Rolling Stones at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, {{in her hometown of}} Tucson, where she and Jagger sang [...] "Tumbling Dice". On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, [...] "I loved it. I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to get scared.

2500|$|Born to Bernard Hopkins, Sr. and {{his wife}} Shirley, Bernard grew up {{with his family in}} the Raymond Rosen housing project in Philadelphia. Hopkins turned to crime early in his life. [...] By the age of {{thirteen}} he was mugging people and had been stabbed three times. At seventeen, Hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in Graterford Prison for nine felonies. While in prison he witnessed the murder of another inmate in an argument over a pack of cigarettes, but also discovered his passion for boxing. After serving almost five years, Hopkins was released from prison in 1988. He then decided to use boxing as an escape from his previous life, and converted to Islam. While Hopkins was leaving the prison for the final time, the warden told him he'd [...] "see [...] again when <b>you</b> <b>wind</b> up back in here", to which Hopkins replied [...] "I ain't ever coming back here." [...] Later, Hopkins attributed his personal discipline to his experiences and time spent in Graterford Prison.|$|E
2500|$|Sara Firth, a London-based {{correspondent}} with RT {{resigned in}} protest over the network's {{coverage of the}} MH17 disaster.

She told the Guardian [...] "I walked into the newsroom {{and there was an}} eyewitness account making allegations [...] and analysis, if you can call it, from our correspondent in the studio. It was just appalling, {{in a situation like that}} where there are families waiting to be informed and a devastating loss of life." [...] She also noted that [...] "There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong" [...] and stated [...] "I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it." [...] In follow-up interview she said [...] "In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and so what <b>you</b> <b>wind</b> up with on air is outright misinformation." [...] Calling RT [...] "mass information manipulation" [...] Firth said [...] "they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove." [...] She also stated that [...] "The worst-kept secret is that RT is blatant propaganda. I’m one in a very long line of people who have left for the same reason." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two other novelists {{should be}} mentioned, for they, like Fielding and Richardson, were in {{dialogue}} through their works. [...] Laurence Sterne's and Tobias Smollett's works offered up oppositional {{views of the}} self in society and the method of the novel. The clergyman Laurence Sterne consciously set out to imitate Jonathan Swift with his Tristram Shandy (17591767). Tristram seeks to write his autobiography, but like Swift's narrator in A Tale of a Tub, he worries that nothing in his life can be understood without understanding its context. [...] For example, he tells the reader that {{at the very moment}} he was conceived, his mother was saying, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>wind</b> the clock?" [...] To clarify how he knows this, he explains that his father took care of winding the clock and [...] "other family business" [...] on one day a month. [...] To explain why the clock had to be wound then, he has to explain his father. [...] In other words, the biography moves backward rather than forward in time, only to then jump forward years, hit another knot, and move backward again. [...] It is a novel of exceptional energy, of multi-layered digressions, of multiple satires, and of frequent parodies. Journalist, translator, and historian Tobias Smollett, on the other hand, wrote more seemingly traditional novels. [...] He concentrated on the picaresque novel, where a low-born character would go through a practically endless series of adventures. Sterne thought that Smollett's novels always paid undue attention to the basest and most common elements of life, that they emphasized the dirt. [...] Although this is a superficial complaint, it points to an important difference between the two as authors. [...] Sterne came to the novel from a satirical background, while Smollett approached it from journalism. [...] In the 19th century, novelists would have plots much nearer to Smollett's than either Fielding's or Sterne's or Richardson's, and his sprawling, linear development of action would prove most successful.|$|E
