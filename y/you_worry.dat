500|$|After {{protracted}} negotiations, lasting for {{the bulk}} of his last season at the club, Reid completed his move from Forest to Tottenham {{on the last day of}} the January 2005 transfer window. He was joined by Michael Dawson for a combined fee of £8 million. He made his debut in a 3–1 win over Portsmouth on 5 February 2005, with Martin Jol saying [...] "Andy Reid also did well on his debut, and <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> a bit how new players will cope with the Premiership".|$|E
500|$|In the summer, Margaret {{collaborated with}} Thomas Karlsson and Mats Tärnfors on [...] "Start a Fire"—the {{official}} {{song of the}} 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship in Poland. She performed it at the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship Opening Ceremony in August {{in front of an}} audience of 62,000 in the National Stadium in Warsaw, before the Poland v. Serbia match broadcast in over 168 countries. [...] "Start a Fire" [...] was released as the second single from Margaret's debut studio album. Distributed only in Poland, it peaked at number ten. Around this time, the singer recorded a cover of Katarzyna Sobczyk's song [...] "O mnie się nie martw" [...] ("Don't <b>You</b> <b>Worry</b> About Me"), which was used as the theme song for the Polish TV series of the same name.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from her}} solo work, Margaret {{featured}} on the single [...] "Let It Snow!" [...] from Old School Yule! by Matt Dusk (2016). She also appeared on two charity albums, Siemacha po kolędzie (2014) and Gwiazdy po kolędzie (2015), and provided vocals for a non-album single [...] "6 in the Morning" [...] (2017) by the Swedish music group Vax. Margaret also released few non-album promotional singles, including [...] "O mnie się nie martw" [...] ("Don't <b>You</b> <b>Worry</b> About Me"; 2014), a theme song for the Polish TV series of the same name, [...] "Smak radości" [...] ("The Taste of Happiness"; 2015), and [...] "Coraz bliżej święta" [...] ("Christmas Is Getting Closer"; 2015). The last two songs were recorded {{as a part of}} the Polish Coca-Cola promotional campaign in which Margaret took part. [...] "Coraz bliżej święta" [...] peaked at number thirty-two in Poland.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "It's got some {{effective}} moments and aspects, {{but the film}} goes {{in and out of}} plausibility, and its elements never manage to unify into a coherent whole". Claudia Puig, in her review for USA Today, wrote, [...] "The dialogue by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer is spotty. There are some great, pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, [...] "Clive Owen makes a semi-believable hero, not performing too many feats that are physically unlikely. He's handsome and has the obligatory macho stubble, but he has a quality that makes <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> a little about him". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B–" [...] rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "the star of the pic may well be NYC's Guggenheim Museum and Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends".|$|E
500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had [...] "sent a message to everyone that music is free, and that's disturbing. It's easy {{to do that when}} you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really something that <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away hundreds of millions of albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E

500|$|Blackadder Goes Forth is more satirical in tone {{than the}} {{previous}} three Blackadder series and most sitcoms, taking the opportunity to present an anti-war message. The dialogue is marked throughout by satirical musings {{about the nature of}} the war, its origins and the effects on the soldiers who suffered over its course. The idea that the soldiers suffered whilst their commanders remained safely distant from the action was also referenced on many occasions, such as when Melchett says to Baldrick, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> my boy, if you should falter, remember that Captain Darling and I are behind you!", to which Blackadder responds, [...] "About 35 miles behind you!". In the episode [...] "Corporal Punishment", Blackadder justifies the shooting for food of a carrier pigeon (which turns out to be Melchett's pet) by saying, [...] "With 50,000 men getting killed a week, who's going to miss a pigeon?" [...] This episode sees Blackadder being sentenced to death by firing squad for the act, a reference to the capital sentences carried out under the laws of war in force at the time.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
500|$|Sos most {{prominent}} political statement, [...] "Don't Give Up", was fuelled by Gabriel's discontent with rising unemployment during Margaret Thatcher's premiership and Dorothea Lange's photograph [...] "Migrant Mother". The track {{began as a}} rhythm pattern of slow, low-pitched tom-tom drums that Gabriel made, and Lanois believed could serve as the centrepiece of a song. Tony Levin added bass {{to create a more}} harmonious sound, and {{during the second half of}} the track, put a nappy behind his bass strings to dampen the sound. Gabriel ensured the song, which follows a narrative of an unemployed man and his lover, was written as a conversational piece. He initially sought out Dolly Parton to portray the woman, although Parton declined; his friend Kate Bush later agreed to feature. Bush serves as the song's respondent, she assumes a comforting role and with delicate vocals, sings lines such as [...] "Rest your head/ <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> too much". The album's first side culminates with [...] "That Voice Again", in which Gabriel explores the concept of conscience, examining the [...] "parental voice in our heads that either helps or defeats us". Co-written with David Rhodes, who plays guitar over Katché and Levin's input, the song was written after Gabriel's initial discussions with Martin Scorsese about scoring The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).|$|E

500|$|According to Questlove, [...] "The Root", [...] "Spanish Joint", and [...] "Greatdayndamornin' / Booty'" [...] {{serve as}} the [...] "virtuoso part of the record", {{featuring}} intricate technical arrangements, no overdubbing, and Charlie Hunter playing both electric and bass guitar. [...] "The Root" [...] is a mid-tempo heartbreak song with the bass line and guitar solo played simultaneously by Hunter on an eight-string guitar. It is about a vengeful woman's effect on the narrator: [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". Miles Marshall Lewis writes of the song's subject matter, [...] " [...] can actually be digested and emotionally felt, sadly rare for Hot 97 R" [...] Co-written by Roy Hargrove, [...] "Spanish Joint" [...] is a salsa-infused, high tempo track about karma. It incorporates rhythmic Brazilian guitar licks by Hunter, funky horn arrangements by Hargrove, and Latin grooves and fusion instrumentation similar to Stevie Wonder's [...] "Don't <b>You</b> <b>Worry</b> 'bout a Thing" [...] (1973). [...] "Feel Like Makin' Love" [...] is a cover of Roberta Flack's 1974 hit of the same name with a low-key, quiet storm sound. [...] "Greatdayndamornin' / Booty'" [...] features double rimshots placed behind the beat by Questlove.|$|E

2500|$|Callaghan's {{advice to}} Bjelke-Petersen {{included}} the recommendation that he maintain his rambling style {{of communication with}} mangled syntax, recognising it added to his homespun appeal to ordinary people and also allowed him to avoid giving answers. His catchphrase response to unwelcome queries was, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> about that", a phrase that {{was used as the}} title of his 1990 memoir. Wear wrote: [...] "His verbal stumbling communicated decent simplicity and trustworthiness and, in order to enhance his popular appeal, Bjelke-Petersen appears to have exaggerated, or at least not tried to rid himself of, his famous speaking style." ...|$|E
