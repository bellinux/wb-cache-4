However, Berryman suggests {{that it is impossible to}} determine how the relationship ended up. While theories exist that the sonnets were written as literary exercises, H. C. Beeching suggests that they were written for a patron and not originally intended to be published together.|$|E
25|$|This sentimental, anti-intellectual form of pietism {{is seen in}} {{the thought}} and {{teaching}} of Zinzendorf, founder of the Moravians; but more intellectually rigorous forms of pietism are seen in the teachings of John Wesley, which were themselves influenced by Zinzendorf, and in the teachings of American preachers Jonathan Edwards, who restored to pietism Gerson's focus on obedience and borrowed from early church teachers Origen and Gregory of Nyssa the notion that humans <b>yearn</b> <b>for</b> God, and John Woolman, who combined a mystical view of the world with a deep concern for social issues; like Wesley, Woolman was influenced by Jakob Böhme, William Law and The Imitation of Christ. The combination of pietistic devotion and mystical experiences that are found in Woolman and Wesley are also found in their Dutch contemporary Tersteegen, who brings back the notion of the nous ("mind") as the site of God's interaction with our souls; through the work of the Spirit, our mind is able to intuitively recognize the immediate presence of God in our midst.|$|E

25|$|Loneliness is {{a common}} theme in Fassbinder's work, {{together}} {{with the idea that}} power becomes a determining factor in all human relationships. His characters <b>yearn</b> <b>for</b> love, but seem condemned to exert an often violent control over those around them. A good example is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (Die bitteren Tränen der Petra von Kant, 1972) which was adapted by Fassbinder from his plays. The title character is a fashion designer who lives in a self-created dreamland and the action is restricted mostly to her lavish bedroom. After the failure of her second marriage, Petra falls hopelessly and obsessively in love with Karin, a cunning working-class young woman who wants a career in modeling. The model's exploitation of Petra mirrors Petra's extraordinary psychological abuse of her silent assistant, Marlene. Fassbinder portrays the slow meltdown of these relationships as inevitable, and his actresses (there are no men in the film) move in a slow, trance-like way that hints at a vast world of longing beneath the beautiful, brittle surface.|$|E
25|$|Gay actor Martin Kurath (Prochnow) who is {{in prison}} {{develops}} a friendship with Thomas Manzoni (Hannawald), the 15-year-old son of the prison warden (Lüönd). The two {{fall in love and}} they both <b>yearn</b> <b>for</b> Kurath's release. This triggers intense indignation in their surroundings. After Kurath is released a year later, Thomas accompanied by Kurath, tells his parents he is a homosexual. His father tells him to leave and never return. Kurath and Thomas move in together and Thomas enrolls in school. Thomas' father, however, then has him arrested and condemned to a brutal reformatory. Kurath obtains a fake passport and poses as a psychology doctoral candidate and helps Thomas escape with him to Germany. They are betrayed by a German homosexual friend of Kurath's who insists, in Kurath's absence, that Thomas become his lover in order to obtain a German residency permit. Thomas does so, but then refuses to sleep with the betrayer, is kicked out and prostitutes himself. Broken by these experiences, he voluntarily returns to the reformatory. When he reaches 21 and is released, he is so psychologically damaged that, despite reunion with Kurath, he attempts suicide and is committed to a psychiatric hospital. He escapes and the film ends with a TV announcement that the police are looking for him and that the public should, if approaching him, treat him gently, as he is very depressed and confused.|$|E

[...] A reviewer from About.com said that it is [...] "contemporary retelling of...(an) engaging and timeless tale rich with human emotion and universal drama". The reviewer appreciates the film in most of the nuances of film making saying that this is [...] "enhanced by a brilliant musical score, and accentuated by superb performances by Sanjay Dutt, Saif Ali Khan, Raima Sen, Diya Mirza and debutante Vidya Balan in the lead role of Lalita". 3000 copies of the novella were sold within weeks of the film's release, owing to the film's good reception.|$|E

500|$|Although Marrash's poetical {{expression}} {{lacked the}} legal meticulousness found in works from Enlightened Europe, orientalist Shmuel Moreh {{has stated that}} Marrash became, with Ghabat al-haqq, [...] "the first Arab writer to reflect the optimism and humanistic view of 18th-century Europe. This view stemmed from the hope that education, science and technology would resolve such problems of humanity as slavery, religious discrimination, illiteracy, disease, poverty, war, and other scourges of mankind, and it gave utterance to his hope for brotherhood and equality among peoples." [...] Yet, his views on freedom differed {{from those of the}} French revolutionists and of his Middle Eastern contemporaries; indeed, he considered pleading for freedom on the basis of natural analogy to be superficial, for even nature responds to its own set of rules, according to Marrash. As a consequence, nothing in the universe may <b>yearn</b> <b>for</b> liberty without satisfying essential rules and needs that guarantee its existence. Being one of these, the need for progress may therefore justify the abolition of any restriction that does not serve as a regulator for a good system. In light of this reasoning, and in reference to the ongoing American Civil War, he thus in Ghabat al-haqq supported the abolition of slavery.|$|E
500|$|... "Lacrymosa" [...] {{incorporates}} the Lacrimosa sequence from Mozart's Requiem (1791). It additionally includes a 22-piece orchestra led by Dave Campbell and background vocals by The Millennium Choir. Inspired {{by the film}} Amadeus, the song contains electronic backing beats, symphonic string section, heavy guitar and a haunting choir. Its vocals make a contrasting representation of light and dark. Jim Farber of Daily News compared the song with the works of English progressive rock band Renaissance. [...] "Like You" [...] is written in memory of Lee's deceased sister, as was [...] "Hello" [...] on Fallen. Concerning this, the singer said, [...] "I can't help but be affected by that, and if it's my place to express myself {{and all the things}} that have been most deep and the most painful and have just touched me, I feel like it does honor her". One of the most personal songs on the album, [...] "Like You", contains lyrics which <b>yearn</b> <b>for</b> death so Lee can be with her sister. which are accompanied by heavy riffing guitars. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield found similarities between the track and American rock band My Chemical Romance's song [...] "Helena" [...] (2005); other critics compared the song with Evanescence's earlier material on Fallen. [...] "Lose Control" [...] was inspired by Balsamo's loud guitar and contains influences from Portishead. The protagonist shows her anger through the lines, [...] "You don't remember my name, I don't really care". According to Lee, the song is about wanting to be less apprehensive and looser.|$|E
500|$|In Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner {{writes that}} Bob {{is built into}} a highbrow snob and {{conservative}} Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart {{is a product of}} a [...] "mass-culture upbringing" [...] and thus is Bob's enemy. Frustrated by his early role as the target of [...] "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that [...] "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." [...] He also tries to [...] "manipulate the tastes of the masses" [...] by becoming a criminal mastermind. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, [...] "Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you <b>yearn</b> <b>for</b> a cold-hearted Republican who’ll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! You need me, Springfield!" [...] He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.|$|E

500|$|Despite having {{turned into}} a highly {{proficient}} band on stage, things were starting to heat up internally, with band members getting more vocal about the direction they wanted the music to go, {{as well as being}} dissatisfied with their treatment financially. Founding members Lord and Blackmore were tired of being identified as a [...] "clone of Vanilla Fudge" [...] and were starting to <b>yearn</b> <b>for</b> a sharper, rawer and overall heavier sound, similar to that introduced in Led Zeppelin's debut album, which had become a great success {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, after its release in January 1969. They felt that Rod Evans, with his tender, smooth voice, would not be able to cope with louder, more aggressive material. Evans had also expressed reservations about his permanence in the band and voiced his wish to permanently move to the US. Tensions were also high with bassist Nick Simper, whose playing style was considered, in Paice's words, [...] "stuck in the late '50s and early '60s" [...] by the other band members and unfit for the new musical direction they wanted to pursue. On the other hand, Simper sided with Blackmore against Lord's excessive influence in the band's songwriting and was critical of classical music getting in the way of harder rock. As a result of those tensions, communication between band members was at a minimum during the tour. It was in May that Lord and Blackmore agreed on changing the line-up, shifting out Evans. They talked their ideas over with drummer Paice, gaining his agreement to the line-up change. Coletta was surprised when he heard the trio's news, advising them to keep quiet about it until the tour was completed and they had returned home.|$|E

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it four out of five stars and states: [...] "Like those good old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Even if you might argue that some of Gandhi's principles seem outdated today, you cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness. And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries. It entertains you, yes, but it also makes you <b>yearn</b> <b>for</b> a perfect world. Judge it by any yardstick that you may, Lage Raho Munnabhai emerges a clear winner. Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride." [...] Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave four out of five stars stating that, [...] "everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them.
