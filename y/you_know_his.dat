500|$|In the song, Bono {{included}} the lyric: [...] "Jara sang, his song {{a weapon in}} the hands of love / <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> blood still cries from the ground". This refers to the Chilean political activist and folk singer Víctor Jara, who became a symbol of the resistance against the Augusto Pinochet military dictatorship after he was tortured and killed during the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. Bono learned of Jara after meeting René Castro, a Chilean mural artist, while on Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the military because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that had seized power in 1973 during the coup. While purchasing a silkscreen of Martin Luther King, Jr. that Castro had created, Bono noticed a print of Jara. He became more familiar with him after reading Una Canción Truncada (An Unfinished Song), written by Jara's widow Joan Turner.|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} {{presumptive}} 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump, Cryer shared his feelings on the May 5, 2016, {{episode of the}} podcast Never Not Funny. Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics. [...] I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>his</b> addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{midway through}} the twentieth century until 1969, {{ownership}} of Friar Park resided with the Roman Catholic Church. As a result, paint masked some of Crisp's inscriptions inside the house, but outside, signs reading [...] "Don't keep off the grass", [...] "Herons will be prosecuted" [...] and [...] "Eton boys are a Harrowing sight" [...] remained intact. Harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning, which he described to his Hare Krishna friend Shyamasundar Das as [...] "like songs really, about the devil, about friendship, life". One example was [...] "Shadows we are and shadows we depart", written on a stone sundial; another began: [...] "Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass / <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> faults, now let his foibles pass..." [...] This four-line verse was written above an entrance-way in a garden wall, {{and it was an}} aphorism that Harrison soon took to quoting in interviews. On 28 April 1970, just over two weeks after the Beatles' break-up, he used the words during an interview for New York's WPLQ Radio, as Village Voice reporter Howard Smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles. In October 1974 – towards the end of what Harrison termed a [...] "bad domestic year", following his split with Boyd – he used the same quote in an interview with BBC Radio's Alan Freeman, when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex-Beatles.|$|E

2500|$|On Jean Renoir, he said: [...] "I think Renoir is {{the only}} filmmaker who's {{practically}} infallible, who has never made a mistake on film. And I think if he never made mistakes, it's because he always found solutions based on simplicity—human solutions. He's one film director who never pretended. He never tried to have a style, and if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> work—which is very comprehensive, since he dealt {{with all sorts of}} subjects—when you get stuck, especially as a young filmmaker, you can think of how Renoir would have handled the situation, and you generally find a solution".|$|E
2500|$|On June 17, 2013, Shady Records {{producer}} The Alchemist {{appeared on}} RapFix Live, and tweeted to shadygodz (One of the Stan fans aka Sanket Kale Mathers) about Eminem's upcoming album: [...] "That's my boss. I DJ {{for him and}} I'm {{not at liberty to}} speak on much, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>his</b> caliber and what he does. Clearly going to further territories. I think what you would expect, especially after the last go-round. He was just getting his feet back on Relapse and then Recovery just came with the smash hits and everything and I think now — he's Eminem." [...] Prior to the announcement of the album's name, it was named to multiple [...] "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" [...] lists; including MTV, Complex where it was listed in sixth position (and later on in second); and XXL, where it was listed in fifth.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} book, Rowling {{establishes}} that Voldemort hates non-pure-blood wizards, despite being a half-blood himself. In a 2000 {{interview with the}} BBC, Rowling described Voldemort as a self-hating bully: [...] "Well I think it {{is often the case}} that the biggest bullies take what they know to be their own defects, as they see it, and they put them right on someone else and then they try and destroy the other and that's what Voldemort does." [...] In the same year, Rowling became more precise about Voldemort. She began to link him to real-life tyrants, describing him as [...] "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering". In 2004, though, Rowling said that she did not base Voldemort on any real person. In 2006, Rowling told an interviewer that Voldemort at his core has a human fear: the fear of death. She said: [...] "Voldemort's fear is death, ignominious death. I mean, he regards death itself as ignominious. He thinks that it's a shameful human weakness, as <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>His</b> worst fear is death." ...|$|E

"If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> {{purpose as}} well as I do,"--said Markham, and then paused, {{conscious}} that he might only incense his uncle without convincing him, as any thing he might say of Kerneguy's addresses to Alice {{was likely to be}} imputed to his own jealous suspicions--he looked on the ground, therefore, and was silent.|$|R
