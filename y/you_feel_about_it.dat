6000|$|... "I {{always do}} think, my lord, {{that there is}} nothing like sport to cement affection. I don't know how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> my lord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen patiently to me, dear. I {{know just}} how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I feel the same. But we've always known {{we would have to}} move some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know exactly}} how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mr. Hathaway," [...] he said, [...] "and I sympathize with you most earnestly. Will you allow me to sit down awhile? Thank you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I'm so awfully sorry,' {{said the}} young man; I keep dogs myself, so I know what <b>you</b> must <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I'll do {{anything}} I can in reparation.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well"--and her {{raised face}} shone up at him--"that's all I want <b>you</b> to <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If I weren't afraid," [...] she added, [...] "there are things I {{should like to}} say to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] said Lord John, who had paced restlessly {{about the}} dining-room whilst we partook of some food, [...] "I don't know how <b>you</b> fellows <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but for my part, I simply can't {{sit here and}} do nothin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can you be {{analytical}} and yet remain within {{the orbit of}} my understanding?" [...] she asked, with a faint smile. [...] "If so, I should like to know exactly how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better see how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{when the}} time comes," [...] she {{answered}} practically. [...] "Besides, I'm not sure they'd let me in here again. Did you see Stella's coat? Fancy feeling fur like that up against your chin! Fancy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|I found such an {{insufficiency}} in {{this statement}} of feeling that I wanted to laugh, but I perceived {{that it did}} not appeal to my wife's sense of humor. She said, [...] "I can understand how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mrs. Hasketh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} didn't," [...] said Mrs. Treat, in a kindly tone. [...] "But don't <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> bad <b>about</b> <b>it</b> one bit, for {{you ought to}} thank your lucky stars that you didn't break any of your bones." ...|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{significant}} difference between asking a Tahitian interviewee something like [...] "Please describe for me exactly how and why supercision (a penis-mutilating rite of passage) is done by Tahitians," [...] and asking him [...] "Can you tell me <b>about</b> your supercision?"..."Did <b>it</b> change your life in any way?" [...] "How?" [...] "What did <b>you</b> think and <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> then?" [...] "What do <b>you</b> think and <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{knew how}} <b>you</b> would <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{and that was}} why I didn't dare to tell you, and why we fixed up this story about old Brackett. I couldn't bear to live on you any longer, and to see you {{roughing}} it here, when we might be having all the money we wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know just}} how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> my dear," [...] said Mrs. Munger. [...] "'Been there myself,' as Jim says. But it grows upon you. I'm glad you didn't refuse outright;" [...] and Mrs. Munger {{looked at her with}} eyes of large expectance.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} that worries me is what {{happened}} this morning. I {{want to know how}} <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If it's on your nerves in the least we can have the old farm {{at the back of the}} house pulled down, or perhaps it has spoiled the notion for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{could not}} help it, dear, and you should not wish it were otherwise. Now, never mind what <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but let us lay our heads {{together}} and consider {{what is to be}} done. You think, I suppose, that Bladud may go {{on for a long time}} searching for this youth Cormac?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dick {{gave him}} a {{grateful}} look. [...] "It's difficult to tell <b>you</b> how I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but I'll {{do my best to}} make good and show that you have not been mistaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Now, then,' said she, {{when we had}} seated ourselves, 'let us go to work to make {{experiments}} with your tube. I am so glad <b>you</b> do not <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as I thought you would.' ...|$|R
60|$|SCHUTZMACHER. Well, {{of course}} I shant if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that way <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But I dont think you {{understand}} Dubedat. However, perhaps thats because I'm a Jew. Good-night, Dr Blenkinsop [shaking hands].|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{asking a}} good deal, I know," [...] Lord Nunneley said, [...] "and, of course, {{it all depends}} upon how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But I tell you frankly, I can't help thinking--you must realize a little that this blackmailing case, even {{if it turns out}} well, is bound to put a {{different}} complexion upon things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A cat is a cat," [...] Amuba repeated. [...] "I can {{understand}} what <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> though to my mind it is ridiculous. There are thousands of cats in Thebes; let them choose another one for the temple. But I grant the danger of what has happened, and I know that if it is found out {{there is no hope}} for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know just}} how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> you {{daughter}} of Eve," [...] she said, with gay sympathy, [...] "but December roads are damp, {{and if you are}} going to walk to Marrs' you are not going to do it in those frivolous Parisian concoctions, even with overboots on; so be brave, dear heart, and show that you have a soul above little red satin shoes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> because it's how {{it always}} strikes me," [...] Headingly {{answered}} with feeling. [...] "I'm not quite clear {{in my own}} mind how these things should be approached--if they are to be approached at all--but I am sure this is not the way. On the whole, I prefer the ruins that I have not seen to those which I have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed you do, my love," [...] {{said the}} skeleton, {{with a world}} of pride in his voice; [...] "but <b>you</b> mustn't <b>feel</b> bad <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> for every pound you gain makes you worth just {{so much more to}} the show." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> {{that way}} <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> you'll make good. And you've got {{a fine man}} for your husband. When Festing {{first came to the}} bridge I didn't know if I'd take him or Bob. In fact, I thought <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for quite a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't deny it. It {{was my idea}} to a tee. But I wouldn't {{have done}} it without asking you first, and seeing how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I won't even ask you. But you thought a heap of that mare, and it's pretty hard on you to lose her. I'm sure sorry. And I'm sorry, too, that you won't be riding with me tomorrow. I'll be plumb lost. I won't {{know what to do with}} myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not here}} to fight. You can kill me any time. You could 'a' killed me to-night, but it wouldn't do any good. It 'ud only make it worse for you. Why, they'll be a town in here bigger'n all your tribe before two grass from now. It ain't no use, Drifting Crane; it's got to be. You an' I can't help n'r hinder it. I know just how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but I tell yeh it ain't no use to fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want to. I {{know how}} <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mistress Blythe--just as I feel meself. But it ain't our {{feelings}} {{we have to}} steer by through life--no, no, we'd make shipwreck mighty often if we did that. There's only the one safe compass and we've got to set our course by that--what it's right to do. I agree with the doctor. If there's a chance for Dick, Leslie should be told of it. There's no two sides to that, in my opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{look at it}} in that way, Clara. It's {{a crusade}} to me; it's a holy war; it's the cause of an {{innocent}} woman against a wicked oppression. I know how <b>you</b> would <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Clara; but I never was as respectable as you are, and I'm quite satisfied to do what Ben, and father, and Mr. Atherton approve. They think it's my duty, and I am glad to go, and to be of all the use I can. But you shall have my heartfelt sympathy through all, Clara, for your involuntary acquaintance with our proceedings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And with my father, at first, I'm {{sure she}} had the real thing. She knows; she has been there. <b>You</b> can <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> her, and about him, and about {{hundreds}} of people you meet every day; and, once it has happened to you, {{you can go on}} with anything and ripen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{would think}} it was quite right and natural if you saw Eva playing with a large dog, {{even if he was}} black. But a fellow-creature that can think, and reason, and feel, and is immortal, you shudder at. I know how <b>you</b> north-country people <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> loathe the blacks as you would a toad or a snake. Yet you pity them, and are angry because they are often ill-treated.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Mr. March!" [...] cried Miss Dale. [...] "Well, it is {{a pathetic}} case, but it isn't the only one, if that's any comfort. Saratoga is reeking with just such forlornities the whole summer long; but I can quite {{understand}} how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mrs. March." [...] We {{came to a}} corner, and she said abruptly: [...] "Excuse my interrupting your quarrel! Not quite so LOUD, Mr. March!" [...] and she flashed back a mocking look at me as she skurried {{off down the street}} with astonishing rapidity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will shut up!" [...] he told himself. [...] "I will shut up. I'll {{see this}} dinner through, and then never come near this house again." [...] He {{tried to look}} casual, as though the {{conversation}} was safely finished. But Aunt Emma {{was waiting for him}} to go on. In the general stillness her corsets creaked with belligerent attention. He played with his fork in a [...] "Well, if that's how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> perhaps it would be better not to discuss it any further, my dear madam," [...] manner, growing every second more flushed, embarrassed, sick, angry; trying harder every second to look unconcerned.|$|E
6000|$|Three {{days before}} the school broke up Easton said: [...] "Clinton, I have had a letter from my father this morning, {{and he will be}} very glad if you will come down to spend the {{holidays}} at our place. And so shall I. There is very good hunting round us. My father has plenty of horses in his stables, and I expect we shall be rather gay, for my brother comes of age in the week after Christmas, and {{there is going to be}} a ball and so on. I don't know how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but I should say that it would be better for you than being at home where everything will call your brother to your mind, and your being there will make it worse for the others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} <b>you</b> how I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mrs. Munger," [...] said Mr. Gerrish, pausing in his walk, {{and putting on}} a fine, patronising, gentleman-of-the-old-school smile. [...] "You may put me down {{for any number of}} tickets--five, ten, fifteen--and you may command me in {{anything}} I can do to further the objects of your enterprise, if you will keep the invited supper and dance. But I should not be prepared to do anything if they are dropped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{something}} so. The old man's hardly {{had time}} yet {{to pull himself}} together. Well, I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that way <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> March. I guess it's more of a blow to him than we realize. He {{was a good deal}} bound up in Coonrod, though he didn't always use him very well. Well, I reckon it's apt to happen so oftentimes; curious how cruel love can be. Heigh? We're an awful mixture, March!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you ever}} get moods when life seems {{absolutely}} meaningless? It's like a badly-constructed story, {{with all sorts of}} characters moving in and out who {{have nothing to do with}} the plot. And when somebody comes along that you think really has something to do with the plot, he suddenly drops out. After a while you begin to wonder what the story is <b>about,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>it's</b> <b>about</b> nothing--just a jumble." ...|$|R
