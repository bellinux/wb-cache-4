500|$|F.E.A.R. was {{announced}} at an E3 2004 pre-show, though its existence as an untitled project was revealed {{prior to this}} announcement. The game's first trailer later premiered at E3 2004 and was well received by critics. During the E3 2004 showing, F.E.A.R.s lead designer, Craig Hubbard, stated that the game [...] "... evolved out of a concept we started developing right after [...] that we've been dying to work on." [...] Monolith Productions' director of technology, Kevin Stephens, later elaborated that this concept was [...] "... to make an action movie in a first-person shooter, where <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like an action star." [...] To this effect, the team focused on immersing the player, using elements like a silent, nameless protagonist with an unknown background, and allowing the player to see the protagonist's body when looking down or sideways.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> {{like you have a}} voice that resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakdown" [...] {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} local critics. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly praised the song, writing [...] "for {{most of the}} album she keeps her notorious octave-climbing chops at bay. Showing some admirable restraint, she nestles herself into downy-soft beats. In 'Breakdown', she demonstrates she can match the staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant called [...] "Breakdown" [...] "the song of Carey's career," [...] noting its [...] "lyrical strokes [...] as broad and obvious as they are naked. Mariah the chanter flawlessly adapts to their singsong style, largely boxing her multi-octave range into a sly, hypnotic melody so that when she really wails at the end, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> it.

R.E.M. and author William S. Burroughs collaborated on a new version of [...] "Star Me Kitten", a song that had originally appeared on the band's 1992 album Automatic for the People. Rob Zombie has described his collaboration with Alice Cooper on the song [...] "Hands of Death (Burn Baby Burn)" [...] as one of the [...] "great moments where <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like you've made your dreams come true".

500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to take someone for granted, and that if you love them, you should tell them, because you might never have the chance to tell them how <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel.</b> She then starts to sing [...] "Never Too Far".|$|E
500|$|The concept behind {{having the}} episode based around an alien planet {{occurred}} to Moffat, Skinner, and producer Marcus Wilson when realising {{they had done}} big location pieces {{in the first half}} of the series with [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", but had none for the second half. They decided to do a story set in [...] "a world created in our studios to make <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> you're out there", rather than having the Doctor [...] "promise unearthly wonders to his companions, and then get them trapped in an underground tunnel". As such, the episode was designed to allow the Doctor to actually show his new companion the wonders he had promised. The production team aimed to show [...] "the best alien planet" [...] on Doctor Who. The episode originally had a different pre-credits sequence, which consisted of a long scene in the kitchen in which Clara informs the Doctor she cannot come and travel with the Doctor because she has responsibilities to her job, and the boy she takes care of asks if the Doctor is her boyfriend. Cross's intent was to juxtapose this [...] "mundane" [...] scene with the vast scale of the planet. However, Moffat thought that at the time in the series the Doctor should be investigating Clara through her parents and Cross revised to include the leaf, an idea Moffat approved of. Originally the resolution was to be the Doctor defeating the planet with his speech, which Cross likened to [...] "facing down one of Lovecraft's Old Gods: an alien so alien that it's practically a supernatural being." [...] Moffat pointed out that the Doctor had given similar speeches before and was more interested in Clara saving the day. After thinking about it for a while, Cross realised he could incorporate the leaf into the solution.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
500|$|The ZX Spectrum {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land {{received}} preview coverage in Your Sinclair magazine. They praised the new additions {{made to the}} game that separated it from Wonder Boy; they called the game [...] "a good arcade adventure with a smattering of strategy thrown in". The magazine reviewed the game four months later. The reviewer noted the diverse level designs and many [...] "surprises" [...] the player will encounter, and they praised the game's learning curve, saying that it [...] "is well thought out and <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> as if you made some progress before you die". It was criticized for its long multi-load times on the ZXSpectrum, its jumping mechanics in which the character [...] "floats around", and the graphics which was {{not as good as}} its predecessor. The reviewer called Wonder Boy in Monster Land [...] "a souped-up version of Wonderboy, which improves much on the original theory but at a slight cost to gameplay". Reviewers from UK-based magazine The Games Machine called it [...] "probably the best conversion you could expect on the Spectrum". Crash magazine praised the ZXSpectrum version of the game for its detailed sprites and smooth movements, playability, and combat system. The reviewer further commended the game for the differences that set it apart from the original Wonder Boy game, citing the cartoon-like feel and the vast arrays of enemies and items; just as in Your Sinclair, it was criticized for its slow multi-loading. Overall, the reviewer said the game is [...] "great fun for the experienced games player or the person just starting out in the Spectrum world". Sinclair User magazine praised its gameplay, citing the ability to stab enemies with a sword, to collect gold and items left behind, and to go into shops and pubs and buy equipment. Further praise went to the colorful and detailed graphics and animations, though they said they tend not to perform well in more complex background settings. Spanish magazine MicroHobby said that the ZXSpectrum version brought nothing new from its arcade counterpart, but the execution was good; they lauded the game's graphics and its challenging and addictive gameplay, but they criticized it for its lack of originality.|$|E

It opens with a solemn spoken passage asking [...] "how <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> about it". The song breaks down into a shouting match that labels Cassavetes with the terms genius, misogynist, alcoholic, and messiah. [...] "My My Metrocard" [...] is a go-go song about escapism and exploration. It uses a call-and-response pattern to condemn Rudy Giuliani, whose policies against quality-of-life crimes the band opposed.|$|E

2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dan Jolin {{offered more}} {{positive}} {{thoughts on the}} season, giving it 3 stars out of 5 in his review for Empire. He felt it was beneficial that Iron Fist released after Luke Cage, instead of before as originally planned, in order for Doctor Strange to release to introduce the MCU to [...] "all his Eastern-mystical baggage", and called Iron Fist [...] "a fresh presence" [...] compared to [...] "the less ostentatious power-sets and moody, conflicted heroism" [...] of the other Defenders. Jolin did criticize that showrunner Buck had [...] "no sense of connection to his subject" [...] as previous Marvel Netflix showrunners had, and felt {{it was not until}} the sixth episode [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> the pulp martial-arts-movie-riffing origins, and that’s thanks to its director, RZA. He finally gives the show a proper sense of flair, shamelessly reveling in the genre’s campier elements through a fun, three-act combat-challenge structure. It’s enough to make you wish they made him the showrunner." [...] He concluded, [...] "Iron Fist works some fantastical flavor into the MCU’s down-to-earth Defenders nook, but it needs more proper kung-fu flair than showrunner Buck allows." ...|$|E
