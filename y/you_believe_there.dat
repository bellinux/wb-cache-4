6000|$|Donna Maria (rapidly, {{ignoring}} Mr. Hamlin's illustration): [...] "Well, perhaps I {{have reason}} to say so. Poor Donna Dolores was my friend. Yet, would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> were people--you know how ridiculous is the gossip of a town like this--there are people who believed that he was paying attention to ME!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Learn {{a little}} of it?--Why, {{it is the most}} horrible--the most damnable, bloodthirsty beast of a Plot--But hold, hold, my good master; I hope, in the first place, <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is a Plot; for, otherwise, the Justice must have a word with you, as sure as my name is John Whitecraft." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{ignored his}} kindly mockery, and again she began, [...] "What makes <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there's</b> a God? <b>You</b> don't <b>believe</b> in the Bible?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Squire Braile!" [...] {{she called}} to him, and as he {{straightened}} himself and turned round toward her, she besought him, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there's</b> any God?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a pretty}} hard country for a {{stranger}} to get along in. You're such a blamed cautious people that nobody can guess what you think. Why don't you give my partner or Dick a hint, if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there's</b> something wrong?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She was {{not going}} quite the way to show Humfrey that her heart was not set on the boy, and she was checked by hearing him sigh. Perhaps {{it was for the}} {{disappointment}} he foresaw, so she said, 'Whether I bring him up or not, don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> will be a special care over such a child?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you, George," [...] replies the ironmaster deliberately, [...] "how {{it is not}} to be brought about, which I hope may answer the purpose as well. Look at our mother, think of her, recall her emotion when she {{recovered}} you. Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son? Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is any chance of her consent, to balance against the outrage it would be to her (loving dear old lady!) to propose it? If you do, you are wrong. No, George! You must make up your mind to remain UNscratched, I think." [...] There is an amused smile on the ironmaster's face as he watches his brother, who is pondering, deeply disappointed. [...] "I think you may manage almost as well as if the thing were done, though." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the face}} of an idiot, isn't it?" [...] pursued Miserrimus Dexter! [...] "Look at her! She is a mere vegetable. A cabbage in a garden has as much life and {{expression}} in it as that girl exhibits at the present moment. Would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> was latent intelligence, affection, pride, fidelity, in such a half-developed being as this?" ...|$|E
40|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there’s</b> more to {{assessment}} than passive {{transmission of}} standards? Would {{you like to}} actively engage your students in the assessment process? Would you like to help your students improve their learning for themselves? If so, why don’t you try a social constructivist approach to assessment? It doesn’t take up much time, and it works...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] she asked, {{with almost}} insolent irony, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>there</b> {{could ever have}} been a right person for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you sure," [...] he asked, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>there</b> is any one in {{the world}} who would be content to take you without a penny?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I don't believe it," [...] {{the girl}} said. [...] "They are too real for that. They come too often, {{and they make}} me {{feel as if they}} would come more fully, some time. If there was a life before this--do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> was?--they may be things that {{happened}} there. Or they may be things that will happen in a life after this. You believe in that, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am not {{challenging}} your sincerity," [...] Ernest continued. [...] "You are sincere. You preach what <b>you</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>There</b> lies {{your strength}} and your value--to the capitalist class. But should {{you change your}} belief to something that menaces the established order, your preaching would be unacceptable to your employers, and you would be discharged. Every little while some {{one or another of}} you is so discharged.* Am I not right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid not; but, however {{that may}} be, I shall never go running {{about for a}} lover as half my mates do. When the true one comes I shall know him, love him at once, and cling to him forever, no matter what may happen. Till then I want a friend, and I will find one if I can. Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> may be real and simple friendships {{between men and women}} without falling into this {{everlasting}} sea of love?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I tell <b>you</b> I <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is {{something}} of the sort brewing again," [...] the woman said. [...] "I'll tell you more about it later on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, then, Reynolds, {{where you}} are, and the whiskey with <b>you,</b> I <b>believe</b> <b>there's</b> {{likely to be}} little {{discretion}} but the discretion of drunkenness,--and not much of that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Miss, I seen 'em makin' {{signs to}} Mr. Pike that we'd run into their ship hove {{to on the}} other tack. Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it. <b>There</b> wasn't no ship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, Augusta, at present, except this. Of late I {{have learned}} to believe in a God. I summon you to meet me before that God. There we will argue out our case and abide His judgment. If there is no God {{there will be no}} judgment, and I salute you, Empress, who triumph. If, as I believe and as you say <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>there</b> is a God, think whom you will be called upon to salute when that God has heard the truth. Meanwhile I repeat that Heliodore the Egyptian still lives beneath the sun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{must be as}} {{you think}} fit, sir. I don't think I should do so unless it were {{absolutely}} necessary. He does not know your daughter as we do, and would infallibly put the worst construction upon it. I should confine myself {{to the story of}} the letters and the jewels, stating that <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is a connection between them, and that, as you implicitly believe Miss Hawtrey's word, the only conclusion you can possibly come to is that the person who visited Gilliat's was some adventuress bearing a strong resemblance to her, and trading on that resemblance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{took this}} {{interval}} {{to say to}} the clergyman, first, that I was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to; that, though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began to think it was all very sincere here, both in the man and his wife, however ignorant they might both be, and I hoped such a beginning would yet have a more happy end. [...] "But, my friend," [...] added I, [...] "will you give me leave to start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate concern which you show for the turning of the poor people from their paganism to the Christian religion; but how does this comfort you, while these people are, in your account, out of the pale of the Catholic Church, without which <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is no salvation? so that you esteem these but heretics, as effectually lost as the pagans themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} old-fashioned idea of man's devotion to woman. Can't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>there</b> may be ties between two men {{stronger}} even than {{between a man}} and the woman he loves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a difficulty," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{not sure}} he would admit the {{existence}} of all the Powers <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in. <b>There</b> {{are so many of}} them. One would fancy that faith was necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As long as <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>there</b> {{is nothing}} more to be said," [...] was the quiet answer, [...] "I'd {{be a little bit}} afraid if I was you, though. But young people never think of those things." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{took this}} {{interval}} {{to talk with}} my clergyman: and first I told him, I {{was glad to see}} the particulars we had both been witnesses to; that though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began to think it was all very sincere here, both in the man and his wife, however ignorant they both might be; and I hoped such a beginning would have yet a more happy end: [...] "And who knows," [...] said I, [...] "but these two may in time, by instruction and example, work upon some of the others?"--"Some of them!" [...] said he, turning quick upon me, [...] "ay, upon all of them: depend upon it, if those two savages (for he has been but little better as you relate it) should embrace Jesus Christ, they will never leave till they work upon all the rest; for true religion is naturally communicative, and he that is once made a Christian will never leave a Pagan behind him if be can help it," [...] I owned it was a most Christian principle to think so, and a testimony of a true zeal, as well as a generous heart in him. [...] "But, my friend," [...] said I, [...] "will you give me liberty to start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate concern which you shew for the turning the poor people from their Paganism to the Christian religion; but how does this comfort you, while these people are, in your account, out of the pale of the Catholic church, without which, <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>there</b> is no salvation; so that you esteem these but heretics still; and, for other reasons, as effectually lost as the Pagans themselves?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Nation of Islam's {{official}} position {{does not deny}} the Jewish holocaust. Tim Russert, during a 1997 Meet the Press interview with Nation of Islam leader, Minister Louis Farrakhan posed the question, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> was a Holocaust in which 6 million Jews perished?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1701, while Intendant of Alsace, Le Pelletier de la Houssaye {{issued a}} ruling {{permitting}} Jewish worship in clandestine synagogues {{in response to}} a complaint brought by an abbé. It reads, [...] "The worship which the Jews established in Reichshoffen is not as public as one would have <b>you</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>There</b> is no synagogue per se, only, by a custom long established in this province, when there are seven Jewish families in one locale, those who compose them assemble, without scandal, in a house of their sect for readings and prayers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> really <b>believe</b> <b>there's</b> life in Mars?" [...] asked Mrs. Flushing, {{turning to}} {{her for the first}} time with keen interest. [...] "Who tells you that? Some one who knows? D'you know a man called--?" ...|$|R
40|$|Part story, part graphic novel - {{a tender}} slice {{of life and}} death from the creators of "The Savage". Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there's</b> life after death? Slog does. He reckons that the scruffy bloke sitting outside the pork shop is his dad come back to visit him for one last time - just like he'd said he would, just before he died. Slog's mate Davie isn't convinced. But how does this man know {{everything}} Slog's dad would know? Because Slog says it really is his dad, that's how...|$|R
5000|$|At the 2013 Human Rights Campaign Dinner in Seattle, Washington, Miller {{said he had}} {{attempted}} suicide multiple times as a teenager before coming out as gay. He said: [...] "When someone asked me if that was a cry for help, I said no, because I told no one. You only cry for help if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there's</b> help to cry for." [...] He discussed struggling in Hollywood as a closeted actor, and talked about how {{his involvement in the}} ManKind Project helped him learn about brotherhood, sisterhood, and being part of a community.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Egocentrism" [...] sketch, {{starring}} Cleese as the host/interviewer and Chapman as interviewee Dr. Rhomboid Goatcabin, {{features a}} discussion about freedom of speech in Great Britain, in which Cleese's character repeatedly reformulates the subject's main question ("Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is freedom of speech in this country?") {{in so many ways}} as to start a monologue and not let Chapman's character speak. This increasingly annoys the interviewee {{to the point where he}} is forced to murder the host in order to express his opinion on the matter, only to be interrupted again by his spirit. This sketch bears some resemblance to Anne Elk's Theory on Brontosauruses.|$|E
5000|$|In 1701, the intendant of Alsace, Félix Le Pelletier de La Houssaye {{ruled against}} a {{complaint}} brought by an abbe, writing that [...] "The worship which the Jews established in Reichshoffen {{is not as}} public as one would have <b>you</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>There</b> is no synagogue per se, only, by a custom long established in this province, when there are seven Jewish families in one locale, those who compose them assemble, without scandal, in a house of their sect for readings and prayers." [...] A line was crossed when an actual building was erected as a prayer house, as the Jews of Biesheim, Wintzenheim and Hagenthal discovered when each community had a newly built synagogue razed by the Conseil Souverain of Alsace in the 1720s.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{music by}} Ongala, the album contains songs in both English and Swahili, {{as opposed to}} just Swahili. Ongala decided to write and sing some songs in English so that he could reach a wider audience. The album tackles social themes, and features both elegies and sorrowful laments. Author Tom Moon compared the songs to lullabies and felt that [...] "Ongala sounds like one who knows what it's like to be down, and knows, also, that he will not give up." [...] The [...] "steadfastness of women" [...] is one subject on the album, as is reckoning with death, which is dealt with on [...] "Kifo." [...] "Karola" [...] warns listeners to [...] "be careful in a world where <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is goodness," [...] while [...] "Kipenda Roho" [...] is an anti-racist song. Although poverty has been described as the album's theme, racism is considered its second most prevalent subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he continued, [...] "couldn't we {{clear this}} matter up sensibly? Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>there</b> is anybody in <b>there?</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> {{the place is}} being used in any way for a wrong purpose? If so, we will insist upon having the keys from Mr. Fentolin. He cannot refuse. The place is mine." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Have <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> <b>there</b> is some female, {{whom the}} stupid vulgar call Holda in some manuscripts, strigam Holdam, the witch Holda, {{who is able}} to do a certain thing, such that those deceived by the devil affirm {{themselves}} by necessity and by command to be required to do, that is, with a crowd of demons transformed into the likeness of women, on fixed nights to be required to ride upon certain beasts, and to themselves be numbered in their company? If you have performed participation in this unbelief, you are required to do penance for one year on designated fast-days.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] {{the other}} rejoined, [...] "I wish I could make <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> this. <b>There</b> is {{room in the}} life of the busiest man in the world for an {{understanding}} woman. I'll go further. No man can do his best work without her." ...|$|R
