In a {{departure}} from Green, the band members often wrote the music with non-traditional rock instrumentation including mandolin, organ, and acoustic guitar instead of adding them as overdubs later in the creative process. Released in March 1991, Out of Time was the band's first album to top both the US and UK charts. The record eventually sold 4.2million copies in the US alone, and about 12 million copies worldwide by 1996. The album's lead single [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was a worldwide hit that received heavy rotation on radio, as did the music video on MTV. [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was R.E.M.'s highest-charting single in the US, reaching number four on the Billboard charts. [...] "There've been very few life-changing events in our career because our career has been so gradual," [...] Mills said years later. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> life changing, I think 'Losing My Religion' is the closest it gets". The album's second single, [...] "Shiny Happy People" [...] (one of three songs on the record to feature vocals from Kate Pierson of fellow Athens band The B-52's), was also a major hit, reaching number 10 in the US and number six in the UK. Out of Time garnered R.E.M. seven nominations at the 1992 Grammy Awards, the most nominations of any artist that year. The band won three awards: one for Best Alternative Music Album and two for [...] "Losing My Religion", Best Short Form Music Video and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. R.E.M. did not tour to promote Out of Time; instead the group played a series of one-off shows, including an appearance taped for an episode of MTV Unplugged and released music videos for each song on the video album This Film Is On. The MTV Unplugged session of [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was recorded {{with members of the}} Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in Madison, Georgia, at [...]|$|E
2500|$|As of the Rogers-produced Hockey Night, Coach's Corner was noticeably shortened, from {{as long as}} 10 {{minutes to}} as short as 5—a change that was lampshaded by both Cherry and MacLean during their first segment of the new season. The {{following}} Monday, Scott Moore had a short discussion with Cherry regarding the matter, laughing it off and explaining that [...] "if you have more to talk about, {{all you need to}} do is make sure you tell the executive producer what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> and we'll make sure you have lots of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to my desk. And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're {{not going to let you}} keep talking about the things <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{why should}} <b>you</b> <b>WANT</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> in that dreadful way? How {{would you like}} <b>to</b> have people <b>talk</b> so about YOU, and you not cold yet?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Continuing as Test captain, Waugh led {{the team}} to a 2–1 victory in South Africa to retain Australia's ranking as the number one team. Australia crushed the hosts in the First Test by an innings and 360 runs, won the Second Test by four wickets, before losing the last. His own form was poor, with 95 runs at 19.00. He left the tour once the ODI series began. Arriving in Australia alone, he faced media {{questioning}} over his playing future. Waugh's reply was, [...] "We've just beaten the next {{best team in the}} world 5–1, and all <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> is getting me out of the team." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with the Washington Post, Steel commented on gun control: [...] "Society should draw lines. What do you need an assault weapon for, if you're going hunting? That's overkill. But I don't think that means {{you go to a}} total ban {{for those who want to}} use gun for skeet shooting or hunting or things like that. But what's the point of passing gun laws if we're not going to enforce them? If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> gun control, that's where you need to start. We've got 300 gun laws on the books right now. At the end of the day, it's about how we enforce the law." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I never {{altogether}} trust these paragons," [...] {{his wife}} said. [...] "In all the ordinary affairs of life the Prince seems {{to reach an}} almost perfect standard. I sometimes wonder whether he would be as trustworthy in the big things. Nothing else <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> Ambrose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{in those}} words, perhaps. However, {{the matter is}} easily settled. You bolted with Marian. I know that, and you know it. If the topic is disagreeable, say so, and it is easily avoided. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, better not change the subject when I mention it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He plumped {{down beside}} her, uncomfortably wedged {{between her and}} the rail. He caught her hand, {{intertwined}} their fingers so savagely that her knuckles hurt.

6000|$|... "Very well, you {{can think}} as you please. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, very well; if not, I'll {{go back to the}} school," [...] and Dave started to walk away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] she said, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> golf again! Golf! Why {{one hears}} nothing else but golf down here. Don't you ever shoot or ride for a change?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am not leading {{you away}} from what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> I {{was about to tell}} you that I came upon 'Ivanhoe' by chance half an hour ago, when I was searching--I confess it--for {{something}} very romantic to read. Ivanhoe was a prize-fighter--the first half of the book is a description of a prize-fight. I was wondering whether some romancer of the twenty-fourth century will hunt out the exploits of my husband, and present him to the world as a sort of English nineteenth-century Cyd, with all the glory of antiquity upon his deeds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are not {{things of}} any importance," [...] Owen, to Fleda's surprise, {{suddenly}} asserted. He had {{not at first}} taken up Mrs. Brigstock's expression of a wish to carry him off: Fleda {{could see that the}} instinct at the bottom of this was that of standing by her, of seeming not to abandon her. But abruptly, all his soreness working within him, it had struck him that he should abandon her still more if he should leave her to be dealt with by her other visitor. [...] "You must allow me to say, you know, Mrs. Brigstock, that I don't think you should come down on Miss Vetch about anything. It's very good of her to take the smallest interest in us and our horrid little squabble. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, talk about it with me." [...] He was flushed with the idea of protecting Fleda, of exhibiting his consideration for her. [...] "I don't like your cross-questioning her, don't you see? She's as straight as a die: I'll tell you all about her!" [...] he declared with an excited laugh. [...] "Please come off with me and let her alone." ...|$|E
5000|$|I’ve {{done about}} 400 calls myself during the beta, {{and what people}} don’t realize is that it’s hard to give someone advice without taking {{something}} away from it yourself. I’ll say, [...] "Hey, I’m driving on the 101 Highway for 45 minutes, call me if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> product or marketing." [...] You queue the calls, and you get in this rhythm, and it’s actually really energizing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have studied}} your notes about {{business}} at the ports Compeador touched on her new round," [...] he said presently. [...] "Some of your suggestions are useful. I expect <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about this?" ...|$|R

5000|$|According to the National Gallery's {{exhibition}} curator Christopher Riopelle, both Charles I Insulted and Delaroche's other painting, Marie-Antoinette Before the Tribunal, painted {{fifteen years}} later in 1851, [...] "suggest episodes of the suffering of Christ". Riopelle added that Delaroche's [...] "obsession with English royalist history" [...] was [...] "classic displacement of what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> but can't, because it's still so raw and recent", particularly referring to the execution of Louis XVI of France in January 1793, and nine months later of his Queen Marie Antoinette.|$|E
5000|$|On Phoenix's fifth studio album, Bankrupt!, {{the sixth}} track is titled 'Drakkar Noir'. On the album commentary, a band member {{describes}} the reference: [...] "I remember precisely this moment... I told Thomas to 'Sing Drakkar Noir'...

5000|$|Delphi was {{originally}} {{one of many}} codenames of a pre-release development tool project at Borland.

[...] Speaking of his internship, Prince said, [...] "I saw a lot of things I didn't agree with--homosexual groups being invited in, the budget agreement, the Clean Air Act."
