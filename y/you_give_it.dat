Cantrell explained the reunion, [...] "We want to celebrate {{what we did}} {{and the memory of}} our friend. We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a shot, try something? We're willing {{to take a chance on}} it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on." [...] Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them all, your life will get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like, if <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E

[...] "Obviously, I'm very disappointed", he said. [...] " [...] year was a little bittersweet", he said. [...] "Because you bust your butt for three years for a manager, <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> your all and don't complain, and you contribute {{so much in the}} regular season, then to have it taken away in the postseason ... But managers are going to make their decisions. You really can't question them or change them because they're going {{to do what they want}} anyway.

2500|$|In 2005, Cantrell, bassist Mike Inez, {{and drummer}} Sean Kinney reunited {{to perform a}} benefit concert in Seattle for victims of the tsunami {{disaster}} that struck South Asia.

2500|$|This moves {{onto another}} track called [...] "You've Changed" [...] that {{features}} her ex bandmates Beyoncé and Michelle Williams. Lyrically the song {{talks about a}} relationship that has gone [...] "awry". Rowland takes prominence on the track, though Beyoncé and Williams each get their [...] "own cathartic verse to go off on a clueless ex". The Honesty Hour compared [...] "You've Changed" [...] to the 2004 Destiny's Child single [...] "Girl". Production on the album then moves on to a light midtempo dance track on [...] "I Remember", which was produced by The Runners. Atop a [...] "tinkling piano and propulsive dance beat", Rowland's [...] "characteristically soulful vocals" [...] can be heard. Hampp said that the song incorporated tribal music and a vibe that [...] "consciously stops short of being a full-on four-on-the-floor banger." [...] According to the Honesty Hour, [...] "I Remember" [...] remains firmly a ballad, but incorporates elements of techno and EDM. Rowland dabbles in some 80's funk pop on the Boi-1da and Matthew Burnett-produced [...] "Red Wine". The song features dreamy synths and a soaring chorus, in a vintage throwback. It was compared to songs by Brandy Norwood. The pace continues on the romantic [...] "This is Love" [...] which focuses on a guy that [...] "got [...] goin’ on cloud 9". Over the light production, Rowland sings [...] "I’m waiting and anticipating for you {{to give it to}} me / Boy I’m trying to hold it inside / Heart racing, my body shaking / ‘Cause when <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> to me, boy you are the truth, I can’t lie." [...] According to the Honesty Hour, [...] "This is Love" [...] had crossover appear for both R and pop radio.|$|E
2500|$|On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, {{participated in}} an {{interview}} with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior. She also claimed Edwards had lied in his confession, because the affair was of a longer duration than the timeframe that he had claimed and was still ongoing. Marshall also stated that, {{in the days after the}} story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her.
