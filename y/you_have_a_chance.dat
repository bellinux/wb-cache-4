500|$|Jack Straus' 1982 WSOP tournament {{victory is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest comebacks in poker history. [...] At one point, Straus was down to one chip, and he came back to win. [...] This victory is considered the origin of the poker saying, [...] "A chip and a chair." [...] A saying that means that as long as you have a chip and a chair <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> [...] Modern lore indicates that this happened at the final table, but the 1983 book The Biggest Game in Town implies this occurred on the first day of the tournament.|$|E
500|$|On May 25, {{during a}} game against the Florida Marlins, Posey was injured during a {{collision}} with Scott Cousins at home plate as Cousins scored the eventual-winning run on a sac fly in the 12th inning of a 7–6 Giants' loss. In the aftermath, Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending surgery. Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he collided with Posey intentionally in order to score. [...] "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of that ball coming out." [...] He expressed regret over injuring Posey, saying [...] "I certainly didn’t want him to get hurt." [...] Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: [...] "I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family. As I said last week, I'm not out to vilify Scott." [...] In 45 games, Posey batted [...]284 with 17 runs scored, 46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.|$|E
2500|$|These {{individual}} section camps {{were predominantly}} associated with individual districts within the Chicago Area Council, and the Scouts would form their {{troops in the}} city and board a steamer vessel in Chicago for the adventure across Lake Michigan. In these first years, the Scouts would arrive at the pier in Whitehall, load their gear on trucks, and hike the 4 miles from town to Owasippe. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to visit the White Lake Lighthouse, check out the exhibit about the S.S. Carolina. In the local maritime museum there is an exhibit on the Carolina that features its Owasippe transport years. It was one of the boats bringing Scouts to Owasippe. In later years, the Scouts would travel by train around the lake and disembark at what was called [...] "Scout Station." [...] This was just a spot on the Pere Marquette railroad where they would stop and drop off the Scouts and their gear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "you've {{changed a}} lot in three months. I always thought that, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> there'd be no telling where you'd end up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{they are}} fried," [...] {{finished}} Tom, with a grin. [...] "You see, somebody might lift {{them from the}} henroost before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to cook them," [...] he went on soberly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} seen it, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> done it," [...] Lute said. [...] "But it was all done before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to do anything. It was not your hand, not even your {{unconscious}} hand." ...|$|R
2500|$|During the New York printers' {{strike of}} 1963, when The New York Times {{and six other}} {{newspapers}} suspended publication, Hardwick, her husband Robert Lowell, and Jason and Barbara Epstein, saw an opportunity to introduce the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined. Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group asked Silvers, who was still at Harper's, to edit the issue, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit it with him. Silvers and Epstein [...] "became an inseparable double act", editing The New York Review of Books together for the next 43 years, until her death in 2006. Silvers continued as sole editor {{until his death in}} March 2017. In later years, he described his motivation for continuing to edit the Review: [...] "I feel it's a fantastic opportunity – because of the freedom of it, because of the sense that there are marvelous, intensely interesting, important questions that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to try to deal with in an interesting way. That's an extraordinary opportunity in life. And you'd be crazy not to try and make the most of it." [...] He said on another occasion: [...] "We do what we want and don't {{try to figure out what}} the public wants." [...] Asked in 2007 about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers replied: [...] "It's not a question that's posing itself". In 2012, he added, [...] "I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barnard later wrote, [...] "For a {{dying man}} {{it is not}} a {{difficult}} decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart {{to be used in the}} transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to sell it}} to {{somebody}} at Rawlett's?" [...] continued Harkutt, with a precaution that seemed ironical.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Lizard, [...] "you {{certainly}} are the champion boob. There <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to cop off a nice bunch of coin on that fight and instead you kill {{it for yourself}} and everybody else." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hall {{had been}} indelibly marked by his {{experience}} {{going through the}} Great Depression in Saskatchewan. One {{of his friends and}} fellow Saskatchewanian, Ramon Hnatyshyn, former Governor General of Canada, commented: [...] "They were tough times. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to see real deprivation and the importance of helping your fellow citizen." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wilhelmina confides to Marc that she's {{considering}} {{leaving the}} country with Connor. [...] "Mode is your life," [...] he tells her, and she insists it's her one chance at love. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to <b>have</b> all the money you ever needed and be with the person you loved {{for the rest of}} your life, would you do it?" [...] Marc doesn't know what to tell her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to finish}} your nap," [...] Cummings whispered as, {{kneeling}} aft, {{he began to}} assist Poyor in propelling the craft.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you lose, you {{and your}} friends will find the Butte pretty hot. But you feel <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> a {{fighting}} chance, and you mean to take it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no use of {{all this}} chinning, for I'm not a fool," [...] Jet cried, angrily. [...] "I shan't come out, nor will <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to rob me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't do, Steve. It isn't that I don't {{want to do}} it; but {{one must}} play to the rules. I can't explain what I mean. I can only say it's impossible. Let's think of a {{parallel}} case. When {{you were in the}} ring, there must have been times when <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of hitting your man low. Why didn't you do it? It would have jolted him, all right." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Choose to do {{something}} and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 50/50 <b>chance</b> of succeeding. Choose to do nothing and you will definitely fail." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{hope that}} many of <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to attend the 141 st APHA Annual Meeting in Boston, and take {{advantage}} of all the great events held by the Student Assembly.

If you’re interested in helping us, please reach out to our Programming Committe...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's different. They stick you {{up there}} and some big stiff amuses himself {{pounding}} the stuffin's out of you before <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to learn. Hunka! Not any! But anyway--Listen {{to some of these}} others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{hang around}} {{until they get}} back and {{see to it that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to talk with her before she goes to her room," [...] {{returned}} Tom; and then, as some other people came up, the conversation had to come to an end.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I {{were you}} I would make no such attempt. It will do no good. I {{do not think}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of being acquitted,--not a chance; and then how much worse it will be for Hester when she finds herself still in your house!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! if {{you would}} follow Emma's advice, and call the baby Osyth, after the first Prioress, <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> from that quarter.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{came to us}} with an {{idea that}} was undeniably good. It {{was such a great}} premise for a series that it was just that feeling of the misery that you'd feel if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to be part of that}} and didn't take {{advantage}} of it. I'm really looking forward to that show. He's so obviously the real deal, and we're just really lucky and honored that he wanted to collaborate with us on it.|$|R
60|$|So, if {{all these}} things happen together, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good <b>chance</b> of seeing <b>a</b> Fairy--or at least <b>a</b> much better <b>chance</b> than if they didn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{news for}} you," [...] he said, in his broken English. [...] "Your {{warships}} fight, bang, bang, bang! {{down by the}} water, at Aguadores and udder places. Think ships go up by Guantanamo Bay, maybe. If sailors land, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to join them--not so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "THAT'S {{the last}} part of it I'd ever doubt," [...] replied the rider. [...] "It's settled, then. I'll camp here. I'll be well in a few days. Then I'll take Wildfire in hand. You will ride out {{whenever}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> without bein' seen. An' the two of us will train the stallion to upset that race." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad he has come," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "It is {{much better}} to see a thing than merely to be told about it, and now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to see for yourselves the {{differences}} between two cousins very closely related, Danny Meadow Mouse and Piney the Pine Mouse. What difference do you see, Happy Jack Squirrel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MABEL. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{been making}} her so proud. It is a {{compliment}} to our whole sex. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> second <b>chance,</b> {{and it is}} her, again! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your uncle told me," [...] {{the priest}} continued, [...] "that {{before he left}} England he took leave of you by stealth, in a place you were staying at by the sea-side. Tie had not the heart to quit his country and his friends forever without kissing you for the last time. He {{followed}} you in the dark, and caught you up in his arms, and left you again before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of discovering him. The next day he quitted England." ...|$|R
6000|$|Crayford {{examined}} them. [...] "Six!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "There! <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> second <b>chance,</b> {{in spite}} of yourself. You are neither under nor over--you throw again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your reverence {{need not}} be excited," [...] said Holmes, {{lighting}} a cigarette. [...] "The case is clear enough against you, and all I ask is a few details for my private curiosity. However, if there's any difficulty in your telling me, I'll do the talking, and then you will see how far <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of holding back your secrets. In the first place, three of you came from South Africa on this game--you Williamson, you Carruthers, and Woodley." ...|$|E
6000|$|Under all circumstances, I should hardly wish {{a contest}} with Philodrama--Philo-Drury--Asbestos, H----, {{and all the}} anonymes and synonymes of Committee candidates. Seriously, I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of {{something}} much better; for prologuising is not my forte, and, at all events, either my pride or my modesty won't let me incur the hazard of having my rhymes buried in next month's Magazine, under [...] "Essays on the Murder of Mr. Perceval." [...] and [...] "Cures for the Bite of a Mad Dog," [...] as poor Goldsmith complained of the fate of far superior performances [2].|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the coaches}} are full {{with the men}} going down," [...] Spavin said. Pen winced. [...] "You'd not get a place for a ten-pound note. Get into my yellow; I'll drop you at Mudford, where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of the Fenbury mail. I'll lend you a hat and a coat; I've got lots. Come along; jump in, old boy--go it, leathers!"--and in this way Pen found himself in Mr. Spavin's postchaise, and rode with that gentleman {{as far as the}} Ram Inn at Mudford, fifteen miles from Oxbridge; where the Fenbury mail changed horses, and where Pen got a place on to London.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you say, lads? <b>You</b> would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of {{crossing}} swords with the Enniskilleners, {{and you could}} always come back here when the war is over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] the Duke {{suggested}} diffidently, [...] "you {{would like}} to ride over, Prince? It is a good eleven miles, and <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of getting into your stride." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Floyd, don't be a fool. You've been on {{the border}} for ten years. You've packed a gun and you've used it. You've been with rustlers when they killed their men. You've been present at many fights. But you never {{in all that time}} saw a man like this ranger. You haven't got sense enough to see him right if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> Neither <b>have</b> any of <b>you.</b> The only {{way to get rid of}} him is for the gang to draw on him, all at once. Then he's going to drop some of them." ...|$|R
