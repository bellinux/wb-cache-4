5000|$|Loving the {{neighbor}} has a [...] "double danger." [...] The same with faith and hope. We not only wish {{that we could}} have love and peace but that our neighbor can have the same because its a free gift from God. He nicely summed up the idea he had in his 1847 book Works of Love. [...] The times are past when only the powerful and the prominent were human beings - and the others were bond servants and slaves. This is due to Christianity but from this it does follow that prominence or power can no longer become a snare for a person so that he becomes enamored of this dissimilarity, damages his soul, and forgets what it is to love {{the neighbor}}. If this happens now, it certainly must happen in a more hidden and secret way, but basically it remains the same. Whether someone savoring his arrogance and his pride openly gives other people to understand that they do not exist for him and, for the nourishment of his arrogance, wants them to feel it as he demands expression of slavish submission from them, or whether he slyly and secretly expresses that they do not exist for him simply by avoiding any contact with them (perhaps also out of fear that openness would incite people and endanger him personally)-these are basically one and the same. The inhumanity and the un-Christianness of this consists not {{in the way in which}} it is done but in independently wanting to deny kinship with all people, with unconditionally every person. Ah, to keep oneself unstained by this world is the task and doctrine of Christianity-would to God that we all did it-but to cling to that in a worldly way as if it were the most glorious of dissimilarities-that is plain defilement. Distinguished corruption will teach the distinguished person that he exists only for the distinguished, that he is to live only in the alliance of their circles, that he must not exist for other people, just as they must not exist for him. When you go with God, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> only one single miserable person and you will be unable to escape what Christianity wants you to understand - human similarity. When you go with God, hold only to him, and understand under God everything you understand, then you will discover … the neighbor; then God will constrain you to love him - shall I say to your own detriment - because to love the neighbor is a thankless task. It is one thing to let ideas compete with ideas, and it is one thing to argue and win in a dispute; it is something else to be victorious over one’s own mind when one battles in the actuality of life. However hard one contending idea presses upon another, however hard one contender presses upon another in a dispute, all this contending is still at a distance and is like shadowboxing. On the other hand, the measure of a person’s disposition is this: how far is he from what he understands to what he does, how great is the distance between his understanding and his actions. A child, the simplest person, and the wisest all understand the highest and all understand the very same thing, because it is, if I dare to say so, one lesson we are all assigned. But what makes the difference is whether we understand it at a distance-so that we do not act accordingly, or close at hand-so that we act accordingly and “cannot do otherwise,” cannot refrain from doing it, like Luther, who understood very close at hand what he had to do when he said, “I cannot do otherwise, God help me. Amen.” Let us now consider the dissimilarity of lowliness. The times are past when those called the more lowly had no conception of themselves or only the conception of being slaves, of not merely being lowly human beings but of not being human beings at all. The fierce rebellion, the horror that followed upon that horror, are perhaps also over, but I wonder if the corruption may not still dwell hidden in a person. In that case the corrupted lowliness will lead the lowly person to believe that he must see his enemy in the powerful and the prominent, in everyone who is favored by some advantage. But be cautious, as the saying goes, because these enemies still have so much power that it could be dangerous to break with them. Therefore the corruption will not teach the lowly one to rise in rebellion or to repress entirely every expression of deference or to allow the secret to be disclosed, but it will teach that something should be done and yet not done, should be done and yet in such a way that the powerful person will derive no pleasure from it, although he will be unable to say that something has been withheld from him. Thus even in homage there will be a crafty defiance that, hidden, can exasperate, a reluctance that, hidden, says no to what the mouth professes, a tonelessness, as it were. Of suppressed envy in the acclaim that honors the powerful. No force is to be used-that could become dangerous; it must not come to a break-that could become dangerous; but a secret of hidden exasperation, a remotely intimated painful dejection will transform the power and honor and eminence into an affliction for the powerful, the honored, and the eminent, who still would not be able to find anything specific to complain about-because here lie the art and the secret.
