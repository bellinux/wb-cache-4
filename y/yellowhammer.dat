5|$|The bird family Emberizidae {{contains}} around 300 seed-eating species, {{the majority}} of which {{are found in the}} Americas, although the genus Emberiza, with more than forty members, is confined to the Old World. Within its genus, the <b>yellowhammer</b> is most closely related to the pine bunting, with which it forms a superspecies; they have at times been considered as one species. The white-capped and cirl buntings are also near relatives of the species pair. Where their ranges meet, the <b>yellowhammer</b> and pine bunting interbreed; the <b>yellowhammer</b> is dominant, and the hybrid zone is moving further east.|$|E

40|$|Diurnal and {{seasonal}} variation in foraging behaviour of <b>Yellowhammers</b> Emberiza citrinella and activity of their avian predators were studied in an unmanipulated winter field situation around Uppsala, Sweden. In December, when time available for foraging was lowest, <b>Yellowhammers</b> {{seemed to be}} time-stressed. In order to meet their energetic needs, they reduced the time allocated to vigilance and increased the time allocated to foraging. <b>Yellowhammers</b> did not systematically change the time spent foraging during the day in December, which indicates time-stress, while they decreased the time spent foraging during the day in both November and February. Predator activity was highest in the afternoon, when <b>Yellowhammers</b> spent the least time foraging. <b>Yellowhammers</b> may have adopted a routine with decreasing foraging rates over the day in November and February, when time available for foraging was longer, {{in order to avoid}} foraging during periods of high predator activity. The diurnal activity pattern of predators together with daylength and energetic needs are factors that might be important in shaping daily foraging routines in small birds...|$|R
5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female <b>yellowhammers</b> can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from <b>yellowhammers.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is a {{traditionally}} managed hay meadow {{on the bank}} of the Grand Union Canal. Birds visiting the site include curlews, lapwings, long-tailed tits, bullfinches, <b>yellowhammers</b> and wrens.|$|R
5|$|The pine bunting and <b>yellowhammer</b> are {{so closely}} related that each {{responds}} to the other's song. The male yellowhammer's song is more attractive to females, and is {{one reason for the}} dominance of that species where the ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|The <b>yellowhammer</b> is a bird of dry open country, preferably with a {{range of}} {{vegetation}} types and some trees from which to sing. It is absent from urban areas, forests and wetlands. Probably originally found at forest edges and large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and clumps of trees.|$|E
5|$|Populations have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in western Europe, including the British Isles, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Italy. The <b>yellowhammer</b> is a red-list (severely declining) species in Ireland and the UK. In eastern Europe, numbers appear to be stable, although the trend in Russia is unknown. Changes to agricultural practices {{are thought to be}} responsible for reduced breeding densities. The introduced population in New Zealand has been very successful, with breeding densities much higher than in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Does flax Linum usitatissimum {{positively}} impact {{populations of}} declining farmland birds? By: Tolhurst, Bryony A.; Allan, Iain U.; Glass, Deborah; et al. BIRD STUDYVolume: 61 Issue: 1 Pages: 42 - 47 Published: JAN 2 2014 Full Text View Abstract Close Abstract Capsule Skylarks and <b>Yellowhammers</b> generally did not preferentially establish territories in flax relative to autumn-sown crops on lowland farmland. Aims To investigate the biodiversity value of flax using farmland birds as indicator species. Methods Field surveys took place annually between 2009 and 2011 in Northern France, during the breeding season. Fifteen 1 km grid squares were surveyed using a grid-transect method during the periods of greatest avian activity. Territories {{were identified by}} the presence of singing males, which were assigned to crop types. Pairwise habitat comparisons were performed. Results Our results suggest that flax is not universally beneficial for <b>Yellowhammers</b> and Skylarks in our study area. However there were inter-specific differences in its use: Skylarks established more territories in flax than in oilseed rape, ploughed fields or improved grassland, whereas <b>Yellowhammers</b> mostly avoided flax fields in preference for grassland, ploughed fields and barley. Conclusion Overall, Skylarks and <b>Yellowhammers</b> did not preferentially establish territories in flax relative to autumn-sown crops, although some selection for flax by Skylarks was evident. Further work is required to: (a) quantify breeding success in flax relative to other crops and (b) investigate the effect of flax on territory densities of other species...|$|R
5|$|Predators of the <b>yellowhammer</b> {{include the}} sparrowhawk, {{northern}} goshawk, {{lesser spotted eagle}} and hobby. It is not a significant host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite, although as a ground-nesting bird its eggs and chicks are vulnerable to predation from small mammals such as mice and other rodents. Nests are also raided by crows, Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies. Predation {{accounted for more than}} 60% of nest failures in a 2012 survey in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} <b>yellowhammer</b> to be from 54–93million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73–186million birds. Although the population {{appears to be in}} a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge breeding range of about 12.9million km2 (5million sq mi), mean that this bunting is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The <b>yellowhammer</b> was {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name. Emberiza {{is derived from the}} Old German embritz, a bunting, and citrinella is the Italian for a small yellow bird. The English name is thought to have come from ammer, another German word for a bunting, and was first recorded in 1553 as yelambre.|$|E
50|$|The River Black Bourn {{runs through}} this large nature reserve, which has many bird species, such as barn owls, <b>yellowhammers,</b> linnets, reed {{buntings}} and skylarks. Plants in wet meadows include marsh orchids and marsh marigolds.|$|R
50|$|This {{site has}} flower meadows, woodland, ponds, and is {{adjacent}} to the River Cam and Byron's Pool, where Lord Byron once swam. Fauna include otters, brown hares, muntjac deer, skylarks, lapwings, <b>yellowhammers</b> and meadow pipits.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} an {{important}} wildlife site - owls, <b>yellowhammers,</b> whitethroats, turtle dove, song thrush, nightingales and bullfinches can be seen. There are also many wild plants such as corn mint, hairy buttercup, sea aster and ox-eye daisy.|$|R
5|$|To {{the south}} are Dinas Bach and Dinas Mawr, twin peninsulas formed from {{weathered}} pillow lavas 600million years old, {{thought to have been}} early fortified sites from the Iron Age. Kittiwakes, cormorants and shags can be seen on the cliffs, while farm birds such as the <b>yellowhammer</b> frequent the gorse. On Mynydd Anelog, experimental plots have been marked out to monitor different methods of managing heather to discover the best way the habitat can be conserved for the future.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yellowhammer</b> males {{learn their}} songs from their fathers, {{and over the}} course of time {{regional}} dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas. Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect; females tend to mate with males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{species of}} fleas in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus {{have been found}} on this bunting, and {{internal}} parasites include Ascaridia galli. The <b>yellowhammer</b> may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as Haemoproteus coatneyi. Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (there is no such effect for females), and {{tend to be less}} brightly coloured. The striking plumage of the male may therefore have arisen as a signal of fitness to breed. Yellowhammers infected with Haemoproteus may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings.|$|E
40|$|Behavioral {{decisions}} based on a trade-off between foraging and vigilance or hiding require information. I studied how {{the amount of information}} about predators influenced yellowhammers'' (Emberiza citrinella) foraging delay and alert perching behavior. <b>Yellowhammers</b> were shown a flying sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) silhouette, which elicited alarm calls, or a square piece of wood (control), which elicited flight calls. <b>Yellowhammers</b> that could not see the sparrowhawk model, but heard the alarm calls, had less complete information about the predation risk than those that actually saw the sparrowhawk. Hearing alarm calls affected the behavior of <b>yellowhammers.</b> Birds with less complete information about the predator exhibited alert perching more often immediately after the encounter than did birds that saw the sparrowhawk model. Also, birds that saw the sparrowhawk resumed foraging earliest, while birds that heard the alarm calls resumed foraging latest. Although there was a tendency for a significant difference in body mass between dominant and sub-dominant individuals, {{there was no significant difference}} in foraging delay. Both the foraging delay and the increase in alert perching caused lost feeding opportunities. Completeness of information and its effect on decision-making may thus affect the fitness of an animal...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} when having fat {{reserves}} is costly {{in terms of}} predation risk, birds should decrease their levels of fat reserves in response to increased predation risk. I performed an experiment in which <b>yellowhammers</b> were exposed to a control treatment, where a curtain was moved several times a day, 5 days in a row, {{and then to a}} predator treatment, where a perched, stuffed sparrowhawk appeared when the curtain was moved, 5 days in a row Between the two treatments were 2 days without any experimental treatment. The birds were expected to decrease in mass, and/or to change the daily trajectory of mass increase in response to increased predation risk. <b>Yellowhammers</b> decreased in morning mass and evening mass in response to both che moving curtain and the sparrowhawk compared to an untreated day {{before the start of the}} experiment. However, the response to both treatments was not the same; in the sparrowhawk treatment the birds waited longer before resuming feeding and lost more weight after each exposure as compared to the curtain treatment. This loss was regained, and <b>yellowhammers</b> increased their intake rate. Due to that, they reduced, although not significantly, the time spent feeding under predation risk. A reduction in the time spent feeding under predation risk reduces the time exposed to predators. However, if an increase in intake rate also incurs a decrease in vigilance, this might increase predation risk. The results of this study, together with other studies, indicate that for <b>yellowhammers</b> a reduction in time exposed to predators might be more important for survival than a reduction in body mass...|$|R

25|$|There are 147 avian {{species that}} are {{associated}} with the Peneda-Gerês park, especially along the Mourela region {{in the southern part of}} its frontier. In this region, although it might vary throughout the year (given climate and season), approximately 36 species make their nests in the area. Of particular note in this park are the: hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), <b>yellowhammer</b> (Emberiza citrinella), garden warbler(Sylvia borin) and whinchat (Saxicola rubetra). For the winchat (Saxicola rubetra), the area of Mourela is the unique nesting ground in Portugal, while the red-backed shrike and <b>yellowhammer</b> are limited to Castro Lombeiro plateau and northern corners of the park.|$|E
25|$|Where bracken is {{dominant}} it excludes most specialist heathland/moorland {{bird species}} of conservation concern, {{although there are}} a few species that may benefit from a certain proportion of bracken. Deeper bracken stands provide a good food site for many resident or breeding birds, such as threatened ground-nesting species skylark, <b>yellowhammer,</b> curlew and lapwing. Some British birds such as the whinchat and the nightjar use bracken as their preferred habitats. The nightjar may lay its eggs on the bare ground under the bracken. The skylark often nests in bracken and uses it for cover. Small stands of bracken provide nesting, feeding and roosting habitat for a variety of smaller birds, including the willow warbler (which will also use bracken to construct its nest), the tree pipit, the <b>yellowhammer,</b> the ring ouzel, the woodcock and the twite.|$|E
50|$|This {{habitat is}} home to badgers, foxes, voles, shrews and weasels, and {{pipistrelle}} and long-eared bats. Jays, green and great spotted woodpeckers are frequently seen, and rarer sightings include <b>yellowhammers,</b> chiffchaffs and tree pipits. Many butterflies, such as the comma and hedge brown thrive here. Also found are turtle doves, nightingales, grey and red-legged partridges, and barn and long-eared owls.|$|R
50|$|This {{site has}} grassland, marsh, scrub and woodland. It has a diverse bird life, such as <b>yellowhammers,</b> whitethroats, song thrushes and short-eared owls. There are also winter {{visitors}} including black-tailed godwits, grey plovers and turnstones. Plants include corn mints and hairy buttercups, {{and there is}} a wide variety of invertebrates. The grassland is grazed to prevent the vegetation from becoming too coarse.|$|R
50|$|Many {{rare and}} scarce liverworts, {{mosses and lichens}} occur within the ghylls or ravines. Peregrines, black redstarts and fulmars breed on the cliffs. Dartford warblers, stonechats and <b>yellowhammers</b> breed on the gorse-covered hillsides. Many {{migrants}} pass through the site in spring and autumn and usually includes a few rarities such as Sardinian warbler, red-rumped swallow, and Pallas's leaf warbler, which have all occurred in recent years.|$|R
25|$|The {{landscape}} is rocky moorland with a covering of coarse grass and bracken. Several spinneys of woodland (pine and mixed deciduous) are enclosed by stone walls {{and are not}} accessible to the public. There {{are a number of}} magnificent specimens of ancient oaks several hundreds of years old. The park is home to herds of red deer and fallow deer. Birdlife is profuse – the reservoir attracts many species of wildfowl, as does the river and the spinneys provide secluded nesting areas for many other species, including large colonies of rooks. Species such as <b>yellowhammer,</b> reed bunting, skylark and meadow pipit are a common sight in the open areas of the park. Deadly nightshade is allowed to grow within the ruins of Bradgate House, having been originally established there during World War II by Leicester Polytechnic's School of Pharmacy for medicinal purposes.|$|E
500|$|The <b>yellowhammer</b> (Emberiza citrinella) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} bunting {{family that}} is native to Eurasia and introduced to New Zealand, Australia, the Falkland Islands, and South Africa. Most European birds remain in the breeding range year-round, but the eastern subspecies is partially migratory, {{with much of the}} population wintering further south. The male <b>yellowhammer</b> has a bright yellow head, streaked brown back, chestnut rump and yellow underparts. Other plumages are duller versions of the same pattern. The <b>yellowhammer</b> is common in open areas with some scrubs or trees, and forms small flocks in winter. It has a characteristic song with an [...] "A little bit of bread and no cheese" [...] rhythm. The song is very similar to that of its closest relative, the pine bunting, with which it interbreeds.|$|E
500|$|The <b>yellowhammer</b> is a conspicuous, {{vocal and}} {{formerly}} common country bird, and has attracted human interest. Yellowham Wood and Yellowham Hill, near Dorchester, both derive their names from the bird. Robbie Burns' poem [...] "The Yellow, Yellow Yorlin'" [...] gets its title from a Scottish {{name for the}} <b>yellowhammer,</b> which is given an obvious sexual connotation: I met a pretty maid, an' unto her I said,/ [...] "I wad fain fin' your yellow, yellow yorlin'."
