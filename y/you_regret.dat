2500|$|Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times {{said the}} film [...] "is closer in texture and {{consistency}} to individually wrapped American cheese than good, tangy English Cheddar. But even humble plastic-wrapped cheese has its virtues {{and so does}} this film, which for its first hour hums along principally by virtue of many, many shots of the verdant Yorkshire Dales and the professional good graces of its cast. Chief among those graces are Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, two well-matched and criminally underused actresses who ... tend to make <b>you</b> <b>regret</b> the movie that could have been, even as they felicitously help pass the time ... Although they {{have little to do}} but grin and bare it, Mirren and Walters are delightful company." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duritz hinted in a 2006 {{interview}} that Counting Crows' next studio record {{would be released}} in late 2007. He indicated that the band had spent three weeks working in a recording studio with Gil Norton, the producer behind Recovering the Satellites, and revealed the working title of the album to be Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings. Duritz explained that [...] "Saturday night is when you sin and Sunday is when <b>you</b> <b>regret.</b> Sinning is often done very loudly, angrily, bitterly, violently." [...] Vickrey stated that [...] "the idea {{at the moment is}} to have kind of a rocking side and then an acoustic-y, maybe country-ish side. We got the first half done in May in New York, so half of it is pretty strong and done. And now we're going to work on the second half, the country tunes, during the tour." ...|$|E

5000|$|This {{process of}} {{reconciliation}} {{leads to a}} [...] "both/and" [...] view of life, where both thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis, which negates the importance of personal responsibility and the human choice of either/or. The work Either/Or {{is a response to}} this aspect of Hegel's philosophy. A passage from that work exemplifies Kierkegaard's contempt for Hegel's philosophy. Note the comparison between [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] (Judge Vilhelm) in Either/Or and Stages on Life's Way. [...] Marry, and <b>you</b> will <b>regret</b> it.

Whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, <b>you</b> will <b>regret</b> it either way. This, gentlemen, is the quintessence of all the wisdom of life. Søren Kierkegaard [...] My dear reader, {{if you do not have}} the time and opportunity to take a dozen years of your life to travel around the world to see everything a world traveler is acquainted with, if you do not have the capability and qualifications from years of practice in a foreign language to penetrate to the differences in national characteristics as these become apparent to the research scholar, if you are not bent upon discovering a new astronomical system that will displace both the Copernican and the Ptolemaic-then marry; and if you have time for the first, the capability for the second, the idea for the last, then marry also. Even if you did not manage to see the whole globe or to speak in many tongues or to know all about the heavens, <b>you</b> will not <b>regret</b> it, for marriage is and remains the most important voyage of discovery a human being undertakes; compared with a married man’s knowledge of life, any other knowledge of it is superficial, for he and he alone has properly immersed himself in life.
