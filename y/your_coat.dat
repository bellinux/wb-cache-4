2500|$|Throughout history {{many have}} {{understood}} Jesus of Nazareth {{to have been}} a pacifist, drawing on his Sermon on the Mount. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should [...] "not resist an evildoer" [...] and promoted his turn the other cheek philosophy. [...] "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take <b>your</b> <b>coat,</b> give your cloak as well... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you." [...] The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.|$|E
2500|$|The Beatles' press officer, Tony Barrow, wrote a {{book called}} On the Scene at the Cavern, using the {{pseudonym}} Alistair Griffin. [...] "On the Scene at the Cavern," [...] a book including text as well as photographs from the crowds and performances at the club, was celebrated at a launch party at The Cavern Club in August 1964. [...] In the book, Barrow described in vivid detail the scene at the Cavern Club in its heyday. [...] "Even on a night when the Beatles weren’t billed to appear there were odds-on chances you’d find Paul or George or one of the other boys propping up the counter of The Cavern’s coke bar and chatting to groups of fans," [...] Barrow tells readers of [...] "On the Scene at the Cavern". [...] "And if you looked in at a lunchtime session Cillia Black would have checked <b>your</b> <b>coat</b> into the cloakroom or spooned out a plate of tomato soup for you." [...] On the Scene at the Cavern" [...] was published by Panther Books, and it was reissued in 1984 with additional pictures and text from the days of the Cavern Club. [...] Barrow also wrote for The Beatles Monthly Book at this time using the pseudonym Frederick James. [...] And a [...] "Cavern trip to Hamburg" [...] was organised, involving a visit to The Star-Club where the Beatles had been a resident group.|$|E
