50|$|Laticauda or <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> are a genus of venomous elapid snakes {{from the}} family Hydrophiinae. They are semi-aquatic: they retain the wide ventral scales typical of {{terrestrial}} snakes for moving on land but also have paddle-shaped tails for swimming. <b>Sea</b> <b>kraits</b> are often confused with another group of aquatic reptiles: sea snakes. However, unlike the fully aquatic ovoviviparous <b>sea</b> snakes, <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> are oviparous and must come to land to digest prey and lay eggs. They also have independent evolutionary origins into aquatic habitats, with <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> diverging earlier from other Australasian elapids. Thus, <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> and <b>sea</b> snakes are an example of convergent evolution into aquatic habitats within Hydrophiinae snakes.|$|R
5|$|When hunting, banded <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> {{frequently}} {{head into}} deep water far from land, but return {{to land in}} order to digest, shed skin, and reproduce.

30|$|Our data {{demonstrated}} {{that there are}} interspecific differences in locomotor performance among these three <b>sea</b> <b>krait</b> species, and these results support our principal hypothesis. Being the most terrestrial species of the three <b>sea</b> <b>kraits,</b> L. colubrina demonstrated the fastest sprint speed during the terrestrial locomotion test. On the other hand, L. semifasciata is a more highly aquatic species and performed significantly better in the water, having the highest sprint swimming speed. These data suggest that <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> have adaptive locomotor capabilities that have evolved to improve performance in their respective principal habitat.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe genus Laticauda (Reptilia: Elapidae), {{commonly}} known as <b>sea</b> <b>kraits,</b> comprises eight species of marineamphibious snakes distributed along {{the shores of the}} Western Pacific Ocean and the Eastern Indian Ocean. We review the information available on the geographic range of <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> and analyze their distributionpatterns. Generally, we found that south and south-west of Japan, Philippines Archipelago, parts of Indonesia, and Vanuatu have the highest diversity of <b>sea</b> <b>krait</b> species. Further, we compiled the informationavailable on sea kraits’ occurrences from a variety of sources, including museum records, field surveys, and the scientific literature. The final database comprises 694 occurrence records, with L. colubrina having the highest number of records and L. schistorhyncha the lowest. The occurrence records were georeferenced and compiled as a database for each <b>sea</b> <b>krait</b> species. This database can be freely used for future studies...|$|R

50|$|Fry and Carwardine {{travel to}} Indonesia and Malaysia to out a rare, endemic species. At Snake Island they {{encounter}} a venomous <b>yellow-lipped</b> <b>sea</b> <b>krait,</b> causing Fry to rue {{his decision to}} wear open-toed sandals. At Turtle Island, conservationists are working to protect sea turtles. The presenters help to collect eggs from a female green turtle that has come ashore to lay, and then release new hatchlings back into the sea. Heading further south, the pair dive and snorkel on Indonesia's coral reefs, viewing adult turtles and seahorses. On Mabul Island they find sharks' fins and jawbones, dried seahorses and sea cucumbers for sale. Carwardine explains that the demand from Asian markets, for food and traditional medicine, is driving these species to extinction. At Labuk Bay they view proboscis monkeys in a mangrove sanctuary surrounded by oil palm plantations. Fry compares their noises to lunchtime at the Garrick Club. Their final destination is the Indonesian island of Rinca, home to the Komodo dragon. The world's largest lizard {{is not to be}} underestimated: they meet rangers and villagers who have been attacked by dragons, and hear of a child who was killed. However, the dragons are entwined in the islanders' culture, and the tourists they attract bring much-needed income. Fry and Carwardine help Park rangers to fit a radio collar to a dragon as part of a research project. With protection, tolerance from locals and the ability of female dragons to procreate through parthenogenesis, Fry is confident that the species can survive.|$|E
50|$|Sea snakes are a {{subfamily}} (Hydrophiinae) of the venomous Australasian snakes of {{the family}} Elapidae. Traditionally, sea snakes and <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> {{were considered to be}} a part of a single family (Hydrophiidae), but <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> have since been placed into a separate subfamily (Laticaudinae) due to their independent evolution into aquatic habitats (i.e., convergent evolution).|$|R
40|$|International audienceDestruction and {{pollution}} of coral reefs threaten these marine biodiversity hot stops which shelter {{more than two}} thirds of sea snake species. Notably, in many coral reef ecosystems of the Western Pacific Ocean, large populations of <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> (amphibious <b>sea</b> snakes) have drastically declined {{during the past three}} decades. Protecting remaining healthy populations is thus essential. In New Caledonia, coral reefs shelter numerous <b>sea</b> <b>krait</b> colonies spread throughout an immense lagoon (24, 000 km 2). <b>Sea</b> <b>kraits</b> feed on coral fish but lay their eggs on land. However, ecological information on reproduction and juveniles is extremely fragmentary, precluding protection of key habitats for reproduction. Our 10 years mark recapture study on Yellow <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> (L. saintgironsi > 8, 700 individuals marked) revealed that most neonates aggregate in highly localized coastal sites, where they feed and grow during several months before dispersal. Hundreds of females emigrate seasonally from remote populations (> 50 km away) to lay their eggs in these coastal nurseries, and then return home. Protecting these nurseries is a priority to maintain recruitment rate, and to retain <b>sea</b> <b>krait</b> populations in the future...|$|R

40|$|Two {{species of}} <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> (Laticaudidae) occur in New Caledonia. The yellow <b>sea</b> <b>krait</b> Laticauda saintgironsi, {{closely related to}} L. colubrina and L. frontalis, is endemic to the area. The blue <b>sea</b> <b>krait</b> (L. laticaudata) is {{widespread}} over the west Pacific, however an absence of careful taxonomic studies impedes to determine to what extent it might be also an endemic species. Paradoxically, despite their abundance, {{there is very little}} scientific information on the neo-caledonian <b>sea</b> <b>kraits.</b> Since 2002 we set up a mark recapture study on 10 islets. We gathered the most comprehensive data set on the morphology and ecology of these two species of snake. We captured and individually marked more than 4, 000 snakes, and gathered more than 3, 000 recaptures. We provide the mean values for the body size, body mass, number of rings of the two species. We also present the first information about the reproduction phenology.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> (Laticauda spp.) – amphibious sea snakes – {{dehydrate}} without a source of fresh water, drink only fresh water or very dilute brackish water, and have a spatial distribution of abundance that correlates with freshwater sites in Taiwan. The spatial distribution correlates with sites where there is a source of fresh water in addition to local precipitation. Here we report six years of longitudinal data on the abundance of <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> related to precipitation at sites where these snakes are normally abundant in the coastal waters of Lanyu (Orchid Island), Taiwan. The number of observed <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> varies from year-to-year and correlates positively with previous 6 -mo cumulative rainfall, which serves as an inverse index of drought. Grouped data for snake counts indicate that mean abundance in wet years is nearly 3 -fold greater than in dry years, and this difference is significant. These data corroborate previous findings and suggest that freshwater dependence influences the abundance or activity of <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> on both spatial and temporal scales.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{investigations}} of water balance in sea snakes demonstrated that amphibious <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> (Laticauda spp.) dehydrate in seawater and require fresh water to restore deficits in body water. Here, we report similar findings for Pelamis platurus, a viviparous, pelagic, entirely marine species of hydrophiine ("true") sea snake. We sampled snakes at Golfo de Papagayo, Guanacaste, Costa Rica and demonstrated {{they do not}} drink seawater but fresh water at variable deficits of body water incurred by dehydration. The threshold dehydration at which snakes first drink fresh water is - 18. 3 [*]±[*] 1. 1 % (mean[*]±[*]SE) loss of body mass, which is roughly twice the magnitude of mass deficit at which <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> drink fresh water. Compared to <b>sea</b> <b>kraits,</b> Pelamis drink relatively larger volumes of water and make up {{a larger percentage of}} the dehydration deficit. Some dehydrated Pelamis also were shown to drink brackish water up to 50 % seawater, but most drank at lower brackish values and 20 % of the snakes tested did not drink at all. Like <b>sea</b> <b>kraits,</b> Pelamis dehydrate when kept in seawater in the laboratory. Moreover, some individuals drank fresh water immediately following capture, providing preliminary evidence that Pelamis dehydrate at sea. Thus, this widely distributed pelagic species remains subject to dehydration in marine environments where it retains a capacity to sense and to drink fresh water. In comparison with <b>sea</b> <b>kraits,</b> however, Pelamis represents a more advanced stage in the evolutionary transition to a fully marine life and appears to be less dependent on fresh water...|$|R
5|$|Banded <b>sea</b> <b>kraits</b> {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish.
