500|$|Stefani came up {{with the}} idea of the Harajuku Girls while writing the song. Stefani first saw the women of Harajuku, known for their unique style drawing from Gothic Lolita and {{cyberpunk}} fashion, in 1996 and had admired them since. She decided to mention them in the line [...] "You Harajuku Girls, damn <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> wicked style", and the concept grew into a running theme on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., which went as far as to feature one song named after and dedicated to them.|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E
2500|$|When O'Reilly {{appeared}} on The Daily Show {{before the second}} episode of The Colbert Report aired, he commented, [...] "Before we get started, somebody told me walking in here, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> French guy on after you making fun of me?", and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'. In a subsequent Newsweek interview, O'Reilly said that he [...] "feels it's a compliment" [...] to have Colbert parody him because Colbert [...] "isn't mean-spirited" [...] and does not [...] "use [...] platform to injure people". Later, Colbert replied on-air, [...] "I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because I {{find you}} disappointing. I {{thoroughly}} enjoyed discovering you upon the steamer. You were delightfully primitive, an absolute cave-dweller, but you quite repaid my {{efforts to make}} a human being of you. You were really almost as interesting {{when we first met}} in London. And now, I don't know what it is, but you seem to have gone thousands of miles away again. You don't seem properly human. Don't you like women, or have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> queer scheme in your head which keeps you living like a man with his head in the clouds? Or are you in love?" ...|$|E

Why don't {{you get on}} at some {{automobile}} factory, and then you could ring in as a chauffeur, soon 's <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> recommends you could take to the Y. M. C. A. employment bureau." [...] The washer gouged at a clot of ice with his heel, swore profusely, and went on: [...] "Here. You {{go over to the}} Lodestar Motor Company's office, over on La Salle, Monday, and ask for Bill Coogan, on the sales end. He's me cousin, and you tell him to give you a card to the foreman out at the works, and I guess maybe you'll get a job, all right." ...|$|E

I haven't {{even get a}} bank-note, or I might have written in blood upon that; though I have got a hundred sovereigns in gold--I grabbed them up before I bolted from the cabin. But I say--excuse me, Miss Smithers, but--um--ah--oh! hang modesty--haven't <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> linen on, somewhere or other, that you could spare a bit of? You shan't lose by giving it to me. There, I promise that I will tear up the {{agreement}} if ever I get out of this--which I shan't--which I shan't--and I will write on the linen that {{it is to be}} torn up. Yes, and that you are to have five thousand pounds legacy too, Miss Smithers. Surely you can spare me a little bit--just off the skirt, or somewhere, you know, Miss Smithers? It never will be missed, and it is so very important." ...|$|E
6000|$|They were by {{no means}} the worst boys who did such things, but only the most thoughtless. Still, there was a public opinion in the Boy's Town which ruled out certain tricks, and gave the boys who played them the name of being [...] "mean." [...] One of these was boring a hole in the edge of your {{school-desk}} to meet a shaft sunk from the top, which you filled with slate-pencil dust. Then, if you were that kind of boy, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> little chap to put his eye close to the shaft, with the hope of seeing Niagara Falls, and set your lips to the hole in the edge, and blew his eye full of pencil-dust. This was mean; and it was also mean to get some unsuspecting child to close the end of an elderwood tube with his thumb, and look hard at you, while you showed him Germany. You did this by pulling a string below the tube, and running a needle into his thumb. My boy discovered Germany in this way long before he had any geographical or political conception of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that's {{the great}} thing," [...] said Isabel, smiling and suspecting that her {{acquaintance}} with this lightly flitting personage would {{not lead to}} intellectual repose. If the Countess objected to argument Isabel at this moment had as little taste for it, and she put out her hand to Pansy with a pleasant sense that such a gesture committed her to nothing that would admit of a divergence of views. Gilbert Osmond apparently took a rather hopeless view of his sister's tone; he turned the conversation to another topic. He presently {{sat down on the}} other side of his daughter, who had shyly brushed Isabel's fingers with her own; but he ended by drawing her out of her chair and making her stand between his knees, leaning against him while he passed his arm round her slimness. The child fixed her eyes on Isabel with a still, disinterested gaze which seemed void of an intention, yet conscious of an attraction. Mr. Osmond talked of many things; Madame Merle had said he could be agreeable when he chose, and to-day, after a little, he appeared not only to have chosen but to have determined. Madame Merle and the Countess Gemini sat a little apart, conversing in the effortless manner of persons who knew each other well enough to take their ease; but every now and then Isabel heard the Countess, at something said by her companion, plunge into the latter's lucidity as a poodle splashes after a thrown stick. It was as if Madame Merle were seeing how far she would go. Mr. Osmond talked of Florence, of Italy, of the pleasure of living in that country and of the abatements to the pleasure. There were both satisfactions and drawbacks; the drawbacks were numerous; strangers were too apt to see such a world as all romantic. It met the case soothingly for the human, for the social failure--by which he meant the people who couldn't [...] "realise," [...] as they said, on their sensibility: they could keep it about them there, in their poverty, without ridicule, as you might keep an heirloom or an inconvenient entailed place that brought you in nothing. Thus there were advantages in living in the country which contained the greatest sum of beauty. Certain impressions you could get only there. Others, favourable to life, you never got, and <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>some</b> that were very bad. But from time to time you got one of a quality that made up for everything. Italy, all the same, had spoiled a great many people; he was even fatuous enough to believe at times that he himself might have been a better man if he had spent less of his life there. It made one idle and dilettantish and second-rate; it had no discipline for the character, didn't cultivate in you, otherwise expressed, the successful social and other [...] "cheek" [...] that flourished in Paris and London. [...] "We're sweetly provincial," [...] said Mr. Osmond, [...] "and I'm perfectly aware that I myself am as rusty as a key that has no lock to fit it. It polishes me up a little to talk with you--not that I venture to pretend I can turn that very complicated lock I suspect your intellect of being! But you'll be going away before I've seen you three times, and I shall perhaps never see you after that. That's what it is to live in a country that people come to. When they're disagreeable here it's bad enough; when they're agreeable it's still worse. As soon as you like them they're off again! I've been deceived too often; I've ceased to form attachments, to permit myself to feel attractions. You mean to stay--to settle? That would be really comfortable. Ah yes, your aunt's a sort of guarantee; I believe she may be depended on. Oh, she's an old Florentine; I mean literally an old one; not a modern outsider. She's a contemporary of the Medici; she must have been present at the burning of Savonarola, and I'm not sure she didn't throw a handful of chips into the flame. Her face is very much like some faces in the early pictures; little, dry, definite faces that must have had a good deal of expression, but almost always the same one. Indeed I can show you her portrait in a fresco of Ghirlandaio's. I hope you don't object to my speaking that way of your aunt, eh? I've an idea you don't. Perhaps you think that's even worse. I assure you there's no want of respect in it, to either of you. You know I'm a particular admirer of Mrs. Touchett." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You ain't sayin' anything, eh? An' why don't you? Because I guess <b>you</b> still <b>got</b> <b>some</b> natural {{shame in}} you a-runnin' with a prizefighter.
