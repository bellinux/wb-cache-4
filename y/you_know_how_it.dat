I had a grandfather who was in Dachau, an aunt in Auschwitz. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is between Poles and Germans. But Bach was a German too—and Schubert, and Strauss. Everyone has his place on this little earth. That's all behind me. So the Third Symphony is not about war; it's not a Dies Irae; it's a normal Symphony of Sorrowful Songs." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{critics and}} fans have {{generally}} praised Sora's character. When Sora was first revealed in 2002, GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini regarded him as [...] "an appropriate amalgamation of the Square and Disney universes." [...] He also comically noted that Sora [...] "doesn't look like much, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> goes." [...] A 1UP.com writer called Sora [...] "one of my all-time favorite Square characters", praising his cheerful personality. Gamasutra commented on Sora's journey along the series in their feature [...] "The Birth of Collecting: The Osiris Archetype In Games" [...] by Jason Johnson; while comparing Sora with Isis, Johnson found Sora's adventure appealing. IGN praised Sora's resilient character, noting how such an ordinary [...] "youngster" [...] could {{face up to}} his challenges during his adventures {{for the sake of}} friendship, while RPGFan's Nicole Monet Kirk labelled him as an [...] "extremely likable hero". Furthermore, in the book [...] "Interactive Storytelling for Video Games: A Player-Centered Approach to Creating Memorable Characters and Stories", it is noted that while Sora follows a [...] "standard hero archetype", his character becomes more believable and strong when worrying about his friends' fates. Haley Joel Osment, Sora's English voice actor, has also been praised by Gaming Target's Matt Swidder, who mentioned Osment [...] "makes a perfect fit for Sora". While remarking on Osment's work, Louis Bedigian from GameZone mentioned that [...] "Sora had something rarely found in video-game characters: depth" [...] also praising his role in Kingdom Hearts. Game Informers Bryan Vore found that in Kingdom Hearts II, Osment has improved in voicing the character, praising his work. In their Super Smash Bros Brawl list, IGN described Sora as [...] "...the most active and evolved hero on this week's list." [...] IGN listed him as a possible character in Brawl, though he was not chosen as the [...] "reader's choice".|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Overstreet of Christianity Today avoided {{revealing}} plot details, {{stating that}} while knowing {{the nature of}} the third part would not ruin the film, it would alter the experience significantly. Mark Moring of Christianity Today said, [...] "Who wants to watch a movie when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> ends? We've actually had to wrestle with that question around here lately..." [...] Moring said, [...] "We wondered if our 'moral obligation' to warn Christians about the potentially disturbing subject matter somehow 'trumped' our professional commitment to avoid plot spoilers—especially the worst plot spoiler of all: divulging the end. After some discussion, we agreed that the right decision was to not give away the end to Million Dollar Baby." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for Lopez told People magazine that Lopez was not replacing Paula Abdul on the eighth season of American Idol because she would be busy promoting her film, The Back-up Plan {{as well as her}} new album. Both projects were slated for a January 2010 release, despite Lopez previously stating that she was aiming for the end of 2009. However during an interview with KTU Mornings, Lopez revealed that both the album and film were being pushed back to April 2010. Rap-Up magazine would later confirm that the album and film were being released together in cross-promotion of each other. However this date appeared unlikely when, backstage at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, she said [...] "I'm working on my album that will be out... hopefully this year, we'll see if I get it done... <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is, you go in your there non-stop, you leave it alone for a minute and you come back– you're like, okay, this is what I need." ...|$|E
