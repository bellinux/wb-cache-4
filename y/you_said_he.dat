60|$|Pala. How? Does {{it become}} him already? 'Twas but just now <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> {{was such a}} figure of a man.|$|E
6000|$|... "In the store,--you know. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> wasn't to hear {{anything}} of this, but I'll call him," [...] said Mrs. Harkutt, rising eagerly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, father, you did praise {{him last}} Wednesday. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had an {{uncommon}} notion of stock, {{and a good}} eye for things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind. It {{will all}} be over soon," [...] replied Mr. Dare with a heavy cough. [...] "I suppose the doctor has told <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would." ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> {{would also}} rob his father, methinks {{that was an}} unnatural thing.|$|R
60|$|A look of relief, that I {{could almost}} have called beautiful, dawned on his countenance. ‘Anything—anything <b>you</b> wish,’ <b>said</b> <b>he.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} fills them with hay, for <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> is a haymaker," [...] remarked Happy Jack Squirrel, {{who is always}} {{interested}} in storehouses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{your uncle}} could {{be thankful for}} one thing--that he wasn't in the mine when that big slide took place. But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> died anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would be nice about it," [...] Sylvia exclaimed. [...] "I must {{have a talk with}} Herbert; <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would be home this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Kate Mercy, [...] "you {{look as if}} you did. He {{thought a}} lot of <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was only {{beginning}} {{to find out what}} you was. I'd like you to think as well of me as you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Doch ist er nicht ein Konig. Beesmarck, {{he was not}} a king, Winifred, as <b>you</b> have <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> was only-il n'etait que chancelier.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where are <b>you</b> going?' <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> {{looking at}} the bear in surprise, for {{he was an old}} acquaintance, and not {{generally}} so smart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what is the}} trick? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{shook hands}} with his jailers and walked off. Of course, he couldn't do that, unless his time was up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he won't. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was one {{of those}} strong men, didn't you? They always run true to form. They never do {{anything}} except be strong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{when we were}} {{learning}} about Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was most {{closely related to the}} Pocket Mice. What about them?" [...] said Johnny Chuck.|$|E
6000|$|... "I would, indeed, if I could, sir,--but it's {{just because}} I love her so, that I can't! Besides, as <b>you</b> {{yourself}} <b>said,</b> <b>he's</b> a perfect stranger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{certainly}} is news," [...] was Ben's comment, as they rolled {{along the river}} road. [...] "I thought from what <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> Dave, <b>he</b> must have been buried alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very natural! I {{must see}} him. From what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> already, <b>he</b> doesn't {{strike me as}} a fool. Well, I don't think you need worry too much, Mr. Ormesby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A rebel!" [...] {{repeated}} Henry. [...] "Yes; you and papa had quarrelled terribly, and you set both him and mamma, and Mrs. Pryor, and everybody, at defiance. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had insulted you----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want {{father to}} go against his will. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> never {{wanted to go to}} Europe." [...] The girl had turned her face upon her mother again; and fixed her with her tearful, accusing eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he dies," [...] Mabane said thoughtfully, [...] "your friend Grooten, I think <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> called himself, {{will have}} to {{disappear}} altogether. In that case I suppose we--shall be compelled to send the child back to the convent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘So, sir, I find <b>you</b> here?’ <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> in {{tones of}} little encouragement. ‘Is that you, George? You can run away; I have {{business}} with your master.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, colonel. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> {{was to go}} on as if we did {{not know}} him, till we reached Chitral; and of course spoke to him in Punjabi.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> know,' <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> after a pause, {{during which}} they walked on side by side, 'that I believe I could tell you your name, if I tried?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Our foe was no skulk in {{his ship}} I tell <b>you,</b> (<b>said</b> <b>he,)</b> [...] His was the surly English pluck, {{and there is}} no tougher or truer, [...] and never was, and never will be; [...] Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'For the practised equivocator <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was,' murmured Mrs. Hauksbee, 'he {{strikes me}} as a failure. Now {{wherefore}} should he have preferred a walk with The Dowd to tea with us? Elective affinities, I suppose both grubby. Polly, I'd never forgive that woman as long as the world rolls.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Thank {{you very}} much for the {{photograph}} frame. It was just what I wanted. Very good of you. I say, {{do you know what that}} Kneyght person has given me? Just what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would—a wretched fan. What? Oh yes, quite a good enough fan in its way, but still [...] .” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Lily,' said Jane, 'how {{can you say}} he {{was quite}} with <b>you,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{thought it would be}} better if she was farther from home, and under some older person?' ...|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Liddle wrote a {{collection}} of short stories, Too Beautiful For <b>You.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> has {{always wanted to be a}} writer, and saw journalism as a cop-out. He is also the author of Love Will Destroy Everything (2007) and the co-author of The Best of Liddle Britain (2007).|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{too little}} for to mill <b>you,</b> Mulvaney,' <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> 'an' you've strook me before; {{but you can}} take an' cut me in two with this 'ere if you like.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If there's {{any doubt}} about the matter, he is," [...] {{returned}} the doctor. [...] "A {{man who has been}} three years biting his nails on a desert island, Jim, can't expect to appear as sane as you or me. It doesn't lie in human nature. Was it cheese <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had a fancy for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{man that}} brought the news about <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was all right and hearty, and the troop was doing good work in {{scouring}} the country round Cawnpore. Now will you ride back and report yourself to General Wilson?" [...] So saying, he ordered two of the troopers to dismount and walk back to camp.|$|E
6000|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} he reached Stoneborough, found no one come in, {{and sat down in}} the fire-light, where, for all his impatience, fatigue had made him drop asleep, when he was roused by Gertrude's voice, exclaiming, 'Here really is Tom come, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would, without writing. Here are all his goods in the hall.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank <b>you,</b> sir,' <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> {{and would}} have {{returned}} the base gratuity. But John, too, would none of it; and as they struggled, who must join in but the cabman? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you can do}} as <b>you</b> please,' <b>said</b> <b>he</b> roughly; 'I'm going no nearer, so you {{can take}} your choice of getting into the dingey or of {{swimming}} for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have told}} <b>you</b> already,' <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> 'that my {{authority}} is sufficient, and my power equal to it; {{this is all}} which {{it is necessary for}} you at present to know.' ...|$|R
