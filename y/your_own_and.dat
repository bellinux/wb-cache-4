5|$|Late in the day, as the {{situation}} was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, Simović, who was both the Prime Minister and Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff, broadcast the following message:All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every means at their disposal.

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1851, Jackson {{accepted}} a newly created teaching position at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), in Lexington, Virginia. He became Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Instructor of Artillery. Parts of Jackson's curriculum are still taught at VMI, regarded as timeless military essentials: discipline, mobility, assessing the enemy's strength and intentions while attempting to conceal <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> the efficiency of artillery combined with an infantry assault.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: [...] "It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves {{having to go to}} a psychiatrist." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} novel at the awards {{ceremony}} in Piccadilly, London, Miller {{stated that he}} [...] "had no special sense of this one being the one" [...] and mentioned that [...] "it's a strange journey, you spend {{three years in a}} room on <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> then this: a little unsettling but deeply pleasurable"; [...] "It's a very happy occasion". Chair of the judging, editor of the Evening Standard newspaper Geordie Greig, said that the panel were basing their decision partially on the durability and memorability of the work, stating [...] "we were looking for quality". Speaking of the novel itself, Greig called it [...] "a rich and evocative historical novel which engrosses with its vivid portrait of pre-revolutionary France", stating [...] "The qualities of Pure stood out for its memorable gothic tale of morality and mortality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rrose Sélavy and {{the other}} pseudonyms Duchamp used may {{be read as a}} comment on the fallacy of romanticizing the {{conscious}} individuality or subjectivity of the artist, a theme that is also a prominent subtext of the Readymades. [...] Duchamp said in an interview,"You think you're doing something entirely <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> a year later you look at it and you see actually the roots of where your art comes from without your knowing it at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{teaching}} and film-making, Khouri devotes time to feminist organizations. [...] "Don’t you think {{talking about it}} is important, making the next generation understand that things are still not right for women?" [...] says Khouri. “I feel like I owe aspiring writers at least the warning that they are picking maybe the hardest thing there is {{to do in the}} business,” she says. “It doesn’t matter any more how good you are. In some ways, it never really did. Bad movies get made as often as good ones, but so few movies get made now, period. If you write for a studio, you may be one of eight writers, so it’s not like you can have an artistic vision of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> achieve it solely through screenwriting. I was very lucky because Ridley really wanted to tell Thelma & Louise. He wanted to make the movie I wanted to make. But often times that’s not the case at all. They think your script is a good idea and that’s all. So they buy it and then they hire two or three other people to take a whack at it and it can be a very disappointing thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mike Langberg of Knight Ridder {{was less}} positive, writing {{in his review}} that [...] "At first glance, the CD-ROM {{provides}} a lot of raw material. There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat." [...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter how hard you try." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bartlett's poetry {{came to the}} {{attention}} of leading poets, writers, and critics as diverse as Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Mark Van Doren, Conrad Aiken, Allen Tate, Alfred Kreymborg, Robert Hillyer, Louis Untermeyer, Rolfe Humphries, John Ciardi, Richard Eberhart, Richard Wilbur, Maxine Kumin, Robert M. Hutchins, Kenneth Rexroth, William Stafford, and others. [...] Over the years, Bartlett maintained an active and extensive correspondence with eminent poets, writers, and literary critics; evident throughout this collected literary correspondence are strong statements attesting to the importance of her work. About her first book of poetry, Poems of Yes and No, published in 1952, Marianne Moore wrote: [...] "I surely find good in the Poems of Yes and No.... The clearness of the book is certainly beautiful." [...] Wallace Stevens was impressed by Poems of Yes and No and wrote: [...] "Your poems give one a sense of intelligence and sensibility." [...] Alfred Kreymborg was enthusiastic about the book: [...] "You have found a style of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> developed it. I say yes to your poems of yes and no. This is a distinguished volume as a whole. I wish you well with this warm book. Any poet might envy the courage and artistry of what you say, or rather sing, there." [...] Further commendation came from Robert Hillyer, who wrote: [...] "Your poems are moving and unusual.... A distinguished achievement!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 2015, the Canadian House of Commons {{public safety}} {{committee}} passed {{a motion to}} invite RCMP Commissioner Paulson to [...] "publicly display and discuss the video" [...] that Zehaf-Bibeau recorded at a future meeting of the committee. Commissioner Paulson showed the video (minus 18 seconds which the RCMP said might be pertinent to investigations into accomplices) at the public safety committee meeting of March 6. Zehaf-Bibeau is quoted as saying: [...] "This is in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper [...] wants to send his troops to Iraq. Canada's officially become one of our enemies by fighting and bombing us and creating a lot of terror in our countries and killing us and killing our innocents. So, just aiming to hit some soldiers just to show that you're not even safe in your own land, and you gotta be careful. We'll not cease until you guys decide to be a peaceful country and stay to <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> stop going to other countries and stop occupying and killing the righteous {{of us who are}} trying to bring back religious law in our countries. Thank you." [...] The video was recorded in the car, in Ottawa, {{on the day of the}} shootings and was found in the car abandoned in front of Parliament. Paulson said he believes that someone else was involved, and if they were found to have aided Zehaf-Bibeau, that they would be charged with terrorism offences. Paulson also said a post-mortem test for drugs and alcohol on Zehaf-Bibeau was negative and that he had a long knife tied to his wrist when he was killed by Parliament Hill security.|$|E
