500|$|Emile Rafael {{directed}} the official music video for [...] "Trouble", with cinematography by Charlie Herranz. During {{an interview with}} Elle, Kills talked on the concept she went with for the visual. Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England {{at the age of}} 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt [...] "closer to betterness" [...] in parties, where she was exposed to recreational drugs. She started to consume them and she felt better with them for [...] "a few short hours". [...] "They make you feel better, so the minute the high wears off <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>more.</b> But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. [...] "More happiness, more power or freedom or love if you know that it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [...] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad—much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." [...] She further explained that she wanted to create an [...] "honest video that showed both [...] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire." [...] The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' Vevo and YouTube accounts.|$|E

2500|$|His {{career began}} in 1992, {{at the age}} of fourteen, during an era known as Golden age hip hop. [...] The artist was {{originally}} known as Divine in the duo Grace & Divine with Michael Lowe. [...] In 1994 the group had a production and development deal with Andy Kravitz of Ruffhouse Records. [...] The production deal did not go anywhere, but IAMISEE was introduced to and worked with such Ruffhouse Artists as Scott Storch, while Storch was working with The Roots on Do <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>More?!!!??!,</b> and Chuck Treece. He loosely collaborated with artists from the label, but work was released only independently and possible commercial releases may not have been credited (see Controversy). [...] By the late nineties Divine & Grace split up, Ruffhouse was defunct and most of the artists IAMISEE was affiliated with moved to Sigma Sound Studios. [...] In 1998 the artist changed his name to IAMISEE (see Meaning of the Name). [...] After going solo he had minor deals with small independent labels. One EP and one LP were released and another album was permanently shelved before the artist began an independent solo career in 2006. [...] Despite his past affiliations with artists who went on to achieve commercial success, IAMISEE's career took a different route. [...] He did maintain working relationships with established artists, including Chuck Treece [...] and Grammy award winning writer Kameron Houff (see Discography), but to date has never signed a recording contract with a Major Recording Label and has no known affiliation to an Agent or Manager. He did become self-taught in various aspects of record production, such as; mixing, graphic design, website development and video editing. [...] IAMSEE's most notable work began after becoming an independent artist.|$|E

They state [...] "From the tones, the rhythms, the vocal delivery, it’s all there, if it’s {{been in a}} Chevelle song, any Chevelle song, it somehow got crammed into here, with a few minor, minor twists. Yet still sounds fresh and invigorating." [...] They conclude that the track leaves <b>you</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>more.</b>|$|R
