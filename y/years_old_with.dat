5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{about one}} percent of the total {{vegetation}} in the park consisted of grasses, bracken, thistle, and fireweed in sections of the forest cleared two to five years earlier.

Forest areas 10 to 30years old that contained tall alder and maple trees and smaller conifers accounted for about 20percent of the park.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{had planned}} {{for a college}} of a Principal and sixty {{bachelor}} fellows; however, Sutton lowered this to only twelve.

He was entitled to take up ecclesiastic office or duties that did not interfere overly with his job as principal; the fellows were required to be resident for ten months of each year. Entrants to the college would have been only 11 or 12 <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> an intake both from those whose income was very low, alongside those from gentlemanly backgrounds. Fellows had a high degree of autonomy, but received only board and lodging as reward.|$|E

5|$|The {{dusky shark}} {{is one of}} the most sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked, the skin is made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 tons per year. The fishery utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> 1828% of all newborns captured in their first year. Demographic models suggest that the fishery is sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E
5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million {{years ago with the}} eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large shield volcano. The second stage began 7.1million years ago to form a complex stratovolcano located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might have occurred in the last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history of Level Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity.|$|E
5|$|After {{the winter}} campaign, Schérer placed the {{divisions}} in the positions where they would start the 1796 campaign. From right to left, they were Masséna with two divisions on the coast, Augereau on the Bormida River, Sérurier on the Tanaro, Macquard at the Col de Tende and Garnier on the far left. On 27 March 1796 Bonaparte arrived to take command of the Army of Italy. At this date Sérurier was 53 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>with</b> 40 years of military service. He applied to retire on a pension due to his age, health and wounds, but after meeting Bonaparte he decided to stay. Masséna later wrote that Bonaparte did not impress his generals at first. Then the new commander put on his hat and sharply questioned them; the generals went away believing {{that they had a}} true leader at last. Bonaparte's plan was to mass over 20,000 men under Masséna and Augereau near Carcare where the Austrian and Sardinian armies linked. Sérurier's division would join the others near Ceva as they moved west. His 9,448-strong division consisted of the 39th, 69th and 85th Line Infantry Demi-brigades.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H. Bánáthy, Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council, {{formulated}} {{the idea}} of an experimental leadership training program. He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which Bela had attended when he was 14 <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> <b>With</b> the active interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the National Council, observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed with what he witnessed, he recommended that the national office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1846, almost 500 wagons headed west from Independence. At {{the rear of the}} train, a group of nine wagons {{containing}} 32members of the Reed and Donner families and their employees left on May12. George Donner, born in North Carolina, had gradually moved west to Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois, with a one-year sojourn to Texas. In early 1846, he was about 60 <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> <b>With</b> him were his 44-year-old wife Tamsen and their three daughters Frances (6), Georgia (4), and Eliza (3), and George's daughters from a previous marriage: Elitha (14) and Leanna (12). George's younger brother Jacob (56) also joined the party with his wife Elizabeth (45), teenaged stepsons Solomon Hook (14) and William Hook (12), and five children: George (9), Mary (7), Isaac (6), Lewis (4), and Samuel (1). Also traveling with the Donner brothers were teamsters Hiram O. Miller (29), Samuel Shoemaker (25), Noah James (16), Charles Burger (30), John Denton (28), and Augustus Spitzer (30).|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a {{football}} tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles. Before {{the inception of the}} World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup. Originally, the event was for amateurs only. As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players. FIFA still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and CONCACAF to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting UEFA and CONMEBOL teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since 1992 male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since 1996, players under 23 <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.|$|E
