500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Proposition 8 on California's November 2008 ballot that would ban same-sex marriage in California, Connerly stated, [...] "For anyone {{to say that}} this is an issue for people who are gay and that this isn't about civil rights is sadly mistaken. If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in freedom and limited government, to be intellectually consistent and honest you have to oppose efforts of the majority to impose their will on people." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-summer, MacDonell {{personally}} visited Shahumyan's home in Baku {{and the two}} {{discussed the}} issue of British military involvement in a generally amiable conversation. Shahumyan first raised the specter of what British involvement would entail: [...] "Is your General Dunsterville [...] coming to Baku to turn us out?" [...] MacDonell reassured him that Dunsterville, {{being a member of}} the military, was not claiming any political stake in the conflict but was merely interested in helping him defend the city. Unconvinced, Shahumyan replied, [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that a British general and a Bolshevik commissar would make good partners....No! We will organise our own force to fight the Turk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O grandpapa, {{that is not}} fair! Indeed, <b>you</b> don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that. O, say you don't!" [...] And Beatrice's {{black eyes}} were full of tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{say that}} again," [...] {{interrupted}} North, [...] "unless you've actually {{got a job}} as General Passenger Agent of the Subway. <b>You</b> can't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could go}} out with <b>you.</b> I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> I could make some money, {{bringing}} in pelts,--more money than I can make by staying here." ...|$|R
2500|$|Miracles {{happen when}} <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in them. And {{if you do}} all you can to make them happen. Benedict knows that his mom could not have {{disappeared}} forever {{when she went to}} swim in the sea. He believes that she is still alive and one day she will return. The weeks and months can pass, there can be a bunch of doubters around him and even grandma can make arrangements to bring a new mommy to Dad, but Benedict knows that Mom is alive! Maybe the UFOs took her. Maybe Mickey the monkey from the fairy tale picked her up [...] will bring her back in his boat. Maybe smugglers picked her up in that sudden sea storm on that fateful day, took her far away, beyond the seven seas, but one day, someone {{picks up the phone and}} calls a number at home… ...|$|E
2500|$|Quayle faced {{off against}} Gore and Stockdale in {{the vice presidential}} debate on October 13, 1992. Quayle {{attempted}} to avoid the one-sided outcome of his debate with Lloyd Bentsen four years earlier by staying on the offensive. Quayle criticized Gore's book Earth in the Balance with specific page references, though his claims were subsequently criticized by the liberal group FAIR for inaccuracy. Quayle's closing argument sharply asked voters, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> Bill Clinton will tell the truth?" [...] and [...] "Do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?", whereas Gore and Stockdale talked more about the policies and philosophies they espoused. Republican loyalists were largely relieved and pleased with Quayle's performance, and the Vice President's camp attempted to portray it as an upset triumph against a veteran debater. However, post-debate polls were mixed on whether Gore, Stockdale or Quayle had won. It ultimately {{proved to be a}} minor factor in the election, which Bush and Quayle subsequently lost.|$|E
6000|$|JULIA (doubtfully). Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that I {{am not the}} shallow, jealous, devilish {{tempered}} creature {{they all}} pretend I am? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told you}} the truth," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Playmore, [...] "because he was cunning enough {{to see that the}} truth would help him in irritating your suspicions. <b>You</b> don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that he shared your suspicions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, Miss Dacre, <b>you</b> cannot indeed <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{that this}} vulgar ruffian, this grim scarecrow, this Guy Faux, was--was--myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope what I may say {{need not}} be kept a secret long. You joke with me about Miss Baker; but <b>you</b> cannot <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that my {{affections}} are placed there? You must, I think, have guessed by this time--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are an {{even greater}} pessimist than I myself," [...] Norgate observed. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that the {{position}} is so critical?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it, Lottie?" [...] Mrs. Kenton entreated, with {{a sudden}} {{tenderness}} for her younger daughter such as she did not always feel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Worthless!" [...] she repeated. [...] "I don't {{understand}} it, father. Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that Mr. Thain {{would do}} you an ill turn like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Halsey," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am going}} out to lunch. At least, I wish it to be thought that I am {{going out to}} lunch. As a matter of fact, I shall return in about ten minutes by the back way. I do not wish you, however, to know this. I {{want you to have}} it in your mind that I have gone to lunch and shall not be back until a quarter past two. If there are {{visitors}} for me--Inquirers of any sort--act exactly as you would have done if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> that I was not in the building." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please listen," [...] he begged. [...] "I {{am afraid}} that your father must be in a tearing rage by now, but it can't be helped. He is out there and he hasn't got an earthly chance of getting back until I give the word. We've got {{plenty of time to}} reach Nice before he can land. I just want you to realise, Fedora, that you are your own mistress. You can make or spoil your own life. No one else has any right to interfere. Have you ever seen any one yet, back in your own country, amongst your own people, whom <b>you</b> <b>really</b> felt that <b>you</b> cared for--who <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> would be willing to lay down his life to make you happy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, the {{annoying}} quality in YOU, is,' {{said the old}} man, 'that you never have a confederate or partner in YOUR juggling; you would deceive everybody, even those who practise the same art; and have a way with you, as if you--he, he, he!--as if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> yourself. I'd lay a handsome wager now,' said the old man, 'if I laid wagers, which I don't and never did, that you keep up appearances by a tacit understanding, even before your own daughters here. Now I, when I have a business scheme in hand, tell Jonas what it is, and we discuss it openly. You're not offended, Pecksniff?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] roared McArdle. [...] "You don't {{mean to say}} <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{this stuff}} of his about mammoths and mastodons and great sea sairpents?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe,</b> mother, {{that every}} one who is born into the world is sent for a purpose, and with a {{specific}} work to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{yourself}} for instance?" [...] Isabel suggested jocosely. And then, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it will ruin me?" [...] she asked in quite another tone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see {{the whole}} {{question}} turns on your Protestant deification of the intellect. [...] . If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed,</b> as <b>you</b> all say you do, {{that the nature of}} man, and therefore his intellect among the rest, was utterly corrupt, you would not be so superstitiously careful to tell the truth [...] . as you call it; because you would know that man's heart, if not his head, would needs turn the truth into a lie by its own corruption. [...] . The proper use of reasoning is to produce opinion,--and if the subject in which you wish to produce the opinion is diseased, you must adapt the medicine accordingly.' ...|$|R
60|$|You {{must believe}} this much about yourselves {{before you can}} believe more. You must fairly and <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that GOD made you one thing before you can believe that you have made yourselves another thing. <b>You</b> must <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>you</b> are not mere {{machines}} and animals, but immortal souls, before <b>you</b> can <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>you</b> have sinned; for animals cannot sin--only reasonable souls can sin. We must <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that God made us at bottom in His likeness, before {{we can begin to}} find out that there is another likeness in us besides God's--a selfish, brutish, too often a devilish likeness, which must be repented of, and fought against, and cast out, that God's likeness in us may get the upper hand, and we may be what God expects us to be. We must know our dignity before we can feel our shame. We must see how high {{we have a right to}} stand, that we may see how low, alas! we have fallen.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was {{a curious}} speech that Voalavo {{made to the}} crocodile, Ravonino," [...] said Mark. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think he <b>believed</b> it did any good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{the affair}} {{to have been}} {{carrying}} on with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that?" [...] Agatha asked, {{with a hint}} of mockery in her voice. [...] "Do {{you imagine}} I have been {{thinking}} about the money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell me <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in such things. Professor Boyden {{says they}} are all {{a part of the}} spineless mysticism which is {{sweeping}} over the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. 'You {{are very}} clever, Alice, but do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think I <b>believe</b> {{that this is}} no shock to you? Oh, woman, why has this {{deception}} not struck you to the ground?' ...|$|R
500|$|Yiftach Klein {{was cast}} to act {{alongside}} her as Yochay Goldberg. Burshtein remarked that Klein [...] "is {{a big star}} in Israel, and has played a pimp, a homosexual, and a cop (among many other roles), so I was not sure <b>you</b> could <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> him as this Orthodox guy. But his audition, and then his chemistry with Hadas were just perfect".|$|R
6000|$|... "He talks {{as if it}} were a real thing!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "George, <b>you</b> don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>you</b> saw {{somebody}} in the summer-house? The place was empty. I tell you positively, when you pointed into the summer-house, the place was empty. You have been thinking and thinking of this woman till you persuade yourself that you have actually seen her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What DID {{you mean}} by all that about walking trees?" [...] she asked. [...] "Don't tell me <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in a magic tree that eats birds!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in all {{the stories}} we {{have heard of the}} blood-thirstiness of these savages, and their taste for human flesh?" [...] asked Will, with some anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|Britt, {{looking into}} her clear eyes, {{acquired}} a new confidence in her. [...] "Tell me, Miss Lambert, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{that your father}} comes to you in this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've a great mind not to pass them," [...] said Jenny. [...] "Are you {{in earnest}} {{in what you}} are saying, or are you only saying it for sensation? How can people believe such things and be comfortable? I could not. If I {{believed}} all you have been saying I could not sleep nights,--I should be perfectly miserable; and <b>you</b> cannot <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> all this, or you would be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dying! my dear wife; {{not a bit}} of it. I am no more dying {{than you}} are. I have been ill, it is true, but that is only because you have fretted me so. The dying was only a little ruse to get your consent. All is fair in love and war, you know; and of course <b>you</b> never <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> in that {{precious}} agreement. That {{was nothing but a}} bit of maidenly shyness, eh?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "All {{the songs}} on the record revolve around the theme of belief in oneself and in humanity's potential[...] [...] And the right-wing {{reactions}} of religious leaders {{of the world to}} the events of 9/11 {{had a lot to do}} with the original impetus of where this record came from. It angered me beyond any way I could possibly explain. The whole album's about questioning your beliefs to determine what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> can <b>believe</b> in." ...|$|R
