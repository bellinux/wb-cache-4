500|$|Another {{element of}} game {{mechanics}} which received significant criticism was the game's handling of space flight. Paragon's attempt to simulate realistic space physics, including planetary gravitational fields and spaceship inertia, {{is a potential}} source of difficulty for some players. According to Paul Presley, the Asteroids inspired type of [...] "control method becomes very awkward until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> (and that could take some time)." ...|$|E
500|$|The title's {{controls}} and overall gameplay {{were not as}} well-received, with certain critics questioning their accuracy and depth. MacDonald finished every level in first place within one hour using {{only one of the}} four initial characters. While the game also features a hard mode, MacDonald concluded that [...] "Sonic R has more in the personality department than in the depth department". MacDonald and Reiner cited finding the Chaos Emeralds and hidden coins as [...] "difficult", but MacDonald argued that such optional tasks offered little in return, because the hidden characters [...] "are mostly robot versions of the already playable ones". Moreover, Sackenheim noted that the game's controls initially [...] "take some practice to get used to", but added: [...] "Start sliding around corners and letting off the gas at the right times and you'll be finding all of the secrets that Sonic R conceals in no time". Likewise, Nutter called the controls [...] "initially tricky... but incredibly playable," [...] Next Generation stated [...] "the proper techniques, with time, can be learned," [...] and John concluded [...] "once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> you'll find a real solid game". The latter reviewer thought the game played better with the digital pad as opposed to Sega's analogue controller. Dan Elektro agreed that the controls were [...] "responsive", but [...] "to a fault": [...] "At high speeds, it's nearly impossible to run in a straight line".|$|E
6000|$|The grey girl smiled. [...] "It {{is rather}} awful sometimes. I've {{been at it}} six months now. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I've had all the worst things said to me by now, I should think." ...|$|E

60|$|MURRAY (after {{watching}} {{her for a}} moment--in an embarrassed tone of sympathy). Come on, Miss Carmody, that'll never do. I know it's hard at first--but--getting yourself all worked up is bad for you. You'll run a temperature and then they'll keep you in bed--which isn't pleasant. Take hold of yourself! It isn't so bad up here--really--once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it!</b> (The shame she feels at giving way {{in the presence of}} a stranger only adds to her loss of control and she sobs heartbrokenly.

60|$|I {{have invented}} {{a good many}} useful things in my time, but never {{anything}} better than that of getting money out of people who don't want to part with it. It is always for good objects, of course. This is the plan: When you call upon a person {{to contribute to a}} great and good object, and you think he should furnish about $1,000, he disappoints you as like as not. Much the best way to work him to supply that thousand dollars is to split it into parts and contribute, say a hundred dollars a year, or fifty, or whatever the sum maybe. Let him contribute ten or twenty a year. He doesn't feel that, but he does feel it when you call upon him to contribute a large amount. When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> you would rather contribute than borrow money.|$|E

[...] "He lay there in the house-place at her mother's, and five or six {{other people in the}} house, and died very gradually. I asked her if his death wasn't a great trouble to her. 'Well,' she said, 'he was very fretful towards the last, never satisfied, never easy, always fret-fretting, an' never knowing what would satisfy him. So in one way it was a relief when it was over--for him and for everybody.' They had only been married two years, and she has one boy. I asked her if she hadn't been very happy. 'Oh, yes, sir, we was very comfortable at first, till he took bad--oh, we was very comfortable--oh, yes--but, you see, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I've had my father and two brothers go off just the same. You get used to it'." ...|$|E
60|$|This Noah's Ark {{arrangement}} it is, I suppose, {{that gives}} to the Black Forest home its distinctive scent. It {{is not a}} scent you can liken to any one thing. It is as if you took roses and Limburger cheese and hair oil, some heather and onions, peaches and soapsuds, together {{with a dash of}} sea air and a corpse, and mixed them up together. You cannot define any particular odour, but you feel they are all there--all the odours that the world has yet discovered. People who live in these houses are fond of this mixture. They do not open the window and lose any of it; they keep it carefully bottled up. If you want any other scent, you can go outside and smell the wood violets and the pines; inside there is the house; and after a while, I am told, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> so that you miss it, and are unable to go to sleep in any other atmosphere.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I don’t suppose you’ll {{mind the}} {{seasickness}} after <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it," [...] said the considerate Mr. Chalk, [...] "and the storms, and the cyclones, and fogs, and collisions, {{and all that}} sort of thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Generally. Wages run high in this country. But I have to ship {{a man or}} two {{when any}} of the city people charter her. She's {{not so much of}} a handful when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'A little tired, eh, friend Wingfield?' he said sneering. 'Well, {{the play}} is rough till <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> A night's sleep will refresh you, and to-morrow {{you will be a}} new man. Perhaps you believe that I have done my worst. Fool, this is but a beginning. Also you think doubtless that your obstinacy angers me? Wrong again, my friend, I only pray that you may keep your lips sealed to the last. Gladly would I give my share of this hidden gold in payment for two more such days with you. I have still much to pay you back, and look you, I {{have found a way to}} do it. There are more ways of hurting a man than through his own flesh--for instance, when I wished to be revenged upon your father, I struck him through her whom he loved. Now I have touched you and you wonder what I mean. Well, I will tell you. Perhaps you may know an Aztec lady of royal blood who is named Otomie?' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was glad}} of her company for more reasons than she knew of. For one, she {{protected}} me against my baser self. With her beside me I {{should not have}} dared to flee from sudden foes. Indeed, together we courted adventure; for once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> this standing hazard of attack adds a charm to outdoor exercise that older folk in districts better policed enjoy not. So possibly my dog feels when together we take the air. To me {{it is a simple}} walk, maybe a little tiresome, suggested rather by contemplation of my waistband than by desire for walking for mere walking's sake; to him an expedition full of danger and surprises: [...] "The gentleman asleep with one eye open on The Chequer's doorstep! will he greet me with a friendly sniff or try to bite my head off? This cross-eyed, lop-eared loafer, lurching against the lamp-post! shall we pass with a careless wag and a 'how-do,' or become locked in a life and death struggle? Impossible to say. This coming corner, now, 'Ware! Is anybody waiting round there to kill me, or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it is. There's {{nothing wrong}} with most of them. As a general thing, they are very decent fellows--extraordinarily decent {{if you think of}} the {{position}} they are in. I don't say that in a business way there's much they won't try to put over on you. In the theatre, when it comes to business, everything goes except biting and gouging. 'There's never a law of God or man runs north of fifty-three.' If you alter that to 'north of Forty-first Street' it doesn't scan as well, but it's just as true. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the Golden Rule is suspended there. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> after you have been in the theatre for a while, and, except for leaving your watch and pocket-book at home when you have to pay a call on a manager and keeping your face to him so that he can't get away with your back collar-stud, you don't take any notice of it. It's all a game. If a manager swindles you, he wins the hole and takes the honour. If you foil him, you are one up. In either case, it makes no difference to the pleasantness of your relations. You go on calling him by his first name, and he gives you a couple of cigars out of his waistcoat pocket and says you're a good kid. There is nothing personal in it. He has probably done his best friend out of a few thousand dollars the same morning, and you see them lunching together after the ceremony as happily as possible. You've got to make allowances for managers. They are the victims of heredity. When a burglar marries a hat-check girl, their offspring goes into the theatrical business automatically, and he can't shake off the early teaching which he imbibed at his father's knee. But morals...." ...|$|E
