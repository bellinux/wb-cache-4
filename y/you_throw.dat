The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

500|$|Since Doofenshmirtz and Perry's actions tend {{to affect}} {{those of the}} boys, the choice to have future Candace's {{interference}} in the past greatly affect those of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's was considered the logical choice.

[...] The song Doofenshmirtz sings, entitled [...] "It's Been a Charmed Life," [...] was well-praised by the production crew, who {{felt that it was}} considerably well-handled. The song centralized the irony surrounding Doofenshmirtz having everything go well for him, a theme completely different from that which is generally touched upon in the series.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Noodle {{was played}} by Broadway actor Bill Irwin, who had {{previously}} worked with Sherman in short films for Sesame Street.

[...] As of January 2017, Daveed Diggs and comedian Daniel Koren, have played two more of Mr. Noodle's brothers. [...] According to Freudberg, [...] "Mr. Noodle, who never speaks, is all about trial and error. When <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> him a hat, he acts like he's never seen one before.

The chorus hook will stay in your brain for days at a time, ... and when <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> in the band's newfound embracing of electronics, you find yourself with what will ideally be one of the biggest hits of 2013." [...] Maura Johnston from Popdust gave the song a 5 out of 5, declaring [...] "If there’s any justice in the world this’ll be a song of the summer, or at least of the late spring". Joseph R.

500|$|Howard {{originally}} envisioned Maximus as the [...] "ultimate super-cop", jokingly {{referring to}} the character as [...] "the Tommy Lee Jones of horses". Attempting to make Maximus feel like a [...] "fresh" [...] character, the filmmakers researched several historical horses from both animated and live-action films {{to ensure that the}} character would be unique and different enough from his predecessors. Greno explained that [...] "Maximus ... could have easily slipped into the category of, 'Oh, I've seen that before.'" [...] To prevent this, the filmmakers referenced [...] "a board with photos of all the different animated horses that had been done". Howard explained that Maximus was originally conceived as a [...] "pretty serious" [...] character, but eventually developed into a funnier and more likeable horse as the animators continued to draw him with dog-like attributes. Both Pascal and Maximus, who according to the Austin American-Statesman are responsible for providing the film with the majority of its comic relief, were eventually written into the film by screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Analyzing the characters' roles in the film, HitFix observed that [...] "There's a simplicity to it all that I admire, and <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> in a few anthropomorphized animals so everyone laughs a lot, and that's the Disney recipe".

500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: [...] "I {{think it is important}} for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> it and kick it and run with it and put it in your hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport." [...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's main problem is [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a [...] "boring game".|$|E

500|$|The four collaborated {{to write}} {{numerous}} [...] "minutes of gameplay" [...] documents, which conveyed how the game would feel. Church later gave the example, [...] "You {{hear the sound}} of a security camera swiveling, and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target, so you duck behind the crate and then you hear the door open so <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> a grenade and run out of the way". The documents would [...] "hint" [...] at the gameplay systems involved, and at the emergent possibilities in each situation. Although Neurath was involved in these initial design sessions, he believed that the project [...] "was always Doug Church's vision at heart". Church and Grossman refined several of the team's documents and defined the game's design and direction, and Grossman wrote the game's original design document. Grossman built on ideas that he first explored while writing and designing Ultima Underworld IIs tomb dimension, which he later called a [...] "mini-prototype" [...] for System Shock. These concepts included the minimization of dialogue trees and a greater focus on exploration. The team believed that dialogue trees [...] "broke the fiction" [...] of games; Church later commented that the dialogue trees in the Ultima Underworld series were like separate games in themselves, disconnected from main experience of being immersed in the environment. There were also concerns about realism.|$|E

Robert was inspired by the 1960s rock groups, The Zombies and The Animals, and who had been picturing [...] "a '60s go-go beat and a girl in a miniskirt" [...] before Weiland changed the song's meaning with his lyrics. Dean commented on how Weiland had turned [...] "Between the Lines" [...] into a love song: [...] "Sometimes we don't feel musically what Scott does lyrically. He took it to an exciting place. It's pretty twisted." [...] Weiland's lyrics reflected on his relationship with his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, and his history with drug abuse. Speaking of the at-times strange lyrics, Weiland cited The Beatles' [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] as an inspiration. [...] "Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> together random words that phonetically sound good with the melody and then you get to the meat of the song in the chorus." [...] "Between the Lines" [...] was originally the working title of the song, which Weiland incorporated into his lyrics.|$|E

Usher outlines lifestyle changes since his wife's arrival and turns away from his days as [...] "a hustler and a player" [...] in [...] "Before I Met You", which makes use of guitar and heavy drums. He is suspected of infidelity and compared to his girlfriend's cheating ex-partner on [...] "His Mistakes".

[...] "What's a Man to Do" [...] opens with a Native Indian call, while [...] "Lifetime" [...] contains influences of 1990s R [...] "Love in This Club Part II" [...] features vocals from Beyoncé Knowles and Lil Wayne and samples The Stylistics' [...] "You Are Everything" [...] (1971); its lyrical content {{is similar to that of}} Part I, and Wayne's voice is modified through the use of a vocoder. The album's soul and pop jazz-derived title track, [...] "Here I Stand", drew comparisons to Stevie Wonder. With a theme of commitment, it was played at Usher's and Foster's wedding. Here I Stand closes with [...] "Will Work for Love", although it was placed as a hidden track on some copies; Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called it [...] "cute".|$|E

I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} January 2016, {{the film}} was {{projected}} to earn $55-60 million over its opening weekend in the United States and Canada. Fox's rivals projected the film to earn closer to $80 million. It ultimately opened at No. 1, making $132.4 million for the weekend, and $152.2 million over the long Presidents' Day weekend. Trying to explain this surprise, Fox's domestic distribution chief Chris Aronson said [...] "it’s hard to comp and predict. You’re doing something that’s never been done. It’s like <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> the rulebook out the window." [...] The weekend included $12.7 million from preview showings on February 11, $47.5 million on its opening day, $42.5 million on February 12, and $42.6 million on February 13, as well as $19.8 on February 14 to end the long weekend. These were all records for R-rated films and days in February. Additionally, $16.8 million of this came from IMAX screens, a record opening weekend for R-rated films and February releases in that format. Deadpool gained an additional $55 million in its second weekend, down over 50% from its first weekend. This kept it at No. 1, and made it the fastest R-rated film to cross $200 million, doing so in nine days. It became the highest grossing X-Men film and R-rated comic book superhero film the next day. It remained in the No. 1 position for its third week, but fell behind Zootopia and London Has Fallen the next week. Deadpools domestic run ended on June 17, after 126 days, with $363.1 million. This was shortly after it became the highest grossing R-rated film worldwide. The film's U.S. audience, across its whole run, was 59% Caucasian, 21% Hispanic, 12% African-American, and 8% Asian. It was also 62% male, and had {{an average age of}} 35.|$|E
