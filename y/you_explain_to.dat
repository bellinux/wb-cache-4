While there in 2007, she shot a cameo appearance in his film Shirin (2008) which he was shooting at the time. Binoche's visit proved controversial when two Iranian MPs raised the matter in parliament, advising more caution be exercised in granting visas to foreign celebrities which might lead to [...] "cultural destruction". In June 2009 Binoche began work on Certified Copy directed by Kiarostami. The film was an Official Selection in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche won the Best Actress Award at the festival for her performance. The film went on general release in France on 19 May 2010 to very positive reviews. Her win at the 2010 Cannes Film festival makes Binoche the first actress to win the European [...] "best actress triple crown": Best Actress at Venice for Three Colors: Blue, Best Actress at Berlin for The English Patient and Best Actress at Cannes for Certified Copy. The September 2010 UK release of the film was overshadowed when French actor Gérard Depardieu made disparaging comments about Binoche to the Austrian magazine Profil, [...] "Please can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me what the mystery of Juliette Binoche is meant to be?" [...] he said. [...] "I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing". In response, while promoting Certified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazine Empire saying, [...] "I don't know him. I understand you don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence ... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem." [...] Certified Copy proved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, [...] "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire {{there will not be a}} general screening." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE INCA [sighing]. Ah well! What can one expect? I don't think I need trouble her personally. Will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> {{her about}} the boys? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet, knowing this, {{you had the}} hardihood to disobey my orders. Since the army's {{place is}} on the other side, will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me how it is to get there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have <b>you</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> the {{lieutenant}} {{the circumstances under}} which he is summoned to the Emperor's presence?' he asked, in his dry, creaking voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} nothing of the sort," [...] said Mrs. Porter. [...] "You have {{wrenched}} your knee very slightly. Have <b>you</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> the policeman that it was entirely your fault?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{regard the}} {{question}} as an impertinent one. I have even mastered geography; the meaning of which word you may remember, <b>you</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> me; and I have a partial knowledge of history." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lydia {{waited a}} moment to recover, settled herself quietly in her chair, and replied, calmly, [...] "I know what you tell me--nothing more. And now, will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me exactly what a prize-fighter is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> {{me the way}} {{you look}} at it? These people don't all seem to be dishonest men or charlatans. Some of them, I know, are honest." [...] And her colour rose again.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by that? Why don't <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me? As long as you are so strange, so mysterious, how can I trust you? You ask me to run off with you, yet you don't put {{confidence}} in me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly! And now, mademoiselle, {{it will be}} a good {{exercise}} for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me in English how such a result was produced by such means." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will tell}} you what it is. I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me why <b>you</b> won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{were better}} I did," [...] said Sir Duncan; [...] "yet I {{can write to}} the Marquis, and follow on the {{subsequent}} day.--Captain Dalgetty, I will dispatch a letter for <b>you,</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> the Marquis of Argyle your character and commission, with which you will please to prepare to travel to Inverary early to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{shall be}} glad to see her," [...] said the Altrurian, [...] "and to tell her {{everything}} I can. But won't <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me first something about your deserted farms here? It's quite a new thing to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ask you to}} {{consider}} the suspicions which would be excited by such a course," [...] Dominey pleaded earnestly, [...] "and further, can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me in what way I, having already, according to belief of everybody, another wife living, {{can take advantage of}} this mandate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true, sir," [...] said Paul; [...] "but {{here are}} many minds among few men. Nor is this all; agreeably {{to your own}} account, some of these men do not exactly know their own minds. But, can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> us what {{essential}} points are involved in all these shades of opinion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{like them}} all," [...] wailed the sub-editor. [...] "They can't argue; when <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> things <b>to</b> them, they go out. It does make me so mad!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Duchess," [...] he {{promptly}} asked, [...] "do <b>you</b> mind <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> me {{an opinion}} I've just heard of your--with marked originality--holding?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>you</b> would <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the {{conductor}} about our tickets," [...] he said. [...] "He is very stupid, and I cannot make him understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR PEARCE [warmly]. It is the quarrel {{of every}} honest man and true patriot, O'Flaherty. Your mother must {{see that as}} clearly as I do. After all, she is a reasonable, well {{disposed}} woman, quite capable of understanding {{the right and the}} wrong of the war. Why can't <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> her what the war is about? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allow me to {{interrupt}} you for one moment, Smith," [...] said the old gentleman, who had been listening attentively to my words. [...] "We understood what you said so well on this occasion that it seems a pity you should suddenly again render yourself unintelligible. Can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> us {{what you mean by}} dressing in accordance with the fashion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A very noble sentiment, I dare say, Rocco, but I can't echo it. Granting {{that you}} care nothing for money, will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> {{me why you}} are so anxious that Maddalena should marry Fabio? She has had offers from poorer men--you knew of them--but you have never taken the least {{interest}} in her accepting or rejecting a proposal before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] {{answered}} the porter, [...] "these gentlemen entreat <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> them why <b>you</b> should first whip {{the dogs and}} then cry over them, and also how it happens that the fainting lady is covered with scars. They have requested me, Madam, to be their mouthpiece." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you will, lad, as <b>you</b> will. <b>Explain</b> <b>to</b> Colonel Ethan Allen {{what has}} {{happened}} here and let him say how these venomous snakes are to be treated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{sounds very}} interesting," [...] she {{answered}} coolly. [...] "Perhaps I should better {{be able to}} understand its significance if <b>you</b> would <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me who Mr. Montague Hill is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are very}} harmless," [...] Mr. Sabin {{continued}} calmly. [...] "The {{first is that}} in a friendly way, and of course under the inviolable law of secrecy, <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me for what part Lucille is cast in this little comedy; the next that I be allowed to see her at reasonable intervals, and finally that she is known by her rightful name as Duchesse de Souspennier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it ever {{occur to}} you that going on at that rate you may very soon lose all the fortune that will ever come to you? You were not yet of age and you lost three {{thousand}} four hundred pounds at cards to a man whom you probably knew to be a professed gambler!" [...] The Duke seemed {{to wait for a}} reply, but poor Gerald had not a word to say. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me what benefit you proposed to yourself when you played for such stakes as that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So clear out," [...] he says; [...] "and you {{can tell}} Mr. Foster {{whatever}} you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your nigger--some idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus, maybe he'll believe you when <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> him what the idea was for getting 'em out. Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don't work your jaw any BETWEEN here and there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very grateful, but I {{cannot be}} there. I must trust {{to one of}} <b>you</b> gentlemen <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the electors that in my present {{condition}} I am unable to visit the borough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Dave, will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> me?" [...] said a {{voice from}} a corner. The question came from Chip Macklin, Gus Plum's former toady. The small boy was working over a sheet of algebra sums.|$|R
6000|$|... "All that <b>you</b> have <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] I said, [...] "I {{understand}} perfectly. But I own I am puzzled on one point, {{which you}} have not made clear to me yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is another}} of our great secrets," [...] she went on archly, [...] "and no one must know of it but my {{secretary}} and me. Sir Thomas would make the saddest disturbance; and if you only knew how weary I am of these scenes! O Harry, Harry, can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me what makes you men so violent and unjust? But, indeed, I know you cannot; {{you are the only}} man in the world who knows nothing of these shameful passions; you are so good, Harry, and so kind; you, at least, can be a woman's friend; and, do you know? I think you make the others more ugly by comparison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{must be the}} man, then," [...] {{the leader}} said. [...] "The letter is written carefully, {{apparently}} {{with a view to}} avoid any suspicion, should it be opened and read by any but him for whom it is intended; but in fact it contains assurances couched in language which I understand, that the bearers are enemies of Russia and friends of Poland, and that every confidence may be placed in them. Now, sirs, will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me how you, who speak no Polish come {{to be in the middle}} of the forest, dressed as Polish, peasants, and the bearers of a letter such as this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{not that}} the Harris {{children}} have the faintest notion of avoiding blame at the expense of a friend and comrade. One and all they are honesty itself in accepting responsibility for their own misdeeds. It simply is, that is how the thing presents itself to their understanding. When <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> them that you had no original intention of getting up at five o'clock in the morning to play cricket on the croquet lawn, or to mimic the history of the early Church by shooting with a cross-bow at dolls tied to a tree; that as a matter of fact, left to your own initiative, you would have slept peacefully till roused in Christian fashion with a cup of tea at eight, they are firstly astonished, secondly apologetic, and thirdly sincerely contrite. In the present instance, waiving the purely academic question whether the awakening of George at a little before five was due to natural instinct on his part, or to the accidental passing of a home-made boomerang through his bedroom window, the dear children frankly admitted that the blame for his uprising was their own. As the eldest boy said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mental terrors, sir! I wish I {{could believe}} {{them to be}} only such: I wish it more now than ever; since even <b>you</b> cannot <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> me the mystery of that awful visitant." ...|$|R
6000|$|ERNEST. In {{that case}} I {{certainly}} won't {{tell you whether}} I agree with you or not. But I will put another question. <b>You</b> have <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> me that criticism is a creative art. What future has it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Try? We'll do it! Now, Betts, <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> it <b>to</b> both. <b>You</b> {{can do it}} {{smoother}} than I, {{and telling}} them is really the finest point of our little plot. I'll help the good work along afterwards. He'll be out presently. Nail him at once." ...|$|R
