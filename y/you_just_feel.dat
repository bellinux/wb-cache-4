I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

Beyoncé's rendition was included on the 2007 deluxe edition of her second studio album, B'Day. Beyoncé contributed to the writing and production processes, {{and it was one}} of the last tracks to be added to the album. She called the song [...] "a beautiful ballad" [...] and said, [...] "I've always loved [...] It gives you this emotion – I don't care who you are, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> it. And it meant a lot for me to do this." [...] While reviewing the deluxe edition of B'Day, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the song, saying that it [...] "sound downright subtle".|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> that leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a shoot interview, Road Warrior Animal {{was asked}} {{who was the}} toughest wrestler he had ever come across and he said [...] "Haku without a doubt ! <b>You</b> could <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> his strength".|$|R

5000|$|... "You can't {{enjoy what}} he's doing to your {{psychology}} if you're {{so weak that}} you become paranoid, {{and there are people}} who tend to do that. Otherwise, if you had any intellectual integrity at all, <b>you</b> would <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> his love, and you would enjoy it like it was better than a theater performance because it was really live." [...] - Billy Name ...|$|R
500|$|Pre-Madonna {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Mark Egan from Rocky Mountain News writes that [...] "although the songs have soul in them, it's the delivery that lacks in Madonna's voice; <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> {{that something is}} really missing." [...] Mark Zug from Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "the demos on Pre-Madonna are a delight to listen to. To all the Madonna fans, this is one album worth collecting and replaying." [...] Jasmine Temple from Lexington Herald-Leader calls the album, [...] "a gloriously voyeuristic—and unauthorized—glimpse at Madonna's past, the woman she was then. You can actually sense {{the development of the}} icon she is today from the songs." [...] Robin DeRosa from USA Today was disappointed with the release, saying that [...] "it feels forced. This release is as unneeded as the hoopla surrounding Madonna's new born. Every artist has demo recordings in their early phases of career and they are generally not good. This one is not different." [...] After Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, Tony Sclafani from MSNBC noted that none of Madonna's songs were in the rock music genre, [...] "but all use rock as a jumping off point. Audible evidence of Madonna's rock roots {{can be found on the}} collection of early demos Pre-Madonna." ...|$|E
500|$|Pete Schulberg of The Oregonian wrote, [...] "Forget all {{the commotion}} about NYPD Blue. Homicide {{delivers}} without the lewd language and skin shots. It depicts violence {{in a most}} compelling way: You don't see it. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> it." [...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while NYPD Blue is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it took to get you to watch NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are a dear, John," [...] she said, {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "I am terribly divided in my {{thoughts}} about <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> now I <b>feel</b> that I {{have only one}} wish--that I could give you all that you want, all that you deserve!" ...|$|R

60|$|I {{tell you}} we were glad to hear the thud of their hoofs, for we knew that that must stop the cannon {{for a minute and}} give us a chance of hitting back. And we hit back pretty hard too that time, for we were cold and vicious and savage, and I for one felt that I cared no more for the {{horsemen}} than if they had been so many sheep on Corriemuir. One gets past being afraid or thinking of one's own skin after a while, and <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> that you want to make some one pay for all you have gone through. We took our change out of the lancers that time; for they had no breastplates to shield them, and we cleared seventy of them out of their saddles at a volley. Maybe, if we could have seen seventy mothers weeping for their lads, we should not have felt so pleased over it; but then, men are just brutes when they are fighting, and have as much thought as two bull pups when they've got one another by the throttle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. You may persuade {{yourself}} {{for the moment}} that you do, {{but after a while}} you will have to go by the evidence. You won't be able to help yourself. You haven't realized what a crushing thing evidence is. You have to go by it against your will. You see, evidence is the only guide. You don't know that I am speaking the truth; <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> it. You're trusting your heart and not your head. The head must win in the end. You might go on believing for a time, but sooner or later you would be bound to begin to doubt and worry and torment yourself. You couldn't fight against the evidence, when once your instinct--or whatever it is that tells you that I am speaking the truth--had begun to weaken. And it would weaken. Think what {{it would have to be}} fighting all the time. Think of the case your intelligence would be making out, day after day, till it crushed you. It's impossible that you could keep yourself from docketing the evidence and arranging it and absorbing it. Think! Consider what you know are actual facts! Nutty invites you down here, knowing that you are Lord Dawlish. All you know about my attitude towards Lord Dawlish is what I told you on the first morning of your visit. I told you I hated him. Yet, knowing you are Lord Dawlish, I become engaged to you. Directly afterwards you hear Nutty consoling me as if I were marrying you against my will. Isn't that an absolutely fair statement of what has happened? How could you go on believing me with all that against you?' ...|$|E

5000|$|The album's {{title is}} named, after the beach cruiser bicycle. In an {{interview}} Glasses Malone said, [...] "It's called Beach Cruiser, everybody loves a Beach Cruiser.

I've got time to do a bit of meditation, practise some yoga, maybe go for a run. I sleep better and I wake up feeling more energetic." ...|$|E

I was still with Dean at the time, and he heard the song and knew it was about and me before I did." [...] With [...] "Borrowed", Rimes stated, [...] "Obviously, it was a very controversial topic to write about...As hard as it was for me to write the song, I think it painted a true picture of that situation.

5000|$|Rapper Mos Def {{said about}} Muldrow: [...] "She’s incredible. She’s like Flack, Nina Simone, Ella, she’s {{something}} else. She’s like religion. It’s heavy, vibrational music. I’ve {{never heard a}} human being sing like this. Her voice is wildly, finely expressive. It’s so singular. It’s hip-hop, {{the way that she}} approaches it rhythmically, she’s got so many jazz influences. It’s something else and <b>you</b> can <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> it. With Georgia Anne Muldrow Presents Ms. One (SomeOthaShip), she’s like J. Dilla, the legendary producer. She makes her own beats, she rhymes, she sings, and she plays. If people love Amy Winehouse, they’re going to get their minds blown when they hear Georgia Anne Muldrow." ...|$|R
