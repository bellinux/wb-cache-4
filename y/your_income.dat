500|$|Philosophy of {{economics}} is {{the branch of}} philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to economics. It can also {{be defined as the}} branch {{of economics}} which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics. The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods {{rise to the level of}} epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of <b>your</b> <b>income)</b> at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of <b>your</b> <b>income)</b> be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society? ...|$|E
500|$|In Enron's {{natural gas}} business, the {{accounting}} had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying {{the gas and}} actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, citing that it would represent [...] "true economic value." [...] Enron became the first non-financial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract was signed, income is estimated as {{the present value of}} net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate. Due to the large discrepancies of attempting to match profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. While using the method, income from projects could be recorded, although they might not have ever received the money, and in turn increasing financial earnings on the books. However, in future years, the profits could not be included, so new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, [...] "If you accelerate <b>your</b> <b>income,</b> then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income." [...] Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.|$|E

They really didn't like the movie. And they certainly didn't like it at three hours and two minutes." [...] Deeley wasn't surprised by the Universal response: [...] "The Deer Hunter was a United Artists sort of picture, whereas Convoy was more in the style of Universal. I'd muddled and sold the wrong picture to each studio." [...] Deeley did agree with Universal that the film needed to be shorter, not just because of pacing but also to ensure commercial success.
