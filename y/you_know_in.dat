500|$|The {{engineers}} who programmed the Apollo training simulator {{had a difficult}} time keeping the simulator in sync with the continuous changes being made to the spacecraft. According to backup astronaut Walter Cunningham, [...] "We knew that the spacecraft was, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> poor shape relative to what it ought to be. We felt like we could fly it, but let's face it, it just wasn't as good as it should have been for the job of flying the first manned Apollo mission." [...] NASA pressed on, and mid-January 1967, preparations were being made for the final pre-flight tests of Spacecraft 012.|$|E

500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E
500|$|Katy Stevens {{notes that}} the {{dialogue}} in [...] "The Body" [...] was recorded with microphones {{very close to the}} actors, making variations in their voices—cracks, rises, and whispers—more prominent to the audience, to close the distance between the actors and the viewer. Conversely, the scene in which Dawn is told of Joyce's death was shot through a large classroom window, muffling Dawn's emotional reaction, to isolate Buffy and Dawn from the class and the audience. Several moments of silence follow this scene. Whedon shot the conversation up close several times, filming over-the-shoulder and reaction shots, but eventually went with a more distanced point of view. Michelle Trachtenberg later said of this effect, [...] "obviously <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> the end result there was no sound and I thought that was actually one of the most brilliant ideas [...] ever had because it allows everyone to sort of attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life. I think it allowed the audience to really connect with Dawn for the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Ferguson {{confirmed}} that Pogba would feature with the senior team during the season, stating, [...] "I mean if we hold Pogba back, what's going to happen? He's going to leave. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> a couple of years' time when his contract is going to finish. So we have to give him the opportunity to see how he can do in the first-team and he's got great ability." [...] Pogba was promoted to the club's reserve team permanently for the 2011–12 season and made his first appearance of the season on 15 August 2011 in the team's opening Premier Reserve League match against Arsenal. On 25 August, in the team's second league match against Swansea City reserves, Pogba scored the second goal in a 6–0 rout. On 19 September, he was named to the first team to participate in their Football League Cup tie against Leeds United the following day, with Ferguson proclaiming, [...] "I intend to play him [...] against Leeds United." [...] Pogba appeared as a half-time substitute to make his professional debut as Manchester United won the match 3–0. Pogba made his second appearance against Aldershot Town in the Fourth Round of the League Cup on 25 October 2011.|$|E

500|$|Selman {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that the episode praises {{collaborative}} writing, and answers {{the question of}} whether or not writing in a group is as valuable as writing alone. He commented: [...] "I've been with The Simpsons for 15 years and [...] it's been pretty much writing as a team. We’re proud of what we've done even if it's not the traditional idea of one writer sitting down with a passion and a vision. In a strange way this episode ends up as a defense of writing in a group and celebrating the way it makes you feel connected to the work and to the people in that group in ways you didn't expect. It's all about a writers room ... and <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> the story, Homer's cynical heist team does end up being incredibly productive." [...] The episode features several references to literature and parodies several popular young-adult book series, particularly Twilight, a vampire-themed fantasy book series by Stephenie Meyer that has received much popularity. While chasing T. R. Francis through the stadium where the dinosaur show took place, Lisa passes a bathroom in which a group of dinosaurs are smoking in reference to a Far Side comic of dinosaurs smoking. The dinosaur show itself, Sitting with Dinosaurs, is based on the live Walking with Dinosaurs show.|$|E
500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E

2500|$|The album's sexual overtones {{led to its}} {{enthusiastic}} {{acceptance in}} American gay clubs shortly after its release. Bono commented on this phenomenon, saying, [...] "First of all we started out and made Boy, which is a sexual LP, and we changed the cover in America to stop any concern there might be about paedophilia and the like, because it was our first album. But import copies got in and, as <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs {{and so we had}} a gay audience, {{a lot of people who}} were convinced the music was specifically for them. So there was a misconception if you like." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Iranian {{expatriate}} Azar Nafisi {{published the}} memoir Reading Lolita in Tehran about a covert women's reading group. In an NPR interview Nafisi contrasts the sorrowful and seductive sides of Dolores/Lolita's character. She notes [...] "Because {{her name is}} not Lolita, her real name is Dolores which as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> Latin means dolour, so her real name is associated with sorrow and with anguish and with innocence, while Lolita becomes a sort of light-headed, seductive, and airy name. The Lolita of our novel is both of these {{at the same time}} and in our culture here today we only associate it with one aspect of that little girl and the crassest interpretation of her." [...] Following Nafisi's comments, the NPR interviewer, Madeleine Brand, lists as embodiments of the latter side of Lolita, [...] "the Long Island Lolita, Britney Spears, the Olsen twins, and Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita".|$|E

2500|$|Commenting {{on the use}} of the Oslo Session String Quartet, Rygg said, [...] "We {{worked a}} lot with {{simulating}} stringed instruments, so it's always good for us to get some people in and play the real thing. I suppose strings and piano are our instruments of preference; those are the sounds we like to work with. That timbre, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>In</b> terms of writing music — not that we really write music per se, but say we did write music, we'd write it for strings and piano." [...] Adding, [...] "A lot of times when we get musicians into the studio we just get them to play along with preliminary ideas or themes. We can record hours of music and end up using one minute of it. But this time we had the body of the songs before the string quartet came, and we wrote down a part for them. It was a little more disciplined than before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1968 by Ozzy Osbourne (vocals), Tony Iommi (lead guitar), Terence [...] "Geezer" [...] Butler (bass guitar), and Bill Ward (drums). The band has since {{experienced}} multiple lineup changes. Though the second most recent line-up of the band to work together were Ronnie James Dio, Vinny Appice, Iommi, and Butler, for three new songs for a compilation in 2007, the original line-up was still considered the [...] "current" [...] lineup {{at the time and}} had been since their reunion in 1997. The 2007 sessions were deemed a one-off which led to the Heaven and Hell side project, resulting in a new studio album in 2009 entitled The Devil <b>You</b> <b>Know.</b> <b>In</b> June 2013, a partial reformation of the original line-up released 13, which was the first album to feature Osbourne on vocals since 1978's Never Say Die!.

2500|$|In 1989, Swayze said, [...] "I've {{always felt}} there was {{something}} different in there (my personality), but I was scared to look. For I fear I wouldn't find anything. That's the reason I got into Buddhism, took EST training, was into therapy, into Scientology, into Transcendental Meditation. I was trying to support that side of myself. But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> Texas there isn't much support for that part of you." [...] He also had said how he is interested in and loves looking into different [...] belief systems and faith, how it matters to other people, and how these various religious teachings are important to him in his world. He sought treatment for alcoholism by going into rehab in the 1990s. After an initial recovery, he temporarily withdrew from show business, retreating to his ranches in California, and Las Vegas, New Mexico to breed Arabian horses. His best-known horse was Tammen, a chestnut Arabian stallion.|$|E
