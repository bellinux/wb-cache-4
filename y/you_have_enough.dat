25|$|Vladimir Putin, {{it was not}} you {{who started}} this war. But you can finish it if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> courage and {{determination}} of de Gaulle. We offer you a sensible peace based on mutual benefit by the principle independence in exchange for security. In case of troops withdrawal and acknowledgement of independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, we are obliged not to make any political, military, or economic treaties with anyone against Russia, not to accommodate foreign military bases on our territory even temporarily, not to support and not to finance groups or organizations carrying out a military struggle against RF, {{to be present in}} the united ruble zone, to enter CIS. Besides, we can sign a treaty even though a neutral state status is more acceptable to us. We can also guarantee a renunciation of armed struggle against RF by all Muslims of Russia for at least 10 to 15 years under condition of freedom of faith. We are not related to the apartment bombings in Moscow and Volgodonsk, but we can take responsibility for this in an acceptable way.|$|E
500|$|According to Robert Simpson, {{there are}} no reasons for a Category6 on the Saffir–Simpson Scale because it is {{designed}} to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to human-made structures. Simpson stated that [...] "...when you get up into winds in excess of [...] <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building it's going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it's engineered." [...] Despite his statements, the counties of Broward and Miami-Dade in Florida have building codes which require critical infrastructure buildings to be able to withstand Category5 winds, which contradicts Mr. Simpson's assessment of building strength.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come in hither, men," [...] shouted he {{down the}} passage, [...] "and sleep here. Haven't <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of this villainous sour cider?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, by Allah. Even worth {{twenty of}} these common people. Indeed, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> {{with you to}} make a great fight but not enough for victory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{one such}} as I am. She {{would not be}} happy over here. She does not like new faces. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> {{depending}} on you; I have but her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't you go {{home now}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> to live, with a little economy, as you were meant to do?" [...] she said. [...] "This country {{is no place for}} you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't {{expect a}} fresh accident! Haven't <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough?</b> However, if your gloomy forebodings were justified, I expect your {{relations}} would meet my claim." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{some better}} girl than I will decide some day, after mature reflection, {{that on the}} whole <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough.</b> Mr. Hudson, of course, is nowhere; he has nothing but his genius and his beaux yeux." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, come, young folks, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> {{to say to}} one another. Sit {{down there}} and leave the ox to the {{children}} and us old folks in our second childhood. You believe and old woman now, M. Darpent?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall want a rope {{of pearls}} very soon," [...] {{she told the}} man, [...] "but not just yet. Perhaps you will let Mr. Deane know when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> of the ones the color and size I like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, fellows," [...] said Jones, [...] "there's six lions, and that's {{more than}} we can pack out of here. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> hunting? I have." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{was a bit}} under a {{thousand}} pounds, Richard. And when she died I put it out under Mr. Carroll's direction at safe interest. So that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> to discharge your debt, and something saved against another emergency." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> of the {{old school}} about you to like {{conventional}} falsehood. This young man did in fact ask me to be his wife. Of course I meant to accept him,--but I didn't. Then comes this convict's granddaughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|HIGGINS. Well, Eliza, you've {{had a bit}} of {{your own}} back, as <b>you</b> call it. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough?</b> and are <b>you</b> going to be reasonable? Or do you want any more? ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Exactly;--and I {{have not}} told you, because I {{would not have}} you bothered with me when I land. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> on your own hands; and if I were to be a burden to you now {{it might be a}} serious trouble. I am afraid poor Mr. Shand objects to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not happy together! You {{shall be}} happy, I tell you; {{you will be}} happy if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> to live on.

6000|$|... “Mother’s {{done what}} she wanted to do. There’s no sense in it that I can see. I’m sure she couldn’t <b>have</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of her. It’s {{perfectly}} wicked, leaving us like that.” ...|$|R

6000|$|Charnock laughed. [...] "I {{imagined}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> {{to bother}} <b>you,</b> and his account is big.
