5|$|Although {{the portion}} {{of what is now}} NY370 from Cato to Liverpool was state-maintained by 1926, it {{remained}} unnumbered until the late 1920s. At that time, the section west of then-NY31 (now NY48) in Baldwinsville became NY37. The designation proved to be short-lived as it was renumbered to NY370 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, NY40 was split into several different routes. From Cato to just east of Red Creek, old NY40 became part of the new NY370, which also extended southeastward to NY57 in Liverpool. The small segment of former NY40 from NY3 to Upton Road was included in NY3E (later US104).|$|E
5|$|Hugh may {{not have}} {{attended}} the coronation of King Henry II of England and his queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Some sources place him at the coronation, others do not. He also {{did not attend the}} Council of Clarendon in 1164 that issued the Constitutions of Clarendon, that was the cause of the quarrel between the king and Thomas Becket. In the ensuing dispute between the king and Becket, Hugh did not take sides. He was, however, present with Roger de Pont L'Evêque the Archbishop of <b>York</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coronation of the king's eldest son Henry the Young King in 1170, and consequently was suspended by Alexander III. The coronation of the Young King eventually led to Becket's martyrdom in December 1170.|$|E

5|$|NY28 was {{originally}} assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville {{in the south}} to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, NY28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, and Oneida County, NY28 has remained the same to this day.|$|E

NY348 had an overlap with US9 from Chazy to what is now NY9B in the town of Champlain. Here, US9 forked to the east and followed the length of modern NY9B to Rouses Point. NY348 was extended east to Rouses Point along US11 and what is now NY276 by the following year.|$|E
5|$|NY78 was {{replaced}} by NY44 (now NY414) {{in the vicinity of}} Watkins Glen as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, two parts of the pre-1921 routing of Route46 east of Seneca Lake were assigned posted route numbers for the first time. From just northeast of Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville, the old road became part of NY227, which initially extended from NY44 (now NY414) near Watkins Glen to NY79 in Perry City. While Route46 veered southeast from Reynoldsville to serve Mecklenburg, NY227 proceeded northeast from the former to connect to Perry City. The portion of old Route46 north of Perry City became part of NY79.|$|E
