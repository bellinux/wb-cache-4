Throughout the 60 day grow-out period the control group was fed a fish meal based basal diet, and three other groups were fed diets in which 20 (NP 20), 40 (NP 40) and 60 % (NP 60) fish meal was substituted with nucleotide (Nu-Pro® (NP) yeast). There were no significant changes of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in liver among the experimental groups. A significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in malondialdehyde (MDA) level of tissue was observed in all nucleotide supplemented groups when compared to the control group.

40|$|Mechanistic {{relations}} between {{the evolution of the}} starch/flour structure, dough rheology and bread quality were investigated using the most common flours and starches in gluten-free bread-making. Micrographs showed that the small wheat starch granules filled the spaces of the big granules, forming a uniform starch-hydrocolloid matrix. This granular advantage decreased the consistency and increased the uniformity of wheat-starch <b>based</b> <b>doughs</b> throughout fermentation, as shown by micrographs and the higher critical strain. The viscoelastic properties of the different doughs strongly influenced the bread volume and the crumb texture. Thus, starch-based breads showed higher specific volume and lower hardness, especially those made with wheat starch, whose lower pasting temperature also reinforced the continuous phase of the crumb. On the other hand, the large potato starch granules did not form a continuous starch-hydrocolloid matrix, resulting in breads with the lowest specific volume, elasticity, cohesiveness and resilience, and the highest hardness...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHuman {{selenium}} supplementation {{is vastly}} dominated by selenized <b>yeasts</b> <b>based</b> products not only due to regulation issues {{but due to}} the fact that yeasts convert inorganic selenium into organic forms up to 2000 μg g- 1 through a well characterized selenium metabolism. Though both yeasts and the higher mushroom Agaricomycetes belong to the kingdom of fungi, their selenometabolic pathways are different. Agaricomycetes, the most widely researched higher fungi tend to store the excess of selenium in inorganic forms. A sample of Hericium erinaceus (lion's mane mushroom), also belonging to Agaricomycetes, was examined in our study after moderate selenium enrichment from inorganic selenium source. Enzymatic digestion and ion-pairing chromatography coupled to ICP-MS revealed that nearly 50 % of the selenium was in organic forms: selenomethionine and Se-methylselenocysteine. To explore the background of this, directed orthogonal chromatographic purification was executed in search for Se-adenosyl compounds, typical for yeast metabolism. After HPLC-ESI-QTOFMS analyses three Se-adenosyl-compounds were identified: Se-methyl- 5 -selenoadenosine, Se-methyl- 5 -selenoadenosine-Se-oxide and the previously unreported Se-dimethyl- 5 -selenonium-adenosine. Two of these species have been linked only to the selenium metabolism of yeasts. The high selenomethionine content and the presence of Se-adenosyl compounds in Hericium erinaceus open the possibility for a functional food alternative to selenized <b>yeast</b> <b>based</b> dietary supplements. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|A {{fast and}} easy-to-use method using laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) {{was set up to}} determine Na (sodium) distribution in baked bread. Standard bread was made using a standard recipe and the amount of salt added was 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 10, 15 and 20 g corresponding to 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 % salt on the flour <b>base.</b> <b>Dough</b> was mixed in a spiral mixer and was allowed to rise for 30 mm.

Bread with added salt spots was made using the same recipe as for the standard bread, but in which the added salt was replaced by salt containing particles. In order to relate sodium profiles to actual mass percentages of Na in dry flour in the case of salt-rich spots, a calibration equation was generated. To estimate how the Na content changes due to the hygroscopic nature of salt, bread samples of different age were analyzed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processing}} (germination, toasting and cooking) of chickpea beans was investigated on the resulting flours characteristics {{and their potential}} for obtaining gluten free breads. Rheological properties of dough were recorded using Mixolab® and breads were analyzed for their instrumental quality, nutritional and sensory properties. Chickpea <b>based</b> <b>doughs</b> showed low consistency and their rheological behavior was defined by the starch gelatinization and gelification. The bread made with cooked chickpea flour exhibited the lowest specific volume (0. 58 mL/g), brightest crumb (L*= 76. 20) and softest texture, but cooking decreased the content of carbohydrates, ashes and proteins, although increased the protein digestibility. The highest specific volume was obtained in bread made with toasted chickpea flour, although crumb hardness was higher. Overall, processing of chickpea beans, concretely toasting and cooking led to flours {{that could be used}} for obtaining gluten free breads with the nutritional characteristics of the legumes and acceptable sensory characteristics.
