30|$|In Figure  8 a we can {{see that}} booklice and {{silverfish}} [i], booklice and woodlice [ii], booklice and <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> [iii], silverfish and <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> [iv] and booklice and plaster beetles [v] were found together more often than expected. Silverfish and woodlice [vi] and <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> and woodlice [vii] (Figure  8 b) lie close to the diagonal line and are thus near to the expected frequency. Although in smaller numbers, brown house moths (Hofmannophila pseudospretella) are found at higher than expected association with booklice [viii], and not surprisingly <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> are strongly associated with the varied carpet beetle [ix]- an adult form of the <b>woolly</b> <b>bear.</b> There is a lower than expected association between plaster beetles and silverfish [x] (Figure  8 b).|$|R

50|$|Folklore of {{the eastern}} United States and Canada holds that the {{relative}} amounts of brown and black on {{the skin of a}} <b>Woolly</b> <b>Bear</b> caterpillar (commonly abundant in the fall) are an indication of the severity of the coming winter. It is believed that if a <b>Woolly</b> <b>Bear</b> caterpillar's brown stripe is thick, the winter weather will be mild and if the brown stripe is narrow, the winter will be severe. In reality, hatchlings from the same clutch of eggs can display considerable variation in their color distribution, and the brown band tends to grow with age; if there is any truth to the tale, it is highly speculative.|$|R

50|$|The Arctic <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> {{caterpillars}} {{are unique}} in their combination of adaptations to the polar extremes. They spend nearly 90% {{of their lives}} frozen and only about 5% feeding on the tundra during June; the remainder is spent in summer aestivation within hibernacula (protective cocoons).|$|R

2500|$|Local {{folklore}} of the American Northeast and the American South {{hold that}} [...] "woolly bears" [...] (or [...] "wooly worms" [...] in the South) help humans predict the weather, {{similar to the}} groundhog. The forthcoming severity of a winter may be indicated {{by the amount of}} black on the Isabella tiger moth's caterpillar—the most familiar <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> in North America. More brown than black is said to mean a mild winter, while more black than brown is supposed to mean a harsh winter. However, the relative width of the black band varies among instars, not according to weather. The mythical qualities attributed to <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> in America have led to such things as the Woollybear Festival in Ohio, the Wooly Worm Festival in Beattyville, Kentucky and the Wooly Worm Festival in Banner Elk, North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|The Natural History Unit of the BBC filmed arctic <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> moths {{in their}} natural habitat on Ellesmere Island during June 2009. The {{sequence}} {{became part of the}} BBC's sequel to Planet Earth called Frozen Planet, broadcast on BBC One in autumn 2011 (with the US broadcast following on Discovery Channel in spring 2012).|$|R
50|$|<b>Woolly</b> <b>bear</b> {{caterpillars}} (Grammia incorrupta) {{infected with}} tachinid flies increase their survival by ingesting plants containing toxins known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The physiological {{basis for this}} change in behaviour is unknown; however, it is possible that, when activated, the immune system sends signals to the taste system that trigger plasticity in feeding responses during infection.|$|R
5000|$|The Amerilini are a {{tribe of}} <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> moths (Arctiidae) in the {{subfamily}} Arctiinae. They are sometimes (e.g. in the [...] "Erebidae" [...] scheme) incorrectly merged into the Phaegopterini, but morphologically the tribe {{is related to}} Callimorphini. The elder name Rhodogastriini Kiriakoff, 1950 was based on incorrectly determined genus Rhodogastria (=Amerila in modern sense).|$|R
50|$|In most {{temperate}} climates, caterpillars become moths {{within months}} of hatching, but in the Arctic the summer period for vegetative growth - and hence feeding - is so short that the <b>Woolly</b> <b>Bear</b> must feed for several summers, freezing again each winter before finally pupating. Some are known to live through as many as 14 winters.|$|R
50|$|Two insect parasitoids attack <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> moth caterpillars: an ichneumonid wasp (reported as Hyposoter pectinatus but {{probably}} Hyposoter deichmanni) and a tachinid fly (Exorista thula). The wasp, a solitary parasitoid, kills about 20% {{of the third}} and fourth instars of the host while the gregarious bristle fly causes about 50% mortality in the instar 5 and 6, and pupae.|$|R
5000|$|The setae of the <b>Woolly</b> <b>Bear</b> {{caterpillar}} do not inject venom {{and are not}} urticant - they do {{not typically}} cause irritation, injury, inflammation, or swelling. [...] Handling them is discouraged, however, as the sharp spiny bristles may cause dermatitis in people with sensitive skin. Their main defense mechanism is rolling up into a ball if picked up or disturbed.|$|R
30|$|An {{analysis}} of the frequency distribution of the catch of <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> is displayed as triangles in Figure  7 a. Although their abundance is very much less, with only some 4000 caught in total, reflecting an average of 0.19 larvae per trap, the number of multiple catches on the same trap {{is much higher than}} expected (shown as a dotted line) {{on the basis of a}} Poisson distribution.|$|R
50|$|<b>Woolly</b> <b>bear</b> {{caterpillars}} (Grammia incorrupta) {{are sometimes}} lethally endoparasitised by tachinid flies. The caterpillars ingest plant toxins called pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which improve {{the survival of}} by conferring resistance against the flies. Crucially, parasitised caterpillars {{are more likely than}} non-parasitised caterpillars to specifically ingest large amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and excessive ingestion of these toxins reduces the survival of non-parasitised caterpillars. These three findings are all consistent with the adaptive plasticity theory.|$|R
