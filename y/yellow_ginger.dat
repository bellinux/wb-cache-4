50|$|Commonly {{known as}} cream garland-lily or <b>yellow</b> <b>ginger,</b> it grows up to 2.5 meters high. It is {{extremely}} shade tolerant, and thrives {{in a wide}} range of soils. Since it has the ability to regrow from even a small fragment of the rhizome, which survive crushing, immersion in sea water, and even years outside of soil, elimination can be a problem. It is treated as an invasive weed in New Zealand, because of its ability to displace other species.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, a study {{established}} a reference {{description of the}} dingo based on pre-20th century specimens that are unlikely to {{have been influenced by}} hybridisation. The dingo differs from the domestic dog by relatively larger palatal width, relatively longer rostrum, relatively shorter skull height and relatively wider top ridge of skull. A sample of 19th century dingo skins the study examined suggests that there was considerable variability in the colour of dingoes and included various combinations of <b>yellow,</b> white, <b>ginger</b> and darker variations from tan to black. Although it remained difficult to provide consistent and clear diagnostic features, the study placed morphological limits on what can be considered a dingo.|$|R

40|$|Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a {{well-known}} and widely used herb, which contains several interesting bioactive constituents and possesses health-promoting properties. e proximate, mineral, antinutrient, amino acid, and phytochemical components of two varieties of ginger (Zingiber officinale) were investigated. Amino acid composition was determined using standard analytical techniques. e results obtained in percentages in the two varieties of ginger (white and yellow types) were crude �bre (21. 90, 8. 30), fat (17. 11, 9. 89), carbohydrate (39. 70, 58. 21), crude protein (12. 05, 11. 65), ash (4. 95, 7. 45) and moisture (3. 95, 4. 63) contents respectively. Elemental analysis revealed that potassium (0. 98 ppm and 1. 38 ppm) is the most abundant, while copper (0. 01 ppm) is the least. Phytochemical screening indicated that they are both rich in saponins, anthraquinones, phlobatannin and glycosides. Also, the antinutrient constituents of white ginger were lower than <b>yellow</b> <b>ginger,</b> although the levels of the antinutrient constituents in the two varieties are saved for consumption. e essential amino acids in the two varieties were almost the same, with Leu being the most abundant in both. e two ginger varieties were adequate only in Leu, Phe + Try, and valine based on FAO/WHO provisional pattern. Overall, the �ndings indicate that the two varieties of ginger are good sources of nutrients, mineral elements, amino acid, and phytochemicals which could be exploited as great potentials for drugs and/or nutritional supplements...|$|E
30|$|According to ISO 16928 : 2014, {{the pale}} yellow to amber ginger oil from China should be {{containing}} α-zingiberene (29 - 40 %), β-sesquiphellandrene (10 - 14 %), ar-curcumene (5 - 11 %), camphene (4.5 - 10 %), and β-bisabolene (2.5 - 9 %), while <b>yellow</b> <b>ginger</b> oil from India should be containing α-zingiberene (35 - 40 %), β-sesquiphellandrene (11.5 - 13.5 %), ar-curcumene (6.5 - 9 %), camphene (5 - 8 %), and β-bisabolene (2.5 - 5.5 %).

50|$|In 2009, the {{pathogen}} {{was found to}} be infecting and killing large numbers of Japanese larch trees (Larix kaempferi) in the United Kingdom at sites in the English counties of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall. It {{was the first time in}} the world that Phytophthora ramorum had been found infecting this species. Since then, it has also been found extensively in larch plantations in Wales and in southwest Scotland, leading to the deliberate felling of large areas. The UK Forestry Commission noted that eradication of the disease would not be possible, and instead adopted a strategy of containing the disease to reduce its spread. Symptoms of the disease on larch trees include dieback of the tree's crown and branches, and a distinctive <b>yellowing</b> or <b>ginger</b> colour beneath the bark. In August 2010, the disease was found in Japanese larch trees in Counties Waterford and Tipperary in Ireland. It had spread to Japanese larch plantations across the south of the country by February 2014. Coillte, who owned twenty forests where the disease was present, felled 16,000 trees in one of its forests, having already felled 150 hectares to contain the disease.|$|R
50|$|Many {{words in}} Woleaian, {{especially}} verbs, use reduplication, (Kennedy). They use both whole stem and partial reduplications “as initial or medial consonant doubling and initial or final reduplication,” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). An {{example of this}} is the word ‘‘fiyefiy’’, which means to squeeze and comes from the word ‘‘fiya’’, which means squeeze it. Some nouns also use reduplication, like ‘‘ugoug’’ or gallbladder, which reduplicates the word ‘‘ug’’ for net. Reduplication in Woleaian can be found in adjectives—like the word ‘‘yangoyang’’, meaning to be <b>yellow,</b> yellowish of <b>ginger</b> color, which comes from the word yang, which means ginger. (Sohn & Tawerilmang, Woleaian-English Dictionary, 1976). Another type of reduplication in Woleaian is reduplication-prefixation, which is when “a neutral verb has both reduplication and the causative prefix/” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). An {{example of this is}} the Woleaian word ‘‘gareparep’’, which means to get close. This word comes from the words ‘‘garepa’’ meaning approach to it, and ‘‘rep’’, meaning to be near (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ginger (Zingiber officinale) {{is one of}} {{the major}} spice crops of India as well as Orissa. In Orissa it is mainly grown in the hilly eastern ghat high land zone. Rhizome rot disease complex is an {{important}} production constraint. In the present study, 134 varieties of ginger were screened for three years at Potangi in Koraput district of Orissa against rhizome rot complex. Only one variety “ ZO – 16 “ was found to be resistant (percentage disease incidence, PDI,- 0. 0 %), eight moderately resistant (PDI – 1. 0 to 5. 0 %), 19 tolerant (PDI – 6. 0 to 15. 0 %), 56 moderately tolerant (PDI – 16. 0 to 25. 0 %), 39 susceptible (PDI – 26. 0 to 40. 0 %) and 11 highly susceptible (PDI – above 40. 0 %). Key words: Ginger, Pythium, Fusarium, rhizome rot complex, varietal evolution Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) {{is one of the}} major spice crops of our country. It is also used as condiment, flavouring agent, in the preparation of non-alcoholic beverage and is also known to have numerous medicinal properties. In Orissa ginger is grown mostly in Koraput and other hilly tracts in the eastern ghat high land zone. Loss due to disease is an important production constraint for ginger in Orissa. Soft rot, yellows and bacterial wilt are three major diseases of ginger. The two diseases, soft rot and yellows are generally found together in the same field affecting the same plant parts and their symptoms often get mixed up. The term “rhizome rot ” is generally accepted for soft rot and yellows disease complex (Mathur, 2000). Soft rot is caused mostly by Pythium aphanidermatum but other species, P. deliense, P. myriotylum, P. pleroticum, P. vexans and P. ultimum were also reported by many worker from different states (Sarma, 1994). Yellows disease is mostly caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. zingiberi. Other reported species causing <b>ginger</b> <b>yellows</b> are F. solani and F. equiseti (Mathur 2000). In Orissa, Pythium sp., F. solani and Sclerotium sp., were found responsible for rhizome rot complex of ginger (Rath, 1991). In the present study 134 varieties were screened against rhizome rot disease complex of ginger...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of anti-diarrhoeal herbs on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and meat quality in pigs. In Exp 1, 150 weanling-growing piglets (average BW = 7. 5 ± 0. 24 kg, average age = 27 ± 1 d) were allotted {{into one of the}} five dietary treatments, including: i) CON, basal diet, ii) DP, basal diet+ 1 g/kg date pits, iii) JH, basal diet+ 0. 5 g/kg Japanese-honeysuckle, iv) HCT, basal diet+ 1 g/kg houttuynia cordata thunb, and v) LE, basal diet+ 1 g/kg laquer tree extract. From wk 0 to 5, the JH, HCT and LE groups presented higher (p< 0. 05) ADFI, ADG and gain/feed ratio (G/F) than CON and DP groups. During wk 5 to 10, Pigs fed JH, HCT and LE diets indicated higher (p< 0. 05) ADG and ADFI than the pigs fed CON and DP diets. During the entire experimental period, a significant increase of ADG appeared in JH, HCT and LE (p< 0. 05). Pigs fed JH, HCT and LE diets got a higher (p< 0. 05) ADFI than the pigs fed CON and DP diets. Pigs fed diets with supplementations of herb additives revealled lower (p< 0. 05) score of diarrhea pigs during d 2 to d 6 compared with pigs fed CON diet. In Exp 2, 60 growing-finishing barrows and gilts (average BW = 54. 10 ± 1. 20 kg, average age = 54 ± 3 d) were allotted to three treatments: i) CON, basal diet; ii) YG, basal diet+ 1 g/kg <b>yellow</b> <b>ginger</b> and iii) HR, basal dietary+ 1 g/kg hoantchy root, respectively. From wk 0 to 5, Dietary supplementation of YG and HR enhanced (p< 0. 05) ADG. No difference was found between YG and HR treatments. During, wk 5 to 10, ADG also was observed higher in YG and HR treatments than CON group (p< 0. 05). Additional, YG had the highest ADG (p< 0. 05) among treatments. There was always an increase of ADG in YG and HR (p< 0. 05) through all periods. HR treatment showed a lower (p< 0. 05) score of diarrhoeal pigs on d 1 and d 2 compared with CON treatment. Pigs fed YG and HR diets had a higher (p< 0. 05) longissimus muscle area (LMA) than pigs fed CON diet. In conclusion, anti-diarrhoeal herbs can improve growth performance, and prevent diarrhea incidence in pigs, it can also increase LMA in finishing pigs...|$|E
