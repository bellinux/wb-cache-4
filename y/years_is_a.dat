25|$|Since the 1950s, {{there has}} been a renewed {{interest}} in the collection of bookplates and in many ways a reorientation of this interest. There are still substantial numbers of collectors for whom the study of bookplates spanning 500 <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fascinating source of historical, artistic and socio-cultural interest. They have however been joined by a now dominant group of new collectors whose interest is more than anything the constitution—at quite reasonable cost—of a miniature, personalized art-print collection. In this miniature art museum, they gather together the works of their favorite artists. They commission numbered and signed editions of bookplates to their name which are never pasted into books but only serve for exchange purposes.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 a {{university}} level course aiming {{to encourage and}} support practitioners working with young children to introduce the Cornish language into their settings was launched. The Cornish Language Practice Project (Early <b>Years)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> level 4 course approved by Plymouth University and run at Cornwall College. The course is not a Cornish language course, but students will be assessed {{on their ability to}} use the Cornish language constructively in their work with young children. The course will cover such topics as Understanding Bilingualism, Creating Resources and Integrating Language and Play, but the focus of the language provision will be on Cornish. A non-accredited specialist Cornish language course has been developed to run alongside the level 4 course for those who prefer tutor support to learn the language or develop their skills further for use with young children.|$|E
25|$|Actuarial science, of {{the kind}} used to project the future {{solvency}} of social security, is by nature subject to uncertainty. The SSA actually makes three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections {{that turned out to}} be too optimistic. It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according to actuary David Langer) assumptions that resulted in pushing back the projected exhaustion date (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report. During the heavy-boom years of the 1990s, the midline projections were too pessimistic. Obviously, projecting out 75 <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> significant challenge and, as such, the actual situation might be much better or much worse than predicted.|$|E

25|$|Identity {{development}} is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are liklely to cycle {{through a number of}} identities to find one that suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent <b>years)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood. Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also {{plays an important role in}} their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.|$|E

500|$|Despite these criticisms, the {{remainder}} of the season earned mostly positive reviews among critics. The season scored 62 out of 100 on Metacritic (a website that assigns a weighted average score for media), which translates to [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] Time magazine wrote that [...] "It's ironic that NBC's most original sitcom in <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> remake, but who cares? The Office is a daring, unflinching take on very American workplace tensions." [...] Boston.com felt that the first season of The Office was good, and the differences between the characters of the American and the original series added to the popularity of the series. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that The Office succeeded in its first season, and that although NBC had failed in the past with television shows such as Coupling, it had found achievement with The Office. Entertainment Weekly awarded the season a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that The Office [...] "is clever and insular, capturing all the drudgery, awkwardness, and rivalry of cubicle living" [...] and that the last five episodes help to illustrate that the series has [...] "crossed the pond handily." ...|$|E
500|$|Fifty Years of Freedom: A Study of the Development of the Ideas of A.S. Neill is a 1972 {{intellectual}} {{biography of}} the British pedagogue A.S. Neill by Ray Hemmings. It traces how Homer Lane, Wilhelm Reich, Sigmund Freud and others influenced Neill as he developed the [...] "Summerhill idea", the philosophy of child autonomy behind his Summerhill School. The book follows Neill's early life and career in rural, Calvinist Scotland and continues through the influence of his mentors, Lane and Reich, and the origins of Summerhill after World War I. Written fifty years from Summerhill's founding, Fifty <b>Years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sociological and historical analysis of Neill's ideas {{in the context of}} intellectual and educational trends both during Neill's life and at the time of publication. Hemmings also surveyed progressive school leaders about Neill's impact on the field, and reported their perception of influence on teacher–pupil relations. Fifty Years was first published in England in 1972 by George Allen and Unwin, and was later renamed Children's Freedom: A. S. Neill and the Evolution of the Summerhill Idea for its 1973 American publication by Schocken Books.|$|E
500|$|After a 20-year {{retirement}} {{from the film}} industry, O'Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy-drama Only the Lonely. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O'Hara stated of her return: [...] "Twenty <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> long time, but it was surprising how little changed. The equipment is lighter now, and they work a bit faster, but I hardly felt like I'd been away". She described Candy as [...] "one of my all-time favorite leading men", and {{was surprised by the}} extent of his talent, remarking that he was a [...] "comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent" [...] who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including The Christmas Box, Cab for Canada and The Last Dance, the latter her last film in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.|$|E

500|$|Richard Corliss of TIME heralded {{the film}} and its director, Steve McQueen, by stating: [...] "Indeed, McQueen's film is closer in its {{storytelling}} particulars to such 1970s exploitation-exposés of slavery as Mandingo and Goodbye, Uncle Tom. Except that McQueen is not a schlockmeister sensationalist but a remorseless artist." [...] Corliss draws parallels with Nazi Germany, saying, [...] "McQueen shows that racism, aside from its barbarous inhumanity, is insanely inefficient. It {{can be argued that}} Nazi Germany lost the war both because it diverted so much manpower to the killing of Jews and because it did not exploit the brilliance of Jewish scientists in building smarter weapons. So the slave owners dilute the energy of their slaves by whipping them for sadistic sport and, as Epps does, waking them at night to dance for his wife's cruel pleasure." [...] Gregory Ellwood of HitFix gave the film an [...] "A-" [...] rating, stating, [...] "12 <b>Years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> powerful drama driven by McQueen's bold direction and the finest performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor's career." [...] He continued by praising the performances of Fassbender and Nyong'o, citing Nyong'o as [...] "the film's breakthrough performance [...] may find Nyong'o making her way to the Dolby Theater next March". He also admired the film's [...] "gorgeous" [...] cinematography and the musical score, as [...] "one of Hans Zimmer's more moving scores in some time". Paul MacInnes of The Guardian scored the film five out of five stars, writing, [...] "Stark, visceral and unrelenting, 12 Years a Slave is not just a great film but a necessary one." ...|$|E

500|$|About {{two months}} after the event concluded, on 22 July, it was {{announced}} that second place overall finisher and points classification winner Di Luca had given two positive tests for continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA, an erythropoietin derivative) on 20 and 28 May, before the Cinque Terre time trial and the Mount Vesuvius stage in the race's final week. He was provisionally suspended with immediate effect by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), cycling's governing body. It was announced on 8 August that the analyses of the B-samples from those controls confirmed the initial results, making it likely that Di Luca will be stripped of some or all of his results from the race. [...] fired him on 13 August. Di Luca at first maintained his innocence and claimed a conspiracy against him by the labs handling the tests. A period of legal maneuvering between Di Luca and the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) followed. CONI officials asked their anti-doping tribunal (TNA) to suspend Di Luca for three years– while two <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> customary ban for a doping positive, CONI prosecutors sought a third year for recidivism, stemming from Di Luca's previous doping incident two years earlier. He was given a two-year suspension, retroactive to July 2009, and indicated that he would appeal it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In October 2010, Di Luca was reinstated to active status by CONI, due to his cooperation with several ongoing doping investigations, though his results were indeed stricken from the record. On 10 January 2011, he signed with [...] and indicated that he would return to the Giro in 2011 to support Katusha team leader Joaquim Rodríguez.|$|E
