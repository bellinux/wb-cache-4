500|$|He was a {{part-time}} leg break bowler, taking 57wickets in first-class cricket at a useful average of 32.21. Barnes's leg break spun very little, {{but he had}} a topspinner which hurried onto the batsman and yielded him many wickets. Barnes was also a substitute wicket-keeper and a versatile fieldsman. During his career, he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires. On the 1948 tour of England, after an Australian appeal was turned down by umpire Alec Skelding, he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to Skelding, stating: [...] "Now all <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> a white stick". A complex character, Barnes, [...] "rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn. Stocky, with blue eyes and powerful wrists, he had a passion for physical fitness, and was an enthusiastic big-game fisherman and golfer".|$|E
500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a tough job to do, bless it, but getting it to do what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E

It's just more solid, more clear." [...] Q gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "Grunge may have died, but Pearl Jam it seems will never be slayed." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer Jon Pareles gave the album three out of five stars, feeling that the album [...] "comes across {{as part of an}} {{extended}} conversation among the five band members...and fans loyal enough to check in for Pearl Jam's latest musings on love, death and social responsibility." [...] The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars, stating that Pearl Jam [...] "are dignified, musicianly, sincere... and a teensy bit dull" [...] and observing that [...] "Vedder's affecting vocal angst drowns in a sea of pessimistic riffola." [...] The review called Binaural [...] "a warts-and-all album; it has grabbers, songs that sink in slowly and a few absolute duds." [...] At the 2001 Grammy Awards, [...] "Grievance" [...] received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. Regarding Binaural, Ament stated that [...] "we look back and think we didn't put some of the best songs on it", adding that [...] "I think there are some beautiful things that came out of it, but we're never going to remember that record as one of the greats." ...|$|E

500|$|Barnes {{returned}} for the subsequent fixture against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately, {{and put on}} an opening partnership of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued {{to build on the}} foundation laid by the top order and were eventually bowled out for 632. Bradman’s bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian appeals had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by umpire Alec Skelding, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball [...] "wouldn't have hit another set of stumps" [...] and telling the umpire to get a guide dog. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then [...] presented to Skelding stating: [...] "You must need a dog. You're blind when you give those decisions [...] not out" [...] and [...] "Now all <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> a white stick". Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena. Barnes later wrote [...] "Strange how I suggested he find himself a canine companion at ...|$|E

However, in September 2007, executive producer Mark Mathis {{announced that the}} movie was [...] about [...] "censorship" [...] of intelligent design supporters.

2500|$|Some {{people may}} be better [...] "lie detectors" [...] than others, better able to {{distinguish}} a lie by facial expression, cadence of speech, certain movements, consistency, and other methods. According to David J. Lieberman, PhD, in Never Be Lied to Again: How to Get the Truth in Five Minutes or Less in Any Conversation or Situation, these methods can be learned. Some methods of questioning {{may be more likely}} to elicit the truth, for instance: [...] "When was the last time you smoked marijuana?" [...] (a leading question) is more likely to get a truthful answer than [...] "Do you smoke pot?" [...] Asking the question most likely to get the information <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> a skill and can be learned. Avoiding vague questioning will help avoid lies of omission or vagueness.|$|E

Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac argued that Suárez's actions were [...] "really shocking," [...] describing the result as a [...] "football injustice." [...] Uruguay's coach Óscar Tabárez defended Suárez: [...] "Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use...We also abide by what the referee did. It could have been a mistake.
