So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy {{the movement of the}} body. You see the skill.|$|E
500|$|Griesemer {{said that}} a {{recurring}} theme throughout Infamous games {{that they wanted to}} continue with Second Son was the idea of [...] "modern elemental powers", variations on commonplace powers drawn from the game world. Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. [...] "This is a game about super powers, so for us, the way the effects look tells <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about how you're playing the game", he explained. Fox considered that the game world's resemblance to Seattle helped the superpower elements feel authentic. [...] "Because we have that sweet foundation of plausibility, you buy into the super-powered element", he explained.|$|E

At the Amateur Athletics Association (AAA) trials in Birmingham his run of 10.01s was the fastest ever wind-legal time {{recorded}} in Britain by a British sprinter. Chambers ran with consistency {{in the summer of}} 2001: he won at the Seville Grand Prix in 10.01s and finished third in ten seconds flat at the Athletissima meet. In the run up to the 2001 IAAF Edmonton World Championships Chambers compared his own performances to the British record holder: [...] "I am very consistent in the 10.00s this year, and that bodes well for the Worlds. If you are running as fast as Linford Christie in his prime, it gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of confidence." ...|$|E

500|$|The German word [...] "Achtung" [...] (...) in {{the album}} title {{translates}} into English as [...] "attention" [...] or [...] "watch out". U2's sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy {{used the phrase}} [...] "achtung baby" [...] during recording, reportedly taking it from the Mel Brooks film The Producers. The title was selected in August 1991 {{near the end of}} the album sessions. According to Bono, it was an ideal title, as it was attention-grabbing, referenced Germany, and hinted at either romance or birth, both of which were themes on the album. The band was determined not to highlight the seriousness of the lyrics and instead sought to [...] "erect a mask", a concept that was further developed on the Zoo TV Tour, particularly through characters such as [...] "The Fly". Of the title, Bono said in 1992, [...] "It's a con, in a way. We call it Achtung Baby, grinning up our sleeves in all the photography. But it's probably the heaviest record we've ever made... It tells <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about packaging, because the press would have killed us if we'd called it anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mutt Romney Blues" [...] is a three-chord, {{acoustic}} Delta blues song. Drawing {{parallels between}} the Mitt Romney dog incident and his political [...] "plans and schemes", the song criticizes Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and is sung {{from the perspective of}} the Romney family's dog. Cooder was inspired by Al Sharpton's quote [...] "how he treated his dog tells <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about him", and found the dog to be [...] "a useful character... when you view it in the light of the blues. Like a servant, a yardman, someone very low in the social order. He's just begging to be let down [...]" [...] Bud Scoppa of Uncut characterizes the song as [...] "the musical equivalent of a political cartoon". [...] "Brother Is Gone" [...] is poignantly styled as a sad folktale and features a haunting mandolin riff, a rueful tone, and wounded vocals. Its lyrics attribute the conservative Koch Brothers to the Deal with the Devil myth, which Cooder adapted from Robert Johnson's [...] "Cross Road Blues". The lyrics cite their [...] "crossroads" [...] as [...] "the prairie town of Wichita", where Koch Industries is headquartered. He said in an interview that [...] "the only logical explanation for the Brothers I could come up with is, they made their deal at the crossroads with Satan." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek cites it as [...] "among the finest songs 's written." ...|$|E
500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E

2500|$|He said of {{this fast}} paced {{form of the}} game, [...] "Wicket-keepers play a very central role as the captain often asks <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about the lines people are bowling and {{the pace of the}} pitch.

2500|$|That {{was what}} we liked to call a [...] "pay the rent" [...] job.

2500|$|Generally {{the use of}} both a {{ring and}} a halter, and {{management}} of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. [...] Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring. A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding. Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. [...] One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull. [...] But a ring in his nose is no good unless you have a bull staff and use it. [...] A bull staff is a pole with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring. [...] Leading a bull with a staff gives <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more handling power as the bull can't get any closer to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.|$|E
