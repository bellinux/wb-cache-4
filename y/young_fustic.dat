50|$|The {{wood was}} {{formerly}} {{used to make}} the yellow dye called <b>young</b> <b>fustic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Old fustic {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with <b>young</b> <b>fustic</b> (Rhus cotinus) from southern Europe and Asia, which provides a more fugitive colour.|$|E
5000|$|Fustin, {{sometimes}} called [...] "dihydrofisetin", is a [...] flavan-on-ol, {{a type of}} flavonoid. It {{can be found in}} <b>young</b> <b>fustic</b> (Cotinus coggygria) and in the lacquer tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum, aka Rhus verniciflua).|$|E
30|$|We limited {{our case}} study to 47 out of 685 samples for ethical considerations, {{and used a}} {{combination}} of spectroscopic, microscopic and chromatographic techniques to identify dyes and infer the presence of mordants. In conjunction with archival research, these scientific results were successfully cross-referenced with documentary sources. Weld, <b>young</b> and old <b>fustic,</b> quercitron, cochineal, madder, indigo plants and orchil dyes were all found in the samples (weft) in repetitive combinations that suggested well-defined recipes. In turn, these results advanced {{our knowledge of the}} substances used to produce primary and compound colours. Furthermore, we found scientific evidence that points the presence of a water-soluble glaze material, likely a natural gum.|$|R
30|$|During {{this initial}} stage {{of an ongoing}} {{research}} project, we have also made progress {{in one of our}} main goals: contributing to the understanding of these materials as an avenue to ensuring their preservation. While destructive analysis such as HPLC–PDA–MS is often conclusive and commonly used to assess collections, it is not sustainable in a museum or archival environment, where instrumental analysis is often limited, if available at all. By studying dated and well-preserved textiles, such as those presented in our case study, we are providing evidence that we anticipate will help in the management and care of collections. For instance, the presence of light sensitive dyes such as flavonoid- containing yellow and green (quercitron, weld, <b>young</b> and old <b>fustic),</b> and especially purple (orchil) textiles, needs to be taken into consideration when deciding display and storage conditions where light levels should be kept at their lowest. Our findings showed J. Tuthill & Sons dyers used recipes/combinations consistently and repetitively. This poses a question of whether the lack of recipe books is indeed due to the ‘secrecy’ Mellor and Cardwell suggest [5], or if it is related to the ‘slow start of publications’ that Kirby, et. al. attribute to the English wool having been dyed for so long in Flanders and Holland [69]. Because of the consistent and repetitive use of combinations, certain colours and patterns likely contain a dye combination, which can be translated into informed guesses of the presence of certain chromophores therein. These informed guesses, in turn, could allow for collections’ assessment {{even in the absence of}} scientific dye analysis. Further, the presence of what seems to be water-sensitive materials such as a gum used for surface glazing imposes the need for stable and mid-level relative humidity conditions, to avoid either the drying or softening of the coating. In presenting our earliest results, we trust our findings can contribute to the care of these beautiful and important textiles in both swatch form and in costumes and furnishing collections.|$|R
50|$|Chemically, {{quercetin}} is {{a member}} of a fairly extensive class of natural coloring matters derived from phenyl benzoyl-pyrone or flavone, the constitution of which followed on the researches of St von Kostanecki, A. G. Perkin, Herzig, Goldschmidt and others. Among the related, coloring matters are: chrysin from poplar buds, apigenin from parsley, luteolin from weld, mignonette and dyer's broom, fisetin from <b>young</b> <b>fustic</b> and yellow cypress, galangin from galangal root, and myricetin from Nageia nagi.|$|E
50|$|Fisetin can {{be found}} in a wide variety of plants. It is found in Eudicotyledons, such as trees and shrubs in the family Fabaceae, such as the acacias Acacia greggii and Acacia berlandieri, the parrot tree (Butea frondosa), the honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), members of the family Anacardiaceae such as the Quebracho {{colorado}} and species of the genus Rhus, which contains the sumacs. Along with myricetin, fisetin provides the color of the traditional yellow dye <b>young</b> <b>fustic,</b> which was extracted from the Eurasian smoketree (Rhus cotinus). Many fruits and vegetables also contain fisetin, including strawberries apples, and grapes. Fisetin can be extracted from fruit and herbal sources in juices, wines, and infusions such as teas. It is also found in Monocotyledons such as onions. It is also present in Pinophyta species such as the yellow cypress (Callitropsis nootkatensis).|$|E
30|$|Only one sample—from pattern 7 —contained weld. The {{presence}} of sulfuretin and fisetin strongly suggested {{the use of}} <b>young</b> <b>fustic,</b> which with the weld yields a rich orange hue. <b>Young</b> <b>fustic</b> (Cotinus coggygria), a shrub found in Southern and Central Europe provided a golden yellow colour, but it was often mixed with other dyestuffs to modify colours and/or hues. For instance, it was combined with cochineal from the Americas or weld to create more orange or olive tones [32]. Its leaves are also rich in tannins, which accounts for the {{presence of}} ellagic acid in the textile.|$|E
40|$|<b>Young</b> <b>fustic</b> (Cotinus coggygria Scop.; Anacardiaceae) {{has been}} used as a {{dyestuff}} since antiquity. Phytochemical investigation of the methanol extract of the heartwood has led to the isolation and structure elucidation by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry (MS) of 3 ′, 4 ′, 6 - trihydroxyaurone (sulfuretin) and 3 ′, 4 ′, 7 -trihydroxyflavonol (fisetin) as well as 3 ′, 4 ′, 7 -trihydroxyflavanol (fustin), 3 ′, 4 ′, 5, 7 -tetrahydroxyflavonol (quercetin), 3 ′, 4 ′, 5, 7 - tetrahydroxyflavanol (taxifolin), 4 ′, 7 -dihydroxyflavanol, 3 ′, 4 ′, 7 -trihydroxyflavanone (butin), 4 ′, 7 -dihydroxyflavanone (liquiritigenin), trans- 2 ′, 3, 4, 4 ′-tetrahydroxychalcone (butein), 4 ′, 5, 7 -trihydroxyflavanone and trans- 2 ′, 4, 4 ′- trihydroxychalcone (isoliquiritigenin). The isolated compounds were used as reference materials for the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-MS method, which was then applied to analyse (1) fresh silk samples dyed with <b>young</b> <b>fustic,</b> (2) dyed silk subjected to artificially accelerated light ageing and (3) historical silk micro-samples, extracted from ecclesiastical post-Byzantine garments (fifteenth to eighteenth century), which belong to monasteries of Mount Athos. Sulfuretin and fisetin, which are usually used as markers for the identification of the yellow dye and, for the first time, some of the aforementioned flavonoid components of <b>young</b> <b>fustic</b> were identified in the historical extracts. Furthermore, preliminary experiments suggested that although the amounts of the dye components decrease with light ageing, the relative ratio of fisetin and sulfuretin, after a first step of ageing, seems to be almost unaffected by such degradation processes raised by light. The effect of the latter on the morphology of the dyed silk fibres is briefly investigated by scanning electron microscopy. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{documents}} and nongovernmental recording, there had been various color names of textiles in Qing dynasty. For example, {{there were at least}} 40 colors recorded in the official documents. Process of dyeing got to be good and stable in Qianlong 19 th, there were at least 30 different dyeing processes at that time, such as direct dyeing, mordant dyeing, deoxidize dyeing and so on, or something more complicate. The dye stuff included indigo, rhubarb, <b>young</b> <b>fustic,</b> safflower, brazilwood, buds of pagoda tree, Amur cork, cape jasmine, gall, hulls of acorn. Dyeing additives included alum, alkali, prunus mume and almond oil. Rules for blue, red, green dyeing were stricter, while that for yellow and other colors were more flexible. The colors of textiles in Qing dynast...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{probably}} the first attempt to identify the organic colouring materials contained in post-Byzantine textiles, from the Holy Mountain of Athos. Samples extracted from seven ecclesiastical garments (15 th- 19 th century) are investigated by high performance liquid chromatography with UV-Vis diode array detection. The detection limits for alizarin, purpurin, carminic acid, laccaic acid A, luteolin, apigenin, genistein, fisetin, sulfuretin, ellagic acid, indigotin and indirubin {{are found to be}} within 0. 002 - 0. 029 μg mL - 1. The following organic dyes are identified in the extracts: dyer's broom (Genista tinctoria L.), <b>young</b> <b>fustic</b> (Cotinus coggygria Scop.), an indigoid dye source either indigo (Indigofera species) or woad (Isatis tinctoria L.), madder, cochineal and lac dye (Kerria lacca Kerr). Furthermore, the identification of a brazilein derivative indicates the presence of a Caesalpinia dye source in the samples. © 2007 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|A set {{of samples}} {{collected}} from two 16 th century silk tapestries belonging to Quirinale Palace in Rome and presently under restoration at the Opificio delle Pietre Dure (Florence, Italy) {{was investigated in}} order to disclose {{the nature of the}} dyes employed in their production. The identification of the colouring materials was achieved through the application of an optimised reliable procedure, based on dimethylsulfoxide extraction of the dyes from the yarns followed by a hydrolysis treatment in an acidic methanolic solution with hydrochloric acid; the extract is then analysed by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (DAD). This study has lead to the identification {{of a wide range of}} colours; expensive dyes were used to dye the analysed silk yarns: coccid dyestuffs, madder, weld, <b>young</b> <b>fustic,</b> tannins and an indigoid dye were identified. Moreover, the use of safflower has been assessed for the first time in a European fabric. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical procedure based on GC-MS to identify in textiles {{the most common}} flavonoid yellow dyes used in Europe since ancient times, extracted from weld, <b>young</b> <b>fustic,</b> dyer's broom, sawwort and the berries of some species of Rhamnus. Later on, old fustic and quercitron bark were introduced as sources of yellow colours. The method {{is based on the}} solvent extraction of flavonoids from raw plant materials (weld, dyer's broom and old fustic), aged and not aged alum-mordanted wool dyed specimens; subsequently, flavonoids are derivatised with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide and analysed by GC-MS. The method easily allows the identification of a dyestuff by the detection of the molecular markers apigenin, luteolin, genistein, morin, maclurin, together with 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 4, 6 - trihydroxybenzoic acid, which survive in aged textiles. Two photo-oxidative degradation pathways for colour fading, one involving the mordant metallic ion and the other the light as a catalyst, are suggeste...|$|E
40|$|Mount Athos {{has been}} an Orthodox spiritual monastic centre and has enjoyed an {{autonomous}} statute since Byzantine times. Today the “Holy Mountain ” has an outstanding universal value, according to the UNESCO, as it houses rich collections of artworks from various chronological periods (i. e. Classical, Hellenistic etc.) including Byzantine and post-Byzantine period, displaying icons, mural paintings, implements, metalwork’s, wood carvings, manuscripts and textiles. The latter have been barely investigated {{in contrast to the}} other types of artworks which have received a considerable attention. The study focuses on selected (15 th – 19 th cent.) ecclesiastical garments (sakkoi) from Mount Athos and aims to elucidate several aspects {{of the history of the}} post-Byzantine textile art. In particular we focus on: (i) stylistic development, design (mainly from France and Italy) and constructional modifications over time leading to a dating typology, (ii) comparison of binding systems; exploration of possible ‘signatures ’ leading to identification of provenance of specific workshops and finally (iii) techniques and materials employed for the production and decoration of the sakkoi. The latter were investigated by using FTIR and high performance liquid chromatography with UV-Vis photodiode array detection. The following organic dyes were identified in the silk extracts of the historical objects: dyer’s broom (Genista tinctoria L.), <b>young</b> <b>fustic</b> (Cotinus coggygria Scop.), an indigoid dye source either indigo (Indigofer...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is to compare the dyes used in ecclesiastical post-Byzantine (sixteenth to early twentieth century) {{textiles}} of Mount Athos, Greece, with the corresponding organic colourants used in Ottoman (16 th – 18 th c.) [Σ 1] textiles which are preserved in the Topkapi Palace Museum, Istanbul, Turkey. During the historical period of interest, Mount Athos, which has been the spiritual centre of Byzantine culture for centuries, was within the borders of the Ottoman Empire (period of Ottoman rule) and Constantinople was its capital. The comparison of the colouring materials that have been used during the period of the Ottoman rule in textiles from the two different, Byzantine and Ottoman, cultures is of great interest. Samples extracted from forty-six and fifty post-Byzantine and Ottoman textiles respectively, were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC–DAD). The analysis of a silk velvet (inventory no: 13 / 1679, Topkapi Palace Museum), is presented in detail and serves as an example to describe the methodology that was applied throughout the investigation. More similarities than differences are observed in the results reported for the two textile collections of different cultural identity. The following materials were found in both post-Byzantine and Ottoman textiles: cochineal, madder (Rubia tinctorum L.), lac (Kerria lacca, Kerr), <b>young</b> <b>fustic</b> (Cotinus coggygria Scop.), weld (Reseda luteola L.), dyer’s broom (Genista tinctoria L.), buckthorn berries (Rhamnus trees), indigoid dyes, either indigo (Indigofera species and others) or woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) and tannins. On the other hand, soluble redwood (Caesalpinia trees), old fustic (Chlorophora tinctoria L.) and logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum L.) were found only in post-Byzantine textiles while dyer’s chamomile (Anthemis species) and Rumex species were detected only in few objects from the Topkapi Palace Museum...|$|E
