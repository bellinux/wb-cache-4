5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to Palermo in August and in September became the senior {{officer in the}} Mediterranean after Jervis' successor Lord Keith left to chase the French and Spanish fleets into the Atlantic. Nelson {{spent the rest of}} 1799 at the Neapolitan court but put to sea again in February 1800 after Lord Keith's return. On 18 February Généreux, a survivor of the Nile, was sighted and Nelson gave chase, capturing her after a short battle and winning Keith's approval. Nelson had a difficult relationship with his superior officer: he was gaining a reputation for insubordination, having initially refused to send ships when Keith requested them and on occasion returning to Palermo without orders, pleading poor health. Keith's reports, and rumours of Nelson's close relationship with Emma Hamilton, were also circulating in London, and Earl Spencer wrote a pointed letter suggesting that he return home: You {{will be more likely to}} recover <b>your</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> strength in England than in any inactive situation at a foreign Court, however pleasing the respect and gratitude shown to you for your services may be.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, the DSM-IIIR {{category}} [...] "psychoactive substance abuse," [...] {{which includes}} former concepts {{of drug abuse}} is defined as [...] "a maladaptive pattern of use indicated by...continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent social, occupational, psychological or physical problem that is caused or exacerbated by the use (or by) recurrent use in situations {{in which it is}} physically hazardous." [...] It is a residual category, with dependence taking precedence when applicable. It was the first definition to give equal weight to behavioural and physiological factors in diagnosis. By 1988, the DSM-IV defines substance dependence as [...] "a syndrome involving compulsive use, with or without tolerance and withdrawal"; whereas substance abuse is [...] "problematic use without compulsive use, significant tolerance, or withdrawal." [...] Substance abuse can be harmful to <b>your</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> may even be deadly in certain scenarios. By 1994, The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) issued by the American Psychiatric Association, the DSM-IV-TR, defines substance dependence as [...] "when an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, substance dependence may be diagnosed."
