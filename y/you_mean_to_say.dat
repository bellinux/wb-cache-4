2500|$|The second specimen, {{found in}} 1952 by Comoran {{fisherman}} Ahamadi Abdallah, {{was described as}} a different species, first as Malania hunti and later as Malania anjounae, after Daniel François Malan, the South African Prime Minister who had dispatched an SAAF Dakota at the behest of Professor Smith to fetch the specimen. It was later discovered that the lack of a first dorsal fin, at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen's life. Ironically, Malan was a staunch creationist; when he was first shown the primitive creature, he exclaimed, with a twinkle, [...] "My, it is ugly. Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we once looked like that?" [...] The specimen retrieved by Smith is on display at the SAIAB in Grahamstown, South Africa where he worked.|$|E
