I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

500|$|The role of animating Simba {{was divided}} between Mark Henn and Ruben A. Aquino. [...] While Henn {{served as the}} supervising {{animator}} of Simba as a cub, credited as Young Simba, Aquino was placed in charge of animating the character as he appears as an adult. [...] The Lion King was Disney's first animated feature film to feature absolutely no humans since Robin Hood (1973). [...] According to Aquino, animating four-legged creatures is difficult because the artists {{are faced with the}} task of drawing [...] "twice as many legs ... as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> human characters" [...] and must also attribute to them both human and animal-like qualities. [...] For assistance, Aquino drew influence from previous animated films that feature four-legged creatures as their main characters, citing Bambi, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and The Jungle Book (1967) as his main sources of inspiration.|$|E

500|$|In 1983 the {{production}} {{moved to the}} US where it played at the Hartford Stage Company in Hartford, Connecticut, directed by Mark Lamos and starring John Cullum as Hitler. At this premiere, Cullum's 25-minute speech {{at the end of}} the play was described by Mel Gussow in The New York Times as [...] "a Wagnerian intensity without resorting to histrionics" [...] that [...] "almost succeeds in that most difficult of tasks—humanizing Hitler". In World Literature Today, Bettina L. Knapp wrote that the play presented theatre-goers with the dilemma: what would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Hitler were he to surface today? Skloot noted that while the [...] "facts" [...] in Steiner's work are pure fiction, the play confronts the audience with an event that cannot be resolved with traditional [...] "logic, facticity and morality". Responding to theatre critics who objected to Hitler having the last word, Steiner said he wanted the audience to refute the former dictator's claims themselves.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} best known for the {{introduction}} of recurring character Elim Garak. Fields said of the character at the time, [...] "we didn't want to make him an out and out spy, because then what would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> him after the episode? You'd have to put him in jail on Bajor. So we tread a pretty thin line." [...] Fields had decided when creating the character that the station needed a Cardassian on-board and when no-one objected to his suggestion to put him in a tailor shop, that became Garak's profession. This was a reference to The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which used a tailor shop as a front, as Fields had begun his writing career on that series. Andrew Robinson had originally been considered for the part of Odo, {{and was one of the}} final three actors vying for the part alongside Gerrit Graham and René Auberjonois. Robinson was invited back to audition for Garak, while Graham was cast as the Hunter in [...] "Captive Pursuit".|$|E

500|$|After the plotlines were developed, major {{deviations}} sometimes {{occurred in}} the writing process. Like in {{the final version of}} the script, twins with mind-control abilities were the focus of Edlund's original pitch for the episode [...] "Simon Said". However, the more powerful twin—kept secluded due to deformities—forced his brother to perceive himself as retarded. At the end of the episode, his brother ate him in retaliation. The story was eventually changed, and instead focused on questions such as [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> power?". Kripke felt that this fit greatly with the series' storyline, because Sam was uncomfortable with his developing abilities; the writers wanted to explore one of the psychic children who took his ability as a gift. [...] "Folsom Prison Blues" [...] stemmed from Kripke's desire to feature prison ghosts, and the initial plot had FBI Agent Henriksen finally capturing the brothers and sending them to prison. However, this caused a major complication: the writers would have to devise a way for Sam and Dean to escape in the end. Writer John Shiban suggested that the brothers be arrested on purpose in order to work a job, with the prison's head guard being revealed as a family friend.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E
