Due to the change in address the package did arrive a little late for Christmas but in excellent condition. Your gift was welcomed because we boys in the service sure like to receive packages and news from the people back home. I enjoyed the last issue of the Bryant Alumni News because it was interesting to see how many of the Bryant graduates were in service and also to see how spread out they are all over the world. Although I am not personally acquainted with the members of your club I feel that I am one of you and hope that some day I shall be able to visit <b>you</b> <b>all.</b> Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> again <b>for</b> your Christmas box.

I am fortunate that my close family is sitting {{here in front of}} this meeting room {{to be part of this}} glorious moment. PRIVILEGED TO SERVE THE SOCIETY I became a member of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) in 1995, 2 years after its foundation. By searching through the ESTS archives handed over to me by Detlev Branscheid, I came across my own application form as it was transmitted by fax to the secretariat in Heidelberg (Fig. 1). My sponsors were Toni Lerut and Jean-Marie Wihlm, the first and the second treasurer of this society, respectively. The signature of Jean-Marie was still missing and I do not know whether he has ever completed my form. So I may not have been a full ESTS member at all…. ! I had the honour of serving this distinguished society for the past 11 years, first as a regent for Belgium from 2002 to 2004, the...|$|E

I want to thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to this conference and to acknowledge that traveling at all, let alone to D. C., is not easy for many of us these days. We aren’t used to thinking about coming to a NASPAA conference as a high-risk activity (although {{in the past four years}} I’ve been through a hurricane in Miami and a traffic accident in Boise). Your presence is a real statement of your commitment to this organization and to the field. I want to talk to you today about some of the challenges facing both the practice and the teaching of public administration and public affairs that have helped shape my priorities for the coming year and that are shaping the planning for next year’s conference in Los Angeles. I have been spending a fair amount of time thinking about two challenges and two concepts. One challenge is long term and ongoing: the changes in the role and structures of government world wide, roughly subsumed under the title “the New Public Management. ” The other, more immediate, challenge is the events of the past month o...|$|E
