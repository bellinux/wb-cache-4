[...] West has described his music as [...] "two chords and the truth. ... It's simple. It tells a story." [...] In 2009, West said of his music pursuits, [...] "I was lucky. You know, the dues <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to get here as an umpire are long and tedious, but the music business, because I {{was already in the}} major leagues, kind of opened a lot of doors I normally wouldn't have been able to open." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Ferguson later praised television's part in {{aiding the}} Premier League, he {{maintained}} the league's freedom of control continued to impair club's chances in European competitions: [...] "You get some ridiculous situations when you're playing on Wednesday night in Europe {{and then at}} lunchtime the following Saturday. You ask any manager if they would pick that themselves... there'd be no chance." [...] He likened television to God and said [...] "When you shake hands with the devil <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the price." [...] Arsène Wenger also criticised the influence television companies had over scheduling: [...] "At the moment, television decides. You cannot have decisive games with one team playing Friday and Tuesday, and another on Sunday and Tuesday." ...|$|E
500|$|Inside the studio, {{the song}} evolved through several musical revisions. Heylin writes, [...] "It is the song's arrangement, and not its lyrics, that {{occupies}} the musicians through the wee small hours." [...] On the fifth take, released in 2005 on the , midtake Dylan stumbles on the formula [...] "Stuck inside of Mobile" [...] {{on the fourth}} verse, and never goes back. The song contains two oft-quoted pieces of Dylan's philosophy: [...] "Your debutante just knows what you need/ But I know what you want" [...] and [...] "here I sit so patiently/ Waiting {{to find out what}} price/ <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to get out of/ Going through all these things twice".|$|E

500|$|She {{had kept}} mementos of Lennon for years, but began {{auctioning}} them off after his death, including a personally drawn Christmas card from Lennon to her, which fetched £8,800 at Christie's in August 1981. [...] With her finances in an unsteady state – {{she would say}} in 1999 that [...] "Apart from John, the men I have {{fallen in love with}} have never been good at earning a living" [...] – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991, including antiques from Kenwood. [...] She said at the time, [...] "I've enjoyed these things for 30 years. But it's time for a change." [...] Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. She later said, [...] "I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clearout, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie's. When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the bills, you're not proud and you can't take it with you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roosevelt, {{eager to}} ensure public consent for this {{controversial}} plan, {{explained to the}} public and the press that his plan was comparable to one neighbor's lending another a garden hose to put out a fire in his home.

'Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> me $15 for it' …I don't want $15 — I want my garden hose back after the fire is over." [...] To which Senator Robert Taft (R-Ohio), responded: [...] "Lending war equipment is a good deal like lending chewing gum. You don't want it back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Years {{of alcohol}} abuse {{alongside}} copious amounts of medications, initially for arthritic pain and later insomnia, took {{their toll on}} Piaf's health. A series of car accidents only exacerbated her addictions and she eventually underwent a series of surgeries for a stomach ulcer in 1959. Coupled with a deteriorating liver {{and the need for}} a blood transfusion, by 1962 she had lost a significant amount of weight, reaching a low of 30kg (66 pounds). Drifting {{in and out of consciousness}} for several months, she died of liver cancer at age 47 at her villa in Plascassier (Grasse), on the French Riviera, on 10 October 1963, the day before filmmaker and friend Jean Cocteau died. Her last words were [...] "Every damn thing you do in this life, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for." [...] It is said that Sarapo drove her body back to Paris secretly so that fans would think she had died in her hometown. She is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris next to her daughter Marcelle, where her grave is among the most visited. Buried in the same grave are her father, Louis-Alphonse Gassion, and Théo (Lamboukas) Sarapo. The name inscribed at the foot of the tombstone is Famille Gassion-Piaf. Her name is engraved on the side as Madame Lamboukas dite Édith Piaf.|$|E
2500|$|Bentley: [...] "Brett {{made that}} when we were fifteen years-old. Brett {{came up with a}} piece of paper and said 'Look at this!' and, and we all laughed and said 'That's really funny' 'cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the 'no' thing on top of it was just...it seemed {{shocking}} enough and good enough, because it represented...sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like Satan worshipers and that we were not liking God, but it was more against, in America, is [...] there's too much TV evangelism, of, you know, 'Send me monies and God will love you', and it's like [...] So that was, at the time, that was very popular, when we were starting, so that was one of the, one of the things that we still hate the most, is having to pay to be saved in some, like, ridiculous...you don't need that. You don't need anybody to tell you that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> money. So that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just...it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe...it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know...you decide." ...|$|E

Gallantry often led young men to offer the ladies ginger beer, but common decency made them refuse. Miss Bennett was very fond of ginger beer, and she drank two and {{sometimes}} three bottles during the evening; but she insisted on paying for them herself. The men liked her for that.|$|R
2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
