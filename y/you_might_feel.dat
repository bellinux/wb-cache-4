2500|$|In December 1916, Major-General Sir John Hanbury-Williams, {{head of the}} British {{military}} at Stavka, {{received word}} {{of the death of}} his son in action with the British Expeditionary Force in France. Tsar Nicholas sent twelve-year-old Alexei to sit with the grieving father. [...] "Papa told me to come sit with you as he thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> lonely tonight," [...] Alexei told the general. Alexei, like all the Romanov men, grew up wearing sailor uniforms and playing at war {{from the time he was}} a toddler. His father began to prepare him for his future role as Tsar by inviting Alexei to sit in on long meetings with government ministers.|$|E

There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat." [...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter how hard you try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] said Cecily, [...] "we {{have all}} got {{something}} to give. If you were like poor Sara Ray, and hadn't been able to collect anything, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And yet, are {{you sure}} that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>feel</b> (for her sake, I say for her sake) any slight coldness towards her on the part of--Society?' ...|$|R

5000|$|... 9 = Feeling desperate. What {{most people}} call a 10 is {{actually}} a 9. Feeling extremely freaked out {{to the point that}} it almost feels unbearable and you are getting scared of what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> do. <b>Feeling</b> very, very bad, losing control of your emotions.|$|R
6000|$|Tony did {{not believe}} her, and she {{recognized}} it. “I was once driven too hard, but this time I’ll fight,” he said. “Anything <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> tempted to do to annoy me would most certainly recoil upon yourself.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur Rotherby," [...] he said, [...] "if I have hesitated at all, it was {{for your}} sake. You are a gentleman of great position. Afterwards <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> sorry {{to think that you}} had been in such a place, or in such company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably {{not much}} yourself; but I thought that as {{these men were}} your father's tenants, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> unwilling that they should turn murderers; and as I am your father's friend, you might, for his sake, wish to prevent them murdering me." ...|$|E
6000|$|GRINNIDGE: [...] "It didn't {{occur to}} <b>you</b> that she <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> bound {{to pay you}} for the first half-dozen, and was embarrassed how to offer {{to pay for them}} alone?" ...|$|R
60|$|CROFTS [not believing him] I know, of course, that <b>you</b> perhaps <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> bound {{not to tell}} if she {{had said}} {{anything}} to you. But it's very awkward to be uncertain about it now that we shall be meeting the girl every day. We don't exactly know how we ought to feel towards her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must forgive me," [...] he said, as if {{purposely}} evading her question, [...] "for I {{give you}} my word that I {{had nothing to do}} with a regulation that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> justly <b>feel</b> was derogatory to your dignity. If you will kindly step in here a wardress in charge will explain to you what is required." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, drily, [...] "I don't quite know. What's {{born in a}} {{man will}} come out somehow, whether it's good for him or not. Now, I was {{thinking}} over another piece of work <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> inclined to put through for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} {{glad to have}} you here," [...] he said; [...] "in fact, I have been {{wondering}} if <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> disposed to stay. It is probably evident to you that I cannot do all that is necessary about this place with one pair of hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came over}} one day. I didn't see you, but I saw the girl by the window, and I {{had a few}} words with the lad. He never knew, and he felt nothing. I think the girl might have done. If you knew how awfully lonely I am, Lettice—how awfully I have been, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> sorry.|$|E
6000|$|... "God forbid, Fanny! If you'd employ your time, engage your mind, and {{cease to}} think of Lord Ballindine, you'd soon cease to be miserable. Yes; though <b>you</b> <b>might</b> never again <b>feel</b> the {{happiness}} of loving, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> still be far from miserable." ...|$|R
60|$|TOPPING. Well, in my belief, we {{all have}} a vice about us somewhere. But if I were you, Miss, I wouldn't touch bettin', not with this other on <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>might</b> get to <b>feel</b> a bit crowded.|$|R
6000|$|... "As St. Paul was a Roman. Heigho!--Well, I fear I {{have but}} one character--or, if I have two, {{they are an}} American, and a New York girl. Did I dress in scarlet, as <b>you</b> do, I <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> English too, possibly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was at {{your request}} that I {{went into the}} law. I have learned to like that profession. I have stuck to {{it as well as}} my wandering, Bohemian nature will permit, and while I do not expect you {{necessarily}} to feel any pride in such progress as I have made, I have hoped--that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> an interest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For {{those reasons}} assuredly, Little Dorrit, but for another too. So far removed, so different, {{and so much}} older, I am the better fitted for your friend and adviser. I mean, I am the more easily to be trusted; and any little {{constraint}} that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> with another, may vanish before me. Why have you kept so retired from me? Tell me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{hold you}} in the bitterest detestation and contempt, sir,' said Kate. 'If you find any {{attraction}} in looks of disgust and aversion, you--let me rejoin my friends, sir, instantly. Whatever considerations may have withheld me thus far, I will disregard them all, and take a course that even <b>YOU</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel,</b> {{if you do not}} immediately suffer me to proceed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he came back, and asked again, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> perhaps, <b>feel</b> like giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very lonely, and {{sometimes}} there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart. So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Did she?" [...] he answered. [...] "I {{sometimes}} wonder. Even now I fancy, if {{the official}} papers {{of every one}} of the nations lay side by side, with their own case stated from their own point of view, even <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> a little confused about that. Still, I am going to be very honest with you. I think myself that Germany wanted war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feared that}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> some objection. But {{certainly}} {{a young man}} with so much talent might be very useful to my uncle--might help him to do good in a better way. And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some fixed occupation. He has been blamed, he says, for not seeking something of that kind, and he would like to stay in this neighborhood because no one cares for him elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{scarcely}} {{notice it}} in the excitement," [...] the Doctor said. [...] "In cold blood I admit <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> it, but I don't think you will {{when you see the}} tiger spring out from the jungle at us. But here we are. That is the nullah in which they say the tiger retires at night. I expect the beaters are lying all round in readiness, and as soon as we have taken up our station at its mouth they will begin." ...|$|E

Her actions lead her {{to figure out the}} significance of the Reaper's Amulet, and just how personal things can get. I'm going to finish off this trilogy with an explosive ending—one filled with a myriad of flashbacks, tear-jerking family histories, a grand villain <b>you</b> <b>might</b> just <b>feel</b> sorry for, Atlantis, and the Land of the Elves!" ...|$|R

60|$|My friends, I am, as you know, a man steeled to face every danger. When one {{has served}} from the affair of Zurich to that last fatal day of Waterloo, {{and has had}} the special medal, which I keep {{at home in a}} leathern pouch, one can afford to confess when one is frightened. It may console some of you, when your own nerves play you tricks, to {{remember}} that you have heard even me, Brigadier Gerard, say that I have been scared. And besides my terror at this horrible attack, and the maddening pain of my wound, there was a sudden feeling of loathing such as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> were some filthy tarantula to strike its fangs into you.|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas More.--The {{consolation}} is {{upon your}} principle of expectant hope. Whenever improved morals, wiser habits, more practical religion, {{and more efficient}} institutions shall have diminished the moral and material causes of disease, a thoroughly scientific practice, the result of long experience and accumulated observations, will then exist, to remedy all that is within the power of human art, and to alleviate what is irremediable. To existing individuals this consolation is something like the satisfaction <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel</b> in learning that a fine estate was entailed upon your family at the expiration of a lease of ninety-nine years from the present time. But I had forgotten to whom I am talking. A poet always looks onward to some such distant inheritance. His hopes are usually in nubibus, and his expectations in the paulo post futurum tense.|$|E

"I am {{sure you}} would do {{anything}} that anyone could do," [...] the girl said kindly; [...] "but whatever <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>feel,</b> having another person behind you could not but hamper you awfully. I would infinitely rather try to escape on foot, for then I should be relying on myself, while if I was riding behind anyone, and we were pursued or attacked, I should feel all the time I was destroying his chances, and {{that if it were}} not for me he would get away. That would be terrible. I don't know whether we were wise to stay here instead of trying to escape at once; but as uncle and Mr. Hunter and the others all thought it wiser to stay, I have no doubt it was; but I am quite sure that it could not have been a good plan to go off like that on horseback." ...|$|E

My mind and nerves have been rather bumped and bruised by the shelling, {{but not so}} much as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> think. I <b>feel</b> as though I'd {{presently}} not think very much of it. Some of our men have got the stun of it a lot more than I have. It gets at the older men more. Everybody says that. The men of over thirty-five don't recover from a shelling for weeks. They go about--sort of hesitatingly....|$|R
500|$|Greg Kot, {{writer for}} the Chicago Tribune, stated that the track [...] "seduces like a drug dealer", with Ocean crooning over a laid-back rhythm. Prefix Magazines David Padula commented that it [...] "centers around a jazzy {{keyboard}} lick that dips regularly into more lush surroundings. The crisp percussion is a highlight, but the winning point is the soulful croons and general smoothness of Ocean." [...] Mike Powell's Spin praised Ocean's writing abilities, musing [...] "my 'TV ain't HD, that's too real', the narrator of 'Sweet Life' complains, then returns to his swimming-pool floatie. If the song wasn't so pretty — Ocean's velvety voice, soft jazzy accompaniment — <b>you</b> <b>might</b> even <b>feel</b> bad for him." [...] Killian Fox of The Observer reported that the song {{was one of the}} few times on the album when Ocean was actively courting heavy radio play, describing Sweet Life as a [...] "near-perfect distillation of every blissed-out summer jam from Stevie Wonder onwards." [...] Amy Dawson, critic for Metro, called the composition [...] "an irresistibly warm slice of old-school funk." ...|$|R

I’d be interested in watching a pure comedy by him — but please, nothing {{more than a couple of}} hours". The Times of India gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "India Pakistan is the kind of film that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>feel</b> compelled to watch, but if you do catch it, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not mind it. It is unremarkable in every way with its share of problems but still manages to be a mildly diverting entertainer". The New Indian Express wrote, [...] "Stronger in content than style, India Pakistan, is ideal summer fare. It strikes the right chord for the most part and {{is one of}} the better comic capers to appear in recent times". Sify wrote, [...] "Director Anand has made India Pakistan in such a way that the film is highly entertaining and it happens mainly because of the characterization and dialogue deliveries of both MS Baskar and Pasupathy who rocks big time", going on to label it [...] "a pucca commercial comedy entertainer which is tailor made for family audiences".|$|R
