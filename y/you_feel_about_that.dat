2500|$|The {{characters}} of Fairy Tail have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network describes the characters' styles {{as having a}} [...] "strong 'bite me' vibe" [...] and compared the visual style to that of One Piece author Eiichiro Oda. In his review of the second volume, Kimlinger said that Cancer's fighting style [...] "is a kick". In reviewing the first DVD/Blu-ray volume of Fairy Tail, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says [...] "with a lead character as pumped-up as Natsu, it's hard not {{to get caught up}} in his energy". Santos also praises Happy, citing his character as an [...] "entertaining diversion, proving that animal sidekicks can be fun to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance". In his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk mentions the [...] "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters". Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, [...] "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> will probably depend upon which character you prefer." [...] Silverman also thought that readers [...] "may have had mixed feelings about Jellal's return earlier in this arc, but the bond between him and Erza has been underlying their scenes for most of their page time together [...]" [...] However, she said that [...] "for the romantics in the audience, Jellal is still a criminal, and the government wants him. And so they come for him," [...] and pointed out that [...] "Erza fans and detractors will find it deepens her character a little while still finding it sad." ...|$|E

I know how <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I can spend hours, even now, in crystal gazing--I don't mean {{to see some}} silly revelation of some silly person's proceedings somewhere, but just for the things themselves. I wonder if you have ever been in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington, and looked at Ruskin's crystal collection? I saw it when I was a boy, and it became--I can't help the word--an obsession. The inclusions like moss and like trees, {{and all sorts of}} fantastic things, and the cleavages and enclosures with little bubbles, and the lights and shimmer--What were we talking about? Oh, about the keen way your feminine perceptions cut into things. And yet somehow I was throwing contempt on the feminine intelligence. I don't do justice to the order of my thoughts. Never mind. We've lost the thread. But I wish you knew my mother." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the title}} of the episode, Bell said [...] "I think for all of us, “who you really are” is {{revealed}} in these kind of situations. Which side are you on, how do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> who do you stand with, how do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> So very much on point with that is Lady Sif, {{and one of the things}} on point with that is Skye, but one of the things that I think is nice about that title is it also reflects on the rest of the team as well." ...|$|E

[...] "I'm not quite clear {{in my own}} mind how these things should be approached--if they are to be approached at all--but I am sure this is not the way. On the whole, I prefer the ruins that I have not seen to those which I have." ...|$|R

40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} a student interview in a Writing Intensive course in Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'Regardless of your plans, will this course or the writing in it remain with you? If so, how?'Brief excerpt from interview: Yeah I think so. {{it was such a}} pivotal course for me... it was one of my favorite courses I’ve taken so far mainly because of the way I felt afterwards... I felt like I improved a lot as a writer, I gained a huge understanding of planning, I have a greater understanding of myself and my interests and things I can pursue. Generally, it was like going to the gym for a workout and coming back feeling stronger – and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I want to convey to students– or anyone – that courses like this are really invaluable...|$|R
5000|$|Monica {{is portrayed}} as high {{maintenance}} and apparently the dominant one in the relationship. Chandler frequently submits to her wishes {{in order to avoid}} unnecessary conflicts and as a way to please her. Once he explained the nature of their relationship, saying: [...] "You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good <b>about</b> making <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> better <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you" [...] (in The one with the Jokes).Her bossiness, neatness and overly competitive nature forces Chandler into several situations, such as Monica being unable to throw a game of tennis against Chandler's boss and Chandler hiding {{the fact that he is}} incredibly good at ping-pong so Monica won't enter them in doubles tournaments. [...] In the alternate reality episode [...] "The One that Could Have Been", Chandler and Monica are also friends and end up together anyway, after sleeping together under different circumstances.|$|R

I {{know how}} {{differently}} <b>you</b> must <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> all <b>that</b> affects our family, {{and your own}} dignity as a young woman, before you could think of receiving secret addresses from Philip Wakem. If it was not disgusting to me in every other way, I should object to my sister's name being associated for a moment {{with that of a}} young man whose father must hate the very thought of us all, and would spurn you. With any one but you, I should think it quite certain that what you witnessed just before my father's death would secure you from ever thinking again of Philip Wakem as a lover. But I don't feel certain of it with you; I never <b>feel</b> certain <b>about</b> anything with you. At one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse self-denial, and at another you have not resolution to resist a thing that you know to be wrong." ...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2007, Boxer was in {{the news}} for {{comments}} she made when responding to Bush's plans to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. [...] "Who pays the price?" [...] Boxer asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. [...] "I'm {{not going to pay}} a personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you." [...] When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, [...] "Madam Secretary, please. I know <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> terrible <b>about</b> it. <b>That's</b> not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily... I find really appalling." ...|$|R
