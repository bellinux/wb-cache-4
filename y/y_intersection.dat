In 1953, the route became Route 83 when Route 49 was realigned to follow what was then Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe and Route 47 was aligned to follow Route S49 between South Dennis and Wildwood. In 2007, the state completed reconstruction of the intersection with Route 47 to include a traffic signal. A school bus accident has prompted the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to install a traffic signal at the <b>Y</b> <b>intersection</b> of Route 83 and US 9.|$|E

Several blocks to the north, NY111 intersects with CR67 (Long Island Motor Parkway) at an at-grade intersection on the northern edge of the community. Now out of Central Islip, the route traverses industrialized areas surrounding a large <b>Y</b> <b>intersection</b> with CR17 (Wheeler Road) in Hauppauge. NY111 takes on the Wheeler Road name, and the route immediately enters an interchange (exit56) with the Long Island Expressway (I-495). From here, the route bends northeast along Wheeler Road, paralleling the Nissequogue River as it serves the northern part of the town of Islip.|$|E
5|$|Until 2003, US 113 {{continued}} {{north from}} Milford concurrently with DE 1 along four-lane divided Bay Road to Dover. The U.S. Highway crossed the Murderkill River while passing {{to the east}} of Frederica. At the north end of Frederica, the highway met the eastern end of DE 12 (Frederica Road). US 113 passed by historic Barratt's Chapel, the birthplace of Methodism in the United States. The highway met the southern end of US 113 Alternate (Clapham Road) at a <b>Y</b> <b>intersection</b> in the village of Little Heaven. US 113 crossed the St. Jones River and curved northwest at its intersections with the southern end of DE 9 (Bayside Drive) and the western end of Kitts Hummock Road. The highway became a freeway along the edge of Dover Air Force Base. US 113 had a diamond interchange with Old Lebanon Road, which served the main gate of the air force base to the northeast and base housing to the southwest. At the next interchange, a partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of DE 10 (Lebanon Road) next to the military base's north gate, US 113 exited onto Bay Road while DE 1 continued on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway. The U.S. Highway had ramps from northbound US 113 to northbound DE 1, from southbound US 113 to southbound DE 1, and from southbound DE 1 to US 113 just south of its partial interchange with the Puncheon Run Connector, which connected DE 1 and US 113 with US 13 {{on the south side of}} Dover. US 113 entered the city of Dover and passed between the DelDOT headquarters and the Blue Hen Corporate Center, which was transformed into a corporate center from the defunct Blue Hen Mall in 1995. The route intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west into the Dover Green Historic District and by the Delaware State Capitol, before reaching its northern terminus at a <b>Y</b> <b>intersection</b> with US 13 and the northern end of US 113 Alternate (DuPont Highway).|$|E

Right after West Essex Park ends, Route 159 comes to a <b>Y</b> <b>intersection,</b> where it leaves Bloomfield Avenue and turns to the north along Oak Road; County Route 506 begins here and runs east along Bloomfield Avenue.|$|E
25|$|NY162 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US20 and NY30A in Sloansville, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Esperance. The route proceeds northward, overlapping with NY30A as the two-lane highway passes through residential areas of the town. After leaving Sloansville, NY162 and NY30A turn northwestward into a <b>Y</b> <b>intersection</b> that marks {{the north end of}} the overlap. While NY30A continues north, NY162 bends northwest to a nearby junction with the western terminus of County Route35 (CR35, named Shun Pike Road). For a short distance from CR35, NY162 proceeds westward through Esperance, turning northwest at a junction with Sprakers Road. Now a two-lane rural roadway, the route enters the town of Carlisle, running near the base of Corbin Hill.|$|E
25|$|The {{privately owned}} James River Bridge Corporation was {{chartered}} by the General Assembly {{to build a}} system of bridges across the James River, Chuckatuck Creek, and Nansemond River, as well as approach roads. On the Newport News end, the bridge simply ended at an intersection with State Route 39/U.S. Route 60 (Virginia Avenue, now Warwick Boulevard). However, a large system of approach roads, including two smaller toll bridges, {{was built on the}} Isle of Wight County side. Traffic coming off the bridge reached a <b>Y</b> <b>intersection</b> at Bartlett, at which it could head west over a private approach road past Carrollton to State Route 10 at Benns Church, or head southeast into Nansemond County. The first of the two smaller bridges was the Crittenden Bridge over Chuckatuck Creek (the county line) at Crittenden, and the second, after passing the road to Hobson and Chuckatuck (now State Route 628), was the Nansemond River Bridge over the Nansemond River. The end of the private approach road was at the current intersection of Bennetts Pasture Road (State Route 627) and Lee Farm Lane (State Route 701), where one could go south to State Route 10 (now State Route 337) at Driver. So the James River Bridge System served not only traffic crossing the James River, but also traffic along State Route 10; the 1928 Chuckatuck-Driver Kings Highway Bridge (now State Route 125) competed with the James River Bridge System for this traffic.|$|E

40|$|A topological {{hyperplane}} is a subspace of R n (or a homeomorph of it) that is topologically {{equivalent to}} an ordinary straight hyperplane. An arrangement of topological hyperplanes in R n is a finite set H such that for any nonvoid <b>intersection</b> <b>Y</b> of topological hyperplanes in H and any H ∈ H that intersects {{but does not}} contain <b>Y,</b> the <b>intersection</b> is a topological hyperplane in Y. (We also assume a technical condition on pairwise intersections.) If every two intersecting topological hyperplanes cross each other, the arrangement is called transsective. The number of regions formed by an arrangement of topological hyperplanes has the same formula as for arrangements of ordinary affine hyperplanes, provided that every region is a cell. Hoping to explain this geometrically, we ask whether parts of the topological hyperplanes in any arrangement can be reassembled into a transsective arrangement of topological hyperplanes with the same regions. That is always possible if the dimension is two but not in higher dimensions. We also ask whether all transsective topological hyperplane arrangements correspond to oriented matroids; they need not (because parallelism {{may not be an}} equivalence relation), but we can characterize those that do if the dimension is two. In higher dimensions this problem is open. Another open question is to characterize the intersection semilattices of topological hyperplane arrangements; a third is to prove that the regions of an arrangement of topological hyperplanes are necessarily cells; a fourth is whether the technical pairwise condition is necessary...|$|R

30|$|As minimum {{coverage}} increases, {{there comes}} a point where two insurers attracting low risks fit in the market.

Now, the regulation generates enough profits for two insurers offering contract y that falls into the segment L^ 2 -L^ 3. The reason is that as the minimum coverage increases, the contracts intended for low-risks start making positive profits. Since now two insurers are offering contract y, if one of them tries to make additional profits it will either attract high risks or will lose all clients. Note that this competitive effect only exists with two or more active insurers specialized in low-risks. Therefore, the pair of contracts (H^ 1,y) is a separating Nash equilibrium.|$|R
