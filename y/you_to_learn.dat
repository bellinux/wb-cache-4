2500|$|Many sources {{place the}} South Beach Diet on lists of [...] "low carb" [...] diets {{such as the}} Atkins Diet. While the South Beach diet does {{prohibit}} foods rich in simple carbohydrates such as white bread, white potatoes and white rice, {{it does not require}} dieters to forgo carbohydrates entirely or even measure their intake. Instead, it focuses on the [...] "glycemic impact" [...] (short term change in blood glucose) of foods.

Complex, fiber-rich carbohydrate sources such as brown rice and 100% whole grain bread are permitted during phase 2.

I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to choose the right fats and the right carbs." ...|$|E
