2500|$|The entire matter, as many French and British {{scientists}} and researchers have proven, {{is nothing more}} than a huge Israeli plot aimed at extorting the German government in particular and the European countries in general. But I, personally and in light of this imaginary tale, complain to Hitler, even saying to him from the bottom of my heart, 'If only <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> it, brother, if only it had really happened, so that the world could sigh in relief [...] their evil and sin.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Göring, who was {{in favor}} of expropriating the Jews rather than {{destroying}} Jewish property as had happened in the pogrom, complained directly to Sicherheitspolizei Chief Heydrich immediately after the events: [...] "I'd rather <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in two-hundred Jews than destroy so many valuable assets!" [...] ("Mir wäre lieber gewesen, ihr hättet 200 Juden erschlagen und hättet nicht solche Werte vernichtet!"). Göring met {{with other members of the}} Nazi leadership on 12 November to plan the next steps after the riot, setting the stage for formal government action.

2500|$|In the Orthodox Church {{there are}} no [...] "categories" [...] of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were {{categorized}} as [...] "mortal" [...] and [...] "venial." [...] In this definition, a [...] "mortal" [...] sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death... These categories do {{not exist in the}} Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, imagine that you commit a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very easy to take the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God's forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> You never sought God's forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. We should go to Confession when we sin—at the very least, we should ask God to forgive us daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.|$|E
