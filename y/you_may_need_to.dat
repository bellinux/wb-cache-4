50|$|Kegerators are {{generally}} {{designed for use}} with beer kegs, but they are gaining popularity for dispensing other types of drinks, most notably wine, cold brewed coffee, kombucha, and soda. With home brew kegs, you can put whatever liquid you want inside the keg, pressurize it and dispense it with a kegerator. Different types of liquids require different alterations to the dispense system. Wine and cold brewed coffee use a CO2/Nitrogen blend to pressurize the kegs. These types of drinks also require all stainless steel contact with the dispense system fittings because the higher acid content can corrode the chrome plated brass normally found in dispense systems. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> change out the beer line for silicone wine line, which {{is less likely to}} impart flavors. In many larger cities, coffee houses and wineries are offering their products in commercial kegs for use in a kegerator. If that is not available, you can always fill a home brew keg yourself.|$|R

[...] A coach having specific content knowledge and respect in a teacher's field of teaching would help build trust. Another way to build this trust is through confidentiality. By keeping all conversations confidential and sticking to that, the coachee knows that your word is good. In addition to relationship building, it is important to let the coachee feel comfortable talking <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about anything—there <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be the time when a crisis they are facing trumps conversation about the lesson. [...] Starting a coaching conversation about how life is going for a coachee is also important to relationship building.|$|R
