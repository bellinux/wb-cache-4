500|$|Critical {{reception}} was positive, {{especially from}} music journalist websites, who praised its psychedelic visuals and uses of American iconography. Consequence of Sounds Michael Roffman compared the scenic visuals to Koyaanisqatsi and [...] Exclaim! magazine's Alex Hudson called the special {{accompanied by the}} soundtrack [...] "ambitious and shapeshifting", but described some of the CGI featured as [...] "corny". Jamie Milton of This Is Fake DIY described the episode as a [...] "bold slice of national pride, beloved to the landscapes that inspired {{the making of the}} excitable producer's latest album".

Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> for.

500|$|On November 19, 1951, Zhou {{called a}} conference in Shenyang to discuss {{improvements}} to China's logistical network, but these did little to directly resolve China's supply problems. Peng visited Beijing several times {{over the next several}} months to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. By the winter of 1951–52, Peng became convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future. On February 24, 1952, the Central Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: [...] "You have this and that problem... <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?" [...] The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government. Peng also became a zealous supporter of the Three-anti Campaign due to his belief that corruption and waste were the main causes of the PVA's hardship.|$|E

2500|$|When he {{came back}} to Australia in 1886/87, Read was flabbergasted at the pickiness of the Australian public, and he wrote of it: [...] "If you have a bit of bad luck and make nothing two or three times, you are not of much account in Australia, and out of the team <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>go,</b> even if you have scored {{excellently}} on occasions."

[...] Powell enrolled at Harvard University, where he obtained a Master of Arts from the Fogg Museum in 1970. He entered the doctoral program in art history at Harvard in 1970. While working on his degree, he served as a teaching fellow. Powell's dissertation was on the work of the early American painter Thomas Cole, and he received his doctorate in 19th-century American and European art history in 1974.|$|E

2500|$|The four {{brothers}} were united in Lahore, {{but every day}} they were informed that Sher Shah was getting closer and closer. When he reached Sirhind, Humayun sent an ambassador carrying the message [...] "I have left you the whole of Hindustan (i.e. the lands to the East of Punjab, comprising most of the Ganges Valley). Leave Lahore alone, and let Sirhind be a boundary between you and me." [...] Sher Shah, however, replied [...] "I have left you Kabul. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> there." [...] Kabul was {{the capital of the}} empire of Humayun's brother Kamran, who was far from willing to hand over any of his territories to his brother. Instead, Kamran approached Sher Shah and proposed that he actually revolt against his brother and side with Sher Shah in return for most of the Punjab. Sher Shah dismissed his help, believing it not to be required, though word soon spread to Lahore about the treacherous proposal, and Humayun was urged to make an example of Kamran and kill him. Humayun refused, citing the last words of his father, Babur, [...] "Do nothing against your brothers, even though they may deserve it." ...|$|E

When the event reached the heads-up stage, {{numerous}} Vietnamese-American followers of Men Nguyen supported the latter by cheering [...] "Go on the Master" [...] at him. In response, Whitaker cheered Ulliott on by cheering [...] "Go on the Devilfish." [...] The nickname was thought up by Stephen Au-Yeung early 1997, who ran a poker game that Ulliott had frequented in Birmingham UK, who later sold him the website DevilFishPoker.com in 2005; a devilfish (or fugu) is a poisonous fish that can kill when ingested, if not properly prepared. Ulliott reduced Nguyen's stack to one chip, and the tournament director insisted upon still taking a one-hour scheduled break, over Nguyen's protests. Ulliott turned to Nguyen and said, [...] "We’re taking the break, and in all fairness to you, I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> upstairs and think about your tactics." [...] Ulliott went on to win, and the headlines the next day read, Devilfish devours the Master. Since the event, Ulliott claimed that the event was only of significance for defining his nickname.|$|E
2500|$|After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell {{became an}} outspoken {{supporter}} {{of gun control}} and a major figure in the Million Mom March. During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, [...] "You {{are not allowed to}} own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to prison." [...] O'Donnell previously had remarked, [...] "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem." [...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [...] "assault weapons." [...] She said {{at the end of the}} segment the conversation had [...] "not gone the way I had hoped" [...] and added [...] "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today." [...] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line [...] "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" [...] from the song [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] and agreed to perform [...] "My Defenses Are Down" [...] instead.|$|E

2500|$|Sackville-West {{constantly}} {{sought to}} improve Woolf's self-esteem, telling {{her not to}} think of herself as a sickly semi-reclusive who needed to hide herself from the world, but rather praised her for her health, her liveliness and sense of wit, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to a reappraisal of herself, helping her to develop a more positive self-image, and a sense that her writings were the products of her strengths, rather than her weakness. From the age of 15 on, Woolf had been led to believe by her father's doctor and her father that reading and writing had a deleterious effect on her nerves, and she needed to engage in physical labour like gardening to prevent a total collapse of her nerves, leading Woolf to spend her time obsessively engaging in physical labor. Woolf tended to push herself relentlessly until illness, whether real or imagined, became the only way that she could relax without guilt. Sackville-West was the first to persuade Woolf that her nervous aliments had been misdiagnosed, and she was better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves, advice that was taken. Under her influence, Woolf learned to spend her time switching from one form of intellectual activity to another, from writing a novel to a book review to reading a book, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength. In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: [...] "Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people? You told me in London that you had at least six novels in your head but were being severe with yourself until <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to Rodmell. Now you are at Rodmell and what of the six novels? Between Ottoline, Gertrude Stein, and bridal parties which cause you to faint, what time is there for Virginia?" [...] Sackville-West tried to persuade Woolf to learn to relax without guilt, telling her she would feel better if she only learned to rest.|$|E
