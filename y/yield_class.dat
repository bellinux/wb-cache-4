This research makes spatial assessment of climate change effect on major plantation crops in Sri Lanka, with emphasis on crop suitability of tea, rubber, and coconut. Geo-referenced maps of spatial and temporal changes in crop suitability and production potentials are generated and compared. Data pertaining to six agro-ecological zones under the study area are analyzed {{for a period of}} 1980 - 2007. Crop suitability maps are generated amalgamating yield maps and climatic factors maps using AHP in multi-criteria analysis under two time frames of 1980 - 1992 and 1993 - 2007. Percent change in crop suitability and crop <b>yield</b> <b>classes</b> is calculated based on five crop suitability and five crop <b>yield</b> <b>classes</b> during two time frames. Dynamics of climatic parameters and crop yield are recognized using geo-referenced maps. The suitability maps of the two time frames are compared to identify the changes with each crop in conjunction with changes in the prevailing climate and yield. Geographic shift of suitability, <b>yield,</b> and climate <b>classes</b> are examined. Net gain or loss in crop production is quantified. Long-termannual rainfall significantly decreased in mid-country wet zone, whereas the mean temperature of the study area increased by 1. 4 "C.

Mutations were chemically induced, and mutants were isolated from P. aeruginosa strain PA 103. Quantitative assays, both enzymatic and immunological, indicated that five mutants produced toxin A in vitro at levels of 0. 3 % or less of parental strain levels. Characterization indicated that the mutants fell into four classes and suggested that multiple genes {{are involved in the}} regulation of toxin A <b>yields.</b> <b>Classes</b> 1 to 3 produced less than 1 % of parental levels of extracellular toxin A.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{forestry}} incentives {{mean that there}} is potential {{for an increase in}} afforestation on better quality agricultural land in Scotland. As a result improved information is required about timber yields from a range of species on better quality sites for production forecasting, financial appraisal, and planning at the local, regional and strategic levels. This paper describes the development of models that enable General <b>Yield</b> <b>Class</b> (GYC) to be predicted from site factors for Douglas fir, Japanese larch and Scots pine. Temporary sample plots were established in stands below 350 m on Land Capability for Forestry class I to V sites. At each location GYC was assessed, as well as the soil, climate and topographic factors which had been demonstrated to influence forest productivity in earlier studies in Scotland. The models, based on a step-wise multiple regression procedure, indicate that mean spring temperature, geomorphic shelter (topex), and crop age are most important in determining the productivity of Douglas fir and Japanese larch. For Scots pine, mean spring temperature, mean winter temperature, and crop age are the most important factors. The models accounted for between 34 and 45 per cent of variation in General <b>Yield</b> <b>Class</b> and are sufficiently precise for estimating mean productivity at regional and national levels...|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} various methods of {{construction}} of models {{of a change}} of the short interest rate {{for the analysis of}} a term structure of an affine <b>yield</b> <b>class</b> that have been introduced by Brown and Schaefer (1991). In the present paper the analysis of three from them is carried out the V-model (VasiEek, 1977), CIR-mode 1 (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross, 1985), and MC-model (Medvedev and Cox, 1996). The main attention is given to a research of mutual properties of functions of affine structure of these models and properties of probability distributions of stochastic processes, which in these models the short interest rate follows. The analysis of the term structure of affine <b>yield</b> <b>class</b> in the literature is usually carried out under the “adjusted by risk ” equivalent martingal probability measure. In this paper the analysis is made under objective probability measure. The functions of affine structure and the probability distributions of the short interest rate are obtained in the explicit form. Usually in the literature the V-model and CIR-model are considered as the models of different classes. In the paper these models together with a MC-model are set as the models of one class.

We assess the drought risk spatially and temporally using drought probabilities and tree species vulnerabilities across Britain. We assessed the drought impact on the potential <b>yield</b> <b>class</b> of three major tree species (Picea sitchensis, Pinus sylvestris, and Quercus robur) which presently cover around 59 % (400, 700 ha) of state-managed forests, across lowland and upland sites.

Furthermore, potential production over the national forest estate for all three species in the 2080 s may decrease due to drought by 42 % in the lowlands and 32 % in the uplands in comparison to the baseline climate. Our results reveal that potential tree growth and forest production on the national forest estate in Britain is likely to reduce, and indicate where and when adaptation measures are required.

A continuing theme for the Border Group has been the relation between {{quality and quantity of}} timber production in spruce, particularly Sitka spruce. It is gener-ally accepted that the aim for Sitka spruce should be to produce a good general purpose timber. The most recent meeting discussed the results of a sawmill conversion of logs from Sitka spruce stands grown under different silvicultural regimes. Sitka spruce is intrinsically one of the lighter and weaker timbers and, to ensure that at least 80 per cent of the sawn timber is suitable for structural grades, crops should be grown within current standard silvicultural regimes with particular attention paid to the moulding of the first 6 to 8 metres of the stem which provides more than half the sawn timber. The trees should be light-branched and have the highest possible timber density. Attention must be given from planting to the thicket stage and through to final felling to the production of crops grown uniformly within their <b>yield</b> <b>classes.</b> In the higher <b>yield</b> <b>classes</b> pruning up to 5 metres may be necessary on final crop trees to maintain the strength and grade of timber rather than to provide 'clears'.

Climate surfaces developed by spatial analysis of weather data were used to predict temperature and rainfall for 87 sample sites to a resolution of 1 km(2).

Multivariate analysis of these and other soil and topographic variables indicate that temperature and exposure are most important in determining the productivity of Douglas fir on better quality sites in Scotland. As crop age increases, GYC declines and the possible reasons for this effect are discussed.
