The active <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> are considered to be {{the state of the art}} for all the modern medium and large sized wind turbines, with a few exceptions proving the rule (e.g. Vergnet). The various components of the modern active <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> vary depending on the design characteristics but all the active <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> include a means of rotatable connection between nacelle and tower (yaw bearing), a means of active variation of the rotor orientation (i.e. yaw drive), a means of restricting the rotation of the nacelle (yaw brake) and a control system which processes the signals from wind direction sensors (e.g. wind vanes) and gives the proper commands to the actuating mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|Passive <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> {{have to be}} {{designed}} {{in a way that}} the nacelle does not follow the sudden changes in wind direction with too fast a yaw movement, in order to avoid high gyroscopic loads. Additionally the passive <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> with low yaw-friction are subjected to strong dynamic loads due to the periodic low amplitude yawing caused by the variation of the inertia moment during the rotor rotation. This effect becomes more severe with the reduction of the number of blades.|$|R

50|$|To {{solve this}} problem, <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> {{incorporate}} pre-tensioned gliding bearings. These bearings have gliding pads that are pressed via pressure elements against the gliding disk {{to stabilize the}} nacelle against undesirable movement. The pressure elements can be simple steel springs, pneumatic, or hydraulic pre-tension elements, etc. The use of pneumatic or hydraulic pre-tension elements allows active control of the yaw bearing pre-tension, which provides yaw brake function.|$|R
5000|$|Windmills of the 18th century began {{implementing}} rotatable nacelles {{to capture}} wind coming from different directions. The <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> of these [...] "primitive" [...] windmills were surprisingly {{similar to the}} ones on modern wind turbines. The nacelles rotated by means of wind driven yaw drives known as fantails, or by animal power, and were mounted on the windmill towers by means of an axial gliding bearing.|$|R
5000|$|Gliding yaw bearing - Electric yaw drive: The nacelle {{is mounted}} on a {{friction}} based gliding bearing and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful electric drives. The need for a yaw brake is eliminated and {{depending on the size}} of the <b>yaw</b> <b>system</b> (i.e. size of the wind turbine) the gliding bearing concept can lead to significant cost savings.|$|E
50|$|Vertical axis wind {{turbines}} (VAWT) {{do not need}} a <b>yaw</b> <b>system</b> since their vertical rotors can face the wind from any direction and only their self rotation gives the blades a clear direction of the air flow. Horizontal axis {{wind turbines}} however need to orient their rotors {{into and out of}} the wind and they achieve that by means of passive or active yaw systems.|$|E
50|$|The yaw bearing is {{the most}} crucial and cost {{intensive}} component of a <b>yaw</b> <b>system</b> found on modern horizontal axis wind turbines. The yaw bearing must cope with enormous static and dynamic loads and moments during the wind turbine operation, and provide smooth rotation characteristics for {{the orientation of the}} nacelle under all weather conditions. It has also to be corrosion and wear resistant and extremely long lasting. It should last for the service life of the wind turbine) while being cost effective.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{components}} of the <b>yaw</b> <b>system</b> is the yaw bearing. It can be of the roller or gliding type and it serves as a rotatable connection between the tower and the nacelle of the wind turbine. The yaw bearing should be able to handle very high loads, which apart from the weight of the nacelle and rotor (the weight of which is in the range of several tenths of tons) include also the bending moments caused by the rotor during the extraction of the kinetic energy of the wind.|$|E

50|$|The yaw vane (or tail fin) is a {{component}} of the <b>yaw</b> <b>system</b> used only on small wind turbines with passive yaw mechanisms. It {{is nothing more than a}} flat surface mounted on the nacelle by means of a long beam. The combination of the large surface area of the fin and the increased length of the beam create a considerable torque which is able to rotate the nacelle despite the stabilizing gyroscopic effects of the rotor. The required surface area however for a tail fin to be able to yaw a large wind turbine is enormous thus rendering the use of such a device un-economical.|$|E
50|$|The yaw drives {{exist only}} on the active <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> and are the means of active {{rotation}} of the wind turbine nacelle. Each yaw drive consists of powerful electric motor (usually AC) with its electric drive and a large gearbox, which increases the torque. The maximum static torque of the biggest yaw drives is {{in the range of}} 200.000Nm with gearbox reduction ratios in the range of 2000:1. Consequently, the yawing of the large modern turbines is relatively slow with a 360° turn lasting several minutes.|$|R

5000|$|Roller yaw bearing - Hydraulic yaw drive: The nacelle {{is mounted}} on a roller bearing and the azimuth {{rotation}} is achieved via a plurality of powerful hydraulic motors or ratcheting hydraulic cylinders. The benefit of the <b>yaw</b> <b>system</b> with hydraulic drives {{has to do with}} the inherent benefits of the hydraulic systems such as the high power-to-weight ratio and high reliability. On the downside however the hydraulic systems are always troubled by leakages of hydraulic fluid and clogging of their high pressure hydraulic valves. The hydraulic yaw systems often (depending on the system design) also allow for the elimination of the yaw brake mechanism and their replacement with cut-off valves.|$|E
50|$|The {{yaw drive}} is an {{important}} component of the horizontal axis wind turbines' <b>yaw</b> <b>system.</b> To ensure the wind turbine is producing the maximal amount of electric energy at all times, the yaw drive is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. This only applies for wind turbines with a horizontal axis rotor. The wind turbine is said to have a yaw error if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. A yaw error implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area. (The generated energy will be proportional the cosine of the yaw error).|$|E
5000|$|The GE 1.5 {{megawatt}} {{series of}} wind turbines was developed {{with the cooperation}} of the United States Department of Energy. It consists of three fibreglass blades attached to a horizontal axis hub. The hub is connected to the main shaft which turns a multi-stage system of gears. The gears increase the rotational rate and send the kinetic energy obtained from the wind to a doubly fed electric machine, where it is converted into electrical energy. The angle of the blades and the direction which the turbine faces are controlled by an active, all electric pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>system.</b> The generator has a maximum output of [...] The generator and gearbox are contained in the nacelle which is further insulated to minimize noise emissions.|$|E
50|$|In all gliding {{bearings}} wear is {{an issue}} of concern, as well as lubrication. Conventional gliding yaw bearings incorporate gliding elements manufactured out of polymer plastics such as POM or PA. To reduce friction, wear, and avoid stick-slip effects (often present in such high friction slow moving systems), lubrication is often introduced. This solution generally solves the gliding issues, but introduces more components to the systems and increases the general complication (e.g., difficult maintenance procedures for removal of used lubricant). Some wind turbine manufacturers now use self lubricating gliding elements instead of a central lubrication system. These gliding elements are manufactured from low friction materials or composites (e.t.g Teflon) that allow reliable operation of dry (non-lubricated) gliding <b>yaw</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

30|$|According to Lin et al. (2016), {{their study}} {{considers}} three primary configurations and failure statistic analysis of wind turbines in China. This paper summarizes {{the failures of}} wind turbine components, such as frequency converters, generators, gearboxes, pitch <b>systems,</b> <b>yaw</b> <b>systems,</b> blades, braking systems and sub-synchronous machines. Although there are many failure types and various causes, we can deduce four primary reasons for these failures: lack of core technologies; inferior quality due to price competition; design standards and wind farm climate differences; and no mandatory quality certification and exterior factors, such as wind farm construction, power grids and maintenance. Finally, while aiming to improve the reliability, a reliability management method {{with regard to the}} design, manufacturing and maintenance of wind turbines was proposed.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the gliding yaw {{bearings}} and their components are designed and constructed to last the service life of the wind turbine, {{it should be possible to}} replace worn out yaw bearing gliding elements or other components of the <b>yaw</b> <b>system.</b> To allow for replace-ability of worn out components, the yaw systems are designed in segments. Usually one or more gliding planes comprise several sub-elements that contain a number of gliding elements (radial or axial or a combination). These sub-elements can be individually removed and repaired, re-fit or replaced. In this way the yaw bearing can be serviced without the need of dis-assembly of the whole gliding yaw bearing (e.g., in case of a roller yaw bearing, dis-assembly of the whole wind turbine). This rep-arability offered by the segmented design of the gliding yaw bearing is one of the most important advantages of this system against the roller yaw bearing solution.|$|E
50|$|Christian Sommer, {{the current}} owner's grandfather, built the {{windmill}} in 1861 for himself after having constructed nearby Svanemøllen {{for a group}} of Svaneke citizens a few years earlier. Kuremøllen was not as impressive as Svanemøllen: it was a bit smaller and had a boat-shaped cap rather than an onion top. It was also finished with wooden planks rather than with oak shingles. When his son Emil took the mill over in 1900, he undertook a number of improvements: first an engine, then he added self-adjusting flaps (1903) and finally opened a bakery (1912). He also replaced the cap with an onion top and added an automatic <b>yaw</b> <b>system</b> with a wind rose. In 1930 the engine was replaced and, in 1940, a new beam was installed together with new sails. From 1943, the mill was run by Christian Sommer who terminated its operation in the 1950s but continued to run the bakery until 1976. In 1978, the association, Kuremøllens Venner, was founded {{to take care of the}} mill's upkeep. They spent several years restoring the windmill, adding a new tail, repairing the shaft and the sails, and more recently recladding the tower and having the engine repaired. When the tarpaulin was renewed in 1993, it became clear that the mill had once a shingle cladding for a number of years, probably in the very beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|In 1855, ten {{influential}} {{citizens from}} Svaneke and Ibsker founded an association aimed at building a Dutch windmill. There were already four post mills in the Svaneke area but only Bechs Mølle was still fully functional. Even that, however, {{was by no}} means as productive as a modern Dutch mill. Bornholm already had considerable experience with Dutch mills, starting with the one on Christiansø built in 1761. The association therefore bought a plot of land northwest of the town, not far from the three northern post mills. They commissioned Christian Sommer from Rønne to build the mill which was completed in 1857. It had five grinders, three for flour, the others for meal and husks. Together with the mill, there was a half-timbered two-storey house with a cellar providing accommodation for the miller, initially Christian Sommer himself, who operated the mill until 1861. Thereafter Hans Anker Kofoed and his son Hans Anker ran the mill until 1920, opening a bakery in 1895 and later adding self-adjusting sails, a self-adjusting <b>yaw</b> <b>system</b> and an engine housed in a little shed northwest of the mill. During the First World War, the engine provided Svaneke with electric power. Both the windmill and the bakery ceased operations in the 1950s. In 1958, just before {{it was going to be}} demolished, the mill was acquired by Svanekes Venner who subsequently undertook extensive restoration work. Since the mill was listed in 1960, the shingles and wind rose have been replaced (1966-67), the cap and two of the sails have been completely renewed (1993-94) and the wind rose has been fully repaired (2001).|$|E
5000|$|The passive <b>yaw</b> <b>systems</b> {{utilize the}} wind force {{in order to}} adjust the {{orientation}} of the wind turbine rotor into the wind. In their simplest form these system comprise a simple roller bearing connection between the tower and the nacelle and a tail fin mounted on the nacelle and designed {{in such a way that}} it turns the wind turbine rotor into the wind by exerting a [...] "corrective" [...] torque to the nacelle. Therefore, the power of the wind is responsible for the rotor rotation and the nacelle orientation. Alternatively in case of downwind turbines the tail fin is not necessary since the rotor itself is able to yaw the nacelle into the wind. In the event of skew winds the [...] "wind pressure" [...] on the swept area causes a yawing moment around the tower axis (z-axis) which orients the rotor.|$|R
