50|$|Clarke's {{idea was}} to use an {{armoured}} vehicle of some sort equipped with a hydraulic ram to insert explosive charges into the ground ahead. The resulting explosion would form a crater into which the machine would move before repeating the cycle. Clarke's machine would require thick armour to protect itself from its own explosions at the front and from the possibility of attack from the rear. None-the-less, the machine would be lighter and very much simpler than Cultivator. Also, Clarke's machine could simply blow its way through minefields and anti-tank obstacles that Cultivator could not deal with {{and when it came}} to a block house, Clarke's machine would push explosives under its floor and blow it up - whereas Cultivator was entirely unarmed. A significant disadvantage of Clarke’s machine was its modest speed, estimated by Clarke to be only 250 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the U. S. Department of Energy`s {{environmental}} restoration and technology development activities, GTS Duratek, Inc., and its subcontractors have demonstrated an integrated thermal waste treatment system at Fernald, OH, as part the Minimum Additive Waste Stabilization (MAWS) Program. Specifically, MAWS integrates soil washing, vitrification of mixed waste streams, and ion exchange to recycle and remediate process water to achieve, through a synergistic effect, a reduction in waste volume, increased waste loading, and production of a durable, leach-resistant, stable waste form suitable for disposal. This report summarizes the results of the demonstration/testing of the soil washing component of the MAWS system installed at Fernald (Plant 9). The soil washing system was designed to (1) process contaminated soil at a rate of 0. 25 cubic <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> hour; (2) reduce overall waste volume and provide consistent-quality silica sand and contaminant concentrates as raw material for vitrification; and (3) release clean soil with uranium levels below 35 pCi/g. Volume reductions expected ranged from 50 - 80 percent; the actual volume reduction achieved during the demonstration reached 66. 5 percent. The activity level of clean soil was reduced to as low as 6 pCi/g from an initial average soil activity level of 17. 6 pCi/g (the highest initial level of soil provided for testing was 41 pCi/g). Although the throughput of the soil washing system was inconsistent throughout the testing period, the system was online for sufficient periods to conclude that a rate equivalent to 0. 25 cubic <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> was achieved...|$|R

50|$|Groundbreaking for {{the plant}} was November 18, 1952. Earthmovers began {{leveling}} the rolling farmland for the building foundations on the same day. One hundred thousand tons of structural steel, 14,500 tons of reinforcing steel in the concrete floors, 600 miles of process piping and 1,000 miles of copper tubing {{were used in the}} construction of the three process buildings. An additional 1,000 miles of tubing ran through the rest of the plant and into the control rooms. Five hundred thousand cubic yards of concrete were required to complete the project. To support this, a separate concrete batching plant was constructed on plant site to serve all contractors. It produced 200 cubic <b>yards</b> of concrete <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> It took 70 million man hours for construction.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 A feedlot cannot {{retain its}} manure {{byproduct}} indefinitely. Eventually some method of disposal must be used. A case study {{approach to this}} problem confronting a cattle feeding operation representative {{of those in the}} area was used to determine volume relationship among different product forms in order to maximize net revenue or minimize costs. The study feedlot of 14, 000 capacity, occupied 40 acres of which 3. 5 acres were used for manure storage and processing. Geographically it was in the western half of the high desert region of Antelope Valley, Los Angeles County, California. The area had an abundance of sunshine, generally dry weather conditions; warm in summer and moderate in winter. The processing plant personnel handled 32, 782 cubic yards of the stockpiled manure. Of this amount 46 percent was sold in the unprocessed product form, 35 percent sold in the processed bulk form and 19 percent as the processed package form. Some of the original 60, 000 cubic yards stockpiled were removed by out-of-area buyers using their own equipment and doing their own processing. Allocating costs by product form and volume revealed that the <b>per</b> cubic <b>yard</b> costs were 11 cents for the unprocessed product, 65 cents for the processed bulk form and 1. 89 for the processed packaged form, Additional costs were incurred when loading and delivery were made. Net revenue <b>per</b> cubic <b>yard,</b> based on an average weighted price for each product form, averaged 1. 29 for the unprocessed product, 1. 75 for the processed bulk, and 1. 91 for the processed packaged form. The total net revenue by volume was greatest for the processed bulk product. Through increased efficiencies the volume processed could be increased and the <b>per</b> cubic <b>yard</b> costs reduced. Application of plant operational harmony could increase plant capacity from 14 to 21 cubic <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> This would eliminate 416 hours of operation and reduce processing costs by seven cents <b>per</b> cubic <b>yard.</b> While no firm expressions were ascertained as to the future demand potential of the manure product a general agreement prevailed that the addition of adequate storage facilities, an inventory and better loading facilities should be considered by the management to increase sales of the processed products. Additional observations will be required to validate generalization as to scale of operations. However, those made {{during the course of this}} study would suffice for any generalization as to operational costs for a manure handling enterprise equivalent to that in the study...|$|R
