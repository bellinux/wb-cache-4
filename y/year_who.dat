5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every <b>year,</b> <b>who</b> was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda's {{service sector}} {{suffered}} during the late-2000s recession as bank lending, foreign aid projects and investment were reduced. The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health. Tourism {{is one of}} the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2007. In spite of the genocide's legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination. The number of tourist arrivals in 2013 was 864,000 people, up from 504,000 in 2010. Revenue from tourism was US$303million in 2014, up from just US$62million in 2000. The largest contributor to this revenue was mountain gorilla tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park; Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; the gorillas attract thousands of visitors per <b>year,</b> <b>who</b> are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.|$|E
