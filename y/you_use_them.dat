[...] I knew that Madonna was {{developing}} a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didn't realize how far {{she was willing to}} go before I saw Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter, Dita. Madonna took the book {{and walked out of the}} room and didn't come back until about half an hour later. Suddenly she was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. [...] "My name is Dita," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll be your mistress tonight." [...] I knew that the original [...] "Erotica" [...] would never be the same again, and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore.|$|E

(Shut those other cupboards, Miss Circumstance; never show more stock than you are obliged to, it only confuses customers. How often am I to tell you that?) YES, miss, you are quite right, there IS a slight blemish. They all have some slight flaw. The makers say they can't help it--it's in the material. It's not once in a season we get a perfect specimen; {{and when we do}} ladies don't seem to care for it. Most of our customers prefer a little faultiness. They say it gives character. Now, look at this, miss. This sort of thing wears very well, warm and quiet. You'd like one with more colour in it? Certainly. Miss Circumstance, reach me down the art patterns. NO, miss, we don't guarantee any of them over the year, so much depends on how <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>them.</b> OH YES, miss, they'll stand a fair amount of wear. People do tell you the quieter patterns last longer; but my experience is that one is much the same as another. There's really no telling any of them until you come to try them. We never recommend one more than another. There's a lot of chance about these goods, it's in the nature of them. What I always say to ladies is--'Please yourself, it's you who have got to wear it; and it's no good having an article you start by not liking.' YES, miss, it IS pretty and it looks well against you: it does indeed. Thank you, miss. Put that one aside, Miss Circumstance, please. See that it doesn't get mixed up with the unsold stock." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{what any}} kingdom or {{government}} is like must needs {{depend on what}} the king or governor of it is like; at least if that king is all-powerful, and can do what he likes. His laws will be like his character. If he be good, he will make good laws. If he be bad, he will make bad laws. If he be harsh and cruel--if he be careless and indulgent--so will his laws be. If he be loving and generous, delighting in seeing his subjects happy, then his laws will be so shaped that his subjects will be happy, if they obey those laws. But also--and {{this is a very}} serious matter, and one to which foolish people in all ages have tried to shut their eyes, and false preachers in all ages have tried to blind men's eyes-- also, I say, if his laws be good, and bountiful, and sure to make men happy, then the good king will have those laws obeyed. He will not be an indulgent king, for in his case to be indulgent will be cruelty, and nothing less. The good king will not say,--I have given you laws by which you may live happy; but I do not care whether you obey them or not. [...] I have, as it were, set you up, in life, and given you advantages by which you may prosper if you use them; but I do not care whether <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> or not. For to say that would be as much as to say that I do not care if you make yourselves miserable, and make others miserable likewise. The good king will say,--You shall obey my laws, for they are for your good. You shall use my gifts, for they are for your good. And if you do not, I will punish you. You shall respect my authority. And if you do not--if you go too far, if you become wanton and cruel, and destroy your fellow-subjects unjustly off the face of the earth; then I will destroy you off the face of he earth, and burn up your city. I will destroy any government or system of society which you set up in opposition to my good and just laws. And if you merely despise the gifts, and refuse to use them--then I will cast you out of my kingdom, inside which is freedom and happiness, and light and knowledge, into the darkness outside, bound hand and foot, into the ignorance and brutal slavery which you have chosen, where you may reconsider yourself, weeping and gnashing your teeth as you discover what a fool you have been.|$|E

5000|$|Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie has {{received}} mostly positive reception. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku called the film a [...] "solid {{addition to the}} franchise and a great capstone to the often shaky Arise story", praising the action scenes in particular as [...] "excellent from start to finish". His criticisms of the film were on the reliance of homages to other Ghost in the Shell property, saying that [...] "homages are fine; but like any trope in film, they lose their charm if <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> too often". He ended his review wishing to see further exploration into the Arise universe, albeit satisfied with Arise as a whole.|$|E

Merloni stated [...] "It was like teaching your teenage daughter about sex education.

5000|$|Kamidori is a turn based SRPG {{comparable}} to other popular titles like Fire Emblem in which playable units {{are set up}} on a map grid where they take turns fighting against computerized opponents.

Certain aspects of the map can only be traversed by particular units that have the proper skills to do so and there are a wide variety of enemy strengths and weaknesses, giving a depth of strategy on which units you choose to take into battle and how <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
