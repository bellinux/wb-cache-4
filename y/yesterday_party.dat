60|$|This bold surmise, however, {{she soon}} learnt comprehended but half the fact. The anxious affection, {{which she was}} accused of having {{continually}} watched in Isabella's every look and action, had, {{in the course of}} their <b>yesterday's</b> <b>party,</b> received the delightful confession of an equal love. Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James. Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest, wonder, and joy. Her brother and her friend engaged! New to such circumstances, the importance of it appeared unspeakably great, and she contemplated it as one of those grand events, of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return. The strength of her feelings she could not express; the nature of them, however, contented her friend. The happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion, and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy.|$|R

The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour; and, on Anne's quitting it to call her sister, Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their <b>yesterday's</b> <b>party.</b> Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it; and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world, that nobody could imagine how charming it had been, and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive. Such was the information of the first five minutes; the second unfolded thus much in detail--that they had driven directly to the York Hotel, ate some soup, and bespoke an early dinner, walked down to the pump-room, tasted the water, and laid out some shillings in purses and spars; thence adjoined to eat ice at a pastry-cook's, and hurrying back to the hotel, swallowed their dinner in haste, to prevent being in the dark; and then had a delightful drive back, only the moon was not up, and it rained a little, and Mr. Morland's horse was so tired he could hardly get it along.|$|R

60|$|February 25.--Our <b>party</b> <b>yesterday</b> {{went off}} very gaily; much laugh and fun, and I think I enjoyed it {{more from the}} rarity of the event--I mean from having seen society at home so seldom of late. My head aches {{slightly}} though; yet we were but a bottle of Champagne, one of Port, one of old Sherry, and two of Claret, among four gentlemen and three ladies. I have been led from this incident to think of taking chambers near Clerk, in Rose Court.[193] Methinks the retired situation should suit me well. There {{a man and woman}} would be my whole establishment. My superfluous furniture might serve, and I could ask a friend or two to dinner, as I have been accustomed to do. I will look at the place to-day.|$|R
40|$|You {{will never}} believe what {{happened}} at the <b>party</b> <b>yesterday!</b> Ellen kissed Ruben and Peter…. Suppose this is the last thing you read in your friend’s e-mail before your computer breaks down. If you have some prior knowledge regarding the situation described, you would be able to guess how the interrupted sentence could continue without great difficulty. For example, if you know that Ellen was secretly in love with both Peter and Ruben and you know she has a certain reputation, she may have kissed them both, but if you know she has a crush on Ruben, but definitely not on Peter, the remaining part of the sentence would more likely be something like (Ellen kissed Ruben and Peter) smiled his approval from a distance. The main question of the research presented in this dissertation is whether readers’ knowledge of a situation immediately affects the structural analysis (i. e. parse) of a sentence. This knowledge is called situational knowledge and is provided by means of discourse context. More generally, the question is whether non-syntactic factors immediately affect the initial parse of a sentence or whether it is solely determined on the basis of syntax-based parsing preferences. Syntactic ambiguity, specifically, the NP-/S-coordination ambiguity, is used as a research tool. The aim is to demonstrate effects of situational knowledge not only at the point of disambiguation, but also {{at the onset of the}} ambiguity. A second question is how situational knowledge interacts with other, particularly syntactic factors. In order to investigate this question, the influence of situational knowledge is not only investigated in isolation, but also in contrast to another factor, viz. subject-verb agreement. In particular, it is investigated which factor outweighs the other if both factors conflict. Results of a series of off-line experiments, self-paced reading experiments and an eye movement experiment are discussed. The results show that the parsing process is immediately affected by situational knowledge, a non-syntactic factor that is often even considered non-linguistic. Furthermore, it turns out that a syntactic constraint (in this case subject-verb agreement) eventually overrules the initial analysis of the critical sentence as determined by situational knowledge. On the basis of these results, parsing is argued to be a highly interactive, dynamic process that changes in response to the strength of various sources of information. This dissertation should be of interest to those interested in sentence processing and its interfaces with discourse representation...|$|R
6000|$|Milton {{says that}} the love of fame is the last {{infirmity}} of noble minds. I think he had not rightly considered the subject. I believe that last infirmity is the love of getting things cheap! Understand me, now. I don't mean the love of getting cheap things, by which one understands showy, trashy, ill-made, spurious articles, bearing certain apparent resemblances to better things. All really sensible people are quite superior to that sort of cheapness. But those fortunate accidents, which put within {{the power of a}} man things really good and valuable for half or a third of their value, what mortal virtue and resolution can withstand? My friend Brown has a genuine Murillo, the joy of his heart and the light of his eyes, but he never fails to tell you, as its crowning merit, how he bought it in South America for just nothing,--how it hung smoky and deserted {{in the back of a}} counting-room, and was thrown in as a makeweight to bind a bargain, and, upon being cleaned turned out a genuine Murillo; and then he takes out his cigar, and calls your attention to the points in it; he adjusts the curtain to let the sunlight fall just in the right spot; he takes you to this and the other point of view; and all this time you must confess that, in your mind as well as his, the consideration that he got all this beauty for ten dollars adds lustre to the painting. Brown has paintings there for which he paid his thousands, and, being well advised, they are worth the thousands he paid; but this ewe lamb that he got for nothing always gives him a secret exaltation in his own eyes. He seems to have credited to himself personally merit to the amount of what he should have paid for the picture. Then there is Mrs. Croesus, at the <b>party</b> <b>yesterday</b> evening, expatiating to my wife on the surprising cheapness of her point-lace set. [...] "Got for just nothing at all, my dear!" [...] and a circle of admiring listeners echoes the sound. [...] "Did you ever hear anything like it? I never heard of such a thing in my life;" [...] and away sails Mrs. Croesus as if she had a collar composed of all the cardinal virtues. In fact, she is buoyed up with a secret sense of merit, so that her satin slippers scarcely touch the carpet. Even I myself am fond of showing a first edition of [...] "Paradise Lost" [...] for which I gave a shilling in a London bookstall, and stating that I would not take a hundred dollars for it. Even I must confess there are points on which I am mortal.|$|R
60|$|During {{the next}} three or four days, while the {{preparations}} for the dinner and the election were going on, he was busy in respect to the American railway. He again went down to Liverpool, and at Mr Ramsbottom's advice prepared {{a letter to the}} board of directors, in which he resigned his seat, and gave his reasons for resigning it; adding that he should reserve to himself the liberty of publishing his letter, should at any time the circumstances of the railway company seem to him to make such a course desirable. He also wrote a letter to Mr Fisker, begging that gentleman to come to England, and expressing his own wish to retire altogether from the firm of Fisker, Montague, and Montague upon receiving the balance of money due to him,--a payment which must, he said, be a matter of small moment to his two partners, if, as he had been informed, they had enriched themselves by the success of the railway company in San Francisco. When he wrote these letters at Liverpool the great rumour about Melmotte had not yet sprung up. He returned to London {{on the day of the}} festival, and first heard of the report at the Beargarden. There he found that the old set had for the moment broken itself up. Sir Felix Carbury had not been heard of for the last four or five days,--and then the whole story of Miss Melmotte's journey, of which he had read something in the newspapers, was told to him. 'We think that Carbury has drowned himself' said Lord Grasslough, 'and I haven't heard of anybody being heartbroken about it.' Lord Nidderdale had hardly been seen at the club. 'He's taken up the running with the girl,' said Lord Grasslough. 'What he'll do now, nobody knows. If I was at it, I'd have the money down in hard cash before I went into the church. He was there at the <b>party</b> <b>yesterday,</b> talking to the girl all the night;--a sort of thing he never did before. Nidderdale is the best fellow going, but he was always an ass.' Nor had Miles Grendall been seen in the club for three days. 'We've got into a way of play the poor fellow doesn't like,' said Lord Grasslough; 'and then Melmotte won't let him out of his sight. He has taken to dine there every day.' This was said during the election,--on the very day on which Miles deserted his patron; and on that evening he did dine at the club. Paul Montague also dined there, and would fain have heard something from Grendall as to Melmotte's condition; but the secretary, if not faithful in all things, was faithful at any rate in his silence. Though Grasslough talked openly enough about Melmotte in the smoking-room Miles Grendall said never a word.|$|R
40|$|It is {{currently}} assumed that intonation {{may be used}} to indicate information packaging. Lambrecht (1994) has shown that a same utterance may be associated with different information structures and he distinguished between three types of constructions, which he named (i) predicate-focus, (ii) argument-focus, and (iii) sentence-focus. They are exemplified in (1) with English and French utterances, in which the small caps indicate prosodic prominence. (1) a. [context: What happened to your car?] My car/It broke DOWN. predicate-focus structure (Ma voiture) elle est en PANNE. (1) b. [context: I heard your motorcycle broke down?] My CAR broke down. argument-focus structure C'est ma VOITURE qui est en panne. (1) c. [context: What happened?] My CAR broke down. sentence-focus structure J'ai ma VOITURE qui est en PANNE. To determine the information structure of an utterance, a possibility is to consider questionanswer pairs rather than utterances in isolation. The intonative difference between (1 a-c) is identified with the difference between the three types of questions presented as a description of the context of (1). And it {{is currently}} assumed that the context of a question determines the form of the answer and in particular its prosody (a. o. Krifka 2001). Yet, different observations seem to contradict this thesis. For example, in his works on C-Accent and implicational answers, Büring showed that a speaker displays different answering strategies : he can simply answer to the question under discussion (QUD), or answer it and by the same token add a new QUD. In other words, Büring showed both the importance and the limitations of notions of congruence and congruent answer to account for prosody in dialogue. The aim {{of this paper is to}} challenge the role of question-answer pairs to study focus and prosody and to show the importance of the notion of discourse strategy, which has to do, not only with focus and QUD, but also with the way conveyed information is structured (at-issue content vs. projected content) and the way a topic may be promoted. We would like present the results of two experiments on the prosody of informational focus in French (a production experiment and a perception one) which show that even in the context of an explicit question, the speaker may choose between different answering strategies. 1. Design of the experiments Our study concerns the realisation and the interpretation of utterances replaced the context of an explicit question. We consider both All Focus answers (2 a) and Narrow Focus ones (2 b). (2) a. What happened? [Jean invited Marie to the <b>party</b> <b>yesterday</b> night]F b. Who did Jean invite? Jean invited [Marie]F to the <b>party</b> <b>yesterday</b> night In terms of prosody, we distinguish two types of markings : (i) the placement of the nuclear contour (NC), which is a tonal event (cf Di Cristo 1999), whose variations convey different pragmatic interpretations, and (ii) an initial accentuation (IA) which may form an “accentual arc” with the following rising accent, or triggers a high plateau up to the following accent. IA or high plateau are generally implemented quite high in the pitch range (cf Astesano et al. 2007) First experiment: production Participants were presented with question-answer pairs embedded in short contexts like (3). The contexts and the questions were presented visually and auditorily. The participants' task was to read aloud the answer as if they were actually participating in the dialogue. Two types of questions are presented to 14 subjects: wh-questions (bearing on the object) and what happened?-type questions. We recorded 112 answers. Second experiment: perception We ran a perception experiment in order to check whether the productions resulting from the first experiment are recognized as appropriate in context by native speakers. 24 participants had to listen to 20 utterances and to determine to what type of question (what happened?- question or wh-question) each utterance had been produced as an answer. The aim of this experiment was to check whether the constituent resolving a partial question has to be marked by NC placement or whether IA alone is recognized as a way of marking it. 2. Results: two types of markings In the case of answers to a broad question (i. e. what happened?-type), 69, 2 % of them involve the placement of NC at the end of the utterance, whereas only 30, 8 % involve it on the right edge of the object. As for answers to a partial questions, object NPs are distinguished in three different ways: (i) NC on object + IA (49 %), (ii) NC on object and no IA (11 %), (iii) IA on object and NC at the end of the utterance (23, 6 %). The perception experiment shows that participants clearly distinguished between answers to broad or partial questions, and that narrow focus are recognized when they bear an initial accent without being the exponents of the nuclear contour as well as when they are the exponents of the nuclear contour. Accordingly, we conclude that narrow focus can be brought out either by NC placement or by an initial accentuation. 3. Explanation: direct vs. indirect answering strategies The results presented above lead us to dissociate focus marking from question/answer congruence. The data show that even when a question is explicitly addressed, Speaker may answer by accommodating another question. The answer is then an indirect answer, it is not the answer to the explicitly addressed question, but an answer to an implicit question (Roberts 1996, Büring, 2004). Our claim is that Speaker may answer indirectly to broad and to partial questions: in the former case, Speaker accommodates a more specific question, a wh- one, and in the latter case she accommodates a what happened?- question. When Speaker answers to a partial question by placing the NC at the end of the utterance and by highlighting the object, she accommodates a broad question, and that when she answers to a broad question by placing the NC at the end of the object, she accommodates a partial question. Then, the core of our proposal is that NC placement always marks informational focus (the content that is specifically asserted, as defined by Jacobs (1991)) and that IA plays a discursive role : or it indicates that the answer is an indirect one, or it indicates a “topic promotion”, when it appears inside the constituent with the NC. In each case, it triggers the accommodation of the implicit question : "What about XP?". References: Astésano, C.; Bard, E.; Turk, A. 2007.

SEVERAL PERSONS SHOT.PORTADOWN, MONDAY. <b>Yesterday,</b> {{a serious}} <b>party</b> row {{took place at}} Maghery, a village {{situated}} {{on the shores of}} Lough Neagh, and distant about six miles (10 km) from Portadown. A man named Thomas Irwin died a couple of days previously at his residence in the townland of Cranfield, and his remains were yesterday removed for interment in Milltown graveyard. Irwin was an old and respected member of the Orange Institution, and his brethren of the Loughgall district turned out in considerable numbers to pay him their last tribute of respect. When passing through Maghery a most dastardly and cowardly attack was made on the procession. A Nationalist mob assailed the Orangemen, and endeavoured to beat them back with sticks and other weapons. Stones were showered into the procession, and the hearse was repeatedly struck with the missiles. A regular riot ensued, and in the fight which followed it is alleged that some of the Orange Party who were attacked in this disgraceful manner described fired revolver shots at their assailants. Two members of the Nationalist mob were shot though the wounds inflicted are said not to be of a dangerous character. A number of persons on both sides received wounds of a more or less serious nature inflicted with stones and other weapons used during the progress of the affray.Information was subsequently conveyed to Portadown, and District Inspector Bigley, Head Constable Donnelly, Sergeants Belford and McQueen, and all the available constables in both barracks drove out {{to the scene of the}} disturbances. Acting on information received some time after their arrival in Maghery, the police arrested two prominent members of the Orange party, and when conveying them to the Birches police barrack they were fired at by a crowd of Nationalists. Some of the police dismounted and pursued the crowd to the shores of the lough, where they arrested twelve members of the party. The peace officers subsequently found a loaded gun and powder cask convenient to the place where the shots were fired. Eye-witnesses of the occurrence state that the attack on the funeral procession was thoroughly organised, and that the Nationalist mob fought fiercely and with determination. The affair has naturally aroused considerable indignation and party feeling in the district surrounding Maghery, and the occurrence formed the sole subject of conversation in the neighbourhood yesterday and today.Captain Slacke, Divisional Commissioner, and Mr. Warburton, county inspector, visited the scene of the occurrence today and made inquiries respecting the affray. In the afternoon the prisoners were brought before Mr. N. L. Townsend, R.M. Armagh, in the Clonmacate Courthouse, Wm. John Vemer and David Fox, member of the Orange party, were charged with firing at and wounding Patrick Tennyson; and the following members of the Nationalist party were charged with unlawful assembly and firing shots: David Skelton, John McNally, James McHelly, Edward Robinson, William Donnolly, Daniel Gallagher, Henry Quinn, John McGrath, James McNally, Daniel Hagan, Joseph Hogan, and Francis Campbell.District Inspector Bigley, of Portadown, conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Crown:Mr. W. H. Wright, solicitor, Portadown, defended Verner and Fox, and the Nationalist prisoners were not professionally represented.After a number of depositions had been taken Mr. Townsend remanded the prisoners for eight days, accepting bail for the appearance of the Nationalist defendants themselves in $20 each, and two sureties of $10. His Worship refused to accept bail for the Protestant prisoners, Verner and Fox, who were charged with firing at and wounding, and they we accordingly conveyed to Armagh Jail this evening. During the affray two members in the Protestant party were wounded with revolver bullets. Their names are Eliza Wilson and Robert McMinn. It is said that the Nationalist defendants who fired at the police when they had Verner and Fox in custody will be charged with riot at a portion of the day prior to the time they were arrested.|$|R
40|$|The Democratic state central {{committee}} decided <b>yesterday</b> that the <b>party</b> 2 ̆ 7 s 1982 U. S. Senate candidate will be chosen at a convention in Roanoke June 4 - 5. The June 4 - 5 date means the Democrats will be choosing their Senate nominee the same weekend as state Republicans and {{will mark the}} first time in modern Virginia political history that the two parties have held conventions at the same time. But few members of the Democratic committee [...] its dominant mood was euphoric because of the party 2 ̆ 7 s sweep of the three statewide offices last month [...] expressed concern about the conflict of dates with the Republicans who will stage their convention in Richmond. The euphoria also was reflected in the standing ovations and cheers that greeted Gov. -elect Charles S. Robb and his running mates, Lt. Gov. -elect Richard J. Davis and Attorney General-elect Gerald L. Baliles. Each made a short thank-you speech and envisioned the leadership Democrats, who had not elected a governor since 1965, would provide Virginia. And the euphoria was reflected when James S. Cremins, a Richmond railroad lawyer who is state party treasurer and who ordinarily speaks in conservative tones, gave not a financial report, but a rousing post-election pep talk. Democrats, Cremins said, are a 2 ̆ 2 vital force 2 ̆ 2 again. But the euphoria was coupled with uncertainty over whom the 1982 Democratic Senate nominee will be and whether {{he will be able to}} maintain the party as Cremins 2 ̆ 7 vital force. Not surprisingly, committee members talked in small groups of prospective candidates; some of whom were present at yesterday 2 ̆ 7 s meeting. Among those there who have been mentioned as possible candidates were former Attorney General Andrew P. Miller, a narrow loser in 1978 to Sen. John W. Warner, and state Sens. Hunter B. Andrews of Hampton and Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. of Fairfax. And Del. Owen B. Pickett of Virginia Beach was there in his role as state party chairman. But the man who emerged as the favorite of many of the committee members was one who was not there [...] former Sen. William B. Spong Jr., who is dean of the College of William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s Marshall-Wythe law school and who has not returned phone calls from reporters wanting to ask if he would consider running. Spong was the winner of an unscientific, informal poll of committee members who were asked to name their top three choices for Senate nomination. Votes were weighted on a 3 - 2 - 1 point basis and Spong had 137 points. Trailing him were Miller (118), Andrews (95), and Pickett (81). Spong served one term in the Senate and was defeated in 1972 by former Sen. William L. Scott, in part because of poor campaign organization and because he was victim of one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s first negative media advertising campaigns. A possible Spong candidacy reportedly also received warm support at a Friday night meeting of a broad range of white and black party leaders. The meeting drew national committeemen, state party officers, General Assembly members and at least two congressional district chairmen, Angus H. Macaulay of the 3 rd and Robert Crouch of the 5 th. There also were expressions of backing for Pickett, who was viewed as a man who would be able, as Robb did, to command support from the state 2 ̆ 7 s financial establishment. One source denied that the meeting had been designed to launch a stop-Miller movement. But another source said that some at the meeting talked of Miller, who also was a narrow loser to Henry Howell in the divisive 1977 gubernatorial primary, as a 2 ̆ 2 man who has had his chances. 2 ̆ 2 Crouch acted as official spokesperson for those who attended the meeting. His only comment on what was discussed was 2 ̆ 2 we talked about everybody who has been mentioned by the Great Mentioner. 2 ̆ 2 Crouch said the group will meet again in January, with its goal being to achieve party unity behind what it perceives the strongest. A search for party unity was the reason Democrats, who traditionally have chosen candidates in a primary, will name their 1982 Senate candidate at a convention. The Democrats 2 ̆ 7 first convention to name a Senate candidate in more than three decades was in 1978 when Miller was nominated. In voting to hold the 1982 convention in Roanoke, the {{central committee}} endorsed a recommendation by the Democratic steering committee, which met yesterday morning. A proposal by a smattering of Northern Virginia central committee members to hold a primary was rejected by a voice vote. The steering committee briefly considered a May 21 - 22 convention, but abandoned that idea because, one of its members said later, 2 ̆ 2 almost every college and high school in Virginia is holding graduation that weekend. 2 ̆ 2 In other action, the central committee approved the addition of a representative of the Democratic Black Caucus to the policy-making steering committee. The move was urged as a means of recognizing the overwhelming black support for Robb, Davis and Baliles...|$|R
