500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Keeler, who had been {{watching}} a lot of Frasier {{at the time and}} had been assigned to write a Sideshow Bob episode and {{he thought it would be}} a good idea to mix the two. Pierce was cast as Sideshow Bob's brother, causing Pierce to joke, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] While Sideshow Bob is addressing the crowd, a man near the back raises his hand and says [...] "probably"; he is also voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who had wanted to be a man in a crowd.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "Brother from Another Series" [...] {{introduces}} Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler {{was assigned}} to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom {{he refers to as}} [...] "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.|$|E
500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost people have never heard of me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to get a guy with a great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight better take it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E

2500|$|Mrs Robinson is four-part {{series that}} focuses on the {{relationship}} and subsequent engagement between Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). The pair meet in an airport bar after they both leave Erinsborough for a while, anthen deciding to go to an island in Queensland together. The actors spent two days filming on Heron Island. Dennis admitted that he was excited to film on the island, as he had always wanted to go. He also revealed that the shoot avoided the show's [...] "location filming curse", which causes the weather to turn bad when they film away from their studio in Nunawading. Dennis added [...] "That's what I love about the web series, even though I'm still playing Paul Robinson and even though it's kind of Neighbours, it's also completely different so <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to play, dipping our toes in something else." ...|$|E

"Well, I kissed {{you because}} I like {{you very much}} and because {{you are going to}} stay and ride with me tomorrow," [...] she said, positively; and then she added, slyly, [...] "I may kiss you again, if <b>you</b> don't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to run away very soon." ...|$|R

6000|$|Tracy blushed. Barrow added: [...] "Earldom! Oh, yes, take it, if it offers; but {{meantime}} we'll go {{on looking}} around, {{in a modest}} way, and if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to superintend a sausage-stuffer at six or eight dollars a week, you just trade off the earldom for a last year's almanac and stick to the sausage-stuffing." ...|$|E

"There, you see, Harry," [...] the old sailor said, [...] "you {{were just}} as ready to fight {{as if you had}} been on a man-of-war; and while in a sailing ship <b>you</b> only <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> if one of these privateers happens to see you, in a king's ship you go looking about for an enemy, and when you see one the chances are he is bigger, instead of smaller, than yourself." ...|$|R
