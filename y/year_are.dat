A Rose makes the important decisions within this group, since she has control over the student council.

5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each <b>year</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs.

The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per <b>year</b> <b>are</b> set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|E

There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (including rugby, hockey, reading, and chess) and then {{at the end of the}} year the points awarded in each event throughout the <b>year</b> <b>are</b> added up, and the house with most points is awarded the Cock House Cup, which is the traditional name given in British public schools for the in-school competition cup.|$|E
5|$|Initial DVT {{costs for}} an average hospitalized patient in the U.S. are around $7,700–$10,800. VTE {{follow-up}} costs at three months, six months, and a <b>year</b> <b>are</b> about $5,000, $10,000, and $33,000 respectively; in Europe, the three and six-month figures are about €1,800 and €3,200. Post-thrombotic syndrome is a significant contributor to DVT follow-up costs. Annual DVT costs in the U.S. are an estimated $5 billion or in excess of $8 billion, and the average annual cost per treated individual {{is thought to be}} about $20,000. As an example, if 300,000 symptomatic DVT patients were treated at costs averaging $20,000 annually, that would cost $6 billion a year.|$|E

5|$|No part of M-134 {{is listed}} on the National Highway System, a system of roadways {{important}} to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In 2009, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) conducted a survey to determine the traffic volume along the highway, reported using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). The department determined that the highest count was the 3,595vehicles a day that used the highway west of the M-129 junction in Cedarville; the lowest counts were 608vehicles daily between the M-48 junction and the De Tour village limits. On the island, 667vehicles use M-134 daily.

5|$|On {{the supply}} side, since 2005 the {{gasoline}} fuelling stations selling more than 3 million liters of fuel a <b>year</b> <b>are</b> required {{to sell at}} least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008. Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 they represented just {{two percent of the}} four million Swedish vehicles. In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.|$|E

The school employs 81 staff, including teachers, therapists and autism consultants, and the school board is headed by founder, ARC president and Member of Parliament Denise Phua. Operating costs of the school are paid by the Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service, while other costs, estimated at S$5 million per <b>year,</b> <b>are</b> funded through fees, donations, merchandise sales and fundraising events. Under the partnership between Pathlight School and Eden School, the two schools have a centralised admission system and share various resources; together, they form the national provision of education for children across the autism spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each <b>year</b> <b>are</b> AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E
5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply each <b>year</b> <b>are</b> accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers in creative writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art. The emphasis is on performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On standardized tests, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E

Since 2000, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009; 231 in 2013).|$|E
5|$|The 1130 Pipe Roll {{noted that}} Pain was a royal justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke. Besides the {{ordinary}} court, Pain also heard cases {{relating to the}} forest law in those counties. The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that <b>year</b> <b>are</b> missing from it. Also in 1130, Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric. The Diocese of Hereford had been vacant {{since the death of}} Richard de Capella in August 1127, and the king consulted with Pain and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—Robert de Bethune, the prior of Llanthony Priory. In 1132 Pain was present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry. Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134. As lord of Caus, Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding. Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.|$|E

Although most Boulonnais are in France, a few are exported. In 1999, fifteen foals were exported to Brazil and one stallion to Argentina. On average, a little over a dozen horses a <b>year</b> <b>are</b> exported, mainly to Brazil and Belgium for breeding and to Germany for forestry work.
