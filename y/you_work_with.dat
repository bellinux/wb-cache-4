During {{the early stages}} of production for The Definition Of..., Fantasia posted several videos on her social media accounts of her recording sessions with Kelly. In promotional interviews, Fantasia said that the album was initially produced by another artist who she “really, really, really loved", but she switched to a different team for the final product. She explained: [...] "Sometimes, when <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> producers who are artists, it’s very hard, They are doing their thing … and things got a little chaotic.” Derrick G. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times speculated that Kelly was the producer mentioned by Fantasia.|$|E

James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote that, Andy's Play' {{was the kind}} of strong, character driven episode I've missed from the show—not just good by later season standards but an actual good Office episode, period." [...] Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic wrote that the episode was a reminder of [...] "what has always been great about this show". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode [...] "worked largely because it embraced [...] idea" [...] that [...] "the bonds you form at work go deeper than carpet, and that if <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> people long enough they can feel like your family."

500|$|Animal rights {{organization}} PETA accused the film's producers of using animals {{that had previously}} been abused. Two chimpanzees who appear in the movie, Cody and Sable, were surrendered by their owner to settle a lawsuit that documented allegations of beatings and mistreatment. The film's director, Tom Shadyac, said of PETA's criticisms [...] "They're not wrong. There's a certain amount of hypocrisy whenever <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> animals, even to show, which we hope we're showing, that respect of all of God's creation...I don't know. I respect their criticism." [...] PETA was also critical of Birds & Animals Unlimited, the primary animal supplier to the film, for alleged serious and continuing violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act, including failure to comply with veterinary care requirements and failure to provide shelter from heat and sunlight, which PETA details and claims it can document. A Universal Studios spokesperson declared: [...] "The live animals used in the filming of Evan Almighty were supplemented by a great number of computer-generated animals, {{but it would have been}} impossible to depend on CGI exclusively as some key scenes in the film demonstrate the need for peaceful and productive co-existence between man and animals. One of the most prominent, inescapable messages of the film is the responsibility that humans have to protect and care for animals." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

So many times, especially if you're working with younger actors, the director says [...] "cut" [...] and, boom, they scatter like quail. They've got to go make a phone call or leave for a date. Duke usually ends up directing a picture about halfway into it and he wants his actors on the set. He doesn't want to have to look around for them at the honey wagon or in their trailer.

40|$|Abstract My {{examination}} {{paper is}} about how <b>you</b> can <b>work</b> <b>with</b> fairytales as an educational tool in order to strengthen young students’ self-esteem. Specialist literature and findings show that the fairytale {{can be used in}} order to strengthen self-esteem. As teachers we have a big part in this to help the students to develop and make them trust their own abilities. <b>You</b> can <b>work</b> <b>with</b> fairytales in many different ways and it’s often popular among the students. The purpose with this paper is to check how fairy tales and self-esteem are connected and how <b>you</b> can <b>work</b> <b>with</b> it in school. The methods I’ve used are a combination of observation and qualitative interview. I have studied two different schools where I observed two teachers, in this case when they read fairytales and then I interviewed them. During the interview I used a recorder to get as much information as possible of the interview {{and to be able to}} listen many times. Both of the teachers I interviewed <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> fairytales but in different kind of ways. Lena used fairytales as an inspiration to <b>work</b> creative <b>with</b> for an example drama, art, storytelling etc. while Lisa used fairytales to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the text and the language.
