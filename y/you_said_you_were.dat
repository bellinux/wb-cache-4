5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E

[...] and walked off the set. Griffin was, uncharacteristically, completely flustered.|$|E

60|$|THE WOMAN. Snobby's a carpenter, ain't it? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> a painter.|$|R
60|$|THE ORDERLY. Well, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> dashed, Sir; and you {{did look}} if youll excuse my saying it, Sir--well, you looked it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> goin' {{to have a}} party!" [...] And Master Kelly, forgetting his own {{caution to}} the boys not to appear {{interested}} in the scheme, looked decidedly disappointed.|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. I am {{glad you}} have come: I {{want to speak}} to you. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going, Frank, I think.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} thinking. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a stenographer--we need stenographers, clerks. You {{will not be}} wasted. Come in here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{remember}} something about that," [...] said the other. [...] "I think, too, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> interested in Californian real estate." ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Gaunt, {{smoothing}} and {{smoothing the}} lined, thin cheeks of the parchmenty, thin-nosed face that Frances Freeland {{had thought to}} be almost like a gentleman's, answered: [...] "I thart <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> goin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did a bit o' {{thinking}} this morning," [...] ses Sam, nodding at 'em, [...] "and I don't mind owning up that it <b>was</b> owing to wot <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> <b>You</b> <b>was</b> right, Ginger, arter all." ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--All right. Maybe I do. But don't rub it in. Why ain't <b>you</b> {{done what}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> going to? Why ain't {{you got that}} ship {{was going to take}} you to the other side of the earth where you'd never see me again? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, a love-letter--you {{could not}} meet him just then, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> sorry, but the emotion you had felt with him made you forgetful of realities.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, you {{unreasonable}} man! {{just now}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> perfectly happy before Captain Cuttwater came, I suppose {{the one thing}} now necessary is to send him away again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We cannot drift. We {{must decide}} now upon some {{definite}} action. Our lives are our own, {{to make as}} we choose. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going away. And you meant--alone?" ...|$|E
60|$|LORETTA. [Not exactly {{enthusiastic}} in her reception, going {{slowly to}} meet him.] <b>You</b> never <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> coming.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Ah thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} be perm'nent!" [...] Mrs. Zapp began quietly, prefatory to working herself up into hysterics. [...] "And here Ah've gone and had your room fixed up just for you, and new paper put in, and you've always been talking such {{a lot about how}} you wanted your {{furniture}} arranged, and Ah've gone and made all mah plans--" ...|$|R
60|$|GAYNOR. You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a {{good reason}} for it--but you and Miss Carmody <b>are</b> engaged, aren't <b>you?</b> Carmody <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b>|$|R
60|$|Miss N. A {{fortnight}} ago <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} London. You said the copies {{you were about}} here would not take you another week, and that was three weeks since.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} once he {{was telling}} me about Snake Anson's gang. He mentioned <b>you.</b> <b>Said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a real gun-fighter. And what a shame it was you had to be an outlaw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Promised?' said Stephen with wide-opened eyes. She {{had no idea}} of sparing him, {{she remembered}} the printed names. 'Why, Leonard, I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> unable to pay any of those debts?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} asleep,' snarled Jeremiah, {{referring}} to his watch, 'two hours. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would <b>be</b> rested enough {{if you had a}} short nap.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing. I'll {{put things}} tidy here a little, and then I'll go. You couldn't give the that three months' pay now, could <b>you?</b> He <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I gather {{from what}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> no longer {{blessed with the}} {{presence}} of the excellent lady, your mother," [...] presently added Mr. Belamour.|$|R
6000|$|... [With a smile.] Ah, yes, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> coming less {{frequently}} to Egypt {{than in the}} past. It might be worth while to keep Ronny here in order to tempt you back.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} wear your gray gown all day to-morrow on your trip to Yalbury, and in the evening too, when I shall be with you, and ask your father for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This fellow's mad," [...] thought Stubbs: [...] "but the woman's rather pretty, and he's not bad fun himself, if {{you come}} to that." [...] What he said was different: [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> an actor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. I'll {{put things}} tidy here a little, and then I'll go. You couldn't give the that three months" [...] pay now, could <b>you?</b> He <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{with your}} {{immediate}} future. I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{trying to get}} a job. Have you given up the idea of newspaper work, then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do {{you think}} that, Charlotte? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{convinced}} <b>you</b> had wounded one of the men; so {{they ought to be}} able to trace him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, all {{you said}} about what you saw and heard when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> eavesdroppin' must have been nonsense, you know, for how could you hear and see what {{took place in the}} cave through tons of rock and earth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Vicar {{shook his}} head. The good {{report of the}} village had been the breath of his life, so far. [...] "You see," [...] he said, [...] "it would look so much more {{plausible}} if <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> just a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘We {{will take}} one more turn before going in,’ said Mr. Crisparkle, ‘for I {{want to ask you}} a question. When <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in a changed mind {{concerning}} me, you spoke, not only for yourself, but for your sister too?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{give you}} leave {{to become a}} kehla--a wearer of the head-ring--although, as <b>you</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> still but a boy, and with it a place upon my Council." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{the fellow}} was a card sharper whom I once {{detected}} at cheating; {{and so was}} the one who was lying next to him, the man whom <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> thought <b>was</b> shamming." ...|$|R
