25|$|Hua Jin 化劲 ('Transforming Jin') - This is {{considered}} the highest stage of practice. You must have already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and {{have a very strong}} foundation in them. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of experience in fighting as you must know that this stage is 'Sheji Cong Ren' (same as in Taijiquan). Give up yourself and comply with the opponent. Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere you need to be empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E
2500|$|Dyson has won {{numerous}} scientific awards {{but never}} a Nobel Prize. Nobel physics laureate Steven Weinberg {{has said that}} the Nobel committee has [...] "fleeced" [...] Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, [...] "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style." [...] Dyson is a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books.|$|E
2500|$|Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, {{while having}} {{initially}} supported the GOP nominee, remarked {{that he was}} [...] "deeply upset" [...] about her endorsement of Owens after Scozzafava's withdrawal from the race. RNC Chairman Michael S. Steele questioned party leaders in upstate New York for using a committee process to select a congressional candidate. [...] "Maybe <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> primary the next time instead of having 11 guys in a room sit around and select your nominee," [...] said Steele. The New York Republican Party {{issued a statement saying}} Scozzafava's endorsement was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of the party and said [...] "In contacting Scozzafava, the Obama White House has once again played its Chicago-style politics here in New York." ...|$|E

"You won't like {{to carry}} insane bugs, lame toads, and convulsive kittens in your hands, {{and they would}} not stay on a {{stretcher}} if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> one. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ambulance and be a branch of the Sanitary Commission," [...] said Will.|$|R

2500|$|The next Soviet {{offensive}} {{began in}} February 1940. The heavy artillery support allowed the Soviet forces to breach the Mannerheim Line. Meretskov's 7th Army proceeded to take Viborg which so far had resisted attempts of Soviet conquest. Less {{than two weeks}} after the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty, on March 21, 1940 Meretskov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, Meretskov was promoted to rank of army general and made Deputy Commissar of Defense. From August 1940 to January 1941 he was Chief of the General Staff. He was dismissed on 14 January 1941, and on 24 January, Stalin spotted him at the Bolshoi and, in front of witnesses: [...] "You are courageous, capable, but without principles, spineless. You want to be nice, but <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> plan instead and adhere to it strictly, despite the fact that someone or other is going to be resentful." ...|$|E

50|$|From {{the clues}} {{in the first}} part <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> idea about the plot and who could be responsible.

6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> favour {{to ask of}} you, Monsieur de Marsac," [...] said I, rising; for our {{business}} was at an end. [...] "It is that if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity of communicating with Mademoiselle de Lavedan, you will {{let her know that}} I am not--not the Lesperon that is betrothed to your sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed I do, aunt. If {{there ever}} {{was a time when}} I felt unwilling that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sorrow or anxiety which I could not share, it is now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dorothy, {{it is not}} at all {{becoming}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{correspondence with}} any young man of such a nature that you should be ashamed to shew it to your aunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, if {{your own}} people are content with you,” Bessie laughed, “it’s {{not for me to}} complain. But I shall always think that {{properly}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great mind—a great character.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] {{the colonel}} said. [...] "I <b>have</b> formed <b>a</b> very high opinion of your {{judgment}} and discretion, from the talks {{which we have}} had together, and I have spoken strongly in your favour to the general, who had promised me that, {{in the event of}} the army moving forward, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> appointment on the quartermaster general's staff, as an intelligence officer.|$|R
6000|$|... "A most admirable reflection, sir, and {{you have}} only, {{according}} to the analogical theory first started by our office, to apply it to that thirtieth boy in question, and see the result. Had you but kept that thirtieth boy--been patient with his sickly virtues, cultivated them, hoed round them, why what a glorious guerdon would have been yours, when at last <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> St. Augustine for an ostler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bucklaw," [...] said Craigengelt, [...] "I {{sometimes}} think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> stage-player yourself; all is fancy and frolic with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg {{you will}} not allude to that subject again. When I have {{distinctly}} told {{you that it is}} annoying--that it is painful to me, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little more consideration." ...|$|E

60|$|But if {{you would}} come out of that murky electioneering {{atmosphere}} and come to us, you don't know how delighted we should be. You should have your own way as completely as though you were at home. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cheery room, and <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Swiss châlet all to yourself to write in. Smoking regarded as a personal favour to the family. Georgina is so insupportably vain on account of being a favourite of yours, that you might find her a drawback; but nothing else would turn out in that way, I hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "That thou and {{all like}} <b>thee</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{horror of the}} ministers of the law, I can understand; and {{it is more than}} {{probable}} that thy dislike will extend to me, for I am about to pronounce a just judgment on thee and thy fellows for disturbing the harmony of the day, and especially for having been guilty of the enormous crime of an outrage on our agents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] sneered Rotherby, [...] "I declare <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> lawyer. We haven't a pleader of such {{parts and}} such lucidity {{at the whole}} bar." ...|$|R

6000|$|Alice {{carefully}} {{released the}} brush, and {{did her best}} to get the hair into order. 'Come, you look rather better now!' she said, after altering most of the pins. 'But really <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lady's maid!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, {{one of you}} brave conspirators {{against a}} defenceless girl, strike a light, for the place is as dark as a vault, and let us see what has happened. I told you that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sign." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, he {{must have}} been the young spendthrift that sold the property? Well, but <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> such <b>an</b> ill-will against him; {{remember}} necessity has no law. And then, goodwife, he was not more culpable than Mr. Treddles, whom you are so sorry for." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll see {{you through}} with the hauling in," [...] Hunter promised. [...] "We'll start right away {{as soon as the}} thrashers can give us a load, and in my opinion <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{reasonable}} surplus after clearing off Nevis's claim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If that be so {{you will}} soon give over making--what you call a fool of yourself. For myself I {{like the idea of}} wild oats. I look upon them like measles. Only <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> doctor ready when the disease shows itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now what's {{your point}} of view?" [...] she asked of her aunt. [...] "When you criticise {{everything}} here <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> point of view. Yours doesn't seem to be American--you thought everything over there so disagreeable. When I criticise I have mine; it's thoroughly American!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That,' I said firmly, 'is {{altogether}} out-of-date. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> brought <b>a</b> larger mentality, a {{more vital}} uplift, and--er--all {{that sort of}} thing, to bear on--all that sort of thing, you know.' ...|$|R
