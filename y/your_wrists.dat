[...] A writer of NME felt that Grande [...] "shows herself as someone who continues to be determined to challenge the norm." [...] The publication as well pointed out that [...] " [...] does sound empowered, even if it doesn't sound especially dangerous {{for her in the}} wake of her 2014 collaboration 'Love Me Harder' with The Weeknd." [...] Writing for Idolator, Robbie Daw, Carl Williot and Mike Wass reviewed [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] during their [...] "Pop Perspective" [...] article, with Daw calling it [...] "one walk of danger worth taking", Williot praising her vocal performance and highlighting the [...] "clever little flip of '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman'", and Wass naming it a [...] "decent song" [...] but noting that [...] " [...] still hasn't found her own lane." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy praised Grande's vocals, describing as [...] "angelic" [...] and completed writing it [...] "almost sound too pure over the seductive guitar line and prowling beat, which threatens to blindfold you and tie up <b>your</b> <b>wrists</b> within one listen.". Reviewing the album with the same name, the editor from Sputnikmusic described the song as [...] "the first moment that the album really shows flashes of becoming something special," [...] and continued, [...] "as it sways to a seductive beat that feels like it was extrapolated from the most revealing scene of a James Bond film." [...] Quinn Maryland of Pitchfork shared similar opinion, the reviewer described it as [...] "a slinky, empowered, Bond theme of a belter;" ...|$|E
