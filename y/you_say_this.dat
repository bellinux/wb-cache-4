2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> to me? Why do you keep saying these things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E

Why do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> then, my dearest Maud?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Thanks,' {{said the}} latter huskily. 'When <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> morning, {{of course you}} mean this afternoon, but thanks all the same--thanks--thanks.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Child!" [...] he cried. [...] "You do {{not know}} what <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> is part of a dream--some evil fancy. Think! You could not have done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] {{said the}} Constable. [...] "But you are forging tales on a noble gentleman. Come, come, dame, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> because you like not Randal Lacy." ...|$|E

Ah! yonder is Sam Yoke, my coxswain, waiting to report the barge; I can send Sir Gervaise's message to the surgeons, by deputy, {{and there will be}} no occasion for my hastening from this lovely spot, and pleasant company." ...|$|E
6000|$|Grayne's {{face was}} very dark. [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> is my affair," [...] he said. [...] "I must first {{ask you to}} help me carry him to the library and let me examine things thoroughly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{the less}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> about <b>this</b> matter the better," [...] {{declared}} the bluejay, swinging his club in a suggestive manner, and looking sharply at the magpie.|$|R

6000|$|Albemarle, {{a little}} flustered, {{turned to his}} colleagues. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to <b>this?</b> Were it perhaps well to order Mr. Wilding's apprehension, and to have him brought hither?" ...|$|R
