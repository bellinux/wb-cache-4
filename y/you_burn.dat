500|$|The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said {{he enjoyed}} {{directing}} the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are [...] "very human and real". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences {{in their own}} lives, and would feel sympathy for the characters. The idea of Homer annoying {{the people at the}} movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two [...] "annoying" [...] women sat down right in front of them. Groening's friend told the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, [...] "Now are you satisfied?", to which Groening's friend replied: [...] "I won't be satisfied until I see <b>you</b> <b>burn</b> in hell." ...|$|E
500|$|A 1954 {{issue of}} Modern Hospital {{contains}} a meal suggestion that includes: [...] "Bean Soup, Toasted Bacon Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich, Pickles, Jellied Banana Salad, Cream Dressing, and Pound Cake." [...] By 1958, Hellmann's Mayonnaise advertised their product as [...] "traditional on bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches," [...] {{suggesting that the}} combination had been around for some time. However, there are several references to a [...] "B.L.T" [...] in the early 1970s, including in one review of Bruce Jay Friedman's play entitled Steambath titled: [...] "A B.L.T. for God – hold the mayo.". The abbreviation used in title references a line of dialogue in the play in which God yells, [...] "Send up a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich, hold the mayo. <b>You</b> <b>burn</b> the toast, I'll smite you down with my terrible swift sword." [...] The coexistence of the shortened version and the full name suggests this {{was a period of}} transition as the abbreviation was popularized.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{made plans}} in 1977 {{to sell the}} rights to his old {{television}} programs {{as part of a}} package which would bring him back to regular television appearances. [...] The package called for him to produce one new television show for every three older episodes; this appears to not have materialized. In 1980, he was taken to court by 13 of his former writers over a story that his will called for the destruction of recordings of all his old television shows upon his death. [...] Skelton contended his remarks were made {{at a time when he}} was very unhappy with the television industry and were taken out of context. He said at the time, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>burn</b> the only monument you've built in over 20 years?" [...] As the owner of the television shows, Skelton initially refused to allow them to be syndicated as reruns during his lifetime. In 1983, Group W announced that it had come to terms with him for the rights to rebroadcast some of his original television programs from 1966 through 1970; some of his earlier shows were made available after Skelton's death.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004 Olbermann was not {{included}} in ESPN's guest lineup for its 25th anniversary SportsCenter [...] "Reunion Week", which saw Craig Kilborn and Charley Steiner return to the SportsCenter set. In 2007, ten years after Olbermann's departure, in an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, he said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>burn</b> a bridge, you can possibly build a new bridge, but if there's no river any more, that's a lot of trouble." [...] During the same interview Olbermann stated that he had recently learned {{that as a result of}} ESPN's agreeing to let him return to the airwaves on ESPN Radio, he was banned from ESPN's main (Bristol, Connecticut) campus.|$|E
2500|$|In late August 1969, the Exploratorium {{opened with}} little fanfare at the Palace of Fine Arts. Oppenheimer [...] "simply opened the doors". Although the {{building}} needed many improvements, Oppenheimer couldn't {{afford to make}} the changes, and decided to allow the public to come and watch exhibits being built and changes being made {{as part of the}} participatory ethos of the institution. An early proposal would have erected a wall between the workshop where exhibits were being developed and the main visitor areas. [...] Instead, Oppenheimer insisted that the workshop be placed without a wall, right next to the main entrance so that visitors could experience [...] "the way a shop smells when <b>you</b> <b>burn</b> the wood in a saw, or smell the oil from a lathe". Above the workshop was a sign, made by the wife of George Gamow, a physicist, educator, and friend of Oppenheimer who had died just a year before the opening of the Exploratorium. The inscription said [...] "Here Is Being Created the Exploratorium a Community Museum Dedicated to Awareness". [...] (Today, a copy of this motto is inscribed above the main entrance to the new Exploratorium at Pier 15.) ...|$|E

[...] While the {{stranger}} spoke he looked cheerfully, hospitably, at Biddy; {{not because it}} was she, she easily guessed, {{but because it was}} in his nature to desire a second auditor--a kind of sympathetic gallery. Her life was somehow filled with shy people, and she immediately knew she had never encountered any one who seemed so to know his part and recognise his cues.|$|E
