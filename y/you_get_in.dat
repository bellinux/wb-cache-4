25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in.</b> Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E

[...] When asking about her intentions for the EP, she responded {{that she did not}} have an exact plan for its promotion and that she would rather [...] "let it work itself out". Chana expressed a desire to record more material for an album, which would include some songs from the EP. She said that she was interested in working with Thom Russo to expand her sound from that on the EP.|$|E
500|$|Executives who {{eventually}} {{escaped from the}} Hole have said that its occupants were forced to practice group confessions {{in which they would}} confess supposed transgressions against Miscavige, bad thoughts that they had had about Scientology and disclose their sexual fantasies. Debbie Cook, who spent seven weeks in the Hole in 2007, said that [...] "most of the time the activities [...] were either you confessing your own sins or bad things that you'd done, or getting other people to confess theirs." [...] Mike Rinder commented on the bizarre personal dynamics of the Hole: [...] "These were your friends, people you had traveled with. But then, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the Hole? You can't trust anybody." ...|$|E

In May 1925, {{he dropped out of}} high school at Loyola School and enlisted in the United States Navy by lying about his age, which at the time he believed to be only 15, and forging his father's signature on the papers.

500|$|As for cargo traffic, truckers {{state that}} despite the longer miles, they can make more trips per day at Port Everglades. Also, they blame the port itself for this, not the Downtown traffic. They state that at Port Everglades, they can make three to four runs a day, versus Port of Miami where [...] "you're lucky if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> two," [...] states truck driver Alejandro Arrieta, due to waiting time at the port, which is often several hours. Port Everglades also has major {{redevelopment}} plans underway that includes its own deep dredging to a [...] depth; they also claim to have surpassed the Port of Miami, which {{has long been known}} as the [...] "Cruise Capital of the World" [...] as well as the [...] "Cargo Gateway to the Americas," [...] in both cruise traffic and cargo tonnage handled.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} almost universally praised by critics. [...] Abby West of Entertainment Weekly complimented {{the writing of}} B.J.

[...] IGN's Brian Zoromski rated it 10 out of 10, making it only one of two third-season episodes he deemed a [...] "masterpiece". He stated that [...] "Another truly brilliant episode of The Office aired this week, with more humor packed into the half-hour than <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> many feature-length comedies." [...] Zoromski also praised the acting by minor characters, such as Creed Bratton and Mindy Kaling, who portrays customer service representative Kelly Kapoor.|$|E

500|$|The Governor of Queensland, Sir Colin Hannah, gave {{a speech}} denigrating the Whitlam Government on 15 October, in {{violation}} of the convention that state governors remain neutral. Hannah held a dormant commission as Administrator of the Commonwealth to act as Governor-General in the event of Kerr's death, resignation, or absence from Australia. Whitlam immediately contacted Buckingham Palace to arrange for Hannah's dormant commission to be revoked, a process which took ten days to complete. Although Whitlam later alleged that he never contemplated dismissing Kerr during the crisis, on 16October, while speaking with Kerr and visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, he told Kerr that if the crisis continued, [...] "It could be a question of whether I get to the Queen first for your recall, or whether <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> first with my dismissal". Kerr saw the statement as a threat; Whitlam later stated the comment was [...] "flippant" [...] and designed to turn the conversation to another subject.|$|E
500|$|While much of {{the novel}} shows Henry and Clare falling in love, the end is darker and [...] "time travel becomes a means for {{representing}} arbitrariness, transience, [...] plain bad luck", according to The Boston Globes Judith Maas. As Andrew Billen argues in The Times, [...] "The book may even serve as a feminist analysis of marriage as a partnership in which only the male is conceded the privilege of absence." [...] Several reviewers noted that time travel represents relationships in which couples cannot quite communicate with each other. Natasha Walter of The Guardian describes the story's attention to [...] "the sense of slippage that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> any relationship—that you could be living through a slightly different love story from the one your partner is experiencing." [...] She points, for example, to {{the section of the}} book which describes the first time Clare and Henry make love. She is 18 and he is 41, already married to her in his present.

500|$|All of Ecstasys seven {{tracks were}} written and {{composed}} by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—"The Things I Miss", [...] "Clair" [...] and [...] "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me". Regarding the lyrical {{content of the}} album {{in contrast to the}} music, Shields said that [...] "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A lot of it is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere". Ó Cíosóig remarked that [...] "it's more weird perversions of feeling <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> a relationship" [...] and referred to the lyrics as being marked by [...] "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as [...] "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour" [...] and considered the songwriting process for Ecstasy as [...] "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".|$|E

Five year later, Mojo ranked it 85th on the magazine's list of [...] "The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs" [...] (between [...] "You Won't See Me" [...] and [...] "Lovely Rita"). The editors credited [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] with inspiring the Krautrock genre, while Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie described it as [...] "a great piece of music" [...] that, in departing from the Beatles' more regimented approach, evokes [...] "the same feeling <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> 'Be-Bop-A-Lula' or a Muddy Waters or John Lee Hooker tune". Writing for the website Ultimate Classic Rock, Dave Swanson considers [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] to be [...] "one of the band's most captivating works from the psychedelic era, {{and one of the}} Beatles' great lost songs".|$|E
500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened.

He had traveled to the New York recording studio from Washington D.C. after a long night of partying. Gaga {{was already in the}} studio in her exuberant style with a big ribbon atop her head by which Wale was taken aback, and was a [...] "cultural difference" [...] for him. In an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with Interscope. By the end of the session, Gaga had created five different hooks for [...] "Chillin" [...] and added her vocals on the track. The rapper added, [...] "It took a while. Once we finally got the ball rolling, it was almost time to go. It was natural though.
