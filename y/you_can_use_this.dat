50|$|Elevations are {{measured}} in three steps, that include first measuring the interior orientation, then the relative orientation, {{and finally the}} absolute orientation. Interior orientation photographs are placed {{in relation to the}} center of the stereoplotter by aligning the fixed standard of reference points for measurement to corresponding points on the photograph. The focal length of the camera is also set. With relative orientation the angle of orientation of the camera relative to the place where the photos were, the stereo-photo is taken programmed in the stereoplotter. This allows the effects of parallax (distortion of the final stereo-photo) to be reduced. In absolute orientation, the ground coordinates of a position are used to scale the model. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> to get the x, y, or z coordinates of any position on the stereo photographs.

[...] In order to measure the diameter of the bore, place the beam at one end and slide the other end on the diameter and watch the dial indicator. The values initially increases and at one point starts decreasing; stop that point, it is called max point on the circle. That is the diameter of the component. Repeat the procedure in 3 different places and get the average value of the diameter of the component. This is the most common way to measure the larger bore.
