500|$|Due to {{the success}} of [...] "Give it Away", the band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would {{ultimately}} be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are <b>you</b> <b>kidding</b> me?

IGN ranked [...] "Walkabout" [...] as the fifth best Lost episode ever, behind [...] "The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham", the Pilot, [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and [...] "The Constant". The episode was also featured in similar lists by the Los Angeles Times, TV Guide, National Post, and ABC2. Jason Snell of The Incomparable thought similarly, saying [...] "Skippable?

Black explained, [...] "that's an anxiety response to feeling inferior to The Avengers, but also to being humbled by sights he cannot possibly begin to understand or reconcile with the realities he's used to...

Mark Savage of BBC wrote that an indifferent person tells the singer that [...] "time will heal her broken heart". According to Andrew Hampp of Billboard, the singer [...] "tells off" [...] a former boyfriend for expecting her to get over quickly their former relationship.

Lansky felt that the [...] "emotion" [...] on the pre-chorus was [...] "chill-inducing", while Savage wrote that [...] "it's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious.

The idea for the race was conceived by CBS Sports reporter John Tesh, who had covered the 1987 Tour de France and on his return suggested holding a race in the United States to the basketball commentator and entrepreneur Billy Packer. Packer originally planned to call the race the Tour de Jersey. He approached representatives of casinos in Atlantic City for sponsorship, and Trump offered to be the race's primary sponsor and Packer's business partner in the venture. It was Packer who suggested the Tour de Trump name. Speaking {{at the time of}} the start of the first Tour de Trump in May 1989, Trump himself stated that [...] "When [...] was initially stated, I practically fell out of my seat. I said, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>kidding?</b> I will get killed in the media if I use that name. You absolutely have to be kidding'". However, Trump reportedly changed his mind within 20 seconds, and was convinced by the commercial value of the name.|$|E

500|$|Manning and the Colts {{introduced}} their now-signature no-huddle offense, {{and used}} it to great effect in a Week 1 rout of the Jets, 45–24. Two weeks later (Week 2 games were not played as scheduled due to the 9/11 attacks) the Colts advanced to 2–0 with a win over Buffalo, behind Manning's 421yards passing. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. However, the Colts lost the following week to New England, and continued their slide, losing their following two games. The Colts briefly rebounded, winning two games, but then lost 7 of their last 9, including a 40–21 home loss to the 49ers. After Manning threw a career-high four interceptions in that game, coach Jim Mora uttered his infamous [...] "Playoffs? Don't talk about playoffs. Are <b>you</b> <b>kidding</b> me. Playoffs?
