6000|$|When it {{came time}} for {{mounting}} the horses Stevens said, [...] "Reckon <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> on my boots once more." [...] In spite of the laugh accompanying the words Duane detected a subtle change in the outlaw's spirit.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, you {{are rather}} a sight, {{but from what}} I {{gathered}} there {{it seemed to me}} they'd be glad to see you under any conditions. I'll look over your work here, if you like, for a couple of days, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> yourself together while Faiz Ullah feeds you up.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Rita: [...] "I'd like to {{make her}} look a little more attractive. How far <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> back?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We've been {{training}} on artificial turf {{pretty much all}} year so I think we're kind of used to it in that way ... I think grass or turf <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>pull</b> up sore after a game so it's definitely about getting the recovery in and getting it right", Foord said.|$|R
40|$|Quality control {{measures}} for aviation gasoline, {{and some of}} the differences between quality control on avgas and mogas are discussed. One thing {{to keep in mind is}} that with motor gasoline <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>pull</b> off to the side of the road. It's not so easy to do in an airplane. Consequently, there are reasons for having the tight specifications and the tight quality {{control measures}} on avgas as compared to motor gasoline...|$|R
6000|$|... "The lot {{you have}} shipped will be {{something}} to score against the account; it's prime coffee and ought to sell well. I'd like you to get the rubber, but Alvarez can't wait long for the goods Mackellar has ready for the boat. Another voyage and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> out for the old country. I'd reckoned on going with you, but that's done with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{where did}} you come from?" [...] said the other. [...] "That's just what we do. A fowl's not much for a man, anyway, and Harry will eat two of them when he's hungry. What {{are you going to}} do with it? Well, <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>pull</b> the {{feathers}} off it, and fix it for cooking, unless you like them better with their insides in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She deems {{that you}} have an oar upon that side of the boat, Master Varney," [...] replied Foster, [...] "and that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> it or no, at your good pleasure. In a word, she ascribes the secrecy and obscurity in which she is kept to your secret counsel to my lord, and to my strict agency; and so she loves us both as a sentenced man loves his judge and his jailor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Angel! Thou never thinkest of self! But not afoot {{this side}} of Sorrento will I quit <b>thee.</b> We <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> thither {{in an hour or}} two; then I shall feel that I have done a duty. Once ashore, Etooelle and I can set our little sail, and will run out to sea between the two islands. No fear but what we can do that, with this land breeze; after which, a few rockets burned will tell us where to find le Feu-Follet." ...|$|R
5000|$|M. Christian Bartsch, {{pastor in}} Dohna, wrote in 1735: ...on this castle hill <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still find {{the ruins of}} old walls, towers and vaults which have {{withstood}} the rain and weather for 330 years uncared for; but whose limestone and rock are so strong that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only <b>pull</b> them down with difficulty, but which do not collapse by themselves. The Swedes when they stood here in 1709, tried to break into a vault in this castle hill, perhaps they thought they would find treasure, but {{had to give up}} soon thereafter due to the strength of the walls.....|$|R
6000|$|Curtis turned sharply. [...] "What I can't understand, Lawson, is this: How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> up {{and leave}} such a home?"--he {{indicated}} {{the room with a}} sweep of his hand--"and go out on the painted desert or down the Chaco and swelter in the heat like a horned toad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is where}} I take my morning bath," [...] Macheson said. [...] "You {{will see that}} though you can {{scramble}} down and dive in, it is too precipitous to get out. Therefore, I have fixed up a rope on the other side--it goes through those bushes, and {{is attached to the}} trunk of a tree beneath the bracken. If you swim across, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> yourself {{out of the water and}} hide just above the water in the bushes. There is just a chance that you may escape observation." ...|$|E
60|$|These, whether {{carrying}} hawthorn blossom and haw, or grape blossom and grape, or {{peach blossom}} and peach, you will simply call the 'stalk,' whether of flower or fruit. A 'stalk' is essentially round, like a pillar; and has, {{for the most}} part, the power of first developing, and then shaking off, flower and fruit from its extremities. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> the peach from its stalk, the cherry, the grape. Always at some time of its existence, the flower-stalk lets fall something of what it sustained, petal or seed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Albert," [...] he said, [...] "I {{know you}} have a piece of thin cord in your pocket. I pray you twist it round that man's arm as hard as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> it, and fasten it tightly. I have shorn off his hand, and he would very speedily bleed to death. If you staunch the wound he may last till his comrades come back, as they doubtless will after we have left; they will carry him away and maybe save his life. He is a villainous ruffian, no doubt, but 'tis enough for me that I have one death on my hands to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{good deal}} more {{wholesome}} here in several ways," [...] said he. [...] "If you're wise, you'll let up on card playing and hanging around the settlement, Ferris, and stick to farming. Even if you lose almost as many dollars over it, it will pay you considerably better. Now, that's all I'm going to tell you, but I know what I'm speaking of, because I've had my fling--and it's costing me more than I care to figure out still. <b>You,</b> however, <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> up, because by this time you have no doubt found out {{a good deal}}, if you're not all a fool. Curiosity's at the bottom of half our youthful follies, isn't it, Courthorne? We {{want to know what the}} things forbidden actually taste like." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped to}} get his breath and then resumed: [...] "You won't find the lode, and you'll come back feeling sick and sore. If they keep you on at the school, you won't want to teach; you'll think of nothing but saving all <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and <b>pulling</b> out again. You're like father, and {{when he took the}} lone trail the blamed foolishness got such a grip of him that he never broke loose. Well, you'll lose your job and the next you get; in fact, you'll come to hate any work that keeps you from the North. But a girl can't let herself down until she turns into a hobo. It's frankly unthinkable. Pull up and cut out the crazy program before it ruins you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} ask," [...] said Kirk. [...] "I got struck {{that way because}} I left you and mummy for a whole year. But now I'm back I'm {{going to be allowed}} to take it off and give it away. Whom shall I give it to? Steve? Do you think Steve would like it? Yes, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go on <b>pulling</b> it; it won't break. On the other hand, I should just like to mention that it's hurting {{something}} fierce, my son. It's fastened on at the other end, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Money!" [...] exclaimed Heyst, {{as if the}} {{suggestion}} had been altogether preposterous. She was so visibly surprised that he hastened to add: [...] "Of course, there is some money in the house--there, in that writing-desk, the drawer on the left. It's not locked. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> it right out. There is a recess, and the board at the back pivots: a very simple hiding-place, when you know the way to it. I discovered it by accident, and I keep our store of sovereigns in there. The treasure, my dear, is not big enough to require a cavern." ...|$|E
6000|$|When he {{got done}} telling it {{there was one}} of them uncomfortable silences that comes, you know, when a person has been telling a whopper and you feel sorry for him and wish you could think of some way to change the subject and let him down easy, but git stuck and don't see no way, and before <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> your mind {{together}} and DO something, that silence has got in and spread itself and done the business. I was embarrassed, Jim he was embarrassed, and neither of us couldn't say a word. Well, Tom he glowered at me a minute, and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am, I'll say something. I'll sure say something. Do {{you know}} what I'm going to do? I'm going to get right up from this chair and walk out that door. I'd take the gun from you, only you might turn foolish {{and let it go}} off. You can have the gun. It's a good one. As I was saying, I am going right out that door. And you ain't going to pull that gun off either. It takes guts to shoot a man, and you sure ain't got them. Now get ready and see if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> that trigger. I ain't going to harm you. I'm going out that door, and I'm starting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stone Sour's {{fourth and}} fifth albums, House of Gold & Bones - Part 1 and Part 2 are notable for their concept album format, and has led to {{comparisons}} to progressive rock bands. When asked about this, Josh Rand stated: [...] "I still think it’s us. We never said {{that we would be}} Genesis or Dream Theater or Yes or any of those types of bands. We're not a prog band. We said we're going to adopt the ideas of those stories and stuff, but it's still going to be a Stone Sour record, where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>pull</b> those individual songs. We just wanted to offer something more - in a world where it's all about singles, we just wanted to do something different. We've always evolved from record to record, if you listen to our entire catalog." [...] Both albums have been critically acclaimed.|$|R
500|$|An {{observer}} in {{an accelerated}} reference frame must introduce what physicists call fictitious forces {{to account for}} the acceleration experienced by himself and objects around him. One example, the force pressing the driver of an accelerating car into his or her seat, has already been mentioned; another is the force <b>you</b> <b>can</b> feel <b>pulling</b> your arms up and out if you attempt to spin around like a top. [...] Einstein's master insight was that the constant, familiar pull of the Earth's gravitational field is fundamentally the same as these fictitious forces. [...] The apparent magnitude of the fictitious forces always appears to be proportional to the mass of any object on which they act – for instance, the driver's seat exerts just enough force to accelerate the driver {{at the same rate as}} the car. [...] By analogy, Einstein proposed that an object in a gravitational field should feel a gravitational force proportional to its mass, as embodied in Newton's law of gravitation.|$|R
60|$|Here is {{something}} that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have a <b>pull</b> at, when I have finished to-day. It is a little apparatus of two hollow brass hemispheres, closely fitted together, and having connected with it a pipe and a cock, through which we can exhaust the air from the inside; and although the two halves are so easily taken apart, while the air is left within, yet you will see, when we exhaust it by-and-by, no power of any two of {{you will be able}} to pull them apart. Every square inch of surface that is contained in the area of that vessel sustains fifteen pounds by weight, or nearly so, when the air is taken out; and you may try your strength presently in seeing whether <b>you</b> <b>can</b> overcome that pressure of the atmosphere.|$|R
6000|$|... "That won't do," [...] {{retorted}} McFarlane, quickly. [...] "That won't do at all. You must go with them. I {{can take}} care of myself. I will not have you dragged into this muck-hole. We've got to think quick and act quick. There won't be any delay about their side of the game. I don't think they'll do anything to-day; but you've got to fade out of the valley. You all get ready and I'll have one of the boys hook up the surrey as if for a little drive, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> out over the old stage-road to Flume and catch the narrow-gage morning train for Denver. You've been wanting for some time to go down the line. Now here's a good time to start." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} {{economically}} unsound in increasing temporarily and artificially {{the demand for}} labour {{during a period of}} temporary and artificial contraction. There is a plain need of some averaging machinery to regulate and even-up the general course of the labour market, {{in the same way as}} the Bank of England, by its bank rate, regulates and corrects the flow of business enterprise. When the extent of the depression is foreseen, the extent of the relief should also be determined. There ought to be in permanent existence certain recognised industries of a useful, but uncompetitive character, like, we will say, afforestation, managed by public departments, and capable of being expanded or contracted according to the needs of the labour market, just as easily as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> out the stops or work the pedals of an organ. In this way, you would not eliminate unemployment, you certainly would not prevent the creation of unemployables; but you would considerably limit the scale of unemployment, you would reduce the oscillation of the industrial system, you would increase its stability, and by every step that you took in that direction you would free thousands of your fellow-countrymen from undeserved agony and ruin, and a far greater number from the haunting dread of ruin. That is the first point--a gap, a hiatus in our social organisation--to which I direct your attention to-night, and upon which the intelligence of this country ought to be concentrated.|$|E
50|$|Pushing on {{a string}} is a figure of speech for {{influence}} that is more effective in moving things in one direction than another - <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull,</b> but not push.|$|E
5000|$|Plunderland {{also has}} unique scenery to be {{encountered}} by the player through gameplay. The islands {{on which the}} “Island people” reside on {{vary depending on the}} type of island people. There are three types of island people, paradise, eskimo and tribal. The tribal are more territorial than the paradise islanders, so they are more likely to fight back, and fight hard when being plundered. [...] Also, sharks, crabs and sea monsters will attacking your ship as you plunder. Joshua Scott-Slade described the gameplay as this: [...] "A shark attacks you, but instead of shooting it or being scared, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> grab it, <b>pull</b> it out of the water and use it as a weapon against the enemies. If you have a taste for the dramatic, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> even tear it in half when you no longer require its services." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Pauper's Dough" [...] is a {{reworking}} of the song, [...] "Harper's Dough", which previously {{appeared on}} 12 O'Clock on the Dot (2000). Anderson noted: [...] "The original sentiment I had for [...] "Harper's Dough" [...] was really personal - it was just, <b>you</b> know, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> not <b>pull</b> yourself up {{by your own}} bootstraps. It was never a protest song, but now it is. It's {{one of the most}} powerful bits in the film. And of course, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make these big sweeping sentiments - Bono does it all the time - but I don't. ... Before it was about how I felt like the worst person ever and had to do something about myself; now it's about changing the world. Wow. And I can't take credit for that, that's down to director Virginia Heath - the footage she used and gave me to write from." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lady," [...] said he, [...] "you <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> me {{a little}} way if you want exercise, {{and as soon as}} you are tired <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stop, and I'll get out, but you must pay me the extra {{shilling}} all the same." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{western side}} of the {{mountain}} is along SR 87 (Beeline Highway), which is a busy four-lane road with narrow shoulders. There are several blocked roads onto the Salt River Indian Reservation, where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> off for a minute if the traffic is light.|$|E
50|$|The {{two reasons}} {{for this is that}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> the Moon card out on the march and hold it up to the moon light to check the bearing or grid {{reference}} of the next leg, and to stop you getting out your torch and giving your position away.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the album}} title, 'Life Will Write the Words', Avary says, [...] "To me, that phrase {{in a sense}} captures {{a bit of the}} human experience. I believe there’s a song in {{everything}}. Literally everything you look at, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> a song out of it. We all have a song, we all have a story.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This, Baas: to tie {{about your}} middle {{the end of}} the rope that I have made from the cloak, then to undo the cord that binds you and the Shepherdess together, and return {{to the top of the}} slope. Once there I <b>can</b> <b>pull</b> her up by the hide line, for it is strong, and she will slip easily over the ice, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> follow." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Arthur {{looked up}} at Lady Hilda with {{something}} like the gleam of a new-born hope on his distressed features. 'Lady Hilda,' he said almost cheerfully, 'you really speak {{as if you had}} some practicable plan actually in prospect.

50|$|InstantAtlas Server is a specialist, enterprise-scale web {{reporting}} {{solution for}} managing and disseminating geographically spread indicator data. Instead of storing data in files and publishing regular outputs {{as you would}} with InstantAtlas Desktop, you manage data in a standard relational database such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle Database. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> also <b>pull</b> data dynamically from other external information systems. InstantAtlas Server solutions can be termed Local information systems, Community Information Systems (see Community indicators), 'Neighborhood Reporting Systems' and 'Area Profiling Tools'. The product occupies a niche space between more mainstream areas of Business Intelligence and Geographic Information Systems. The two primary styles of report output are area profiles and interactive 'data views'. The product is used {{for a wide range}} of international, national, regional and local solutions globally. The technical and licensing model means it is well suited to federated web-based administration, often by a partnership of organisations, and unlimited levels of end-user access (with content access managed through user logins).One of the primary drivers for customers is the need to engage better with citizens and empower communities with neighborhood level information through online channels. For example, Department of Health, New Zealand, uses it to publicly present patterns and trends in a wide range of health conditions across the country while Diabetes UK, a national charity, use it to highlight the differences in local service provision to citizens and to make their own lobbying more effective.|$|R
