As Viggo and Kimmo's parents worked at Stockholms Datamaskincentral ("Stockholm's Computer Center", QZ) and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), and Johansson's father worked at an office that was a client for QZ, they had access to QZ's DEC-10 mainframe computer Oden. Using Oden and the book What to Do After <b>You</b> <b>Hit</b> Return (1975), the Eriksson brothers and Johansson learned programming.|$|E
25|$|Six and Out - If <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> it {{over the}} fence you're out {{and you have to}} get the ball. The 6 runs are usually not awarded to the batsman unless agreed to by both teams. This rule is {{especially}} popular in small backyards (where the rule may be applied to any ball that lands over the fence - not just 6's), and encourages the batsman to exercise control and restraint by aiming for 4's instead of 6's. Six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out, even if no damage is evident.|$|E

[...] Original drummer Lombardo would use two bass drums (instead of a double pedal, which is used on a single bass drum). Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the [...] "godfather of double bass" [...] by Drummerworld. Lombardo stated his reasons for using two bass drums: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> the bass drum, the head is still resonating. When <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> it in the same place right after that, you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe." [...] When playing the two bass drums, Lombardo would use the [...] "heel-up" [...] technique.|$|E

500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer Barry Ulanov commented in 1946 that Tristano [...] "was {{not content}} merely to feel something, [...] {{he had to}} explore ideas, to {{experience}} them, to think them through carefully, thoroughly, logically until he could fully grasp them and then hold on to them." [...] Tristano criticized the free jazz {{that began in the}} 1960s for its lack of musical logic as well as its expression of negative emotions. [...] "If you feel angry with somebody <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> him on the nose – not try to play angry music", he commented; [...] "Express all that is positive. Beauty is a positive thing." [...] He expanded on this by distinguishing emotion from feeling, and suggested that playing a particular emotion was egotistical and lacking in feeling.|$|E

500|$|Indifferent league {{performances}} that season meant that Ipswich finished just three points above the relegation zone, but the season ended in {{success in the}} FA Cup. Wark scored in a 3–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final, and appeared in the final at Wembley {{as part of a}} side that surprised favourites Arsenal, winning the game 1–0. Wark remarked, [...] "We were underdogs but on the day we hammered them." [...] Wark did not touch the ball for the first 18 minutes of the match, and as the players left the pitch at half-time, David Geddis said to Wark, [...] "Make sure <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> it between the posts in the second-half.

Aly Barchi of Complete Music Update said, of the song, [...] "‘Pink And Blue’ {{is at once}} ‘just a dumb pop song’ and also a highly smart bit of manufacturing. And so, so good… infuriatingly good." [...] Jamie Milton of DIY honored the song as [...] "THE BIG NEU THING", and called the song [...] "one of the most insanely addictive tracks of the year [...] ".

500|$|After the 1941 season, {{with his}} batting in decline, Oana {{worked as a}} pitcher during a barnstorming tour of Mexico. [...] Rogers Hornsby took over as the manager at Fort Worth in 1942, and Oana badgered Hornsby for a chance as a pitcher. [...] According to one account, Hornsby was {{reportedly}} prepared to release Oana, who was not hitting well, and said to Oana, [...] "Hank, <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> like a pitcher," [...] to which Oana replied, [...] "I am a good pitcher." [...] Hornsby initially thought that Oana was joking about being a pitcher, but finally relented and allowed him to pitch in relief one day in Houston. [...] In Oana's first 76 innings as a pitcher in 1942, he compiled a 0.76 earned run average (ERA), threw 50 consecutive innings without an earned run, and pitched a no-hitter. [...] In mid-July 1942, Oana's scoreless streak became national news, and resulted in a feature story in The Sporting News. In a total of 25 games as a pitcher during the 1942 season, Oana compiled a 16–5 record with a 1.72 ERA.|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve {{went into}} lap 48 {{less than a}} second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he {{attempted}} to overtake Schumacher at the Dry Sack corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision. ITV's then pit lane reporter James Allen has noted that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve. Martin Brundle, in the commentary box alongside Murray Walker, immediately saw that Schumacher's move had been deliberate, saying, [...] "That didn't work Michael. <b>You</b> <b>hit</b> the wrong part of him, my friend". The right-front wheel of Schumacher's Ferrari hit the left radiator pod of Villeneuve's Williams—unlike the 1994 collision with Hill where Schumacher inflicted damage on Hill's suspension—and caused Schumacher to retire. Villeneuve described the incident after the race [...] "The car felt very strange. The hit was very hard. It was not a small thing."

GameSpot echoed these sentiments, stating Guitar Hero had a [...] "great guitar controller" [...] and [...] "killer soundtrack" [...] and was possibly the [...] "best rhythm game ever made". Many reviews praised the game's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song. Play said the game [...] "gives bedroom air guitarists {{a chance to live}} out their rock 'n' roll fantasies". GameSpys review commented on the length of the songs, in that [...] "once <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> the three minute mark or so, things start to feel 'too long'".

500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy when <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> the spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 2005, Thompson {{supported}} {{a campaign to}} discourage Take-Two’s subsidiary, Rockstar Games, from releasing a game called Bully, in which, according to Thompson, [...] "what you are in effect doing is rehearsing your physical revenge and violence against those whom you have been victimized by. And then you, like Klebold and Harris in Columbine, become the ultimate bully." [...] According to Thompson, the game [...] "shows you how to—by bullying—take over your school. You punch people; <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> them with sling shots; you dunk their heads in dirty toilets. There's white-on-black crime in the game. You bludgeon teachers and classmates with bats. It's absolutely nuts." [...] Thompson sued Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, GameStop, and Toys 'R' Us, seeking an order to bar the game’s release. He also participated in a protest at Rockstar's office that also included students from Peaceaholics, a Washington, D.C. mentoring organization. Thompson said he hoped that the pressure would get retailers to refuse to carry the game. In March 2006, a Florida school board he had lobbied passed a resolution criticizing the game, but only urged retailers not to sell the game to minors.|$|E
