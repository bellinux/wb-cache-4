500|$|Ebert {{was also}} an {{advocate}} and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming {{to the defense of}} the cast and crew of Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would say such a thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: how could <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!" [...] He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [...] Eric Byler's Charlotte Sometimes).|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, also in 957, {{apparently}} as {{a posture}} of goodwill, Guo sent several thousand Later Shu soldiers that he captured during the Qin/Feng campaign, {{whom he had}} previously made into a special Huai'en Army (懷恩軍) and put under command of the captured Later Shu officer Xiao Zhiyuan (蕭知遠), back to Later Shu. [...] To reciprocate, Meng also some 80 Later Zhou officers captured in the campaign back to Later Zhou, and against wrote Guo, asking for friendly relations. [...] However, Guo was again displeased with the letter's expression of equal status, and therefore again refused to respond.

2500|$|The {{incident}} was {{caught on tape}} by a crew from the Spanish television company PVS, and the videotape showed that Kasparov's fingers were free of the knight for about 1/25 of a second, or a single frame of the video. Tournament director Carlos Falcon did not forfeit Kasparov when the videotape evidence was made available to him. As U.S. chess journalist Shelby Lyman pointed out, {{in the majority of}} sports [...] "instant replays" [...] do not overrule a referee's original decision and chess is no exception. The video has never been publicly released, at the request of tournament sponsor Luis Rentero. At one point Polgár reportedly confronted Kasparov in the hotel bar, asking him, [...] "How could <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> me?" [...] Following this incident, Kasparov bluntly told an interviewer [...] "... she just publicly said I was cheating. ... I think a girl of her age should be taught some good manners before making such statements." [...] Subsequently, Kasparov refused to speak to her for three years. Kasparov told reporters that his conscience was clear, as he was not aware of his hand leaving the piece. Although Polgár recovered {{by the end of the}} tournament, she went into a slump over the next six rounds, gaining only half a point. The incident may also have had an effect on Kasparov, who turned out a subpar performance in the tournament.|$|E

[...] "What!" [...] she went on, [...] "do you not live here in peace and plenty, and must you go to make war on those who have not harmed you; there, perhaps, to perish or to come to other ill? You say <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> win a girl for Dingaan and to find favour in his sight. Has not Dingaan girls more than he can count? It is more likely that, wearying of us, your wives, you go to get girls for yourself, Bulalio; and as for finding favour, rest quiet, so shall you find most favour. If the king sends his impis against you, then it will be time to fight, O fool with little wit!" ...|$|E

Other than serving approximately 140 residents who walk into the church premises daily, volunteers also deliver about another 190 packed meals to Senior Activity Centres in the vicinity. Free haircuts are also offered every second Tuesday of the month at the Church by the Matthew 25 ministry.|$|R

[...] "Dreaming about the spirit" [...] as often men do was not the right answer. In the I-solitude (Icheinsamkeit)without a real relationship with God, our Thou, we dream {{of the spirit in}} the different cultural expressions. But when the right I-Thou encounter takes place we do not separate theory and praxis anymore, because we are able to understand Matthew 25,40: [...] "as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> one of the least of these brothers of mine, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it to me". (I,268). Living in a real, true relationship with God and our neighbour means waking up to the [...] "spiritual realities", the end of our just [...] "dreaming of the spirit". So can men be creative and work for a better society without forgetting justice and solidarity, the brother in need.|$|R

[...] The final occurrence came in [...] "My Whole Life Is Thunder" [...] when Tracy locks himself, Kenneth, and TV star Florence Henderson in an elevator, to which Kenneth screams [...] "Why are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> me, Jacob?!" [...] In the Lost series, a character named Richard Alpert was made immortal by the character of Jacob, another possible link between the two given Kenneth's supposed immortality.|$|R

So they teach us to dead-check them by pressing them in the eye with your boot, because generally a person, even if he's faking being dead, will flinch if you poke him there. If he moves, you put a bullet in the brain. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> keep the momentum going when you're flowing through a building.
