25|$|January 2009 saw the {{departure}} of co-founding member Chris Stevenson for personal reasons. Chris stated 'The Eternal was basically my life for a good 5 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> loved every single moment of it! It was also an extremely gruelling experience, which at times took its toll on me on a personal level'. The band will continue on as a 3 piece {{and at this point}} have no intention to find a replacement.|$|E
25|$|Lammers: No. But you {{confirmed}} it. You see, I {{have been}} studying metaphysics for <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was able by a few questions, by the facts you gave, to check {{what is right and}} what is wrong with a whole lot of the stuff I've been reading. The important thing is that the basic system which runs through all the mystery religions, whether they come from Tibet or the pyramids of Egypt, is backed up by you. It's actually the right system.|$|E
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty <b>years.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

However, Mustaine expressed frustration with the label, saying [...] "The treatment's been terrible over the <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just don't want it." [...] He stated that he would prefer to retire than [...] "continue to play like that". Nevertheless, Mustaine exclaimed the band's new record would be [...] "great" [...] and the songs were [...] "really good".|$|E

500|$|By 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating {{increasingly}} self-destructive behaviour, particularly {{through his}} drug usage, about which Di'Anno comments, [...] "it wasn't just that I was snorting {{a bit of}} coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just couldn't see {{my way to the}} end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much." [...] With his performances suffering, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour, at which point the band had already selected his replacement.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Caitlin Flanagan, {{who wrote}} an exposé in The Atlantic titled [...] "The Dark Power of Fraternities: A yearlong {{investigation}} of Greek houses", told On the Media {{that she was}} concerned that Erdely's article could inhibit reforms of the Greek system.

500|$|The {{story of}} Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was {{inspired}} by Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman the Potters employed {{over the course of}} eleven summers at Dalguise House on the River Tay in Perthshire, writes Leslie Linder. Potter was 26 when, in 1892, she visited MacDonald while staying at Heath Park, Birnam. She wrote in her journal: [...] "Went out with the pony... to see Kitty MacDonald, our old washerwoman... Kitty is eighty-three but waken, and delightfully merry... She is a comical, round little woman, as brown as a berry and wears a multitude of petticoats and a white mutch. Her memory goes back for seventy <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really believe she is prepared to enumerate the articles of her first wash in the year '71".|$|E

[...] Cole had a part in Mary Harron's The Moth Diaries, which was released in 2012.|$|E
500|$|The General Prosecutor {{followed}} up travel bans and frozen bank accounts on former ministers {{and government officials}} including former Minister of Trade and Industry Rachid Mohamed Rachid. He told Al Arabiya that [...] "I returned from Davos to Egypt because of the current situation in Egypt. The new Prime Minister had contacted me for the same position in the new cabinet, I refused because I want fresh blood." [...] Regarding the travel ban, he commented, [...] "I had no idea about the accusations, I served for six and half <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am completely ready to face any accusation. No one had informed me of this decision and I heard it from the news." [...] He was considered a possible candidate for Prime Minister before the protests.|$|E

It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in <b>years.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, Sacramone briefly stayed in Los Angeles and {{designed}} for Tank Farm, a men's fashion company. She has discussed her intent to return to college in the media, but announced in August 2009 {{that she was not}} intending to return to Brown University. [...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I think that would be pretty much ideal." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of the slaveholders, Tubman was never captured, and neither were the fugitives she guided. Years later, she told an audience: [...] "I was {{conductor}} of the Underground Railroad for eight <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can say what most conductors can't say – I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger." [...] One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father, Ben, had purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars. But even when they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence. Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest. She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St. Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered.|$|E

500|$|Evans enjoyed an {{executive}} position at Apple until 1969, when Allen Klein {{was hired as}} a manager to reorganise the whole company. Evans was fired by Klein the next year, because Klein complained to Lennon that Aspinall and Evans were [...] "living like kings; like fucking emperors". Evans was later reinstated after McCartney, Harrison and Starr complained. On 13 September 1969, Evans accompanied Lennon, Yoko Ono, Klaus Voorman, Alan White and Eric Clapton to Toronto, Canada, for the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival concert. He later wrote: [...] "I was really enjoying myself. It was the first show I had roadied for three <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was really loving every minute of plugging the amps in and setting them up on stage, making sure that everything was right. Everyone wanted the show to go particularly well because Allen Klein, who had flown over, had organised for the whole of John's performance to be filmed. This was on top of it being video-taped by Dan Richter." ...|$|E
500|$|The duke {{eventually}} {{lost his}} case in 1891, enabling a further sale {{that had been}} set up by Baron Pichon to proceed. This was to the leading firm of Messrs. Wertheimer of Bond Street in London, where the cup was seen by Augustus Wollaston Franks, who had been Keeper of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography at the British Museum since 1866, and was president of the Society of Antiquaries. Samson Wertheimer agreed [...] "with much public spirit" [...] to sell the cup to the British Museum for the £8,000 (£ in [...] ) it had cost the firm. Franks was worried by the new American collectors such as J. P. Morgan, and in 1891 wrote to Sir Henry Tate, of Tate Gallery fame: [...] "A very wonderful gold cup has appeared returned to this country after an absence of 287 <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am anxious to see it placed in the National Museum and not removed to America." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{revealing}} their deception to a busy Queen Victoria public house, Peggy slapped both Pat and Frank, rebuffed Frank's {{attempt at}} reconciliation {{and left him}} to depart alone. In December 2000, Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror voted the scene in which Peggy slaps both Pat and Frank {{as one of the}} [...] "TV fights of the year", saying [...] "It was Peggy's speech which really made it a Bonfire Night to remember. But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when I found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I got my own back when I had to slap him after I found out he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn't think I did it hard enough the first time." ...|$|E
