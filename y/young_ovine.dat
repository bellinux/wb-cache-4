40|$|The {{unfavorable}} {{evolution of}} a <b>young</b> <b>ovine</b> during hyperimmunization process with Crotalus durissus terrificus venom was investigated in order to differentiate its origin between ophidic envenomation and copper toxicosis. Clinical, laboratory, necroscopic and histological exams as well as evaluation and measurement of heavy metals (copper) in the kidneys and in the liver were carried out. Blood counts revealed anemia and serological tests showed high levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase, total bilirubin and indirect bilirubin; which indicates liver, kidney and skeletal muscle damages. At necropsy, the animal presented hepatopathy and nephropathy. Histological examination revealed renal and hepatic features that may imply copper intoxication. Copper levels were 237. 8 µg/g in the liver and 51. 2 µg/g in the kidneys. Although the amount of metal found in both organs was below the level that can cause death, according to the literature, anatomopathological signs were suggestive of copper intoxication. Therefore, the hypothesis of metal toxicosis during the hyperimmunization process became more consistent than the crotalic envenomation one...|$|E
40|$|The ELISA {{technique}} {{was used to}} evaluate and compare <b>young</b> <b>ovine</b> humoral immune response during crotalic antiserum production. Animals were clinically evaluated throughout this process, and the neutralizing capacity of antisera raised against natural (NV) and Cobalt- 60 irradiated (IrV) venoms of Crotalus durissus terrificus (C. d. t.) was verified by means of in vitro challenges. Three groups of six animals each were used: G 1 received NV; G 2 was inoculated with IrV; and G 3 was used as control. Animals received six immunizations during 84 days at 14 -day intervals. ELISA of antibody profile showed significant difference (p< 5 %) between experimental groups (G 1 <G 2). These results justify the use of gamma radiation to detoxify Crotalus durissus terrificus venom like alternative to antiserum production. The neutralizing capacity of antiserum raised against IrV was fivefold higher than that of antiserum raised against NV. Results showed a new possibility of using ovines to produce commercial crotalic antiserum, which may be employed in the treatment of human and animal envenomation. Production cost might be reduced by the subsequent utilization of hyperimmunized ovines as food...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the optimal starting material {{for the development of}} an acellular osteochondral graft. Osteochondral tissues from three different species were characterised; pig (6 months), cow (18 months) and two ages of sheep (8 - 12 months and > 4 year old). Tissues from the acetabulum and femoral head of the hip, and the groove, medial and lateral condyles and tibial plateau of the knee were assessed. Histological analysis of each tissue allowed for qualification of cartilage histoarchitecture, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) distribution, assessment of cellularity and cartilage thickness. Collagen and GAG content were quantified and cartilage water content was defined. Following biomechanical testing, the percentage deformation, permeability and equilibrium elastic modulus was determined. Results showed that porcine cartilage had the highest concentration of sulphated proteoglycans and that the condyles and groove of the knee showed higher GAG content than other joint areas. Cartilage from younger tissues (porcine and <b>young</b> <b>ovine)</b> had higher cell content and was thicker, reflecting the effects of age on cartilage structure. Cartilage from older sheep had a much higher elastic modulus and was less permeable than other species...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{profile of}} <b>young</b> <b>ovines</b> was studied {{in order to}} {{evaluate}} and compare their antiserum production from natural and Cobalt- 60 irradiated Crotalus durissus terrificus (C. d. t.) venoms. The parameters analyzed included complete blood count, and urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, total proteins, albumin and globulin serum measurements. Three groups of six animals each were used. Group 1 (G 1) received natural C. d. t. venom; Group 2 (G 2) received irradiated C. d. t. venom; and Group 3 (G 3) was used as control and did not receive venom, only adjuvants, using seven venom inoculations. During the experimental period, animals were fortnightly weighed. According to clinical and weight evaluation, sheep in post-weaning phase showed no changes in their physiological profiles but had excellent weight gain. The parameters analyzed were not statistically different (p< 5 %) among the groups tested. The hyperimmunization process was successfully accomplished with the production of specific antibodies against Crotalus durissus terrificus venom. Results bring a new possibility of utilizing ovines in the commercial production of anticrotalic serum, which {{may be used to}} treat human and animal envenomation. Its production cost may be reduced by subsequent use of hyperimmunized sheep for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|Trabecular bone is {{routinely}} analysed by histomorphological-histometrical and immunohistochemical techniques as means of assessing the differentiation status of bone deposition and growth. Currently few embedding resins exist for which both morphological and immunohistochemical analyses {{can be performed}} on mineralised tissue. Paraffin, the standard embedding medium for bone enzyme and immunohistochemistry, can only be used on demineralised tissue, but then trabecular structure may be badly preserved. Methyl methacrylate (MMA), the resin of choice for undecalcified bone histology can only be used for bone immunohistochemistry if the usual, highly exothermic polymerisation procedure is avoided which destroys tissue antigenicity. Consequently, most current practices involve cutting samples in half to be processed in separate resins when more than one type of analysis is required. Technovit 9100 Newregistered is a low temperature MMA embedding system that is purported to significantly improve tissue antigenicity preservation allowing polymerisation at - 20 &#x 00 B 0;C. In this study, Technovit 9100 Newregistered-embedded undecalcified trabecular bone samples (adult human, <b>young</b> bovine and <b>ovine)</b> yielded immunolabelling with several bone matrix markers and preserved morphological features in 7 µm sections when stained with Masson-Goldner, von Kossa, or toluidine blue. Bone samples from all resins used were immunolabelled with antibodies against osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, osteonectin, bone sialoprotein and procollagen type I amino-terminal propeptide. Technovit-embedded bone yielded more reliable immunolabelling of the matrix proteins when compared with heat or cold-cured LR White or standard embedded MMA samples. Technovit 9100 Newregistered provided better routine histology than LR White, and was comparable to MMA. Results demonstrated that Technovit 9100 Newregistered {{can be used as}} a low-temperature acrylic resin embedding method for routine undecalcified bone histology, as well as for immunohistochemistry...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVOS: A necessidade de substituição da valva, aorta ascendente e reimplante coronariano em pacientes onde a anticoagulação é indesejável, é crescente. Avaliamos em animais o comportamento hemodinâmico de um conduto valvado aórtico feito com pericárdio bovino tratado pelo glutaraldeído (CVAP). MÉTODOS: Para isto, implantamos CVAPs em oito ovinos e os explantamos após 150 dias de pós-operatório. Realizouse estudo angiográfico e hemodinâmico no pré-operatório e antes do explante. EcoDopplercardiogramas foram realizados nos dias 30 e 150 de pós-operatório (teste) e também em cinco ovinos não operados. Após explantados, submetemos os CVAPs à avaliação macroscópica, radiológica e histológica por microscopia óptica. RESULTADOS: Na análise hemodinâmica, as pressões {{arterial}} e capilar pulmonar aumentaram (P OBJECTIVE: The {{necessity for}} {{replacement of the}} valve, ascending aorta and aortic with coronary reimplantation in patients where anti-coagulation is undesirable, is increasing. We evaluated the hemodynamic performance of an aortic valved conduit made with glutaraldehyde treated bovine pericardium (AVCP) in animals. METHODS: Therefore, AVCPs were implanted in eight <b>young</b> <b>ovine</b> and explanted after 150 days. Angiographic and hemodynamic study was performed at pre-operative and prior the explant. EchoDopplercardiograms were performed at day 30 and 150 of post-operative (test) and also in five nonoperated ovines. After explanted, AVCPs were submitted to a macroscopical, radiological and histological evaluation by optic microscopy. RESULTS: In the hemodynamic analysis the arterial and pulmonary capillary pressure increased (P< 0. 05) between day 0 and 150. In the echoDoppercardiographic analysis, the test group presented higher values in the diastolic and systolic diameters of the left ventricle (P< 0. 05). In the test group, between day 30 and 150, occurred an increase of weight, thickness of the left ventricle walls, maximum transvalvar gradient, medium transvalvar gradient, left ventricle diastolic diameter {{and a decrease in}} the ejection function (P< 0. 05). Two animals with endocarditis explain those differences, how we can see with the statistycal analysis without this sample. Macroscopy showed calcification in variable degrees. Optic microscopy revealed data similar to literature with the use of glutaraldehyde treated bovine pericadium. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the AVCPs allows the performance of this kind of experiment in the proposed model and that the hemodynamic outcomes found are similar to physiological parameters...|$|E
