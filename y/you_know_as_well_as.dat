6000|$|... "'Yes,' I answered, 'a pure yellow stone is. But this {{is neither}} one nor the other. It's off-colour, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> I.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>know</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> I do {{that none}} of our natives has a revolver. Besides {{ourselves}} {{only two or three}} of the servants have them.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Marcia," [...] said Sylvia, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> him <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> I do, <b>you</b> would <b>know</b> that {{he would}} never {{remember}} anything about a place." ...|$|R
