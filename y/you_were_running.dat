6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "it couldn't do much harm if I told you. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> whisky {{a little while}} ago, and, though the folks didn't seem to suspect it, you had a farmer or a rancher for a partner--it appears he has mixed up things for you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I see you'll {{have to be}} convinced. Very well; in {{the first}} place, the man would have stuck at nothing. I've already tried {{to show you that}} he had {{something}} to gain by Benson's death. I suspected when we took you away from him that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> a big risk, Benson." ...|$|E

Very well; in {{the first}} place, the man would have stuck at nothing, and I've already tried {{to show you that}} he'd {{something}} to gain by Benson's death." [...] He turned to the latter. [...] "I suspected when we took you away from him that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> a risk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} his name. I've clean {{forgotten}} it; but don't you worry. He {{was anything but}} a friend of yours. He called you all the names he could think of. He said you set a lot of scandal going about him once, somewhere--in Bangkok, I think. Yes, that's it. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> a table d'hote in Bangkok at one time, weren't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jovita (glancing around). Nothing, nothing! But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> {{a terrible}} risk. At any moment {{we may be}} discovered.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then, my poor Manuel, it's as I feared; civilization has ruined you. Farming and a simple, bucolic {{life have}} perverted your morals. So <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> {{off with the}} stock and that mustang, when you got stuck in the snow; and the {{luminous}} idea of this little game struck you? Eh? That was another mistake, Manuel; I never allowed you to think when you were with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> to {{destruction}} {{in the way}} of sin, and there was a [...] voice, together with the Gospel preaching to your ear, that spake into [...] your heart, and called you back from that path of death to the way of [...] holiness, which is the only way of life. He hath severed you from the [...] mass of the profane world, and picked you out to be jewels for [...] himself.|$|E
6000|$|... '"True" [...] indeed! [...] One of our town, {{but later}} by an hour [...] Here than ourselves, spoke {{with me on}} the shore; [...] While <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> down the sands, and made [...] The dimpled flounce of the sea-furbelow flap, [...] Good man, to please the child.

60|$|FRIEND BLISS,--.... Yes, I am {{satisfied}} with the way <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> the book. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> it in staving, tip-top, first-class style. I never wander into any corner of the country but I find that an agent has been there before me, and many of that community have read the book. And on an average about ten people a day come and hunt me up to thank {{me and tell me}} I'm a benefactor! I guess this {{is a part of the}} programme we didn't expect in the first place.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will do as}} {{you tell}} me, Jack. But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> too much risk yourself, aren't you? I get little news of you; but I fancy you are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am heartily pleased, my lad," [...] Captain O'Connor said, as he {{laid his}} hand upon Terence's shoulder. [...] "I am proud of you. I have never seen my own name in general orders, but I am heartily glad to see yours. Bedad, when I think {{that a couple of}} months ago <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> wild and getting into all sorts of mischief, it seems hard to believe that you should not only be one of us, but have got your name into general orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where do {{you expect}} to go to, you little liar?" [...] Desmond asked. [...] "We know what you are up to. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> to tell some one that the {{soldiers}} were getting up. Now, if you are quiet and keep still no harm will come to you; but if you try to scream or to get away we shall hand you over to the police, and there's no saying whether they may not make it a hanging matter for aiding the king's enemies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You surely,' she said, 'aren't {{going to}} suggest {{at this hour}} of the day, Nutty, that your friends aren't the most horrible set of pests outside a prison? Not that it's likely after all these months that they are outside a prison. You know {{perfectly}} well that while <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> round New York you collected the most pernicious bunch of rogues that ever fastened their talons into a silly child who ought never to have been allowed out without his nurse.' After which complicated insult Elizabeth paused for breath, and there was silence for a space.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} be afraid, Colonel Campbell, our {{confidence}} in <b>you</b> <b>is</b> absolute; but do you not think that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> a great risk in attacking a force some forty times as large as your own?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "If {{you start}} getting into a {{position}} where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> up debts that you cannot afford, spending money you don't have, it is the road not to success but to ruin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] Dick said, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> no risks on our account, countess. I {{fear that}} there may be suspicions that the count has been {{concerned}} in our escape." ...|$|R
60|$|Within a fortnight, {{so quickly}} does an aseptic wound heal up again, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> {{about in the}} sun, and I had come back, as one comes back to a thing forgotten, to the first {{beginnings}} of this chapter on my desk. But for a time I could not go on working at {{it because of the}} fear I had felt, and it is only now in June, in this house in France to which we have come for the summer, with you more flagrantly healthy than I have ever known you before, that my heart creeps out of its hole again, and I can go on with my story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{would advise}} you to beg, borrow or steal the money. A man of your {{abilities}} and practical experience oughtn't to find much difficulty {{in this part of}} the world," [...] said the newcomer. [...] "The tale may have been a fabrication, but it sounded true, and while I don't set up as a reformer I am a director of this Company, and can't have those rumors set going about its secretary. No, I don't want to hear your side of the case--it's probably highly creditable to you--but I know all about the kind of business <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running,</b> and a good many other folks in this province do, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--When Mrs. Clemens {{read your}} letter she said: [...] "Well, then, {{wherever}} they go, in March, the direction will be southward {{and so they}} must give us a visit on the way." [...] I {{do not know what}} sort of control you may be under, but when my wife speaks as positively as that, I am not in the habit of talking back and getting into trouble. Situated as I am, I {{would not be able to}} understand, now, how you could pass by this town without feeling that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> a wanton risk and doing a daredevil thing. I consider it settled that you are to come in March, and I would be sincerely sorry to learn that you and Mrs. Howells feel differently about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll try {{and tell}} you," [...] was the meditative reply. [...] "It's your {{extraordinary}} insouciance. It seems to me, as a budding diplomat, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> the most ghastly risks on earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why {{not come}} back?" [...] She did not reply, and he resumed, with tender gravity: [...] "I hope I haven't {{made it so}} {{unpleasant}} for <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> away to escape me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I have educated you thus, Angela, {{partly by}} {{accident}} and partly by design. You will {{remember when you}} began to come here some ten years since--you were a little thing then--and I had offered {{to give you some}} teaching, because you interested me, and I saw that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> wild in mind and body. But, when I had undertaken the task I was somewhat puzzled how to carry it out. It is one thing to offer to educate a little girl, and another to do it. Not knowing where to begin, I fell back upon the Latin grammar, where I had begun myself, and so by degrees you slid into the curriculum of a classical and mathematical education. Then, after a year or two, I perceived your power of work and your great natural ability, and I formed a design. I said to myself, 'I will see how far a woman cultivated under favourable conditions can go. I will patiently teach this girl till the literature of Greece and Rome become as familiar to her as her mother-tongue, till figures and symbols hide no mysteries from her, till she can read the heavens like a book. I will teach her mind to follow the secret ways of knowledge, I will train it till it can soar above its fellows like a falcon above sparrows.' Angela, my proud design, pursued steadily through many years, has been at length accomplished; your bright intellect has risen to the strain I have put upon it, and you are at this moment one of the best all-round scholars of my acquaintance." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, Howard {{retired to}} Greencastle, Indiana, {{where his wife}} taught at DePauw University. He {{attempted}} to foster the sport at the college, but failed. Howard explained:"I tried to start lacrosse at DePauw. We held a few practices in the fall. The kids had a problem - they would not believe you could catch and throw a lacrosse ball while <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>running.</b> They thought {{you had to be}} standing still ... After Christmas, nobody came back. Either I'm a lousy teacher or kids in Indiana just didn't like lacrosse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If it is conclusive, I don't see why {{you should}} go to Sydney at all. If your proof is so perfect, why should that fellow be kept in prison while <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> about the world?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think of {{the risk}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running,</b> Pa," [...] she whispered. She would have dragged him to the closet. But it was too late. The door opened, and Mr. Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "This. I {{scarcely}} slept last night, {{for thinking}} of the dangers <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running.</b> The Paladin told me how you made the duke stand {{out of the way}} when the cannon-balls were flying all about, and so saved his life." ...|$|R
