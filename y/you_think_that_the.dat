2500|$|Game Revolution's Johnny Lee {{scored the}} PC version an A-, calling the game [...] "Non-stop 3D shooting, killing, exploding, dodging, parachuting, running, ambushing, assassinating, jumping, mind blowing action!" [...] He wrote, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 3D gaming style in Mario 64 was awesome, {{but the game}} just too soft for you? Try it again with a twist of Doom and you can say [...] "up yours" [...] to those soft-core, non-violent, weak-ass kiddy games." [...] He praised the gameplay, sniping mode, the bombing minigame, and the game's acerbic sense of humor. He {{concluded}} [...] "MDK combines sweet graphics and 'revolutionary' gameplay and design concepts {{to put it in}} a class by itself. Thank heavens someone decided to create something revolutionary rather than dupe others' successful ideas." ...|$|E

A woman painted all this?... there's nothing sadistic here, instead what strikes the most is the impassibility of the painter, who was even able to notice how the blood, spurting with violence, can decorate with two drops the central spurt! Incredible I tell you! And also please give Mrs. Schiattesi—the conjugal name of Artemisia—the chance to choose the hilt of the sword! At last don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only aim of Giuditta is to move away to avoid the blood which could stain her dress?

2500|$|In 1934 {{the chief}} of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Admiral Ernest King, offered Halsey command of the {{aircraft}} carrier , subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Captain Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week Naval Aviator course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. [...] "I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be {{at the mercy of the}} pilot." [...] Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!" [...] He went on to command the Saratoga, and later the Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, [...] "The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good." [...] Captain Halsey was promoted to rear admiral in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.|$|E
