5|$|The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz {{occurred}} about 1.8 {{million years}} ago {{at the beginning of the}} Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 {{million years ago}}, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The remarkably {{successful}} Hymenoptera {{appeared as}} long as 146 million {{years ago in the}} Cretaceous period, but achieved their wide diversity more recently in the Cenozoic era, which began 66 million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>A</b> number of highly successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with flowering plants, a powerful illustration of coevolution.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in this {{chain is}} calc-alkaline, {{yielding}} both andesite, dacite, and rhyolite. Three million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> {{change in the}} chemistry of volcanism occurred, with an increased content of potassium in the rocks. This change in composition geographically coincided with the volcanic activity crossing a lineament known as the Trotus line.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>A</b> divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split {{does not seem to}} have been driven by competition for resources but instead by the fact that each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{takes place}} in the three mountainous regions at 45 {{distinct}} coal beds near Mesozoic basins. Over 62 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as slate, kyanite, sand, or gravel, were also mined in Virginia in 2012. The state's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 caves, ten of which are open for tourism. 35 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting crater may explain sinking and earthquakes in the region.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} volcano spends {{less time}} actively {{attached to the}} plume. The large difference between the youngest and oldest lavas between Emperor and Hawaiian volcanoes indicates that the hotspot's velocity is increasing. For example, Kohala, the oldest volcano on Hawaii island, is one million years old and last erupted 120,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> period of just under 900,000 years; whereas one of the oldest, Detroit Seamount, experienced 18 million {{or more years of}} volcanic activity.|$|E
50|$|After {{the major}} {{collapse}} approximately 5,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about {{as recently as}} 1,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> many as 11 Holocene tephra layers have been found.|$|R

5|$|In January 2008 British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} (in {{the journal}} Nature Geoscience) that 2,200 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> volcano erupted under Antarctica's ice sheet (based on airborne survey with radar images). The biggest eruption in Antarctica {{in the last}} 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the metamorphism during the Proterozoic. About 1,400million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>a</b> mass of granite now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California {{at least two}} million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps {{at the same time}} as humans.|$|E

5|$|Several million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> {{species of}} small African ape gained {{the ability to}} stand upright. The {{subsequent}} advent of human life, {{and the development of}} agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300million years to culminate.|$|E
5|$|St. Helens {{started its}} {{growth in the}} Pleistocene 37,600 years ago, during the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and {{andesite}} eruptions of hot pumice and ash. 36,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>a</b> large mudflow cascaded down the volcano; mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current ice age.|$|E
5|$|Starting 20 {{million years}} ago (in the Cenozoic) and lasting until 5 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> now-extinct {{extension}} of Cascade Range volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and Long Valley areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{regional}} differences correspond mainly to old ethnic or tribal divisions from around <b>a</b> thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of}} expulsions and other displacements of Poles during and after World War II, as well as language policy in the People's Republic of Poland, the Polish language became far more homogeneous {{in the second half}} of the 20th century.|$|R

5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>A</b> migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million years ago but 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat is {{believed}} to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>A</b> second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{date of the}} {{appearance}} of smallpox is not settled. It most likely evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago. The wide range of dates {{is due to the}} different records used to calibrate the molecular clock. One clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>A</b> second clade included both alastrim minor (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present. This clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>A</b> second estimate has placed the separation of variola from Taterapox at 3000–4000 years ago. This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding {{the appearance}} of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin. However, if the mutation rate is assumed to be {{similar to that of the}} herpesviruses, the divergence date between variola from Taterapox has been estimated to be 50,000 years ago. While this is consistent with the other published estimates, it suggests that the archaeological and historical evidence is very incomplete. Better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed.|$|E
