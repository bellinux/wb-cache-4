Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the <b>years</b> <b>since,</b> <b>I</b> have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E

500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many <b>years</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared {{the heck out of}} me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment.

[...] "Before I knew it, people would line up on the street for our performances," [...] Benise said. [...] "It's been seven <b>years</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> started with the Spanish guitar.

2500|$|The attack {{took place}} {{approximately}} {{three weeks before}} the Israeli legislative election of 1981. Opposition leader Shimon Peres criticized the operation as a political ploy, which did not go over well with the electorate. Dan Perry writes that [...] "the Osirak bombing—and Peres's poor political judgement in criticizing it—were crucial in turning the tide of what initially had seemed to be a hopeless election campaign for Likud". Begin responded to Peres's accusation at a Likud rally: [...] "Jews, you have known me for forty <b>years,</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> lived in the Hassidoff neighborhood of Petah Tikva to fight for the Jewish people (a reference to Begin's incognito days in the Irgun). Would I send Jewish boys to risk death—or captivity worse than death, because those barbarians would have tortured our boys horribly—for elections?" [...] On 30 June, Likud was reelected over Peres's Alignment party, winning by just one seat in the Knesset.|$|E
2500|$|In an 1834 {{letter to}} Silliman, Morey wrote: “It {{is now more}} than twenty <b>years</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{have been in the}} constant, I may say daily {{practice}} of making experiments on the decomposition of water, by mixing with its vapor that of spirits of turpentine, and a great portion of atmospheric air.” This would seem to understate the scope of some research that led to such diverse discoveries as the liquid fueled internal combustion engine, a method for carbonating water, and odd bubbles formed by molten resin. The last two appeared in journals in England and Germany, respectively. Morey noted differences in flames near knots, perhaps rich in sap, or in wet wood. Eventually he experimented with anything he could find: “tar, rosin, rough turpentine, or the spirit, or alcohol, or any kind of oil, fat, or tallow; mineral coal, pitch-pine wood, and the knots, birch bark, pumpkin, sun-flower, flax, and other seeds; as well as many other substances.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Shinee {{is known}} for their fashion style, {{initially}} created by designer Ha Sang-beg (...) , which features high-top sneakers, skinny jeans, and colorful sweaters. Their style has created a fashion trend amongst students which the media dubbed the [...] "Shinee Trend". The group's [...] "boyish charm" [...] was {{an important factor in}} Shinee gaining fans. With the release of 2009, Year of Us, Shinee's style became more mature, though still contained Shinee's unique image. Furthermore, instead of working with famous artists and photographers, S.M. Entertainment's Visual and Art Directing department usually works with up-and-coming talents with new ideas for Shinee's concepts. When Shinee debuted in 2008 with [...] "Replay", it was not only their music which gained attention but also their colorful style—but even four years later, in 2012, Shinee maintained their colorful concept for Sherlock. Their designer, Ha Sang-beg, stated {{in an interview with the}} Korean Times: [...] "Much has evolved over the <b>years,</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> change their styles to reflect their music. The feel from their debut single still exists, mixing the overground [...] with the underground, haute couture with street fashion ... but it is very modern, like Shinee." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{assimilation}} was {{a crucial}} part of the Carlisle School's plan, it was also looked at controversially by some Native Americans who felt they were pushed to marry interracially. As Katherine Ellinghaus notes in her book, “There was considerable resistance to the school’s unspoken policy regarding interracial marriage.” On the Carlisle Indian School Digital Resource Center, this also proves evident. Isaiah Wasaquam, a member of the Ottawa Nation, echoes controversy in an application to Carlisle when he answers a question about his marriage proudly, “it has been nearly ten <b>years</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> married my Race.” [...] Research suggests this was a subtle hint to the school’s officials to prove that they have married their own race. Most likely, this backlash by the Native’s {{is due to the fact}} that the school was trying to, “take the Indian out of the man.” Additionally, Cathleen Cahill proves that the Carlisle School matches the time in history that enveloped such assimilation, [...] "During the closing decades of the nineteenth century, the federal government's strategies for changing Indian societies tacitly encouraged interracial marriage." [...] Although this unwritten rule of interracial marriage was never proven, the conversation remains ongoing regarding the controversiality of this occurrence.|$|E
