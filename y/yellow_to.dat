5|$|The {{body is a}} pale {{brown or}} silvery brown colour, {{transitioning}} to white below, with green, mauve and rosy reflections when the fish is first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the pectorals are pale <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base. The caudal fin is <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> olive in colour with darker margins. Juveniles less than 90mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs.|$|E
50|$|Silver sand {{is a fine}} {{white sand}} used in gardening. It {{consists}} largely of quartz particles that are not coated with iron oxides. Iron oxides colour sand from <b>yellows</b> <b>to</b> rich browns. Silver sand is also used as a constituent of mortar for laying light coloured pavers.|$|R
50|$|In {{ecology and}} forestry, <b>yellow</b> pine refers <b>to</b> {{a number of}} pine species which tend to grow in similar plant {{communities}} and yield similar strong wood. In the Western United States, <b>yellow</b> pine refers <b>to</b> Jeffrey pine or ponderosa pine. In the Southern United States, <b>yellow</b> pine refers <b>to</b> longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, slash pine, or Loblolly pine. In the United Kingdom, <b>yellow</b> pine refers <b>to</b> Eastern white pine or Scots pine.|$|R

The scales on the underside vary from light <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> different shades of green. The toes on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and gripping tree limbs.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E

In the SAR role, RDAF AW101s have a crew of six and were initially painted <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> distinguish themselves from AW101 allocated to military duties, but were later painted green, and all 14 AW101s are used for SAR and troop transport.|$|E
5|$|Io's {{colorful}} {{appearance is}} the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide frost is ubiquitous across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen in many places across Io, forming <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, breaking up the normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.|$|E
5|$|Myrrh is a bitter-tasting, aromatic, <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> reddish brown gum. It is {{obtained}} from small thorny flowering {{trees of the}} Commiphora genus, which {{is a part of}} the incense-tree family (Latin: Burseraceae). There are two main varieties of myrrh: bisabol and herabol. Bisabol is produced by C. erythraea, an Arabian species similar to the C. myrrha, which produces the herabol myrrh. C. myrrha grows in Ethiopia, Arabia, and Somalia.|$|E

5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{has a small}} (an {{average of}} 20.9mm in length in adult individuals), delicate, ovate shell of 3¼ whorls, with deep sutures. The shell is almost translucent, and varies in color from a chalky pale <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> white, with a glossy surface. Several {{internal}} organs of the animal can be distinguished through the shell's outer surface. The visible soft parts of the animal are of a pale subtranslucent yellow color, with different markings during distinct stages of development.|$|E
5|$|The WindSeeker at Knott's Berry Farm {{differed}} from the other five in several ways. Rather than white, blue, and green on the tower, Knott's adopted a color scheme using orange, purple, and <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> reflect the Spanish California theme of the Fiesta Village section of the park. The tower at Knott's had no lights at the top. The ride's sign had a Mexican theme and did not light up.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores {{produced}} by Polytolypa are , <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> yellow-orange in color, with dimensions of 2.5–5 by 3–4μm. Viewed {{with a light}} microscope their surfaces appear to be smooth, but under scanning electron microscopy, they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small, hard, sharp projections. The structures that produce the ascospores are called asci. In Polytolypa they are numerous, spherical, and measure 9–10 by 12–13μm. Each ascus contains eight ascospores, which are released when the ascus dissolves away at maturity. The anamorph (asexual form of the fungus) resembles the genus Chrysosporium.|$|E
50|$|In color Lopodytes species {{generally}} are {{a range of}} dusty greyish <b>yellows</b> <b>to</b> browns, shades that combine with their shape to make them inconspicuous in the partly dried tussock grasses that they normally inhabit. They probably are noticed far less often in the field than {{when they come to}} lights at night in certain seasons.|$|R

But as he got nearer he realised it was not.|$|R

5|$|There are few {{variations}} in plumage {{between the three}} subspecies. Anairetes parulus aequatorialis tends to be browner than the nominate subspecies in its upperparts, with broader and more extensive breast streaks and broader and more distinct white wingbars. A. p. patagonicus has more variation from the nominate subspecies as it is paler gray overall, particularly on the crown, and the wingbars and breast streaks are broader and more distinct. A. p. patagonicus underbelly is also a paler <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> white.|$|E
5|$|When {{head coach}} Paul Johnson {{was hired in}} 2008, the Yellow Jackets adopted a new uniform style. One year later, the uniforms were altered to change the <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> gold. A year after that, the uniforms were altered again. This time, the team adopted {{separate}} white uniforms for both home and away games, while retaining the previous styles' navy and gold jerseys for occasions when the Yellow Jackets could not wear white at home.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other <b>yellow</b> <b>to</b> red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
50|$|Phytoplasmas are {{pathogens}} of agriculturally important plants, including coconut, sugarcane, and sandalwood, {{in which}} they cause {{a wide variety of}} symptoms ranging from mild <b>yellowing</b> <b>to</b> death. Phytoplasmas are most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. They are transmitted from plant to plant by vectors (normally sap-sucking insects such as leafhoppers) {{in which they}} both survive and replicate.|$|R
