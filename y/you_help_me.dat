500|$|McCartney {{suffered}} from depression prior to leaving {{the group and}} also after the group disbanded. His wife helped him pull out of that emotional crisis by praising {{his work as a}} songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording. In her honour, he later wrote [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed", explaining that with the Beatles breaking up, [...] "that was my feeling: Maybe I'm amazed at what's going on... Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> understand... Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time, hung me on the line, Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you." [...] He added that [...] "every love song I write is for Linda." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{has been}} {{embroiled in a}} feud with veteran rapper Lil' Kim since her success with Pink Friday. Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, [...] "If {{you are going to}} steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. <b>You</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> I help you. That's how it goes to me." [...] Minaj's single [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with Eminem was {{believed}} to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, [...] "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch." [...] Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called [...] "Tragedy" [...] was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track [...] "Stupid Hoe" [...] may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with 105's Breakfast Club that the song [...] "Automatic" [...] was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj [...] "obnoxious" [...] and [...] "catty".|$|E

[...] "It was easy to escape, or I should not have got away. They never {{suspected}} me as they suspected the others. I was so quiet, and so obedient, and so easily frightened. The finding London was the hard part, and there <b>you</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me.</b> Did I thank you at the time? I thank you now very kindly." ...|$|R

2500|$|After he {{got through}} that troubled phase of his career, he wrote [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] in Linda's honour. He {{explained}} {{during an interview}} that the song was written [...] "for me and Linda," [...] and that with the Beatles breaking up, [...] "that was my feeling: Maybe I'm amazed at what's going on... Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't <b>you</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> understand...

2500|$|Shanties {{have also}} been {{well-documented}} in use for tasks other {{than those of the}} deep-water sailor. The working of cargo was performed by stevedores to the accompaniment of shanties, for example {{in the tradition of the}} Georgia Sea Island Singers of St. Simons Island, Georgia. They used such shanties as [...] "Knock a Man Down" [...] (a variation of [...] "Blow the Man Down") to load heavy timber. The category of menhaden chanties refers to work songs used on menhaden fishing boats, sung while pulling up the purse-seine nets. The musical forms, and consequently the repertoire, of menhaden chanties differ significantly from the deep-water shanties, most noticeably in the fact that the workers [...] "pull" [...] in between rather than concurrently with certain words of the songs. Common examples are [...] "The Johnson Girls" [...] and [...] "Won't <b>You</b> <b>Help</b> <b>Me</b> to Raise 'Em Boys." [...] Off-shore whalermen in parts of the Caribbean sang shanties whilst rowing their whaleboats and when hauling their catch onto land.|$|E
