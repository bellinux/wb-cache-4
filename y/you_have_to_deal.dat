5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
500|$|The bombing came {{five days}} after the {{beginning}} of the peace talks in Belfast, and represented the IRA's opposition to talks which excluded republicans. The attack was part of a political strategy by the IRA to be included in negotiations on the IRA's own terms. According to historian Richard English: [...] "What they were doing with their return to bombings like the Manchester bomb was saying, 'We can still return to war if we want to. We can still put off a huge bomb in your cities and devastate them and therefore <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with us'".|$|E
500|$|In a 1975 interview, Dufek noted {{his love}} of both sports: [...] "There are times when I've thought of {{dropping}} one or the other, but heck, I've been doing this since high school {{and it would be}} pretty tough to quit them both now." [...] Dufek added: [...] "Hockey is a more relaxed thing. [...] It's a smaller atmosphere and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with only one or two coaches. [...] You can be more individual and flashy. [...] Football has certain assignments and you can't really express yourself." [...] In the end, however, Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL. [...] He explained: [...] "I've decided to pursue professional football because I would probably have an extensive tour in the hockey minor leagues and I don't want that." ...|$|E

There! down!--down! So! That'll do." ...|$|R
500|$|The motel {{scene with}} the bounty hunter and Dana Scully was shot on a sound stage in Vancouver, Canada in a simple motel room set. The scene {{featuring}} Scully being beaten up by the bounty hunter was primarily performed by a stunt woman. The stiletto weapon, {{often referred to as}} the [...] "gimlet", used by the bounty hunter was constructed from aluminium and acrylic, and activated by a pneumatic hose hidden in actor Brian Thompson's sleeve. The grunt Scully utters when thrown through a table was insisted on by Standards and Practices, giving the reasoning that the show needed to make it clear for the viewers that she was not dead. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz it was an [...] "arcane, bizarre logic that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with when you're putting a show on network television." [...] As director Rob Bowman was dissatisfied with the first take of Skinner shoving X against the elevator wall, Mitch Pileggi and Steven Williams decided to do the stunt for real, and Pileggi did it with so much strength that it broke the back of the elevator scenery. Williams' background in fight choreography, stemming from his role in , allowed him to help in choreographing the brawl.|$|E
500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

It left me with a lot of sleepless nights and I think about it constantly. I'll go to my grave wishing that I'd been better. I know that I did my best at that time, but it wasn't good enough.

2500|$|The US position, as {{presented}} to the UN General Assembly {{a month before the}} incident by President George W. Bush, was that sovereign states have [...] "an obligation to govern responsibly, and solve problems before they spill across borders. We have an obligation to prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary for terrorism and proliferation and human trafficking and organized crime." [...] Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the US Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about the raid that, [...] "When you are dealing with states that do not maintain their sovereignty and become a de facto sanctuary, the only way <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with them is this kind of operation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historian James J. Weingartner sees a {{connection}} between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. [...] "he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands." [...] On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: [...] "The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true".|$|E
5000|$|Bruce Timm states {{he wanted}} this series {{to focus on}} [...] "mystery, mood, drama as well as super hero action sequences" [...] and that Man-Bat fit into those {{categories}} perfectly. In an interview, he says, [...] "Man-Bat was chosen specifically the first episode because he wasn't familiar to very many people outside of comic book fans. Nobody had any preconceived notions about him. It wasn't like the Joker, where <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with people expecting him to be Jack Nicholson or Cesar Romero." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ulrich Niemann, a Jesuit priest, {{doctor and}} psychiatrist, whom priests call in {{exorcism}} cases, told The Washington Post in 2005, [...] "As a doctor, I {{say there is}} no such thing as possession... In my view, these patients are mentally ill. I pray with them, but that alone doesn't help. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with them as a psychiatrist. But at the same time, when the patient comes from Eastern Europe and believes that he's been impaired by evil, it would be a mistake to ignore his belief system." [...] Niemann further said that he does not think he is an exorcist and does not perform the Roman ritual of 1614. Academic Heike Schwarz says her case showed demonic possession as a variation of multiple personality disorder.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 June 2009, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} to the media that the Government of Singapore was planning to create the Special Operations Task Force to counter all terrorist threats from land, sea and air. According to Teo Chee Hean, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence at that time, he stated that the unit's establishment was needed because Singapore is not [...] "dealing only with people with guns.

Death, says Epicurus, is the greatest anxiety of all, in length and intensity. This anxiety about death impedes the quality and happiness of one's life by the theory of afterlife: the worrying {{about whether or not}} one's deeds and actions in life will translate well into the region of the gods, the wondering whether one will be assigned to an eternity of pain or to an eternity of pleasure.|$|R
