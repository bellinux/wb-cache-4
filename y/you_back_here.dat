6000|$|... "Well, we {{wish you}} a {{pleasant}} voyage," [...] Captain O'Halloran said. [...] "I suppose we shall see <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again, before long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Greeting, son Saduko!" [...] {{he said in}} a deep, {{rumbling}} voice. [...] "Why are <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> so soon, and why do {{you bring}} this flea of a white man with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bridge!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What brings <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here?</b> Don't {{you know}} that you endanger us as well as {{yourself}} by being seen here? General Villa will think that we have been harboring you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} not yet told me why <b>you</b> came <b>back</b> <b>here</b> to-night? If Citizen Chauvelin was your taskmaster, then you must know all that has occurred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} light enough by half-past six. Do not delay later {{in taking the}} road. And see that <b>you</b> are <b>back</b> <b>here</b> by nightfall; I shall be anxious till you are returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|Victor exploded. [...] "Get out," [...] he shouted. [...] "If <b>you</b> come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again I'll {{throw you}} down the stairs." [...] Thereupon he slammed the door in their faces and {{returned}} to his mother.|$|R
60|$|MARTHA--The {{years have}} made me reconciled. They haven't Curt. [She sighs--then turns to BIGELOW with a forced smile.] I suppose it's hard for any of <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> to realize that Curt and I ever had any children.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} the truth," [...] said he, in his quiet impassive voice. [...] "I fixed on these lines as a pis aller; and they have done all and more than I wished, by {{bringing}} <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> {{for at least a}} moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|FANNY. Thanks. Maybe {{you will}} also mention it to the butler. Possibly also to the--[She {{suddenly}} changes.] Honoria. Suppose it had been you--you know, you're awfully pretty--who had married Lord Bantock, and he had brought <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> among them all--uncle, aunt, all the lot of them--what would you have done? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} hurry," [...] said Mrs. Yeobright. [...] "It {{will be better}} not to get there till after dusk, and then nobody will notice <b>you.</b> Come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> to supper, {{if it is not}} too late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You?" [...] cried Eddie. [...] "What are <b>you</b> doin' <b>back</b> <b>here?</b> I gotta {{take you}} now," [...] {{and he started}} to draw his revolver; but Billy Byrne had him covered before ever his hand reached the grip of his gun.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Now,' I said, 'be {{off with}} you, and if <b>you</b> come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> I'll bid the Kafirs hunt you to Natal with their sticks. This is the South African Republic, and we don't care overmuch about law here.' Which we didn't in those days.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{must begin}} the {{preparations}} for our wedding at once,' he said; 'but my foster-brother {{will take you}} home, as I promised. In three days he will bring <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> with your parents and sisters, and any guests you may invite, in your company. By that time the feast will be ready.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eighteen years I've {{been on the}} trail. An' it led me to {{the last}} lonely villages of the Utah border. Eighteen years!... I feel pretty old now. I was only twenty when I hit that trail. Well, as I told <b>you,</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> a ways a Gentile said Jane Withersteen could tell me about Milly Erne an' show me her grave!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't {{it plain}} enough?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You {{came to my}} rooms {{a week or so}} ago, a terrified, broken-down man. If ever there was guilt in a man's face, it was in yours. You sent for Laverick. He pitied you and helped you away. At Liverpool they would not let you embark--these men. They have brought <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> You are their tool. But you know very well, Arthur, that it was not Stephen Laverick who killed the man in Crooked Friars' Alley! You know very well that it was not Stephen Laverick!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What made <b>you</b> come <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> ye auld beldam?' {{said one}} of the gipsies; 'could ye not have staid where you were, and spaed {{fortunes}} to the Cumberland flats? Bing out and tour, ye auld devil, and see that nobody has scented; that's a' you're good for now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw you dining at Luigi's {{yesterday}} and to-day," [...] he answered sternly. [...] "You {{were with the}} same man both times. I followed you yesterday. <b>You</b> both came <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> To-day <b>you</b> came <b>back</b> alone. Is this man your brother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are not so}} wicked as I thought," [...] he growled. [...] "Get up, then, and do my bidding. <b>You</b> can be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> {{two hours}} after dawn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not! He was hurt, though, {{and there}} was a terrible scene of {{confusion}} in the room. The people crowded around him, and I managed, somehow, to drag you away. The manager helped us. To tell the truth, he was only too anxious for you to get away before the police arrived. He was so afraid of anything getting into the papers. I drove <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> and, as you still seemed stunned, I brought you up-stairs. I didn't mean to stay, but I couldn't get you to say a single coherent word. I was afraid to leave you alone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see now, Gervaise, that it {{is truly}} no holiday {{excursion}} on which you are starting. I should envy you greatly were you going in command of an armed galley, prepared to beat off any craft that might try to overhaul you; but, going alone as you are, {{it is a very}} different thing. Should pirates meet you, you could offer no resistance, and your position would be a perilous one indeed. However, I think you are born to good luck, and am confident that your patron saint will look after you, and therefore expect to see <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in a fortnight's time at the outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Says I, 'I don't see no {{plan for}} getting you away secret, you are watched {{altogether}} too close, the only {{plan is to}} make a race for it. There ain't many horses on the plain as can beat that mustang of yours, and I know you can ride him barebacked. Do you take a head of maize now and walk across to where he is picketed, and feed and pat him; then to-morrow morning early do the same. They won't be watching very closely, for they will think you are only going to do the same as to-night. I have put an open knife down behind you. You cut his rope, jump on his back, and ride straight; I will join you {{at the bottom of the}} valley. They may overtake us, but they won't hurt you; if they do catch you, they will just bring <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again, and you will be no worse off than you are now. Will you try?' The gal nodded, and I crept away out of sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "But tell me, my dear," [...] said he, [...] "how are {{you going}} to find your father, and in what way can <b>you</b> bring him <b>back</b> <b>here</b> with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to {{understand}} that <b>you</b> cannot come <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> I told <b>you</b> I did not wish to sell you a pistol, and that ought to be enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Clare," [...] she said, [...] "I've {{called to}} see you and Mrs Clare, and to inquire if ye be well. I thought <b>you</b> might be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 3, 1937, again Alakbar was arrested. He {{told his}} fellow artist Rasim Babayev how it happened: [...] "One day I {{was walking down}} Komsomolskaya Street when I ran into Ruhulla Akhundov (one of the Bolsheviks who helped {{establish}} the Soviet system in Azerbaijan). [...] "Ruhulla looked annoyed at seeing me and remarked rudely: 'Hey, you dumb guy, are <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again?' And with those words, I was sent directly back to prison" [...] - this time, to Siberia and later on to Solovki, {{an island in the}} Arctic where there are monasteries. Alakbar would go on to do a series of paintings depicting the isolation of those years there.|$|E
5000|$|The R101 left Cardington, with Scott and 53 {{other people}} aboard, at 18:36 GMT on 4 October 1930, bound for Karachi with an {{intermediate}} stop at Ismaïlia in Egypt. (Scott {{had sought to}} expedite the departure {{in the hope of}} avoiding an approaching low-pressure area.) Opinions differ on Scott's mood at the time of departure; Masefield quoted F. A. de V. Robertson of Flight to the effect that Scott's final words before departure were [...] "The ship is really good now. I'm sure we'll have a splendid flight—and we'll see <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> just two weeks from now". However, another historian of the programme, Geoffrey Chamberlain, presented a different view in his 1984 book Airships—Cardington, citing comments allegedly made by Scott to Ted Stupple, an R100 crewman who was a [...] "frequent visitor" [...] to Scott's household, before departure. According to Chamberlain, Scott asked Stupple to [...] "keep an eye" [...] on his (Scott's) pregnant wife, describing the R101 as [...] "an old ragbag" [...] that was [...] "never going to make it".|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, Göring gets a hawk {{to capture}} Bugs. Bugs, {{standing}} next to Göring asks, [...] "Do you think he’ll catch me, doc?" [...] to which Göring replies, [...] "Do I think he'll catch you? Why, he’ll have <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> before you can say Schicklgruber." [...] (Schicklgruber was the original surname of Hitler’s father Alois.) Bugs runs off and jumps into his rabbit hole, but as he falls down the hole, the hawk, which imitates Jimmy Durante, catches Bugs in a bag, capturing him. Göring brings the bag to Hitler, who plays solitaire {{in front of a}} map depicting the decline of Fortress Europe. Göring identifies the captive in the bag as [...] "Bugsenheimer Bunny" [...] (as opposed to [...] "Weisenheimer", or [...] "wise guy") to der Führer. As Herr Hitler talks of the great rewards he’s going to pile upon Göring for this act of heroism, he peeks inside the bag and is shocked ("Ach!! Himmel!"). Göring goes and looks inside the bag as well, to be shocked as well (again, [...] "Ach!! Himmel!"). Out of the bag comes Bugs dressed as Joseph Stalin—complete with an enormous pipe and a large moustache—staring back at them. As the cartoon ends, Bugs glances back at the camera and asks, in a Russian accent: [...] "Does your tobacco taste different lately?", citing an ad slogan of that era for the Sir Walter Raleigh pipe tobacco manufactured by the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.|$|E
60|$|I {{was very}} glad to receive your nice letter. I am {{going to tell you}} {{something}} that I hope will please you. It is this: I am coming to London Thursday, and I mean to bring <b>you</b> both <b>back</b> <b>here</b> with me, to stay until we all come home together on the Saturday. I hope you like this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you shall}} {{have it on}} {{condition}} that you go away, and stay away, until harvest is over. After that, I will send for you and shall have more to tell you. If in the meantime <b>you</b> come <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> or hint that I am Winston, I will surrender to the police, or decide our differences in another fashion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{you know}} that yet? Up to the town, round the island just below the bridge,--the island with the croquet ground on it, <b>you</b> know--and <b>back</b> again <b>here.</b> Ready?" ...|$|R
40|$|Cooperation is a paradox: Why {{should one}} perform a costly {{behavior}} only {{to increase the}} fitness of another? Human societies, in which individuals cooperate with genetically unrelated individuals on a considerably larger scale than most mammals do, are especially puzzling in this regard. Recently, the threat of punishment has been given substantial attention {{as one of the}} mechanisms that could help sustain human cooperation in such situations. Nevertheless, using punishment to explain cooperation only leads to further questions: Why spend precious resources to penalize free-riders, especially if others can avoid this investment and cheaters can punish <b>you</b> <b>back?</b> <b>Here,</b> it is argued that current evidence supports punishment as an efficient means for the maintenance of cooperation, and that the gravity of proposed limitations of punishment for maintaining cooperation may have been overestimated in previous studies due to the features of experimental design. Most notably, the importance of factors as characteristic of human societies as reputation and language has been greatly neglected. Ironically, it was largely the combination of the two that enabled humans to shape costly punishment into numerous low-cost and less detrimental strategies that clearly can promote human cooperation...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then go," [...] she said, {{in final}} surrender. [...] "Conventions {{ought not to}} count against saving a sweet, good girl. Go and help her, and if <b>you</b> bring her <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> I'll receive her gladly." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{signed off}} {{at the end of}} her nightly {{broadcast}} with [...] "I'll see <b>you</b> right <b>back</b> <b>here</b> tomorrow night." [...] The show, like the competing evening newscasts, ended the year with ratings 14% below that of the preceding year. Until 2014 she was the anchor of ABC's flagship broadcast World News and the network's principal anchor for breaking-news coverage, election coverage, and special events.|$|R
60|$|SERGIUS. A hollow sham, I say. Would <b>you</b> {{have come}} <b>back</b> <b>here</b> {{if nothing had}} passed between you, except at the muzzle of your pistol? Raina is mistaken about our friend who was burnt. He was not my informant.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came for}} you, too," [...] he said. [...] "It would be {{difficult}} to take <b>you</b> <b>back</b> from <b>here</b> and so I was going to kill you, as I have sworn to kill all your kind; but you were right when you said that I was not such a beast as that slayer of women. I could not slay him as he slew mine, nor can I slay you, who are a woman." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "'Well, {{you ought}} to get up there. Get yourselves a good look around. Get {{the lay of the land}} uphere in New York, because it will {{probably}} be a good long while before <b>you</b> get <b>back</b> up <b>here</b> again.' ...|$|R
