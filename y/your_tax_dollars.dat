40|$|Amid {{the usual}} {{campaign}} rancor and negative attack advertisements that characterize competitive elections, voters were {{confronted by a}} new, more subtle appeal in 2008. In the hotly contested race for the 3 rd congressional seat in Minnesota between Democrat Ashwin Madia and Republican Eric Paulson, the latter candidate aired a campaign commercial late in the campaign asking voters to “meet the real Ashwin Madia. ” As far as campaign spots go, this one was hardly unique, charging his opponent with taking “more of <b>your</b> hard earned <b>tax</b> <b>dollars.</b> ” But in the brief thirty second advertisement, voters meet a slightly altered candidate. Madia, the son of Indian immigrants {{who served as a}} Marine in the Iraq War, was made to look several shades darker in the attack ad than he actually appeared in the original images. i The distorted stillshots that accompanied the “real Ashwin Madia ” exaggerated his color, introducing voters to a candidate that appeared more menacing. After the commercial aired, the once very popular Madia saw his support in the polls begin to slip, ultimately losing the bid for the open seat.

5000|$|It {{is argued}} that racial coding of {{concepts}} like crime and welfare {{has been used to}} strategically influence public political views. Racial coding is implicit; it incorporates racially primed language or imagery to allude to racial attitudes and thinking. For example, in the context of domestic policy, it {{is argued that}} Ronald Reagan implied linkages between concepts like [...] "special interests" [...] and [...] "big government" [...] with ill-perceived minority groups in the 1980s, using the conditioned negativity toward the minority groups to discredit certain policies and programs during campaigns. In a study analyzing how political ads prime attitudes, Valentino compares the voting responses of participants after being exposed to narration of a George W. Bush advertisement paired with three different types of visuals with different embedded racial cues to create three conditions: neutral, race comparison, and undeserving blacks. For example, as the narrator states [...] "Democrats want to spend <b>your</b> <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> on wasteful government programs", the video shows an image of a black woman and child in an office setting. Valentino found that the undeserving blacks condition produced the largest primed effect in racialized policies, like opposition to affirmative action and welfare spending.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} couple of years, the nation’s economy has seen the biggest {{downturn}} since the Great Depression. Utah has not been immune from these troubling times. We are, however, better positioned economically than nearly any other state and, moving forward, we have reason to be cautiously optimistic about our economic future.

40|$|Most inquiry on {{the role}} of money and power in civic life is {{addressed}} {{to the question of whether}} money can buy influence. 1 This is an interesting question in its details. How, exactly, is influence purchased and with what effects? Yet the answer to the general question is obvious, at least to the moneyed interests whose representatives must suppose that their millions of dollars in contributions are buying something. In this article I take the reality of purchasing influence for granted and propose that the most interesting current trend in this arena is a ripening claim that buying influence is entirely proper within American cultural and social traditions of free political competition. That expensive mass advertising establishes money as a condition of mass influence is now accepted as both true and legitimate. The role of money in American politics has been profoundly altered by the rise of what I call the ‘New Public ’ (Mayhew, 1997), a form of organizing public communication that bestows great authority on professional com-munications experts. Modern money-based politics is a product of mass consumption, electronic media, polling opinions, marketing, and advertis-ing. It is not surprising that many citizens often reduce political values to money, the common denominator of competing demands. Political leaders encourage a private, calculating attitude by repeating such slogans as, ‘Is this how you want <b>your</b> <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> spent? ’ (Sorauf, 1992). How do citizens want public dollars to be spent? Advocacy of claims that money is a legitimate arbiter of public values has increased over the last three decades. Proponents of such claims assert that public demand rules the market, and so it should, for it measures what people really want. Occasionally, when relatively legitimate political uses of money are at issue, politicians and officials are willing to state justification...|$|E
