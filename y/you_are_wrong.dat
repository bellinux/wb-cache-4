500|$|On {{the other}} hand, US-based writer Xi Nuo (...) {{released}} his book Xi Jinping and His Lovers that {{was turned down}} by Gui Minhai the previous year after he had received a visit from a Chinese government agent. Xi Nuo says his decision to publish the book was to challenge the Chinese authorities. [...] "I {{want to tell the}} Chinese authorities and Xi Jinping, the president of China, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> Completely wrong. You better release the five guys. Let them go back home". American and European associations of publishers and booksellers – including PEN American Center, the Authors Guild and the Federation of European Publishers – jointly wrote to CY Leung, urging him to take action on the missing Causeway Bay booksellers and [...] "request a formal assurance from Beijing that it will respect Hong Kong's autonomy and abide by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration".|$|E
2500|$|Mao Zedong, {{chairman}} of the People's Republic of China, was reviled for his persecution of intellectuals. On being compared to the First Emperor, Mao responded: [...] "He buried 460 scholars alive; we have buried forty-six thousand scholars alive... You [...] revile us for being Qin Shi Huangs. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> We have surpassed Qin Shi Huang a hundredfold. When you berate us for imitating his despotism, we are happy to agree! Your mistake was {{that you did not}} say so enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 2011, {{conservative}} {{talk radio}} host Rush Limbaugh told his listening audience: [...] "When I was 10 years old I was more self-sufficient than this parade of human debris calling itself Occupy Wall Street." [...] Glenn Beck said on his internet television network GBTV, [...] "Capitalists, {{if you think}} that you can play footsies with these people, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> They will come for you and drag you into the streets and kill you. They will do it. They’re not messing around." [...] Newt Gingrich said, [...] "All the Occupy movements starts with the premise that we all owe them everything. Now, that is a pretty good symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country and why you need to reassert something as simple as saying to them, go get a job right after you take a bath." [...] Rick Santorum also told the protesters to get jobs.|$|E
2500|$|... "Ol' English" [...] {{contains}} {{samples of}} [...] "(If Loving <b>You</b> <b>is</b> <b>Wrong)</b> I Don't Want to Be Right" [...] by Luther Ingram ...|$|R
6000|$|I agreed. [...] "I {{remember}} his face at Hoden's that day you winged him. Because Jim swore <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> {{not to kill}} instead of wing him. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do; and {{you will}} pardon me if I say {{improperly}} so. I think <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> in suffering Jane {{to go with him}} this afternoon." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Sun Ce sent Taishi Ci {{to persuade}} Liu Yao's {{followers}} to surrender, many of Sun Ce's aides felt that Taishi Ci {{could not be}} trusted. They believed that Taishi Ci would defect to either Hua Xin or Huang Zu. However, Sun Ce said, [...] "All of <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> I trust my judgment. Taishi Ci may be brave and headstrong, {{but he is not}} an impulsive person. He is a man of exemplary character and a man who keeps his word. I treat him like a close friend and will not betray him. All of you don't need to worry." [...] Sun Ce's aides only trusted Taishi Ci after he kept his promise and returned from Yuzhang Commandery. When Taishi Ci met Sun Ce again, he said, [...] "Hua Ziyu is a man of virtue, but not a talented leader. He has no grand plan; he only wants to preserve the status quo. Tong Zhi (僮芝) from Danyang lied that he has been appointed as the Administrator of Luling and has taken control of the commandery. The local clans in Poyang have formed their own ruling body and driven away the officials sent by Hua Ziyu to govern the area. Hua Ziyu is unable to control Luling and Poyang. Moreover, about 5,000 to 6,000 local clans in Haihun (海昏) have formed their own ruling body too and rejected control by the commandery administration. Hua Ziyu can do nothing about this." [...] Sun Ce clapped his hands and laughed. Later on, he pacified Yuzhang Commandery and successfully induced Hua Xin to surrender to him.|$|E
60|$|MR. BARLOW. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> dear, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> The peace can come, {{the peace}} that passeth all understanding.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> at all. How can I say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> when you are so good? If I could be your servant I would serve you. But I can be nothing to you, because of papa's disgrace. Dear Mrs. Robarts, I cannot stay. You must answer him for me." [...] And having thus made her speech she escaped from the room.|$|E
6000|$|It is not myself alone, nor all my people. A {{moment ago}} you {{said no one}} but I had any right to <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong.</b> Your child-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, in a non-committal fashion, [...] "we {{certainly}} won the match, and I think <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> to slip away. One {{would almost}} fancy that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> unduly sensitive now and then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little while}} ago, Mademoiselle, when M. de Mancini dubbed me a wizard <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{good enough to}} sneer. Now, a sneer, Mademoiselle, implies unbelief, and I would {{convince}} <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> to disbelieve." ...|$|R
6000|$|Herbert and I went to {{my house}} and {{despatched}} our answers. Now [...] began the storm. Granville met us driving to Newcastle. Sorry [...] beyond expression; he almost looked displeased, which for him is [...] much. Newcastle: I incline to think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> Canning: My [...] impression is <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> Various letters streaming in, all [...] portending condemnation and disaster. Herbert became more and more [...] uneasy.|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> Connie. He is nobody's enemy. He is the truest, cleanest, most right-seeking man I {{have ever}} seen.|$|E
60|$|ANNYS <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> It is {{the mother}} {{instinct}} that makes us politicians. We {{want to take care}} of the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> to come so early, Ransome. The {{service will}} last {{at least two}} hours. You had much better have taken my advice, and come on by {{yourself}} later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> in this, sir, if ever <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> in your life," [...] said Peregrine, {{leaving the}} room. His {{grandfather}} {{did not answer}} him again, but followed {{him out of the}} door, and walked briskly across the hall into the drawing-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, Monsieur le Console," [...] {{said the}} Dey sternly, [...] "if {{it shall be}} proved, even twenty years hence, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> in this matter, you shall have to answer for it." ...|$|R
60|$|FERRAND. It {{is because}} {{you do not know}} me, Ma'moiselle. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> it is always the unknown you should love.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Wilkins, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> I {{have walked}} away, being my own master, and I {{have done it}} openly, though I admit {{somewhat}} hastily--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘That’s where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> Gentle or simple, {{stupid or}} clever, {{the men are}} all alike {{in the hands of}} a woman that flatters them.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{should you}} do if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> like me--feeling that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> and miserable, and {{dreading}} everything to come?" [...] It seemed that she was hurrying to make the utmost use of this opportunity to speak as she would.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{relieved}} to hear it," [...] Challoner grimly replied. [...] "You wish {{to appeal to}} my gratitude and not my fears? Has it struck you that, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> correct in your conclusions, by keeping silent <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wronging</b> an innocent man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you mad Westerman," [...] said he; [...] "do {{you wish}} to fight here in the Mayor's house? I tell <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> in taunting him as you did; sit quiet till I make peace between you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adolphe," [...] said he, as he overtook {{him in the}} market-place, [...] "Adolphe, indeed <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> no one {{meant to}} show you any indignity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> you know, {{not so much}} in {{your views}} on the {{question}} itself--which, to tell the truth, I hardly understand as yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> Uriah,' I said. 'I {{dare say}} there are several things that I could teach you, {{if you would like}} to learn them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} is holding {{something}} back," [...] said Beth; [...] "something that would explain all the discrepancies in his story. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> Uncle John, not to let him speak when he offered to tell you all." ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{you don't}} listen to me, <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> punished, after {{which you will}} know that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> = If <b>you</b> dun listen, later you get punished, and then you know = don't listen, later you kena punish/punished then you know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>wronging</b> him in {{your heart}} all this while, ma tante?" [...] asked Crystal, {{and there was a}} slight tone of reproach in her voices [...] "you used not to be so cynical once upon a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|A little flash {{crept into}} Jacinta's eyes, but it faded again. [...] "I suppose I deserve that, but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> It wasn't to soothe my vanity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are wrong!" [...] exclaimed Arnold. [...] "Indeed, indeed <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong!</b> It's no excuse--it's the truth. I {{was present}} when the message came about his father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, indeed <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong!</b> Lord Harry {{has known}} Mrs. Vimpany for years, and he says--I am truly {{sorry to hear}} it--that the {{separation}} is her fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{looked up}} the book. Length twice the breadth and the {{elephant}} exactly in the middle. I thought the people ashore would {{know how to make}} the local flag. Stands to reason. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> Jukes. [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|I observed, when I passed you to-day, {{from your}} {{concerned}} looks, [...] and your hurried manner of putting something into your desk, that [...] <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{doing something that}} <b>you</b> knew <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> When <b>you</b> attempt [...] to do any thing whatever, which conscience tells <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> <b>you</b> [...] only make yourself uneasy and anxious while you do it, and then <b>you</b> [...] <b>are</b> forced to resort to concealment and deception, when you see me [...] coming. <b>You</b> would <b>be</b> a great deal happier, if <b>you</b> would always <b>be</b> [...] doing your duty, and then <b>you</b> would never <b>be</b> afraid.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bah!' cried John Westlock, {{with the}} utmost disgust and disdain the monosyllable is capable of expressing. 'Ladies, good evening. Come, Pinch, it's not worth {{thinking}} of. I <b>was</b> right and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong.</b> That's small matter; you'll be wiser another time.' ...|$|R
