5|$|A freeway {{along the}} I-475 {{corridor}} was {{proposed in the}} 1950s. The 1955 <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book,</b> an early proposal for {{what would become the}} Interstate Highway System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Flint area, including a loop route freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1957, I-475 construction was funded by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (<b>Yellow</b> <b>Book),</b> an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book</b> contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.|$|E
5|$|An east–west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (<b>Yellow</b> <b>Book),</b> an early proposal {{for what would}} become the Interstate Highway System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was waiting on approval of a final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.|$|E

5|$|By 1945, {{a divided}} highway {{designated}} Alternate US24 (US24A) was opened {{from the state}} line north to Erie. After World War II, the MSHD planned to convert several highways {{in the state to}} freeways. In planning maps from 1947, the modern I-75 corridor was included in the system that later became the Interstate Highway System. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book</b> after the cover color, that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system.|$|E
5|$|MSHD {{had plans}} to upgrade the US16 {{corridor}} to freeway standards {{in the middle of}} the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed a highway in the corridor. The General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book</b> after the cover color, showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced much of US16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94). MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US16 corridor.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan, the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and Sault St. Marie. In {{planning}} maps from 1947, this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the Interstates. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book</b> after the cover color, that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system. The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 (I‑75).|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} riverside roadway {{along the}} southern bank of the Mohawk River in western Schenectady was designated as part of NY5S in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY5S entered the Schenectady area on River Road and followed River and Rice Roads and Erie Boulevard into downtown Schenectady, where it ended at NY5. In the initial plans for the Interstate Highway System, outlined by the Bureau of Public Roads in the 1955 <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book,</b> the city of Schenectady would be served by two highways: one bypassing {{the city to the}} southwest (the New York State Thruway) and another that would loop north of the bypass route to serve downtown Schenectady.

25|$|The Ministry of Defence's (MOD) 2005 Defence Industrial Strategy {{encouraged}} BAE and VT Group {{to form a}} naval shipbuilding {{joint venture}} {{with the aim of}} maintaining the UK's naval shipbuilding capability in the long-term. In return, in July 2007 the MoD guaranteed the new company a certain amount of work for 15 years, or to pay penalties instead. The Terms of Business Agreement (ToBA) finally signed in July 2009 promised a minimum level of ship build and support activity of around £230 million/year to sustain a warship industry in the UK. The government could cancel the deal at any time, subject to penalties which would decline {{over the course of the}} agreement but which would have been £630m at the time of the 2010 SDSR, in lieu of the MoD's existing liability for rationalisation costs under <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book</b> rules.|$|E
25|$|Rolfe took an {{interest}} in photography throughout his life, but never achieved any more than basic competence. While he began to experiment with photography when he was a schoolmaster, it was his time in Rome in 1889–90 that introduced him to the work of the 'Arcadian' photographers Wilhelm von Gloeden and Guglielmo Plüschow. His seminary, the Scots College, was quite close to Plüschow's studio in via Sardegna, just off the via Veneto, and when Rolfe was expelled from the College and came under the benevolent patronage of the Duchess Sforza Cesarini, he began his own photographic efforts in imitation of von Gloeden and Plüschow. His models were the local ragazzi from the streets of Genzano di Roma, a town dominated by the Duchess's palazzo. These youths were later to become the principal characters in Rolfe's Toto stories, published first in The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book</b> in 1895–96 and later collected in Stories Toto Told Me in 1898 and In His Own Image in 1901.|$|E

The two were not introduced that evening but Yeats, probably through Lionel Johnson (who became disruptively drunk at the dinner), enquired about the woman seated opposite. Yeats was deeply affected, later writing in his memoirs of the encounter: [...] "I noticed opposite me.... a woman of great beauty... She was exquisitely dressed... and suggested to me an incomparable distinction." ...|$|E
500|$|The story {{appears to}} have been well known in {{literary}} circles. A variant of the tale is apparently mentioned in a poem by Flannacán Mac Cellaich in the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book</b> of Lecan. Flannacán {{is said to have been}} killed by the Vikings in 896. Another apparent reference, to an Orgain Mic Da Thó – [...] "The Slaughter of Mac Da Thó" [...] – is included in a 10th-century list of the prímscéla, the [...] "primary stories" [...] or [...] "chief stories" [...] which the professional poetic class (filid) used to relate to kings. Mac Da Thó's Hostel is also one of a number cited in a poem on the feasting halls or hostels (bruidne) of ancient Ireland. Clearly the tradition predates our oldest surviving copy, that of the Book of Leinster.|$|E
500|$|Nine {{plans for}} a Baltimore city freeway system were put {{together}} by Baltimore city planners between 1942 and 1957. [...] The most influential of these plans was portrayed in the Smith Report of 1945, which heavily influenced future proposals, including the proposal that would {{be included in the}} General Location of National System of Interstate Highways, also known as the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Book,</b> in 1955. [...] None of the plans gained traction due to either decision makers figuring the freeways were not needed or opposition to the east–west freeway passing straight through the central business district or immediately {{to the north of the}} central business district. [...] For instance, a 1957 proposal had the east–west freeway following Biddle Street through the northern part of downtown Baltimore. [...] However, by the late 1950s, Baltimore was starting to suffer from the flight of its commercial and industrial concerns and residents to the suburbs in response to the easy access provided by the developing Baltimore Beltway.|$|E
