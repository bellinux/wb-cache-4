2500|$|The first {{tenet of}} {{minority}} stress theory holds that {{being in a}} minority group is associated with increased exposure to distal stressors, such as prejudice and discrimination. [...] Indeed, despite significant improvement {{over the past several}} decades, numerous studies have confirmed that minority individuals continue to face high rates of distal stressors. For example, in large-scale national surveys, LGB individuals report high rates of prejudice and discrimination across the lifespan. One survey found that one-fourth of LGB adults have experienced victimization related to their sexual orientation, and another found that as many as 90% of LGBT <b>youth</b> <b>report</b> hearing prejudiced remarks at school. Similarly, up to 60% of African Americans report experiencing distal stressors throughout their lives, ranging from social rejection at school to housing discrimination and employment discrimination. In one study, 37 African American respondents recalled over 100 discrete experiences with racist prejudice in a two-year period. In another study, 98% of Black participants reported experiencing at least one incidence of prejudice in the past year.|$|E
2500|$|Rates of {{exposure}} to distal stressors are much higher among racial and sexual minorities than among majority individuals. [...] For example, LGB adults {{are twice as likely}} to recall experiencing prejudice throughout their lives compared to heterosexuals, and LGBT <b>youth</b> <b>report</b> significantly higher rates of prejudice and discrimination compared to their heterosexual peers. In one carefully controlled study, researchers compared rates of victimization among LGBT youth and their heterosexual siblings, and they found significantly higher rates of abuse among the LGB individuals. Comparing rates of perceived discrimination among African American and White individuals, researchers have found large differences in reports of discrimination: 30.9% of Whites reported experiencing [...] "major discrimination" [...] throughout their lives compared to 48.9% of African Americans. [...] Similarly, 3.4% of Whites reported experiencing discrimination [...] "often" [...] in their lives, compared to 24.8% of African Americans. Thus, collectively, research suggests that minority individuals face frequent exposure to distal stressors compared to their majority group counterparts.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recent {{national}} attention to hate crimes committed against lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths has highlighted {{the need to}} understand this group's experiences of violence. Using nationally representative data, we examine the associations between romantic attraction and experiences of violence, {{as well as the}} risk of witnessing violence and perpetrating violence against others. METHODS: Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were examined. <b>Youths</b> <b>reporting</b> same-sex and both-sex romantic attractions were compared with those reporting other-sex attractions. Survey logistic regression was used to control for sample design effects. RESULTS: <b>Youths</b> who <b>report</b> same-sex or both-sex romantic attraction are more likely to experience extreme forms of violence than <b>youths</b> who <b>report</b> other-sex attraction. <b>Youths</b> <b>reporting</b> same-sex and both-sex romantic attractions {{are also more likely to}} witness violence. The higher incidence of violence perpetrated by youths attracted to the same sex is explained by their experiences of violence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide strong evidence that <b>youths</b> <b>reporting</b> same-sex or both-sex romantic attraction are at greater risk for experiencing, witnessing, and perpetrating violence...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} of early initiation of sex, drug-use, drug-trafficking, and sensation-seeking among urban, African-American adolescents. A longitudinal follow-up of 383 youth ages 9 to 15 years at baseline over four years with serial risk-assessments was used. Sexual experience and several drug-related risk behaviors increased significantly during the four-year study interval. Sensation-seeking scores were higher after the baseline assessment among <b>youth</b> <b>reporting</b> tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use and were higher, both at baseline and through several follow-up assessments, among <b>youth</b> <b>reporting</b> drug-selling and sexual activity. At baseline, the correlations among drug-related risk behaviors were all strong, except those between initiation of sex and drug-related risk behaviors. However, over time, early initiators of sex were significantly more likely to report involvement in substance use and drug-delivery/sales than were late initiators. <b>Youth</b> <b>reporting</b> repeated involvement in drug-related activities were more likely to report intensive sexual involvement than they were to report experimental sex or no sex. Sensation-seeking scores were lower among <b>youth</b> <b>reporting</b> no involvement in risk behaviors. However, scores did not differ between youth exhibiting experimental behavior compared to youth demonstrating repeated risk involvement. These results support the need for alternative experiences for youth exhibiting high levels of sensation-seeking and the need for early drug/sexual risk prevention programs...|$|R

Methods: The study was based on three separate cross-sectional national telephone surveys of approximately 1, 500 youth Internet users, aged 10 through 17 years. Data were collected in 2000, 2005, and 2010. Results and Conclusion: Nine percent of <b>youth</b> <b>reported</b> an unwanted sexual solicitation in 2010. This continued the decline in unwanted sexual solicitations that occurred between 2000 (19 %) and 2005 (13 %), resulting in a total 50 % decrease between 2000 and 2010. Twenty-three percent of <b>youth</b> <b>reported</b> an unwanted exposure to pornography, a decline from 34 % in 2005, following an increase between 2000 and 2005 (25 % to 34 %).

40|$|Theoretical models {{suggest that}} many diverse psychosocial factors {{contribute}} to the etiology of substance use among youth. It {{has been suggested that}} substance use {{is a function of the}} total number of etiologic factors, rather than a specific type or set of factors. This study examined whether cumulative psychosocial risk and protection measured in the 7 th grade predicted alcohol use in the 9 th grade across ethnically diverse samples of adolescents. Participants consisted of black (n 775) and Hispanic (n 467) inner-city youth and white suburban youth (n 708). Prevalence rates for alcohol use and risk/protection varied more widely based on ethnic group compared to gender. Black <b>youth</b> <b>reported</b> the fewest risk factors and lowest levels of alcohol use, white <b>youth</b> <b>reported</b> the most risk factors and highest levels of alcohol use, and Hispanic <b>youth</b> <b>reported</b> the fewest protective factors and intermediate levels of alcohol use. Despite these differences, structural equation modeling indicated that a latent factor consisting of cumulative risk, protection, and their interaction significantly predicted later alcohol use for the combined sample as well as for each ethnic/ gender subgroup. However, the proportion of variance explained in alcohol use varied across subgroups, and moderator analyses indicated that protection significantly buffered the effect...|$|R
