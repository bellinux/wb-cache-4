60|$|But the {{countryside}} {{was the thing}} that made us open our eyes. Imagine a land of rich black soil, very heavily manured, and worked by the spade and hoe almost exclusively, and if you split <b>your</b> <b>field</b> (of vision) into half-acre plots, you will get a notion of the raw material the cultivator works on. But all I can write will give you no notion of the wantonness of neatness visible in the fields, of the elaborate system of irrigation, and the mathematical precision of the planting. There was no mixing of crops, no waste of boundary in footpath, and no difference of value in the land. The water stood everywhere within ten feet of the surface, as the well-sweeps attested. On the slopes of the foot-hills each drop between the levels was neatly riveted with unmortared stones, and the edges of the watercuts were faced in like manner. The young rice was transplanted very much as draughts are laid on the board; the tea might have been cropped garden box; and between the lines of the mustard the water lay in the drills as in a wooden trough, while the purple of the beans ran up to the mustard and stopped as though cut with a rule.|$|E
60|$|This {{survey of}} <b>your</b> <b>field</b> being made, you are {{prepared}} to commence definite operations, and the great difficulty, in carrying your plans into effect, is, how to act more efficiently on the greatest numbers at a time. The whole business of public instruction, if it goes on at all, must go on by the teacher's skill in multiplying his power, by acting on numbers at once. In most books on education, we are taught, almost exclusively, how to operate on the individual. It is the error into which theoretic writers almost always fall. We meet, in every periodical, and in every treatise, and in fact, in almost every conversation on the subject, with remarks, which sound very well by the fire-side, but they are totally inefficient and useless in school, from their being apparently based upon the supposition, that the teacher has but one pupil to attend to at a time. The great question {{in the management of}} schools, is not, how you can take one scholar, and lead him forward, most rapidly, in a prescribed course, but how you can classify and arrange numbers, comprising every possible variety, both as to knowledge and capacity, so as to carry them all forward effectually together.|$|E
60|$|Of {{agriculture}} first, {{because the}} bronze hatchet enabled men {{to make such}} openings in the forest as neolithic man had never ever dreamed of. For {{the first time in}} the history of our race, whole tracts of country at once began to be cleared and cultivated. Stone Age tillage was the tillage of tiny plots in the forest's depths; Bronze Age tillage was the tillage of fields and wide open spaces in the champaign country. The Stone Age knew no specials implements of agriculture as such; its tomahawk was indiscriminately applied to all purposes alike of war or gardening. You scalped your enemy with it, or you cut up your dinner, or you dug <b>your</b> <b>field,</b> or you planted your seed-corn, according as taste or circumstances directed. But while the Bronze Age men had axes to hew down the wood, they had also sickles and reaping-hooks to cut their crops, and a sort of hoe or scraper to till the soil with. Specialisation reached a very high pitch. All the remains of the Bronze Age show us an agricultural people by no means idyllic in their habits to be sure, and not all disposed to join the Peace Preservation Society, but cultivating large stretches of wheat or barley, grinding their meal in regular mills, and possessed of implements of considerable diversity, some of which I shall proceed to notice later.|$|E

You must assure yourself that there are no moving objects in sight. When you get near such a point you must dismount, and, leaving your horse, crawl forward until you reach a point from where you have a good view, and on no account stand up. While you are making your observations any Boers who might be lying in sight would be certain to notice a figure against the skyline, and we know that many of them are provided with glasses as good as our own. We must be as careful as if we were out after game instead of men. You all know these things as well as I do, but I want to impress them upon you. You see, they have captured five of the Natal police, who are a very sharp set of fellows. However, a few days' scouting will show us far better what is required than any amount of thinking beforehand. There is one thing that I want to say to you. You elected me for your leader, but it is quite probable that when we have worked together for a bit some of you may prove much better qualified for the post than I am. What I want to say now is, if this is the case, I shall feel in no way aggrieved, and shall serve just as cheerfully under his orders as I hope you will under mine so long as I command you." ...|$|E
60|$|Go to now, O ye rich men, howl and cry, Because of your {{approaching}} misery: Your riches are corrupted, and the moths Have ent'red, {{and have}} eaten up your clothes.

The hire of them that reaped down <b>your</b> <b>field,</b> The which by you is wrongfully withheld. Cries, and the voice thereof hath reach'd the ears Ev'n of the God of sabbath, and he hears. Your lives in pleasure ye on earth have led, And as in days of slaughter nourished Your wanton hearts, and have condemn'd and slain The just, and he doth not resist again. Be patient therefore, brethren, ev'n unto The coming of the Lord: behold, ev'n so The husbandman expecteth patiently The precious increase of the earth to see, With patience waiting till he doth obtain The showers of early and of latter rain. So be ye patient, fixing stedfastly Your hearts, for {{the coming of the}} Lord draws nigh. Grieve not each other, brethren, lest ye bear The condemnation;[14] lo! the judge stands near. The prophets, brethren, who all heretofore In the name of the Lord their witness bore, Take for examples in their sufferings And patience: they that endure such things, Ye know are counted blest. Have ye not read Of Job, how patiently he suffered? Have ye not seen in him what was God's end; How he doth pity and great love extend? My brethren, but above all things forbear, By heav'n or earth, or otherwise to swear; But let your yea be yea, your nay be nay, Lest ye become reprovable I say. Let him sing psalms that's merry; he that's griev'd, Let him by prayer seek to be reliev'd. If any of you by sickness be distress'd, Let him the elders of the church request That they would come and pray for him a while; Anointing him in the Lord's name with oil; So shall the pray'r that is of faith restore The sick, and God shall raise him as before. And all th' offences which he hath committed Shall be forgiv'n, and he shall be acquitted. Confess your faults each one unto his brother, And put up supplications for each other, That so you may be heal'd; the fervency Of just men's prayers prevails effectually. Elias was a man as frail as we are, And he was earnest with the Lord in pray'r, That there might be no rain, and for the space Of three years and six months no rain there was: And afterward, when he again made suit, The heav'n gave rain, the earth brought forth her fruit. If any one shall from the truth desert, And one, my brethren, shall that man convert; Let him be sure, that he that doth recall The poor backsliding sinner from his fall, Shall save a soul from death, and certainly Shall hide a multitude of sins thereby.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are scarce}} degrees of {{difference}} in my constant need of hearing from you, yet when that felicity comes it manages each time to seem pre-eminent and to have assuaged an exceptional hunger. The pleasure and relief, at any rate, three days since, were of the rarest quality--and it's always least discouraging (for the exchange of sentiments) to know that your wings are for the moment folded and <b>your</b> <b>field</b> a bit delimited. I knew you were back in Paris as an informer passing hereby on his way thence again to N.Y. had seen you dining at the Ritz en nombreuse compagnie, [...] "looking awfully handsome and stunningly dressed." [...] And Mary Hunter cesjours-ci had given me earlier and more exotic news of you, yet coloured with a great vividness of sympathy and admiration.... But I feel {{that it takes a}} hard assurance to speak to you of [...] "arriving" [...] anywhere--as that implies starting and continuing, and before your great heroic rushes and revolutions I can only gape and sigh and sink back. It requires an association of ease--with the whole heroic question (of the [...] "up and doing" [...] state)--which I don't possess, to presume to suggestionise on the subject of a new advent. Great will be the glory and joy, and the rushing to and fro, when the wide wings are able, marvellously, to show us symptoms of spreading again--and here I am (mainly here this winter) to thrill with the first announcement. London is better for me, during these months, than any other spot of earth, or of pavement; and even here I seem to find I can work--and n'ai pas maintenant d'autre idée. Apropos of which aid to life your remarks about my small latest-born are absolutely to the point. The little creature is absolutely of the irresistible sex of her most intelligent critic--for I don't pretend, like Lady Macbeth, to bring forth men-children only. You speak at your ease, chère Madame, of the interminable and formidable job of my producing à mon âge another Golden Bowl--the most arduous and thankless task I ever set myself. However, on all that il y aurait bien des choses à dire; and meanwhile, I blush to say, the Outcry {{is on its way to}} a fifth edition (in these few weeks), whereas it has taken the poor old G.B. eight or nine years to get even into a third. And I should have to go back and live for two continuous years at Lamb House to write it (living on dried herbs and cold water--for [...] "staying power"--meanwhile;) and that would be very bad for me, would probably indeed put an end to me altogether. My own sense is that I don't want, and oughtn't to try, to attack ever again anything longer (save for about 70 or 80 pages more) than the Outcry. That is déjà assez difficile--the [...] "artistic economy" [...] of that inferior little product being a much more calculated and ciphered, much more cunning and (to use your sweet expression) crafty one than that of five G.B.'s. The vague verbosity of the Oxusflood (beau nom!) terrifies me--sates me; whereas the steel structure of the other form makes every parcelle a weighed and related value. Moreover nobody is really doing (or, ce me semble, as I look about, can do) Outcries, while all the world is doing G.B.'s--and vous-même, chère Madame, tout le premier: which gives you really the cat out of the bag! My vanity forbids me (instead of the more sweetly consecrating it) a form in which you run me so close. Seulement alors je compterais bâtir a great many (a great many, entendezvous?) Outcries--and on données autrement rich. About this present one hangs the inferiority, the comparative triviality, of its primal origin. But pardon this flood of professional egotism. I have in any case got back to work--on something that now the more urgently occupies me as the time for me circumstantially to have done it would have been last winter, when I was insuperably unfit for it, and that is extremely special, experimental and as yet occult. I apply myself to my effort every morning at a little repaire in the depths of Chelsea, a couple of little rooms that I have secured for quiet and concentration--to which our blest taxi whirls me from hence every morning at 10 o'clock, and where I meet my amanuensis (of the days of the composition of the G.B.) to whom I gueuler to the best of my power. In said repaire I propose to crouch and me blottir (in the English shade of the word, for so intensely revising an animal, as well) for many, many weeks; so that I fear dearest Edith, your idea of [...] "whirling me away" [...] will have to adapt itself to the sense worn by [...] "away"--as it clearly so gracefully will! For there are senses in which that particle is for me just the most obnoxious little object in the language. Make your fond use of it at any rate by first coming away--away hither....|$|E
