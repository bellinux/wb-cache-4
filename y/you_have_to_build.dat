Tyler stated that the score pays homage to John Williams' scores for Star Wars, Superman, and Raiders of the Lost Ark and references the scores for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films {{in order to create}} a similar musical universe, saying, [...] "That's the goal for sure. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it." [...] Danny Elfman also contributed music to the score, using Silvestri's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme. Hollywood Records released the album digitally on April 28, 2015, and in physical formats on May 19.|$|E

500|$|On June 14 and 22, 2005, Deep Impact {{observed}} two {{outbursts of}} activity from the comet, {{the latter being}} six {{times larger than the}} former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission co-investigator for JPL pointed out that [...] "it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this thing. You have to rely {{on the fact that the}} Impactor is a smart spacecraft as is the Flyby spacecraft. So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> in the intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing." [...] On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed. A 6m/s (20ft/s) velocity change was needed to adjust the flight path towards the comet and target the impactor at a window in space about [...] wide.|$|E
2500|$|After much {{criticism}} and numerous delays, RIM officially launched BlackBerry 10 and two new smartphones based off the platform, the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10, on January 30, 2013. The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. {{with other countries}} following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 {{by the time the}} device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII. In discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an off-the-shelf platform such as Android, Heins noted, [...] "If you look at other suppliers' ability to differentiate, there's very little wiggle room. We looked at it seriouslybut if you understand what the promise of BlackBerry is to its user base it's all about getting stuff done. Games, media, we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game. Very little time to consume and enjoy contentif you stay true to that purpose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> on that basis. And if we want to serve that segment we can't do it on a me-too approach." [...] Chief Operating Officer Kristian Tear remarked [...] "We want to regain our position as the number one in the world", while Chief Marketing Officer Frank Boulben proclaimed [...] "It could be the greatest comeback in tech history. The carriers are behind us. They don't want a duopoly" [...] (referring to Apple and Samsung).|$|E

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, he took a fiction-writing {{workshop}} led by Gordon Lish. Of the Lish class, Bailey told an interviewer, [...] "The whole concept of the class was basically {{to learn how to}} write a story, period. What this class did was basically strip everything down to the barest essential, which was a sentence. Really, a word, actually, and then a sentence, and then <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> everything from that first word. The idea was that by the 12th class, we would be able <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a full story. Very few people made it to a full story. For some, it was really humiliating. ... I made it to two and a half pages. It was more than a sentence, but I never finished the story. I was inspired by Lish, but also sort of terrified of him. ... What it taught me, really, was the power of language, thinking of words {{not so much as a}} poet but really on a base level, making sure everything you put out there counts." ...|$|R

5000|$|Mayersberg said [...] "I'm of {{the belief}} that, in general, film {{is not a very}} good medium for science fiction, it's visual, and {{therefore}} not very imaginative.

5000|$|According to Unterberger, [...] "the {{very fact}} that the {{equipment}} was so primitive... lent a spontaneous resonance and warmth that has rarely been achieved by subsequent synthesizer technology." [...] Producer David Rubinson commented:The ring modulator and the volt-control oscillators and voltage control filters [...] - [...] they didn't come in a set, like they did in a Moog. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> each one [...] - [...] which they did [...] - [...] and actually hard-wire them together. It was an eight-track album. So all that synthesized stuff was painstakingly layered in, sound by sound, one oscillator at a time. Now you may get a bank of oscillators and you can run six, eight, twelve {{of them in a}} row, and make all kinds of wonderful waves, shapes, and it can be very complicated. But at that time, it was not possible. It had one oscillator, one ring modulator, one voltage control filter [...] - [...] that's it. It looked funny. It was like aluminum boxes, little knobs sticking out, and patch cords. And it was very exciting to me, because it was a marriage of a lot of what was happening in what people called classical music at the time. When people think about what Steve Reich was doing then, and Terry Riley was doing then, and what Joe Byrd was doing then, it was very, very similar in different areas.|$|R

5000|$|The company's {{business}} model is {{to address the}} consumer market with a low cost, small form, simple to program unit. [...] According to one report, 56,000 personal 3D printers were shipped globally in 2012 and the market {{is expected to grow}} to close to 2 million units by 2018. [...] The Micro was described in October 2014 as [...] "one of the lowest-priced personal 3-D printers that <b>you</b> don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> yourself." [...] The form of the unit is a 7-inch cube weighing 2 pounds. [...] The initial Kickstarter price point of $299 has not been maintained, but increased to $349 by October 2014. [...] This low cost was achieved through reduction of [...] "power consumption by a factor of 10 compared to professional 3D printers", and the use of locally sourced, standardized electronics.|$|R

5000|$|Source {{followers}} (buffers) [...] {{are another}} complementary structure found in amplifiers. The complementary source follower, {{often used in}} the output stage of an amplifier, can be designed such that it can adjust the output offset voltage to zero, effectively, {{eliminating the need for}} an AC coupling capacitor. [...] A complementary source follower can also be paralleled to create power amplifiers. Nelson Pass built such a design based on Toshiba’s 2SK170 and 2SJ74 single complementary JFETs with over 1000 paralled JFETs [...] Today though, since Toshiba discontinued these parts, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> such an amplifier with LSK170 and LSJ74 single complementary pairs or with LSK489 and LSJ689 JFETs. Because the LSK489 and LSJ689 have lower input capacitance than Toshiba parts and are duals the same kind of amplifier design would have lower noise levels and a smaller footprint.|$|R
5000|$|According to McCartney, George Harrison [...] "didn't {{want to do}} it," [...] {{while an}} unnamed {{participant}} told the Daily Express: [...] "George just didn’t want to rework it because it’s {{not a matter of}} putting some vocals, or a bit of bass and drums to finish it. With this, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> really <b>build</b> the song." [...] Producer Jeff Lynne reported that [...] "It was one day—one afternoon, really—messing with it. The song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn't finish." [...] An additional factor behind scrapping the song was a technical defect in the original recording. As with [...] "Real Love", a 60-cycle mains hum can be heard throughout Lennon's demo recording.

Also, for providing a lab environment with all the tools and technology I needed and colleagues for support and stimulating discussions. I believe that all I have learned as a graduate student in the Stathopoulos lab will be invaluable to me during my postdoctoral research and beyond. I would like to thank my current thesis committee: Dr. Kai Zinn, Dr. Marianne Bronner and Dr. Paul Sternberg, and previous member Dr. Henry Lester, for all of their helpful feedback and efforts to keep me on the right track. I am beginning to fully appreciate how many demands they have on their time and energy and their attendance at my meetings and availability for advice outside of meetings is a testament to how much they care about training graduate students. I remember meeting with Marianne, Kai and Paul {{for the first time as}} a prospective student. The enthusiasm they had for their research and the stimulating interview conversations I had with them were the main reason I chose to come to Caltech (and I’m very glad that I did). In addition, Marianne and Paul both provided nurturing environments for me as a rotation student and the opportunity to work with their most outstanding post docs, Tatjana Sauker Spengler and Cheryl Van Buskirk. Many outstanding educators were responsible for capturing my interest in the subject area of Biology and Developmental Biology. Most notably, I would like to thank Jane Haddad,...|$|R
