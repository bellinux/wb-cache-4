A rigorous mathematical theory of resonances for such Hamiltonians has been developped in the pioneering papers by Aguilar-Combes [Ag-Co] for 2 -particle Hamiltonians and Balslev-Combes [Ba-Co] for arbitrary N. In this approach resonances are defined as complex eigenvalues of some non selfadjoint deformation of H. However in these two papers {{it is essential that}} the pair potentials are dilation analytic, which roughly means that the V ij (<b>y)</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> extend holomorphically in a cone fjImzj CjRezjg. For some applications (like for example N Hamiltonians where some particles have infinite mass) it proved necessary to extend the class of potentials in order to accept potentials which are analytic only near infi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Retail {{development}} {{has become the}} preferred land use among Californ ian cities because the sales tax dollars generated by such development have {{the greatest impact on}} local budgets. This situation {{is a direct result of}} California ’ s Proposition 13, passed in 1978, which limits property taxes to 1 per cent of the origin al purchase price of properties. The paper explores how the bene ® ts of public assistan ce are distributed among the major parties to public ± private joint venturesÐ the city, the anchor retailer and the developer. It attem pts to answer the question, ª Who really bene ® ts from public assistan ce?º We focus on high volume retailers, sometimes referred to as `big-box ’ retailer s, becau se they represen t a homogeneous class of public ± private projects. The results show, som ewhat surprisingly, that while the city ’ s share of the bene ® ts may have eroded, new perform ance-based incentives are being employed in public± private joint ventures that help to protect the city ’ s share. The North County Square case study illustrates how new perform ance-based public ± private deals are structured. The paper then compares the distribution of public tax bene ® ts in four public ± private transaction s in Californ ia. The analysis shows a wide variatio n in the percen tage of tax bene ® ts that are retained by the city. In those situations where the city must compete with another city where the development will otherw ise occur, the develop er and the tenant are more likely to receive a large percen tage of the total bene ® ts. The case study demonstrates that cities do not necessaril <b>y</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> receive a smaller and smaller share of the public bene ® t over tim e as tenants and developers become more sophisticate d in playing off one city again st another. Deal structures such as those presen ted here provide ample tools with which to protect the public ’ s share of the bene ® ts...|$|E

In this paper we give explicit formulae {{for the difference}} of the Hirzebruch χ_y-genus χ_y(E) - χ_y(F) χ_y(B).

In the case of dim_ CE ≦ 4 the χ_y-genus difference χ_y(E) - χ_y(F) χ_y(B) can be concretely described {{only in terms of}} the signature difference σ(E) -σ(F) σ(B) and/or the Todd genus difference τ(E) - τ(F) τ(B).
