25|$|Smith-Dorrien {{finally managed}} to locate Snow (GOC of the newly arrived 4th Division), at 5am (his brigades were {{assembling}} in their positions between 3.30am and 5.30am). He was not under Smith-Dorrien's orders but agreed to assist. Smith-Dorrien cancelled his orders to retreat and decided to stand and fight at Le Cateau. Smith-Dorrien still hoped for assistance from I Corps, which did not reach its intended position to the immediate east of Le Cateau. This news reached French at 5am – woken from his sleep once again, and insisting that the exhausted Murray not be woken, he telegraphed back that he still wanted Smith-Dorrien to “make every endeavour” to fall back {{but that he had}} “a free hand as to the method”, which Smith-Dorrien took as permission to make a stand. On waking properly, French ordered Wilson to telephone Smith-Dorrien and order him to break off as soon as possible. Wilson ended the conversation – by his own account – by saying “Good luck to you. <b>Yours</b> <b>is</b> the first cheerful voice I've heard in three days.” Smith-Dorrien's slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned him that he risked another Sedan.|$|E

[...] The Mishnah taught that there are four types of people: (1) One who says: [...] "What's mine is mine, and what's <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> yours"; this is a neutral type, some say this {{was the type of}} Sodom. (2) One who says: [...] "What's mine is yours, and what's <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> mine"; this is an unlearned person. (3) One who says: [...] "What's mine is yours, and what's <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> yours"; this is a pious person. And (4) one who says: [...] "What's mine is mine, and what's <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> mine;" [...] this is a wicked person.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine considered the album to be a [...] "crushing disappointment" [...] concluding with, [...] "Mine Is <b>Yours</b> <b>is</b> {{not just the}} questionable effort of a once-promising band, but perhaps even worse: a work of obviously borrowed ideas from a group highly capable of succeeding with their own." [...] PopMatters contributor David Gassmann said that despite some strong hooks and instrumental choices, he felt the album lacked the idiosyncratic personality from the band's previous records and resembled more of The Script and Train due to King's production. He added that listeners will consider this as a gateway introduction to the band itself. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club gave the album a D+ grade. He found their sound to be [...] "dulled for maximum accessibility" [...] coupled with [...] "uninspired melodies" [...] and lyrics that were [...] "formless" [...] concluding with, [...] "Mine Is <b>Yours</b> <b>is</b> the bland sound of a band trading identity for ambition." [...] The most critical about the album was NMEs Katherine Rodgers who found some of the tracks to be generic and found the highlights to be [...] "asphyxiated in lubricious studio slime." ...|$|E
