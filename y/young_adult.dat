Health insurance is a key factor in the access to medical care services, and <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> in the United States aged 20 – 29 years are more likely than adults aged 30 years and over to lack health insurance coverage (1 – 4).

40|$|Introduction: This study {{examined}} the differences between <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> from divorced households (N= 54) and <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> from always-married households (N= 120) in terms of romantic relationship dissolution patterns, perceptions of inter-parental conflict, child-parent bonding, and attitudes toward divorce. It was hypothesized that <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> from divorced households would have {{a greater number of}} romantic relationships and would report a lack of investment and conflict as reasons for relationship dissolutions more frequently than <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> from always-married households. It was also hypothesized that <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> who report high inter-parental conflict would hold more positive attitudes toward divorce and that <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> with reported high parental bonding would have less positive attitudes toward divorce. Methods: Data was collected via an online survey. Results: Findings revealed that <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> from divorced households had significantly fewer romantic relationships than <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> from always-married households. Supporting hypotheses, <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> from divorced households reported a lack of investment as a reason for romantic relationship dissolution more often than did <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> from always-married households. All other predictions were not supported. Discussion: Such findings indicate that there may not be a clear line between attitudes toward divorce and child-parent bonding and perceptions of inter-parental conflict...|$|R
40|$|TOPIC: This article {{describes}} {{efforts to develop}} and offer supports for <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> within two clubhouse programs affiliated with the International Center for Clubhouse Development (ICCD). PURPOSE: In response to a need to address service gaps and create supports to engage <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> transitioning to the adult mental health system, the authors describe the background, development, and adaptations of services and supports for <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> within their respective clubhouse programs. The authors highlight details and challenges associated with program adaptation and success stories of transition aged youth actively engaged in their clubhouses. Sources Used: Published literature, personal observation, and member feedback. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These clubhouse programs share successful strategies used to engage <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> including outreach efforts led by <b>young</b> <b>adults,</b> developing supports and linkages with local educational institutions, addressing housing issues specific to <b>young</b> <b>adults,</b> and using current technologies that <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> find appealing. These strategies may prove useful to other service models that serve this population. Clubhouses affiliated with the ICCD show promise in expanding their approach and services to engage and support <b>young</b> <b>adults...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Young</b> <b>adults</b> (182 ̆ 013390 year-olds) {{have the}} lowest {{hypertension}} control rates among adults with hypertension in the United States. Unique barriers to hypertension management in <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> with primary care access compared to older adults have not been evaluated. Understanding these differences will inform the development of hypertension interventions tailored to <b>young</b> <b>adults.</b> The goals of this multicenter study were to explore primary care providers 2 ̆ 019 perspectives on barriers to diagnosing, treating, and controlling hypertension among <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> with regular primary care. Methods Primary care providers (physicians and advanced practice providers) actively managing <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> with uncontrolled hypertension were recruited by the Wisconsin Research & Education Network (WREN), a statewide practice-based research network. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in three diverse Midwestern clinical practices (academic, rural, and urban clinics) using a semi-structured interview guide, and content analysis was performed. Results Primary care providers identified unique barriers across standard hypertension healthcare delivery practices for <b>young</b> <b>adults.</b> Altered self-identity, greater blood pressure variability, and unintended consequences of medication initiation were critical hypertension control barriers among <b>young</b> <b>adults.</b> Gender differences among <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> were also noted as barriers to hypertension follow-up and antihypertensive medication initiation. Conclusions Tailored interventions addressing the unique barriers of <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> are needed to improve population hypertension control. Augmenting traditional clinic structure to support the 2 ̆ 01 chealth identity 2 ̆ 01 d of <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> and self-management skills are promising next steps to improve hypertension healthcare delivery...|$|R

In order to provide holistic care for <b>young</b> <b>adults,</b> general physicians need to recognise common presentations of mental illness in <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> such as depression, deliberate self-harm, eating disorders and substance misuse.

40|$|Aim : Spirituality is an {{important}} aspect of wellbeing in people with diabetes. The current study aimed to explore how <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> with diabetes define spirituality, and the relationship between spirituality and coping in <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> with diabetes. Methods : An exploratory study was conducted in 100 <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> with diabetes aged 18 – 30 years. Participants completed the Coping Questionnaire for <b>Young</b> <b>Adults</b> with Diabetes and the Spirituality Questionnaire. Results : <b>Young</b> <b>adults</b> with diabetes defined spirituality as a sense of finding inner self and meaning in life, which is enriched by connections with other people and the universal whole. There {{was no significant difference in}} spirituality between religious and non-religious <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> with diabetes.
