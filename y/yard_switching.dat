25|$|The United States' {{entry into}} World War II impeded Baldwin's Diesel {{development}} program when the War Production Board dictated that Alco and Baldwin produce only steamers and Diesel-electric <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> engines. Electro-Motive Division (EMD) was assigned {{the task of}} producing road freight Diesels (namely, the FT series). EMD's distinct advantage over its competitors in that product line {{in the years that}} followed World War II, due to the head start in diesel R and production, is beyond doubt, however, assigning it solely to WPB directives is questionable. Longtime GM chairman Alfred P. Sloan presented a timeline in his memoir that belies this assumption, saying that GM's diesel-engine R efforts of the 1920s and 1930s, and its application of model design standardization (yielding lower unit costs) and marketing lessons learned in the automotive industry, were the principal reason for EMD's competitive advantage in the late 1940s and afterward (clearly implying that the wartime production assignments were merely nails in a coffin that Baldwin and Lima had already built for themselves before the war). In his telling, the R needed to adapt earlier Diesels (best suited to marine and stationary use) to locomotive use (smaller; higher power-to-weight ratio; more reliable given more vibration and less maintenance) was a capital-intensive project that almost no one among the railroad owners or locomotive builders was willing (latter) or able (former) to invest in during the 1920s and 1930s, save the people of Winton, Electro-Motive, and Charles F. Kettering of the GM Research Corporation.|$|E
2500|$|Some SD45 and SD45-2 {{units have}} been {{modified}} by replacing their 20-cylinder engine with the 16-cylinder removed from scrapped SD40-2 units; this was common on Union Pacific and possibly other railroads. In many cases these are {{identified by the}} owner as SD40-3, SD40M-2 or some such. Confusingly, {{what appears to be}} an SD45 is labeled as an SD40-2. [...] Older SD40-2 units used in low-power modes such as <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> or hump service have been de-turbocharged, resulting in the mechanical equivalent of a SD38-2.

2500|$|The {{following}} year they purchased the [...] {{as a means}} of connecting the quarries of the Woodbury Granite Company and the Fletcher Granite Company on Robeson Mountain more directly with the outside world. The stock of the railroad was floated partly by popular subscription, but mainly by the backing of John S. Holden and his associates. Nine miles of track had to be built to reach the quarries (since increased to fifteen miles) and the grades were such that no ordinary engine could be coaxed to climb them. Undaunted, a Shay Locomotive, a geared mountain-climbing engine, was purchased and put into service. Soon railroad operations consisted of quarry switching, main line hauling and <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> with three Shays and a massive fleet of over 40 flat cars. There was also a quarry-village railroad connection that allowed quarry workers living in the village to commute to work. Monday through Saturday the train left Hardwick at 6:15a.m. and returned from the quarries at 5 p.m. At the death of John S. Holden on March 23, 1907, Mr. Leonard then became president.|$|E

50|$|The Union Pacific Railroad {{is perhaps}} the largest current user of the MP15DC, having 102 of the type in service (Strack, 2004). None were {{originally}} owned by the UP; instead, they were acquired by merger or takeover, or bought on the second-hand locomotive market. The vast majority (62) came from the Missouri Pacific Railroad, while locomotives were also acquired from the Chicago and North Western Railway (14) and Southern Pacific Railroad (9). A further 15 were acquired from the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, being surplus to their requirements, while a further two have been leased from Helm.The Alaska Railroad had four MP15DCs used as <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> engines, numbered 1551-1554. As of 2/28/2011 LEF&C (1551)#25 & (1552)#26, 1553, 1554 were sold to GATX, a RR leasing fleet. Two {{were obtained from the}} Lake Erie, Franklin and Clarion Railroad; the other two were obtained from the Kelley's Creek and Northwestern Railroad.Caltrain has two MP15DCs used for <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> and work train service, numbered 503 and 504.|$|E

In 1990 new owners returned the yard to production as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab, resuming the manufacture of superstructure modules for oil platforms. Under a management buyout in 2001 the Burntisland yard returned to being an independent company.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, tenders with a sloped back {{were often}} used for {{locomotives}} in <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> service, because they greatly improved the engineer's ability to see behind the locomotive when switching cars. The reduced water capacity was not a problem, as the tender's water tank could be frequently refilled in the rail yard. [...] In the 1880s, numerous locomotive manufacturers were offering tenders with this design on small switch engines.|$|E
5000|$|The Baldwin S-12 was a [...] {{diesel-electric}} locomotive {{intended for use}} in <b>yard</b> <b>switching.</b> Utilizing a turbocharged 6-cylinder version of the powerful 606A diesel prime mover, S-12s were known for their [...] "lugging" [...] power, despite being temperamental. Like most Baldwin switchers, the S-12 had AAR Type-A switcher trucks in a B-B wheel arrangement. 451 units were built between 1951 and 1956, when Baldwin left the locomotive market.|$|E

5000|$|A wye switch (Y points) has {{trailing}} ends which diverge symmetrically and {{in opposite}} directions.

In North America this is also called an [...] "equilateral switch" [...] or [...] "equilateral turnout". Common switches are more often associated with mainline speeds, whereas wye switches are generally low-speed <b>yard</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R

50|$|After the {{corporate}} mergers {{of the former}} separate railroad companies that used the yard to interchange freight cars, the need for Potomac Yard greatly diminished. It {{was determined by the}} RF&P that the land was worth more than the need for <b>yard</b> <b>switching.</b> The PRR's old catenary was dismantled in the 1980s. The facility was identified as a toxic waste site in 1987. The RF&P finally decommissioned it in 1989.

50|$|Advances in {{locomotive}} design, {{particularly the}} advent of diesel-electric power, eventually rendered No. 999 obsolete. After touring the nation and making appearances at numerous expositions including the Chicago Railroad Fair, the unit was retired from service in May, 1952 at which time it was relegated to <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> service in western New York shuttling express service milk cars. At this time, the railroad appeared to turn its back to steam power, and consequently, {{the majority of their}} steam engines, including all of their famed Hudsons, had been scrapped.
