5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E

2500|$|In actuality, <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were {{attracted}} to each other would often meet privately, in the bush or on the beach. Sometimes the young women became pregnant {{as a result of}} these meetings. Marriage might or might not result. Even if it did not, paternity was generally announced (by the mother) and accepted (by the father). The child was usually welcomed by all relatives. The mother was not considered a [...] "fallen woman" [...] and could usually find a husband afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|In a July 1995 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a [...] "low-level opportunist" [...] and someone was [...] "telling {{him what to}} do". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> want to strive for a [...] "new world order" [...] {{and this was a}} campaign for Marxism. Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it." [...] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that he was served by generations of young research workers whose assistance helped him achieve the epidemiological studies for which he is renowned. Conversely, he was the inspiration behind their efforts and psychiatric careers that followed. A former student, Anthony Clare, has said that he was without equal in his record of selecting, nurturing and encouraging <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> would go on to fill senior academic posts in Britain and throughout the world. He was noted for identifying able and committed doctors in Africa, Asia, South America and Eastern Europe on his travels there. He often raised funds for their salaries, and took a great personal involvement in their research topics and apprenticeships securing them [...] "a foot on the ladder of academic achievement" [...] whilst helping to maintain The Maudsley’s position as one of the world's great postgraduate centres for psychiatric teaching and research.|$|E
60|$|The music now {{struck up}} a more lively air. Presently a number of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> had been feasting in another apartment, came in and {{performed}} several graceful dances, {{to the accompaniment of}} the music; singing, as they did so, a sort of chant, which reminded Roger of those he had so often heard in the churches at home.|$|E

60|$|It {{occurred}} to Mrs. Hatherly that Brown's face lost a trifle of its usual placidity {{as his eyes}} rested on his daughter, who was, however, still apparently talking to the naval officer. The Catalina did not possess a particularly attractive garden then, {{but there were a}} few dusty palms in it, and any one strolling in their shadow that moonlight night could see the filmy mists drifting athwart the great black cordillera, and the wisp of lights that twinkled above the hissing surf along the sweep of bay until they ended in a cluster where the white-walled city rose above the tossing spray. There were several pairs of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> apparently found the prospect attractive, but Brown did not notice Austin among them. He and Mrs. Hatherly sat in the shadow, but Oliviera was in the moonlight, which was probably how it happened that a man who appeared in the lighted doorway close by turned towards him, evidently without noticing the others.|$|E
60|$|Chinese control is, to my mind, as {{important}} {{in the matter of}} education as in the matter of industry. For the present, it is still necessary to have foreign instructors in some subjects, though this necessity will soon cease. Foreign instructors, however, provided they are not too numerous, do no harm, any more than foreign experts in railways and mines. What does harm is foreign management. Chinese educated in mission schools, or in lay establishments controlled by foreigners, tend to become de-nationalized, and to have a slavish attitude towards Western civilization. This unfits them for taking a useful part in the national life, and tends to undermine their morals. Also, oddly enough, it makes them more conservative in purely Chinese matters than the <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have had a modern education under Chinese auspices. Europeans in general are more conservative about China than the modern Chinese are, and they tend to convey their conservatism to their pupils. And of course their whole influence, unavoidably if involuntarily, militates against national self-respect in those whom they teach.|$|E
