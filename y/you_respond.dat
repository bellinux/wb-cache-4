2500|$|Daleks are {{extremely}} aggressive, and seem {{driven by an}} instinct to attack. This instinct {{is so strong that}} Daleks have been depicted fighting the urge to kill or even attacking when unarmed. The Fifth Doctor characterises this impulse by saying, [...] "However <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> [...] is seen as an act of provocation." [...] The fundamental feature of Dalek culture and psychology is an unquestioned belief in the superiority of the Dalek race, and their default directive is to destroy all non-Dalek life-forms. Other species are either to be exterminated immediately or enslaved and then exterminated once they are no longer useful.|$|E

Below are specific types of anger management treatment approaches supported by empirical studies. [...] Several of the studies examined used self-report, which some psychologists feel could be a limitation for results. People do not want others {{to think of them}} as angry individuals, so their answers could be changed to fit how society wants them to behave.|$|E

The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence.|$|E

"What {{was said}} in court was a defense {{argument}} made that we put a cloud over the White House, as if, one, we were inventing something or, two, making something up, in order to convince the jury {{that they ought to}} convict. And I think in any case where you feel that someone's making an argument that you are inventing something or improperly casting a cloud on someone, <b>you</b> <b>respond.</b> And we responded fairly and honestly by saying there was a cloud there caused by – not caused by us. And by Mr. Libby obstructing justice and lying about what happened, he had failed to remove the cloud. And sometimes when people tell the truth, clouds disappear. And sometimes they don't. But when you don't know what's happening, that's a problem. And so {{the fact that there was}} a cloud over anyone was not our doing. It was the facts of the case. It was the facts of the case. It was aggravated by Mr. Libby telling falsehoods. And that's what we said. We're not going to add to that or subtract to that. That's what we said in court, and that's the context in which we said it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Denisof {{had earlier}} {{stated that he}} thought [...] "it's better for the father [...] {{to be kept in}} the {{background}} and not become part of the story." [...] When Wesley's father finally did appear in Angel season five, he said:I had mixed feelings [...] It was {{a lot of pressure to}} have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. I was worried that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both in the mind of the character and in the minds of the audience. All my concerns disappeared as soon as I read it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can't necessarily control. Wesley's a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That's one of the things I wanted to explore with this, the subtle ways in which <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to the conditioning of your parents. Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we're children. The shooting [...] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father [...] I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.|$|E

60|$|Such are the shepherds of the people: and now how fares it {{with the}} flock? With the flock, as is inevitable, it fares ill, and ever worse. They are not tended, they are only {{regularly}} shorn. They are sent for, to do statute-labour, to pay statute-taxes; to fatten battle-fields (named 'Bed of honour') with their bodies, in quarrels which are not theirs; their hand and toil is in every possession of man; but for themselves they {{have little or no}} possession. Untaught, uncomforted, unfed; to pine dully in thick obscuration, in squalid destitution and obstruction: this is the lot of the millions; peuple taillable et corveable a merci et misericorde.

Paris requires to be cleared out periodically by the Police; and the horde of hunger-stricken vagabonds to be sent wandering again over space--for a time. 'During one such periodical clearance,' says Lacretelle, 'in May, 1750, the Police had presumed withal to carry off some reputable people's children, in the hope of extorting ransoms for them. The mothers fill the public places with cries of despair; crowds gather, get excited: so many women in destraction run about exaggerating the alarm: an absurd and horrid fable arises among the people; it is said that the doctors have ordered a Great Person to take baths of young human blood for the restoration of his own, all spoiled by debaucheries. Some of the rioters,' adds Lacretelle, quite coolly, 'were hanged on the following days:' the Police went on. (Lacretelle, iii. 175.)
