25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more na√Øve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are closer to the character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E
5000|$|Evans {{struggled}} {{to come to}} terms with the death of his wife, despite living for a further 32 years. At the age of 98, Evans was asked about his age over a pub lunch, where he was quoted to have responded [...] "Part of <b>you</b> <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't be here.". He celebrated his 100th birthday at the Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2009.|$|R

6000|$|... "It isn't {{possible}} for me," [...] she said simply, [...] "to {{tell you how}} glad I am. Don't <b>you</b> yourself <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have done the right thing?" ...|$|R
