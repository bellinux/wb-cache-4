Then {{when you get a}} bit older, you realise that {{whatever}} she was doing, she was only doing it for <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> And you think: 'God, I was really horrible.'" [...] "Mama" [...] was released in the UK and Ireland as a double A-side along with [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] in March 1997, timed not only for the Comic Relief telethon, but also for Mothering Sunday.|$|E

2500|$|Hooker {{describes}} {{two aspects}} to the problem: act utilitarianism requires huge sacrifices {{from those who}} are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>good</b> even when the aggregate good will be only slightly increased. Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism, [...] "there {{is no such thing as}} morally permissible self-sacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty." [...] Mill was quite clear about this, [...] "A sacrifice which does not increase, or tend to increase, the sum total of happiness, it considers as wasted." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1995, {{the trio}} {{recorded}} their second EP, It's for <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Good,</b> {{which appeared in}} the following June. The six-track EP was co-produced by Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Cosmic Psychos), Mike Alonso (Jericho) and The Living End for the Rapido label. It included their first radio airplay hit, [...] "From Here on In", which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio network, Triple J. Shortly after, Piripitzi was fired as his lifestyle choices were holding back the band. He was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey (later in The Knockout Drops). With Demsey the group appeared at major festivals: Pushover and the Falls Festival. Demsey's drum style was compared with The Who's Keith Moon. [...] "From Here on In" [...] was used on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, Occasional Course Language.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Cheney and Owen, on {{piano and}} double bass, were in The Runaway Boys. In 1994, the pair started {{to write their}} own {{material}} and were joined by Joe Piripitzi on drums to form The Living End. They released two successive extended plays, Hellbound (1995) and It's for <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Good</b> (November 1996), which contained their first radio single, [...] "From Here on In". The track is co-written by Cheney and Owen. In 1996 while Green Day were touring Australia, The Living End sent their second EP to the band, and supported them on their tour, which then led to radio station, Triple J, playing their first single. Late that year Piripitzi was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey. In September 1997 The Living End issued a third EP, Second Solution / Prisoner of Society, with four of its five tracks written by Cheney. The EP peaked at No.4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became the highest selling Australian-made 'single' for the 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|The Swiss {{childhood}} researcher Alice Miller gave Hitler {{a section}} in her 1980 published book For <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Good.</b> Miller owed her knowledge about Hitler to biographic and pathographic {{works such as}} those by Rudolf Olden (1935), Konrad Heiden (1936/37), Franz Jetzinger (1958), Joachim Fest (1973), Helm Stierlin (1975), and John Toland (1976). She wrote that the family setting in which Hitler grew up was not only dominated by an authoritarian and often brutal father, Alois Hitler, but could be characterized as [...] "prototype of a totalitarian regime". She wrote that Hitler’s hate-ridden and destructive personality, that later made millions of people suffer, emerged under the humiliating and degrading treatment and the beating that he received from his father as a child. Miller believes that the mother, whose first three children died at an early age, was barely capable of fostering a warm relationship to her son. She posits that Hitler early on identified with his tyrannical father, and later transferred the trauma of his parental home onto Germany; his contemporaries followed him willingly because they had experienced a childhood that was very similar.|$|E

60|$|The sacredness of the household, and {{the strong}} sense of the {{individual}} rights of property, are to be remarked. One found in a 'court,' courtledge (or homestead), by night (as we say in old English), may be killed. You know, I dare say, that in many Teutonic and Scandinavian nations the principle that a man's house is his castle was so strongly held that men {{were not allowed to}} enter a condemned man's house to carry him off to execution; but if he would not come out, could only burn the house over his head. Shooting, or throwing a lance into any man's homestead, costs 20s. 'Oberos,' or 'curtis ruptura,' that is, making violent entry into a man's homestead, costs 20s. also.
