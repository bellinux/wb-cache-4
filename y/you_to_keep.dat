25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E

Who's that chick?/ Too cold for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her/ Too hot {{for you to}} leave her/ Who's that chick? Who's that chick?", which incorporates heavy usage of Auto-Tune.

500|$|Nil Battey Sannata {{opened to}} {{critical}} acclaim, and was positively {{received by the}} audiences as well.

Namrata Thakur of Rediff.com gave the film the highest praise and deemed it [...] "an absolute gem", saying [...] "there is hardly a dull moment in the film". She considered it the feel-good film of the year, comparing it to 2015's Dum Laga Ke Haisha. The Hindu journalist and film critic Namrata Joshi included Nil Battey Sannata in her year-end list of [...] "Hindi films that made a mark in 2016".

Burdon immediately became concerned that police would find drugs at the apartment, and as he was collecting incriminating evidence, he found the poem that Hendrix had written hours earlier, [...] "The Story of Life". Burdon, {{who said he had}} previously discussed suicide and death with Hendrix, assumed the poem was a suicide note. Under this assumption, he made comments to the press regarding his belief that Hendrix had committed suicide that he has since recanted: [...] "I made false statements... I simply didn't understand what the situation was. I misread the note... I thought it was a goodbye". Dannemann said Hendrix told her: [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this [...] forever [...] I don't want you to forget anything that is written. It's a story about you and me".|$|E

It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games {{reviewer}} Kim Randell {{noted that}} [...] "Gearbox has obviously {{gone to great}} pains to provide a similar experience to the original". Praise was also given to the game's multiplayer; Randell stated that the new additions for multiplayer made it the area of Opposing Force that [...] "really shines". Randell closed the review by concluding that Opposing Force is [...] "an awesome achievement". Erik Wolpaw, writing for GameSpot, noted that as most expansion packs were mediocre, [...] "it's appropriate that Gearbox Software's Opposing Force, the official expansion for the genre-redefining Half-Life, in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action-game mission packs". Wolpaw praised {{the design of the}} single-player campaign, commenting that [...] "you can sense the designers' enthusiasm as one memorable scene unfolds after another, and it compels <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> playing". Although criticizing some elements of the game's artificial intelligence and describing some of the new models as [...] "merely window dressing", the review concluded that Opposing Force was an [...] "impassioned application of creative design".|$|E
500|$|Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater played drums on Office of Strategic Influence and Free, {{but found}} the {{experience}} frustrating. Moore regarded Portnoy's {{contributions to the}} first two albums as [...] "great", but he and Matheos decided to recruit a different drummer for Blood. [...] "We were continuing {{to try to get}} new voices involved with the album", he explained. Matheos, a fan of Porcupine Tree, was in control of personnel on Blood and asked Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison to perform drums on the album. Harrison had a schedule gap {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, so agreed to work on the album. He never met Matheos and Moore, recording his drums parts in his recording studio in England and exchanging files with them over the Internet. Most songs were sent to Harrison with programmed drums. [...] "For the most part, we usually told him to try to stay away from the programmed drums and come up with his own parts, and he did. So much of that is his taking it in a different direction," [...] Moore said. [...] "There was probably at least one song, maybe two, where we said 'We'd like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> closer to the programmed drums,' but he had a lot of say in what went on." [...] Matheos and Moore were [...] "very happy" [...] with Harrison's work on Blood, and hoped to work with him on the fourth OSI album. Blood marked the first time Matheos played bass on an OSI album instead of recruiting an outside bassist.|$|E

2500|$|Verdi had {{received}} a synopsis of the opera from Cammarano, the subject of which was not his. [...] But, as Budden notes, Verdi adopted a somewhat passive attitude, impressed as he was at being {{able to work with}} this librettist. In a letter of 23 February 1845, Verdi had expressed his optimism that [...] "Voltaire's tragedy will become an excellent melodrama," [...] with the added hope that if the librettist would [...] "put some passion into your libretto" [...] and that he, Verdi, would write music to match. In their early correspondence, it appears that Cammarano had already sent some sample verses because Verdi's 23 February letter also contained his enthusiasm for receiving more: [...] "I beg you to send me promptly some more verses. It's not necessary for me to tell <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it short. You know the theatre better than I do." [...] It is quite clear that Verdi's characteristic requirement for brevity appeared this early on in his career.|$|E

2500|$|He {{had found}} the pig eating his tubers. This {{was not the first}} occurrence. Cutlar was so upset that he took aim and shot the pig, killing it. It turned out that the pig was owned by an Irishman, Charles Griffin, who was {{employed}} by the Hudson's Bay Company to run the sheep ranch. He also owned several pigs that he allowed to roam freely. The two had lived in peace until this incident. Cutlar offered $10 to Griffin to compensate for the pig, but Griffin was unsatisfied with this offer and demanded $100. Following this reply, Cutlar believed he should not {{have to pay for the}} pig because the pig had been trespassing on his land. (A probably apocryphal story claims Cutlar said to Griffin, [...] "It was eating my potatoes." [...] Griffin replied, [...] "It is up to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> your potatoes out of my pig.") When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, American settlers called for military protection.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 April 2008, Ali Khamenei backed President Ahmadinejad's {{economic}} policy {{and said the}} West was struggling with more economic difficulties than Iran, with a [...] "crisis" [...] spreading from the United States to Europe, and inflation was a widespread problem. The Iranian leader said that the ongoing economic crisis which has crippled {{the world has been}} unprecedented in the past 60 years. [...] "This crisis has forced the UN to declare state of emergency for food shortages around the globe but foreign radios have focused on Iran to imply that the current price hikes and inflation in the country are the results of carelessness on the part of Iranian officials which of course is not true", he said. Khamenei emphasized that no one has the right to blame the Iranian government for Iran's economic problems. He also advised people and the government to be content and avoid waste in order to solve economic problems. [...] "I advise <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in your mind that this great nation is never afraid of economic sanctions", he added.|$|E

[...] He also sent for the British Supply Officer of the Hejaz Forces. [...] "Before discussing supply matters, however, he ... said 'they are out to make as little as possible of the British and make the populace think that it is the Arabs who have driven out the Turk. This is why Lawrence asked <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> your men out of the city and they have no intention of asking you for any police.' He also said 'They are getting the British Consulate ready for you. If you go there you are not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. You should take possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge." [...] As a result, Chauvel decided to march through the city the following day, with [...] "practically every unit being represented; guns, armoured cars, everything, and I also took possession of Djemal's house." ...|$|E
