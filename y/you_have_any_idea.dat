2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Knight was {{recorded}} berating an NCAA volunteer at a March 1995 post-game press conference following a 6560 loss to Missouri {{in the first}} round of the NCAA tournament held in Boise, Idaho. The volunteer, Rance Pugmire, informed the press that Knight would not be attending the press conference, when in reality, Knight was running a few minutes late and had planned on attending per NCAA rules. Knight was shown saying: [...] "You've only got two people that are going to tell you I'm not going to be here. One is our SID , and the other is me. Who the hell told you I wasn't going to be here? I'd like to know. Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> who it was?...Who?...They were from Indiana, right?...No, they weren't from Indiana, and you didn't get it from anybody from Indiana, did you?...No, I—I'll handle this the way I want to handle it now that I'm here. You (EXPLETIVE) it up to begin with. Now just sit there or leave. I don't give (EXPLETIVE) what you do. Now back to the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} from a year of study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence (cut short by the First World War), Schmitt returned to Warren, where he received a number of commissions from prominent local citizens including Joseph G. Butler, Jr. and Henry K. Wick. In 1916 Schmitt returned to New York, where he established a studio in the Stuyvesant Square neighborhood. Hart Crane, then an unknown poet and newly arrived in New York, was a frequent visitor to Schmitt’s studio apartment {{in the early part}} of 1917. Crane and Schmitt had met in Warren the previous year through Crane’s aunt and Schmitt’s patron Zell Hart Deming. Just before moving to New York, Crane wrote to Schmitt about his life in Cleveland, Ohio. In one of his first letters to his mother from New York, Crane wrote, “Carl is a more wonderful man than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea.</b> A tremendous thinker!” A little later he wrote to his father: “Nearly every evening since my advent has been spent in the companionship of Carl. Last night... we talked until twelve, or after, behind our pipes. He has some splendid ideas.” Crane got to know some of the poets and writers in Schmitt's circle, including Conrad Aiken. Although they would each pursue their own interests and friends in later years, Schmitt and Crane carried on an extensive correspondence, Crane sending drafts of his poems to Schmitt for his review. They saw each other for the last time in 1925 in New York with Zell Hart Deming. Crane described his friend at this meeting: [...] "He was as always, looked and acted exactly the same as we remember him." [...] A portrait of Crane by Schmitt, done almost 50 years later, is now in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E

[...] "Well, I'm sorry if it's serious, Jem, but I never dreamt <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> in that quarter. If I had I'd have given old Nugent the best bunk {{on the ship}} and sung him to sleep myself. Has she given you any encouragement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed!" [...] sneered the ram, [...] "you like it, do <b>you?</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> {{what you}} look like, all sheared down to your skin?

"I thought," [...] resumed Clara, {{in rather}} lower tones than before, [...] "that I would just look into your room before I {{went to the}} ball, and see that {{everything}} was properly arranged for you, in case <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of writing tonight; I had just time to do this while my aunt, who is going with me, was upstairs altering her toilette. But perhaps you don't feel inclined to write?" ...|$|R

[...] "He said that a great many men wanted you to be their candidate for governor of the State,--more than <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of,--and that <b>you</b> wouldn't consent. Mr. Redbrook grew so enthusiastic that he forgot, for the moment, my--relationship to the railroad.

[...] "No {{doubt you}} think that I am mad, but if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> {{of the women in}} our own set who have done the same thing, I think you would be astonished. Well, whilst I was there I chanced to drop, or leave behind--it {{scarcely}} concerns you to know which--a letter written to me by a very dear friend. One of my perfectly harmless love affairs, you know, Henry, but men do make such idiots of themselves when they have pen and paper to do it with." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because," [...] Helen continued, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> such <b>idea</b> in your mind, I {{think it}} is most unfair to Mr. Lessingham. You know {{perfectly}} well that anything else between you and him would be impossible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd hate awfully to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> go," [...] said Mrs. Treat, reflectively; [...] "but it's a {{good deal}} better {{for you to get}} away from that Job Lord if you can.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} quickly. [...] "I'd {{like to know}} because I think you've misjudged me.

6000|$|... "You {{distress}} me," [...] he declared. [...] "Perhaps {{it is my}} fault. I {{have not}} made myself sufficiently clear. The knowledge of that word is a necessity to me.

6000|$|... "Stuff!" [...] said Mrs. Mulrady, decidedly. [...] "Don't be a fool. Any gold discovery, anyhow, {{would have}} been yours--that's the law.

I choose to give the Tredowen estates away, to disappoint my next of kin. That is how you may regard the transaction. We will go {{into the house and}} complete this deed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My advice," [...] said Ben, {{after he}} had waited some time, to give due weight to his words, [...] "is that you clear out from this show {{just as soon as}} you can.
