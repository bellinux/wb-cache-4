5|$|Borrowing {{from the}} French again, Planché {{introduced}} the revue (or review) to British theatre, as {{a commentary on}} recent events, particularly events in the theatre. His first revue, Success; or, a hit if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> was produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.|$|E
5|$|Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American film actress, director, producer, and writer. Howard {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, {{but left}} before graduating {{to take on}} roles on Broadway. During a performance of As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> where Howard portrayed Rosalind, she {{caught the attention of}} director M. Night Shyamalan, and he cast her in what would be her breakout film, the psychological thriller The Village (2004) and then in the fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptation of As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 2006 she co-wrote and directed the short film Orchids.|$|E
5|$|For several years, Howard {{appeared}} in New York plays. Among these were House & Garden, a 2002 Alan Ayckbourn production {{held at the}} Manhattan Theatre Club, in which she portrayed a disdainful, flirtatious teen. While performing as Rosalind in the critically acclaimed 2003 William Shakespeare comedy production As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> at The Public Theater, Howard {{caught the eye of}} director M. Night Shyamalan.|$|E

5|$|Hordern came to {{prominence}} in the early 1950s when he {{took part in a}} theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London. There, he impressed Glen Byam Shaw who secured the actor a season-long contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre where he played major parts, including Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. The following season Hordern joined Michael Benthall's company at the Old Vic where, among other parts, he played Polonius in Hamlet, and the title role in King John. In 1958 he won a best actor award at that year's British Academy Television Awards for his role as the barrister in John Mortimer's courtroom drama The Dock Brief. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular minor roles in various films including Cleopatra (1963), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966).|$|E
5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E
25|$|The role {{is thought}} to have been first played by Robert Armin, who {{typically}} played intelligent clown roles like Touchstone in As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> or Feste in Twelfth Night.|$|E

25|$|In William Shakespeare's Macbeth, Hecate {{appears as}} {{the queen of}} witches, uniquely placing the Anglo-Saxon witches under a Greek goddess's control. Hymen appears as a {{character}} name in his As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It.</b>|$|E
25|$|A statue {{was created}} for Logan Circle, Philadelphia in 1926, {{designed}} by Alexander Stirling Calder. It does not depict Shakespeare himself, but rather the figures of Touchstone the jester from As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> representing comedy, and Hamlet, representing tragedy. Touchstone is lounging with his head tilted laughing, his feet hanging {{over the top of}} the tall stone pedestal and his left arm resting on Hamlet's legs. Hamlet is seated, brooding, his knife dangling over Touchstone's body. The opening lines of the famous All the world's a stage speech from As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> are inscribed on the pedestal beneath the figures.|$|E
25|$|The Prodigal Son {{was also}} {{referred}} to in the play As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> a pastoral comedy by William Shakespeare. The Prodigal Son is also mentioned in Shakespeare's romance, The Winter's Tale (Act 4, Scene 4 line 89).|$|E

25|$|In Wilmington, {{she was a}} stage director. One of her directorial credits was a 1998 {{production}} of William Shakespeare's As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> updated to a Brazilian jazz style. In both Wilmington and New York she teaches master classes in acting and singing.|$|E
25|$|Later, he {{performed}} in such pieces as Princess Charming (1926) and appeared {{in at least}} ten films for London Film Productions Ltd., among other films, in the 1930s. He produced The Land of Smiles and Cavalcade (both in 1931), and in 1933, he played Touchstone in a production of As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is a {{tradition}} that Shakespeare, in addition to writing many of the plays his company enacted and concerned with business and financial details as part-owner of the company, continued to act in various parts, such as the ghost of Hamlet's father, Adam in As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> and the Chorus in Henry V.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, Worth {{demonstrated}} her exceptional versatility {{by playing}} in the farce Hotel Paradiso in London with Alec Guinness, high tragedy {{in the title role}} of Schiller's Mary Stuart, co-starring Eva Le Gallienne; and on Broadway and Shakespearean comedy in As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> at Stratford, Ontario. In Ivor Brown's play William's Other Anne she played Shakespeare's first girlfriend Anne Whateley opposite John Gregson as Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|She {{joined the}} Bristol Old Vic Company in January 1950, {{appearing}} as Phebe in As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> Anni in Denis Cannan's Captain Carvallo and Belinda in John Vanbrugh's The Provok'd Wife. She joined the Old Vic company in London for the 1950–51 season, playing among other parts, Win-the-Fight Littlewit in Ben Jonson's , Ann Page in The Merry Wives of Windsor and Princess Katharine in Henry V.|$|E
25|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for his departure, Kempe was {{replaced}} by Robert Armin, formerly of Chandos's Men and an author in his own right. Small and fanciful, Armin offered significantly different options for Shakespeare, and the change is seen in the last Elizabethan and first Jacobean plays. Armin is generally credited with originating such characters as Feste in Twelfth Night, Touchstone in As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> and the fool in King Lear.|$|E

25|$|Her {{first tour}} of the United States (accompanied by Gebhard) was an {{enormous}} success, which she repeated in subsequent years. While the critics generally condemned her interpretations of roles such as Pauline in The Lady of Lyons or Rosalind in As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> the public loved her. After her return from New York in 1883, Langtry registered at the Conservatoire in Paris for six weeks' intensive training to improve her acting technique.|$|E
25|$|Although Armin {{typically}} played these intelligent clown roles, it {{has been}} suggested by a few scholars that he originated the role of Iago in Othello, on the grounds that Iago sings two drinking songs (most of the songs in Shakespeare's plays from 1600 to 1610 were sung by Armin's characters) and that this was the sole play between As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> and Timon of Athens that has no fool or clown for Armin to play.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, he {{arranged}} incidental music from Elizabethan sources for As <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> at Stratford-on-Avon, and conducted {{a series of}} Sunday concerts at Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, where he also conducted Pergolesi's opera La serva padrona.
