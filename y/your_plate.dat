One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass <b>your</b> <b>plate</b> back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E

6000|$|... "May I {{offer you}} the native delicacies, and share <b>your</b> <b>plate?</b> Both are very good, but the china has run short, and after such {{vigorous}} exercise {{as you have}} had you must need refreshment.

60|$|I {{heard all}} this, {{much to my}} satisfaction, for I found plainly that the tankard was not missed, and yet they {{concluded}} it was fetched away; so I drank my ale, called to pay, and as I went away I said, 'Take care of <b>your</b> <b>plate,</b> child,' meaning a silver pint mug, which he brought me drink in.

6000|$|... "Wait {{till the}} lad has got {{something}} to eat and drink," [...] the colonel said, peremptorily. [...] "Pray take your seats, gentlemen.

6000|$|... "I see!" [...] said Mr. Tetterby. [...] "I understand! My {{little woman}} was put out. Hard times, and hard weather, and hard work, make it trying now and then. I see, bless your soul!

2500|$|By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing Dynasty, the {{popularity}} of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish. For instance, one of the verses of Duan Zhu Zhi Ci, a collection of Beijing poems was, [...] "Fill <b>your</b> <b>plates</b> with roast duck and suckling pig". In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing. Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks. With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the Peking Duck {{to the rest of}} the world.|$|R

If some happy impulse," [...] he concluded, [...] "should show you the only reasonable course by dinnertime, it would give me the utmost {{pleasure to have you}} join us at that meal.

40|$|Flexo {{plates are}} a {{critical}} component of the printing system. Printing is a system—viewing platemaking in isolation doesn’t address the total print process. A system has multiple components that interact with each other and influence the performance of each. Great plates with the wrong anilox rolls offer nothing to improve quality. Likewise, great plates made from a poorly prepared file help little to produce an outstanding final product. So, looking upstream and downstream is necessary to ensure <b>your</b> <b>plates</b> are supporting the total printing system. Superior printing plates… •have sufficient resolution for the graphics to be reproduced on the substrate for the job (paper, film, foil, etc). •are produced to optimize press and ink performance. •are made in a controlled and repeatable manner.

And when it comes to sleeping another night on a bed like a gridiron, no--thank--you! And believe me, if I see that old rube hotel-keeper comb his whiskers at the hall hat-rack again--he keeps a baby comb in his vest pocket with a lead-pencil and a cigar some drummer gave him--if I have to watch him comb that alfalfa again I'll bite his ears off and get pinched by the S.

I thought maybe Miss Sterling was just learning to keep house and cook--that rabbit would surely make you think so--and I says to myself, 'Little lady, sugar or no sugar I'll stand by you,' and I raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade. And then all the balance of 'em picks up their bowls and does the same. And then I gives Miss Sterling the laugh proper, just to carry it off like a joke, so she wouldn't feel bad about the mistake.|$|E
