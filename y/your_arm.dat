500|$|As {{punishment}} for [...] "insubordination"—rumoured {{to be his}} penchant for American jazz music, womanising and an overt [...] "playboy" [...] lifestyle—and inability to fly as a wingman, Steinhoff transferred Marseille to Jagdgeschwader 27 on 24 December 1940. When he joined his new unit, {{it was difficult to}} foresee his outstanding career. His new Gruppenkommandeur, Eduard Neumann, later recalled, [...] "His hair was too long and he brought with him [...] a list of disciplinary punishments as long as <b>your</b> <b>arm.</b> He was tempestuous, temperamental and unruly. Thirty years later, he would have been called a playboy." [...] Nevertheless, [...] Neumann quickly recognised Marseille's potential as a pilot. He stated in an interview: [...] "Marseille could only be one of two, either a disciplinary problem or a great fighter pilot." [...] Jagdgeschwader 27 was soon relocated to North Africa.|$|E

[...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E
500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired.

500|$|On October 2, 1938, Feller was the {{starting}} pitcher against the Detroit Tigers. Detroit's Hank Greenberg was {{two home runs}} short of Babe Ruth's then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit's Pete Fox and passed it, to set a modern major league record of 18 strikeouts, when he struck out Chet Laabs {{for the fifth time}} that day. Greenberg said, [...] "Feller's curve was jumping wickedly and with that and his fast ball, he was murder." [...] Feller did not earn a win, however, as the Indians lost, 4–1. [...] "It was one of those days when everything feels perfect, <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> your coordination, your concentration, everything. There was drama in the air because of Greenberg's attempt to break Ruth's record, and the excitement grew even greater when my strikeouts started to add up", Feller said. For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts. In 1939, Feller received his first career Opening Day start against the Tigers after a match against the Browns was rained out. He won the game 5–1, after allowing three hits. On Mother's Day, Feller pitched against the Chicago White Sox with his family in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by Marv Owen into the seats and into the face of Feller's mother; he {{went on to win the}} game. Feller finished the 1939 season having led the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (296.2) and led the majors for a second consecutive year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246).|$|E
2500|$|The {{sense of}} agency (SA), or sense of control, is the {{subjective}} awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own volitional {{actions in the}} world. It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's [...] "sense of ownership" [...] (SO), which is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that one {{is the owner of}} an action, movement or thought. If someone else were to move <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it were <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> that moved and thus a sense of ownership (SO) for that movement.

2500|$|The Wii Zapper is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote. As {{shown in}} the image, the shell receives both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote's B button; all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell. The name is {{a reference to the}} NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> out like that can get <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> somewhat tired." [...] The Zapper is useful for most games primarily involving gun-style weapons, such as light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters.|$|E

[...] He also made mention in the book of a rather humorous exchange he and Undertaker had while being checked out more thoroughly by Petit in the backstage area. Foley, still somewhat dazed from the concussion he sustained, turned to The Undertaker and asked, [...] "Did I use the thumbtacks?", which was a staple of a number of Foley's early matches. The Undertaker looked at him and rather sternly replied, [...] "Look at <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> Mick!", at which point Foley discovered a significant number of thumbtacks still lodged in his arm.

2500|$|Needing a band, {{he called}} {{childhood}} friend and songwriter/guitarist Ron Elliott, who recruited drummer John Petersen, rhythm guitarist/singer Declan Mulligan, and bassist Ron Meagher. Victor Savant, later to achieve fame in Europe as musical director for schlager singer Roberto Blanco, {{was in the}} band {{for a brief period}} as a pianist, but never recorded with the band. The gig led to a more lucrative deal at the Morocco Room, a club in nearby San Mateo, California. Meanwhile, San Francisco disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell were looking for new acts to bring to their fledgling Autumn Records label. Donahue and Mitchell wanted to capitalize on the Beatlemania craze that originated the previous year in the UK and was spreading across the U.S. by this time. Rich Romanello, owner of the Morocco Room and the Brummels' first manager, asked Donahue and Mitchell to see the band perform at the club. Romanello recalled, [...] "There were maybe four people in the place, and they set up and started playing, and that old hair on my arm goes up. And when the hair on <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> goes up, you got something. It was a big change, to go from saxophones and black singers to a white guitar sound, but I hired 'em." ...|$|E

2500|$|People {{gather at}} the site of the execution, lamenting that a queen's death will bring shame upon England.

When Cecil arrives to tell her that the time for her execution has come, he informs her that Elizabeth has granted her final wishes, including allowing Anna to accompany her to the scaffold. Then Mary offers a pardon to the queen (Mary, Anna, Talbot, Cecil, chorus: Di un cor che more reca il perdóno / [...] "From a heart that is dying, may pardon be granted"). Leicester comes to bid her farewell. Both are distraught and he expresses outrage.

2500|$|Rowe was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} the on-camera host as well and he appeared in taped footage as himself during the first season of shooting. As filming of the first season was nearing completion, Discovery greenlighted production on another Rowe project, Dirty Jobs, under the condition that Rowe choose only one show on which to appear on camera. As Rowe relates the story, Discovery told him that the two shows would be airing back-to-back on the same night, thus, [...] "We can't have you telling us stories about six dead fishermen on camera and making a fart joke with <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> in a cow's ass." [...] Most of the footage Rowe shot during the first season became part of the first season's [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] episode. After the third season of Deadliest Catch, Rowe began hosting a post-season behind-the-scenes miniseries entitled After the Catch, a roundtable discussion featuring the captains relating their experiences filming the preceding season's episodes. A season 3 episode of Dirty Jobs (2007-2008) saw Rowe return to Alaska {{to take part in a}} job tangentially related to the fishing industry — diesel fuel spill cleanup. Another episode that same season featured Rowe at work on board the F/V Legacy doing trawl fishing and at-sea shellfish and other seafood processing, during which Rowe made numerous references to the crab fishing of Deadliest Catch.|$|E
