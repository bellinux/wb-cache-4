500|$|As part of {{the secrecy}} campaign, Benedict Cumberbatch denied that he was playing Khan during interviews, {{describing}} Harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes, as well as [...] "someone that's activated and manufactured in a way by Starfleet, and it's a scene that has {{come back to haunt}} him." [...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> are going to love it. You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it. But you can’t start there."—but for fitting the sequel's theme of [...] "how far will we go to exact vengeance and justice on an enemy that scares us." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{reducing}} Buemi's lead by 22 {{points in}} the preceding New York City ePrix, di Grassi stated that his team had to improve vastly in gaining any hope of winning the championship in Montreal and was feeling more confident that he previously been: [...] "With the experience that I have with Formula E, {{you know that it}} can go from hell to heaven any weekend, any race. We just have to do our best, try and win both races and see how it goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will try to do the best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> will think then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much more than me, this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This is very nice," [...] she resumed. [...] "There's {{something}} very homelike about Ashness.

6000|$|Staniford drew a long, silent breath. After all, he knew everything. He {{mechanically}} {{dropped a}} little the arm on which her hand rested, {{that it might}} slip farther within. Her timid remoteness had its charm, and he fell to thinking, with amusement, how she who was so subordinate to him was, in the dimly known sphere {{in which he had}} been groping to find her, probably a person of authority and consequence. It satisfied a certain domineering quality in him to have reduced her to this humble attitude, while it increased the protecting tenderness he was beginning to have for her. His mind went off further upon this matter of one's different attitudes toward different persons; he thought of men, and women too, before whom he should instantly feel like a boy, if he could be confronted with them, even in his present lordliness of mood. In a fashion of his when he convicted himself of anything, he laughed aloud. Lydia shrank a little from him, in question. [...] "I beg your pardon," [...] he said. [...] "I was laughing at something I happened to think of. Do you ever find yourself struggling very hard to be what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> think you are?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you want to say," [...] she went on; [...] "you want to say that he spoils me, and I don't see why you should hesitate. You {{generally}} say everything you want, and you need n't be afraid of me. He does n't spoil me, simply because I am so bad I can't be spoiled; but that 's of no consequence. I was spoiled ages ago; every one spoiled me--every one except Mrs. Vivian. I was always fond of having everything I want, and I generally managed to get it. I always had lovely clothes; mamma thought that was a kind of a duty. If it was a duty, I don't suppose it counts {{as a part of the}} spoiling. But I was very much indulged, and I know I have everything now. Gordon is a perfect husband; I believe if I were to ask him for a present of his nose, he would cut it off and give it to me. I think I will ask him for a small piece of it some day; it will rather improve him to have an inch or two less. I don't say he 's handsome; but he 's just as good as he can be. Some people say that if you are very fond of a person you always think them handsome; but I don't agree with that at all. I am very fond of Gordon, and yet I am not blinded by affection, as regards his personal appearance. He 's too light for my taste, and too red. And because <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> handsome, it does n't follow that you are fond of them. I used to have a friend who was awfully handsome--the handsomest man I ever saw--and I was perfectly conscious of his defects. But I 'm not conscious of Gordon's, and I don't believe he has got any. He 's so intensely kind; it 's quite pathetic. One would think he had done me an injury in marrying me, and that he wanted to make up for it. If he has done me an injury I have n't discovered it yet, and I don't believe I ever shall. I certainly shall not as long as he lets me order all the clothes I want. I have ordered five dresses this week, and I mean to order two more. When I told Gordon, what do you think he did? He simply kissed me. Well, if that 's not expressive, I don't know what he could have done. He kisses me about seventeen times a day. I suppose it 's very improper for a woman to tell any one how often her husband kisses her; but, as you happen to have seen him do it, I don't suppose you will be scandalized. I know you are not easily scandalized; I am not afraid of you. You are scandalized at my getting so many dresses? Well, I told you I was spoiled--I freely acknowledge it. That 's why I was afraid to tell Gordon--because when I was married I had such a lot of things; I was supposed to have dresses enough to last for a year. But Gordon had n't to pay for them, so there was no harm in my letting him feel that he has a wife. If he thinks I am extravagant, he can easily stop kissing me. You don't think it would be easy to stop? It 's very well, then, for those that have never begun!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Martyn Percy of the Lincoln Theological Institute for the Study of Religion and Society, an {{authority}} on new religious movements, commented on the organisation's nature of control: [...] "It {{seems to me to}} be a fascinating form of religious control exercised on <b>people.</b> If <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>people</b> know what <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> just don’t dare step out of line.

5000|$|Her husband {{traveled}} frequently, so it {{took some}} effort to attend to both home (raising 3 sons) and practice.

When she received the precepts in 1971, Kobun gave her the name Enji (Boissevain-Wendy Graham). In those early days Kobun encouraged his students to marry, have children, and to live “everyday” lives as secret Bodhisattvas.

5000|$|The {{list has}} {{generated}} controversy over who {{was included in}} other years as well. In 2005, conservative commentator Ann Coulter was listed, which led Salon to observe:When Time magazine named Ann Coulter among its 100 [...] "most influential people" [...] last week, alongside such heavyweights as Ariel Sharon, Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Kim Jong Il, and the Dalai Lama, the choice produced guffaws online. Plugging the issue on Fox News last week, Time executive editor Priscilla Painton insisted it was Coulters use of [...] "humor" [...] that made her so influential, stopping just short of suggesting that Coulter is the conservative Jon Stewart. But even Foxs Bill OReilly wasnt buying it. He pressed Painton: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>people,</b> Americans, listen to Ann Coulter?
