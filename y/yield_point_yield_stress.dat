Nonfat dry milk, whey protein concentrate (WPC), cream, Span 60 and Tween 20, were combined to prepare formulations with 1. 5 % fat and 4. 5 % total protein that were homogenized at 15, 30 and 45 Mpa. Particle size analysis, protein load on the milk fat globules, fat globule membrane composition, dynamic <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> and apparent viscosity were determined for each formulation. The specific surface area (SSA) of the milk fat particles increased as the homogenization pressure increased. The SSA of the fat particles in samples which contained WPC was greatest after homogenization at 30 Mpa but the greatest specify surface area of the fat panicles in the control was after homogenization at 45 Mpa. The SSA of samples with Tween 20 and WPC was greater than the SSA of the other formulations. The sample containing Span 60 and WPC had the smallest SSA after homogenization at 45 Mpa. Increasing the homogenization pressures caused the average diameter for volume-surface (dvs) of the fat globules to decrease. Homogenization at 15 MPa caused the samples containing only WPC and Span 60 with WPC to have a larger dvs than the samples containing Tween 20 and WPC and the control. Protein load was greatest after homogenization of the sample containing Tween 20 and WPC at 15 Mpa, no {{differences were found between the}} protein load of other treatments. The <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the gels increased as the homogenization pressure was increased.

30|$|It {{has been}} posited that {{differences}} in chemical composition lead to different retention factors {{as a function of}} steel grade (Ranawaka and Mahendran [2009 a]). Young’s modulus shows little dependence on steel grade, but retention factors for <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> show a more complicated dependence. Researchers report that high strength steel (i.e. Fy ~ 550 MPa) is more efficient than common (low strength) steel grades at about 400 °C and above (Lee et al. [2003]). However, the available experimental data is limited, and mixed. As shown in Figure 4 -b, the transition temperatures from high to low retention factors may be different depending on steel grade (Ranawaka and Mahendran [2009]a), but overall retention factors for <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> are similar across grades. Determining <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> retention factors is itself dependent on strain level, heat level, and the formal method for determining <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> The retention factors vary according to the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and <b>yield</b> strain definitions.

In the century-long history of the Canal, the slopes have shown only minor stability problems despite their significant length, very steep inclination and, more importantly, the strong earthquakes that have frequently shaken the Corinth area. This type of unsual behaviour has motivated research into the mechanical behaviour of the bluish grey marl which is the main geological formation in the Canal area. Geotechnical investigation of the Corinth Canal marl was performed with an extensive laboratory testing programme on high quality undisturbed samples of the intact marl. The material was shown to exhibit brittle behaviour, high stiffness and significant apparent cohesion at low and moderate stress levels.
