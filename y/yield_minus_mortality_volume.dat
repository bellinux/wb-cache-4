40|$|To model discriminative, i. e. {{competition}} induced, self-thinning in {{even-aged forest}} stands a concept has been explored that discriminative mortality alters spatial arrangement of trees {{which in turn}} alters the mortality. Function of density was suggested to be a balance of initial density <b>minus</b> <b>mortality</b> that was dependent on initial spatial arrangement and mean horizontal size in the forest stand. Assuming initial spatial arrangement to be aggregation and performing normalizations gave the self-thinning function depending on only two parameters, initial stem density and maximal horizontal size (represented by stem diameter). Normalizations included integral of probability of trees to collide to be unity and stem density at maximal size to be zero.

Some studies have tackled this issue and found a negative relationship between the yield spread and economic growth; however, recent studies have shown no or a weak relationship. This problem has not yet consensus in spite of its importance. As the Japanese interest rate has been quite low since the adoption of the zero interest rate policy at the end of 1990 s, the situation may change the results. The empirical results show that reliability of yield spread as a leading indicator of output growth exists in Japan; however, term structure of interest rate is not related to economic growth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe genomic RNA of Turnip {{yellow mosaic}} virus (TYMV) has an 82 -nucleotide-long tRNA-like {{structure}} at its 3 ′-end {{that can be}} valylated and then form a stable complex with translation elongation factor eEF 1 A·GTP. Transcription of this RNA by TYMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to <b>yield</b> <b>minus</b> strands has previously been shown to initiate within the 3 ′-CCA sequence.

Higher eEF 1 A·GTP levels were needed to repress minus strand synthesis templated by valyl-EMV TLS RNA, which binds eEF 1 A·GTP with lower affinity than does valyl-TYMV RNA. Repression by eEF 1 A·GTP was also observed with a methionylated variant of TYMV RNA and with aminoacylated tRNAHis, tRNAAla, and tRNAPhe transcripts. It is proposed that minus strand repression by eEF 1 A·GTP binding occurs early during infection to help coordinate the competing translation and replication functions of the genomic RNA...|$|R

40|$|The fish of {{inland waters}} are diverse, long-lived, large-growing, and an {{important}} source of food for humans and other vertebrates, features which have combined {{to attract the attention of}} humans for millennia. Such historical interest, stemming principally from fisheries, has acted as a major global driver for studies of fish populations in terms of changes in population abundance and individual growth rates. Despite a long history of inland fisheries, the scientific quantitative sampling of fish from such habitats using passive, active, and remote techniques remains a significant challenge. The population dynamics of inland fish are reviewed with the approach that their future abundance is a function of present abundance plus immigration, minus emigration, plus reproduction, and <b>minus</b> <b>mortality.</b> The considerable locomotory powers of fish mean that migratory movements into and out of the local habitat are frequent and can have significant implications for local population dynamics, while reproduction is characterized by high fecundities and complex behaviors. Mortality is correspondingly high and is particularly severe in early life stages, leading to complex and highly dynamic age distributions for the population as a whole. As a result, fish populations of inland waters typically show great variations in abundance on both short- and long-term timescales and these are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Tropical forests store vast {{quantities}} of carbon, account for {{a third of the}} carbon fixed by photosynthesis, and are a major sink in the global carbon cycle. Recent evidence suggests that competition between lianas (woody vines) and trees may reduce forest-wide carbon uptake. However, estimates of the impact of lianas on carbon dynamics of tropical forests are crucially lacking. Here, we used a large-scale liana removal experiment and found that, three years after liana removal, lianas reduced net above-ground carbon uptake (growth and recruitment <b>minus</b> <b>mortality)</b> by ~ 76 % per year, mostly by reducing tree growth. The loss of carbon uptake due to liana-induced mortality was 4 -times greater in the control plots were lianas were present, but high variation among plots prevented a significant difference among the treatments. Lianas altered how aboveground carbon was stored. In forests where lianas are present, the partitioning of forest aboveground net primary production is dominated by leaves (53. 2 % compared to 39. 2 % in liana-free forests) at the expense of woody stems (from 28. 9 % compared to 43. 9 %), resulting in a more rapid return of fixed carbon to the atmosphere. After three years of experimental liana removal, our results clearly demonstrate large differences in carbon cycling between forests with and without lianas. Combined with the recently reported increases in liana abundance, these results indicate that lianas are an important and increasing agent of change in the carbon dynamics of tropical forests...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate this expected increase in stroke patients in the Netherlands. We sought to determine what the future developments in the number of stroke patients due to demographic changes and trends in the prevalence of smoking and hypertension in terms of the prevalence, incidence, and potential years of life lost might be. Methods - A dynamic, multistate life table was used, which combined demographic projections and existing stroke morbidity and mortality data. It projected future changes in the number of stroke patients in several scenarios for the Dutch population for the period 2000 to 2020. The model calculated the annual number of new patients by age and sex by using incidence rates, defined by age, sex, and major risk factors. The change in the annual number of stroke patients is the result of incident cases <b>minus</b> <b>mortality</b> numbers. Results - Demographic changes in the population suggest an increase of 27 % in number of stroke patients per 1000 in 2020 compared with 2000. Extrapolating past trends in the prevalence of smoking behavior, hypertension, and stroke incidence resulted in an increase of 4 %.

The mortality rate of juveniles during their first winter was four times that of adults, but did not differ later. For three periods, recruitment <b>minus</b> <b>mortality</b> corresponded qualitatively with changes in population size. In 1969 - 77, when the numbers wintering in Britain were declining by 8. 7 % annually, the mean percentage juveniles in the wintering population was estimated at 12. 1 % and the mean adult mortality rate was estimated at 23. 6 % per year (balance - 11. 5 %). In 1977 - 85, when numbers were increasing by 4. 6 % per annum, the average juvenile percentage was high (28. 8 %), but the adult mortality rate was lower {{than in the previous}} period (19. 6 %; balance + 9. 2 %). In 1985 - 95, when wintering numbers showed no clear trend (average + 0. 9 % per annum) but were still below those in 1969 - 72, juvenile percentages were again quite low (mean of 13. 8 %), but the adult mortality rate was also low (14. 2 %; balance - 0. 4 %). Cold summers reduced both recruitment and adult survival. British Knot populations appear to fluctuate as a consequence of factors affecting survival as well as reproduction.

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} {{feasibility}} of prospective, real-time outcome monitoring in a United Kingdom oesophago-gastric cancer surgery unit. METHODS: The first 100 hybrid (laparoscopic abdominal phase, open thoracic phase) Ivor-Lewis oesophagectomies performed by a United Kingdom oesophago-gastric cancer surgery unit were assessed retrospectively using cumulative sum (CUSUM) techniques. The monitored outcome was 30 -d post-operative mortality, with the accepted mortality risk defined as 5 %. A variable life adjusted display (VLAD) was constructed by plotting a graph of cumulative <b>mortality</b> <b>minus</b> cumulative <b>mortality</b> risk on the y axis vs sequential case number on the x axis. This was modified to a zeroed VLAD by preventing the plot from crossing the y = 0 axis - essentially creating two plots, one examining trends where cumulative mortality was higher than mortality risk (i. e., worse than expected outcomes) where y > 0, and vice versa. Alert lines were set at y = 1; 2. At any point where a plot breaches an alert line, it is felt that the 30 -d post-operative mortality rate has deviated significantly from that expected and an internal review should be performed. RESULTS: One hundred cases were assessed, {{with a mean age}} of 66. 4 years, mean T stage of 2. 1, and mean N stage of 0. 48. Three cases were commenced using a laparoscopic technique and converted to open surgery due to technical factors. Median length of inpatient stay was 15 d. The crude 30 d mortality was 5 % and the incidence of clinically significant anastomotic leak was 6 %. The VLAD demonstrated a plot of cumulative <b>mortality</b> <b>minus</b> cumulative <b>mortality</b> risk (i. e., 5 % per case) which remained in the range - 1. 4 to + 0. 5 excess mortalities. With the alert set at two greater or fewer than predicted mortalities, this method does not approach the point of triggering internal review. It is however arguable that a run of performance that is better than expected, causing the plot to be well below y = 0, would mask a subsequent run of poor performance by requiring a rise of greater than two excess mortalities to trigger the alert line. The zeroed VLAD removes this problem by preventing the plot that is examining above expected mortality from passing below y = 0, and vice versa. In this study period, no audit triggers were reached. It is therefore possible to independently assess runs of good, or poor performance and so target internal audit to the appropriate series of cases. It is important to note this technique allows targeted internal review, in response to both above and below average outcomes. This study has demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} prospective outcome monitoring using the above techniques, actual real-time implementation has the potential to pick up and reinforce good practices when performance is better than predicted, and provide an early warning system for when performance falls below that predicted. Further development is possible, including more patient specific risk adjustment using the oesophago-gastric surgery physiological and operative severity score for the enumeration of mortality and morbidity score.

40|$|Measurement of {{relative}} near-view scenic beauty and prediction {{of changes in}} scenic beauty with timber stand management, grazing, and downed wood management are necessary to integrate scenic beauty into the multiple use decision-making framework. Although traditional landscape quality assessment procedures are of limited use in measuring or predicting the relative scenic beauty of near-view forest scenes, extension of psychophysical methods to measurement of forest scenic beauty offers an approach to effectively incorporate scenic beauty into forest management. Biological and physical variables were inventoried at sites within ponderosa pine timber stands in northern Arizona. Four color slides, also taken at those sites, were later rated for scenic beauty by groups of people, and the ratings were scaled to provide scenic beauty estimates per site. Highly significant multiple regression models, expressing scenic beauty {{as a function of}} the biophysical variables, accounted for up to 60, 50, and 80 percent of the variance in scenic beauty for pre-harvest sites, post-harvest sites, and pre-harvest timber stands, respectively. It seems possible at this point to specify a general ponderosa pine model, to be calibrated for specific damage-free areas within the Southwest. Herbage and large ponderosa pine contribute to scenic beauty, while numbers of small pine trees, mechanical ground disturbance, and downed wood, especially as slash, detract from scenic beauty. Areas of northerly aspect, lower overstory density, and less tree clumping were preferred. Moderate harvest tends to improve scenic beauty once the stand has recovered from obvious harvest effects. The recovery period can be greatly reduced by slash cleanup. Grazing can seriously detract from scenic beauty.

A total of forty-six 8 - to 30 -m corn transects were harvested by plant in Argentina, Mexico, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Virginia, and Oklahoma from 2002 to 2004. By-plant corn grain yields were determined, and the average individual plant yields were calculated. Over all sites in all countries and states, plant-to-plant variation in corn grain yield averaged 2765 kg ha- 1 (44. 1 bu ac- 1). At the sites with the highest average corn grain yield (11 478 and 14 383 kg ha- 1, Parana Argentina, and Phillips, NE), average plant-to-plant variation in yield was 4211 kg ha- 1 (67 bu ac- 1) and 2926 kg ha- 1 (47 bu ac- 1), respectively. As average grain yields increased, so did the standard deviation of the yields obtained within each row. Furthermore, the yield range (maximum corn grain <b>yield</b> <b>minus</b> the minimum corn grain yield per row) was found to increase with increasing yield level. Regardless of yield level, plant-to-plant variability in corn grain yield can be expected and averaged more than 2765 kg ha- 1 over sites and years.

40|$|Question: The {{practice}} of extracting logging residues after clear-cutting for bioenergy purposes is spreading. Logging residues constitute a shelter in clear-cut areas and therefore concerns have been expressed that their removal {{could make the}} ground and its vegetation more exposed to extreme micro¬climatic conditions. We asked whether logging residues and forest edges can protect ground-dwelling forest bryophytes from fatal microclimate events following clear-cutting. Location: Boreal forests of central Sweden. Methods: Using transplants of eight forest floor bryophyte species we experimentally analysed the sheltering effect (less solar radiation and less wind) of logging residues and forest edges in seven clear-cut areas. Transplants were placed in two contrasting positions in each area; near a north-facing forest edge and in {{the centre of the}} clear-cut area. In each position, half of the transplants were covered by a layer of spruce branches and the other half was left uncovered. We estimated proportion of apparently living shoots (apparent vitality) and measured radial growth of transplants during one growing season. Results: Position in the clear-cut area, but not cover of spruce branches, clearly influenced radial growth. Vitality scores were higher among transplants covered with branches and the lowest apparent vitality was observed in uncovered transplants in the middle of clear-cut areas. The change in area of apparently liv¬ing shoots {{during the course of the}} experiment (growth <b>minus</b> <b>mortality)</b> was unaffected by branch cover close to the edge but positively affected in the centre of the clear-cut area. In general, the effect of branch cover on bryophytes was higher in the centre of clear-cut areas. Here, climatic measurements showed that branch cover buffers during periods of extreme microclimates. Conclusions: Extraction of logging residues after clear-felling may reduce the survival of some ground-dwelling forest organisms. The additional sheltering provided by branches was unimportant close to forest edges. We suggest smaller clear-cut areas, green-tree retention and other ways to make logged areas shadier and less windy to mitigate the reduced shelter caused by harvest of logging residues...|$|R

Each experiment factorially manipulated the presence and absence of two guilds: resident piscivores (groupers and moray eels) and interference competitors (territorial damselfishes). In the first experiment, guilds were manipulated via selective removals, and subsequent recruitment (larval settlement <b>minus</b> <b>mortality)</b> was monitored for 44 days. In the second experiment, guilds were placed within large cages to prevent direct resident–juvenile interactions, while allowing for any cues produced by enclosed fishes, thereby testing whether incoming larvae used resident-derived cues to select or reject settlement sites. Colonizing juveniles were collected from each reef over 42 days to prevent confounding resident- and recruit-derived cues. In the first experiment, piscivores inhibited recruitment of a damselfish (Pomacentridae) and a surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), and enhanced recruitment of a wrasse (Labridae). In contrast, territorial damselfishes inhibited recruitment of the damselfish and the wrasse, and enhanced recruitment of the surgeonfish. Observations of early recruitment patterns suggested that recruitment differences were established rapidly during the night or dawn periods shortly after settlement and before each daily census. In the second experiment, {{there was no evidence}} that larvae used resident-derived cues to select settlement sites, suggesting that recruitment differences in the first experiment resulted from differential mortality caused by direct resident–recruit interactions rather than differential larval settlement. These results demonstrate that interactions between established residents and newly arrived juveniles can have a strong influence on juvenile persistence, and that such interactions appear to be strongest within hours of larval settlement. Furthermore, because resident effects were species specific, the present composition of these communities may impose a previously undocumented degree of determinism on their future structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that optimal greenhouse design must account for (and be combined to) optimal climate management. We prove this by showing that different strategies and set-points to control the greenhouse ventilators result in different ¿optimal sets¿ of design parameters. We determined these optimal sets for a passive greenhouse in Almería, Spain where tomatoes were grown. The greenhouse design parameters investigated in this research were: 1) the transmission of the cover for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), 2) the transmission of near infrared (NIR) radiation and 3) the emission coefficient for longwave radiation of the cover. Six optimal sets of design parameters were determined by maximising the marginal revenues (crop <b>yield</b> <b>minus</b> costs of design parameters), under given climate conditions, and for different ventilation control strategies. Each ventilation control strategy had different set-points for the air temperature and carbon dioxide concen¬tration to control the greenhouse ventilators. To solve this optimization problem we used a dynamic crop-greenhouse model and an optimization algorithm. The model described the combined influence of the relevant design parameters, outdoor climate and ventilation control upon economic crop yield, through their effect on indoor climate. The yearly costs of the design parameters were empirically derived from prices, physical properties and lifespan of a number of greenhouse cover materials. Results showed that indeed for different strategies and set-points to control the green¬house ventilators different ¿optimal sets¿ of design parameters and marginal revenues were obtained. For example, the difference between the highest optimal NIR trans¬mission 1. 00 and the lowest optimal NIR transmission 0. 40 was 60 %, while the highest marginal revenues 16. 94 ¿m- 2 differed 18, 7 % with the lowest marginal revenues of 13. 77 ¿ m- 2. Additionally, it was found that the cover design parameters were time dependent. In conclusion, only a combined optimal control and design approach that takes into account the best climate control strategy and the time dependency of the design parameters will ensure optimal design parameters and maximum marginal revenues...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} high yield {{with a goal}} of minimum {{environmental}} cost has become widely accepted. However, the trade-offs and complex linkages among agronomic, economic, and environmental factors are not yet well understood. In this study, reactive nitrogen (N r) losses were estimated using an empirical model, and an economic indicator and an evaluation model were used {{to account for the}} environmental costs of N fertilizer production and use. The minimum N rate to achieve the maximum yield benefit (agronomically optimal N rate), maximum economic benefit (economically optimal N rate: economic benefit was defined as <b>yield</b> benefit <b>minus</b> N fertilizer cost), and maximum net benefit (ecologically optimal N rate: net benefit was defined as <b>yield</b> benefit <b>minus</b> N fertilizer and environmental costs) were estimated based on 91 on-farm experiment sites with five N levels for summer maize production on the North China Plain. Across all experimental sites, the agronomically, economically, and ecologically optimal N rates (N agr, N eco, and N ecl, respectively) averaged 289, 237, and 171 kg N ha − 1, respectively. N ecl management increased net benefit by 53 % with a 46 % decrease in total environmental costs, and a 51 % decrease in N r loss intensity from N fertilizer use (47, 65, and 38 % for N 2 O emission, N leaching, and NH 3 volatilization, respectively) and maintained grain yield, compared with N agr management. Compared with N eco management, N ecl increased net benefit by 12 %, with a 31 % decrease in total environmental costs and a 33 % decrease in N r loss intensity from N fertilizer use, and maintained economic benefit and grain yield. No differences in N ecl were observed between soil types or years, but significant variation among counties was revealed. N ecl increased with the increase in N-derived yield with an R 2 of 0. 83. In conclusion, N ecl was primarily affected by N-derived yield and could enhance profitability as well as reduce N r losses associated with the maize grain yield...|$|R
