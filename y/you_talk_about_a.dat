2500|$|The {{following}} is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning {{home run in}} Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: [...] "All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [...] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight – with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> roll of the dice... this is it." [...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting {{at one point that}} the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse {{trying to get rid of}} a troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!" [...] "They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!" [...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. [...] "Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back." ...|$|E

40|$|When <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> farmer {{the image}} in most people's minds {{is that of a}} man. But in many {{developing}} countries and especially in Africa, it is the women who accomplish most of the tasks associated with farming. It is the women who do the hoeing, sowing, weeding and harvesting, particularly for food crops. A lot of the time the men are away in towns earning a cash income or when they stay home, they are more involved with cash crops. These preconceived ideas of farmers as men have meant that the significance of women in food production has been largely overlooked. Consequently, most development and extension activities tend to be planned with men in mind, disregarding the particular problems faced by women farmers. For instance, women's social responsibilities in the community and their daily tasks such as looking after children, preparing food and collecting fuel and water, are not taken into consideration. Yet these time-consuming chores mean that women have much less time to spend on farming activities. There are other constraints such as the traditional attitudes towards land inheritance and formal education, which make the women's lot in rural areas worse. However, over the last few years, the significant contribution of women in food production has attracted more and more attention. From 24 to 29 May, 1987, at Sparsholt, England, CTA, in conjunction with the Royal Agricultural Society of England and the British Council, organized a seminar to discuss the contribution of women to rural extension. The seminar brought together those with an interest in agricultural extension work from thirteen African countries as well as Fiji, Guyana and Papua New Guinea. After discussing the problems they face in providing advice for women in their own areas delegates came up with a wealth of ideas for improving the lot of rural women and encouraging more women to take up a career in agricultural extension. Among the ideas suggested was that advisers should encourage village women to get together to discuss their own problems so that they could share ideas and find solutions which they themselves can implement. Better ways of making information reach women should be found: radio, open-air film shows and the use of women's organizations. Delegates also thought that more research should be directed at easing women's workload. Research to improve food storage methods, for instance, would help women to secure an adequate supply of food. Beyond the household, women should be advised on ways of marketing surplus crops to gain some cash for other household needs and maybe to invest in better seeds or other farming inputs. A two-way flow of information between women farmers and decision-makers was considered essential. This would ensure that women's views are taken into account at the decision-making level. At the advisory level, delegates emphasized the need for more detailed information on rural women's work. In order to obtain the best information it should be collected by people familiar with life in the village or prepared to live there for sometime. Rural women would most probably communicate better with a fellow woman. More efforts, therefore, should be directed at encouraging girls to take up a career in extension work. The number of women in extension services in sub-Saharan Africa has been estimated by the FAO at only 3 % of the total. This has been the result, partly, of the fact that education systems in some regions have tended to exclude women from technical training institutions. Home economists were singled out as an important link with village women in some African countries. It is important that the status of this subject is upgraded and home economists undergo further training so that they could provide agricultural as well as domestic advice. Delegates noted with appreciation that attitudes to women were changing and there was evidence of awareness of their needs among decision-makers at all levels. Representatives from international aid agencies reported that an effort to encourage 'gender awareness' in their organizations has already begun but cautioned that these require a sensitive approach if they are not to backfire. If government and aid agencies could divert some of their funds to fulfilling the aims stated above, or at least ensure that the role of women farmers is not overlooked in their schemes, it would not only improve the welfare of rural women but, by increasing food supplies, would improve the well-being and wealth of nations as well.

The Genting Group, which operates the racino and has been asked to construct the convention center, was evaluating several plans to increase transportation access, and was committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements.

40|$|A {{topological space}} is a {{generalization}} of a metric space that {{allows one to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> limits, convergence, continuity and so on without requiring {{the concept of a}} distance between points in the space. It is based on the observation that, in the theory of metric spaces, the definitions of limits and continuity can be formulated without the word “metric” appearing in the definitions, if you know what the open subsets of the metric space are. Here is the definition. Definition 1 (Topological Space) A topological space (X, T) is a set X together with a collection T of subsets of X that satisfies the axioms ⊲ ∅ ∈ T and X ∈ T ⊲ The union of any collection of sets in T is also in T. ⊲ The intersection of any finite collection of sets in T is also in T. The sets in T are called the open subsets of X. Usually when <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> topological space (X, T), {{it is clear from the}} context what T is. Then you usually just refer to the “topological space X”. Once you have specified what sets are open, you can import a large number of definitions from the theory of metric spaces...|$|R

500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann made a decision that changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the right place for Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey.
