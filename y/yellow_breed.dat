50|$|Southern Yellow cattle are one {{of three}} breeds of Chinese Yellow cattle, the other two being the Central Plains Yellow and the Northern Yellow breeds. The Southern <b>Yellow</b> <b>breed</b> is clearly Zebu (Bos taurus indicus), the Northern <b>Yellow</b> <b>breed</b> is clearly taurine (Bos taurus taurus), and the Central Plains <b>Yellow</b> <b>breed</b> is intermediate, which means at a glance that the Southern Yellow cattle have high, erect humps, the Northern Yellow cattle have no humps, and the Central Plains Yellow cattle have small humps. Philippine Native cattle are mainly derived from Southern Yellow cattle brought from Fujian to the Philippines, they are usually very similar.|$|E

40|$|Eight male cattle of Local <b>Yellow</b> <b>breed</b> with {{an average}} live weight of 121 kg and {{an average age of}} 18 months were used to {{evaluate}} the effects of different levels of sun-dried cassava foliage supplementation (Manihot esculenta) on intake, digestibility and N retention. Rice straw ad libitum and para grass (Brachiaria mutica) at 1 % DM of BW comprised the basal diet. The study was arranged as a 4 × 4 double Latin square design, with cassava foliage contributing 0, 0. 8, 1. 6 or 2. 4 g CP/kg BW. The cattle selected cassava leaves in preference to petioles. Petiole intake decreased from 64 to 48 % of offered petioles when the cassava foliage proportion increased from the lowest to the highest level. The cattle consumed all the leaves at the two lower levels of cassava foliage inclusion and 91 % at the highest level. Rice straw intake decreased significantly as the level of cassava foliage increased. Intake of DM, OM, NDF, and ADF increased significantly with increasing intake of cassava foliage. Daily DM intake per 100 kg BW increased from 2. 7 to 3. 2 kg with increasing cassava foliage intake. No effect on CP digestibility was detected when the level of cassava foliage increased. Digestibility of DM, OM, NDF and ADF was significantly higher in the group fed no cassava foliage than in the other groups. N retention increased from 16 to 28 g/d with the first level of cassava foliage inclusion, but levelled out at the two highest levels. N excretion increased in both faeces and urine as a response to higher intake of cassava foliage. Maximum N retention occurred when 40 % of total N intake came from cassava foliage (equivalent to 1. 3 g CP/kg BW) ...|$|E

40|$|Eight male cattle of the Local <b>Yellow</b> <b>breed</b> with {{an average}} live weight of 121 kg and {{an average age of}} 18 months were used to {{evaluate}} the effects of different levels of sun-dried cassava (Manihot esculenta) foliage supplementation on mineral metabolism in growing cattle fed rice straw and para grass as basal diet. Rice straw ad libitum and para grass (Brachiaria mutica) at 1 % DM of BW comprised the basal diet. The study was arranged as a 4 × 4 double Latin square design, with cassava foliage contributing 0, 0. 8, 1. 6 or 2. 4 g CP/kg BW. The cassava foliage intake was lower than the planned levels. DM consumption was significantly affected by cassava foliage supplementation, with the largest intake observed at the two highest levels of cassava foliage supplementation. Rice straw intake showed the opposite pattern, with lower intake at higher cassava foliage supplementation. No refusals occurred for para grass in any of the treatments. Ca, P, Mg, K, S and Mn intake increased significantly with increasing intake of cassava foliage, but Na intake was not affected by treatment. Faecal excretion of Ca, Mg, S and Mn increased significantly with increasing cassava foliage intake. There were no differences between P, K and Na excretion in faeces. There was a significant diet effect on Mg, S and Mn digestibility. Mg and Mn digestibility increased with increasing cassava foliage supplementation, while S digestibility decreased. Ca, P, K and Na digestibility was not affected by diet. There was a significant effect of treatment on P retention, with the highest value observed for supplementation with 1. 6 g CP/kg BW cassava foliage. Ca and Mg showed similar trends, with the highest retention again for supplementation with 1. 6 g CP/kg BW cassava foliage. There were weak but significant positive correlations between nitrogen retention and the macro minerals Ca, P and Mg. Furthermore, retention of all these minerals was positively correlated. Mineral losses in urine were not affected by dietary treatment with the exception of P excretion, which was affected by treatment. In conclusion, cassava foliage is a good Ca source which compensates for the low Ca content in rice straw and para grass, but P deficiency appears to be exaggerated in cattle with higher cassava intake. The results suggest that under these conditions growing cattle on a high cassava intake would benefit from P and S supplementation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} biomass yield and chemical composition of cassava foliage as influenced by harvesting height and cutting interval (Paper I), the effect of different supplemental levels of dried, ensiled or fresh cassava foliage on rumen fluid parameters, thyroid gland hormones and liver enzymes of cattle fed urea treated fresh rice straw (Paper II to IV), and to determine the changes in live weight gain, thyroid hormones and liver enzymes of heifers supplemented by different levels of dried, ensiled or fresh cassava foliage (Paper V). The experiments were carried out at the experimental farm of Nong Lam University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, on fistulated cattle of local <b>yellow</b> <b>breed</b> (Paper II to IV), growing heifers of Sindhi breed (Paper V), and at the field crop station (Paper I). In Paper I, harvesting height and cutting interval influenced the yield of cassava foliage and root tubers {{and to a lesser}} extent the nutritional quality of foliage. The highest dry matter foliage yield was 8 times higher at a harvesting height of 30 cm above the ground and 45 day cutting intervals, as compared to only one cut of the green foliage tops at the end of the season. The reverse was seen for tuber production on the same treatments, with only 28 % of tuber yield at the highest foliage production. In Paper II to IV, almost all of the cassava foliage was consumed. Mean values of ruminal pH ranged from 6. 14 to 7. 03. Average NH 3 -N concentration ranged from 10. 41 to 16. 25 mg 100 g- 1 of ruminal fluid, volatile fatty acids concentration ranged from 80. 9 to 93. 4 mmol L- 1 of ruminal fluid, and both increased with higher amounts of cassava foliage in the rations. Serum triiodothyronine, thyroxin, free thyroxin, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were not significantly affected by ensiled cassava foliage and dried cassava foliage. When feeding fresh cassava foliage the triiodothyronine and thyroxin concentrations were lower, and alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and thyrotropin stimulating hormone concentrations were higher. Significant effects of fresh cassava foliage levels were found on triiodothyronine and thyroxin. In Paper V, increasing supplemental levels of ensiled cassava foliage and pelleted cassava foliage increased live weight gain, while the gain was not significant for fresh cassava foliage. Ensiled cassava foliage and pelleted cassava foliage supplements increased the daily weight gain by approximately 50 % at the lowest supplementary level of 50 g CP 100 kg- 1 LWt day- 1 and by 100 % at the highest supplementary level of 100 g CP 100 kg- 1 LWt day- 1. Thyroid hormones and liver enzymes did not differ among treatments with ensiled cassava foliage and pelleted cassava foliage. A significant effect of fresh cassava foliage levels was only found for triiodothyronine, while the levels of thyroxin, free thyroxin, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were not significantly affected by fresh cassava foliage level. Results indicated that pelleted cassava foliage and ensiled cassava foliage could be safe protein supplemental sources for growing heifers without adverse effects on their performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} an {{acceleration}} of the loss of domestic animal biodiversity. For conservation purposes, the genetic diversity of the H'Mong cattle, an indigenous local breed was studied. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the SRY gene and mtDNA D-Loop sequence were analysed to clarify the origin of the breed. The genetic diversity was assessed through genetic data with twenty-five FAO microsatellites, and morphometric data with five body measurements from 408 animals sampled from eight districts of the Ha Giang province. Results The SRY genes were all of the zebu type. Among the 27 mtDNA haplotypes, 12 haplotypes were of the taurine type and the remaining 15 of the zebu type. This indicates female taurine introgression in the zebu H'Mong. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0. 616 to 0. 673 and from 0. 681 to 0. 729 respectively according to district, with low genetic differentiation (F ST = 0. 0076). Multivariate analysis on morphometric and genetic data shows a separation of districts into two groups following a south-west/north-east cline and admixture analysis confirmed the two clusters, but no differentiation of taurine introgression between clusters was observed. A possible admixture with the <b>Yellow</b> cattle <b>breed</b> from a neighbouring province was suggested through genetic data and householder interviews. Conclusions In this study we demonstrate the interest of fine-scale sampling for the study of genetic structure of local breeds. Such a study allows avoiding erroneous conservation policies and on the contrary, proposes measures for conserving and limiting crossbreeding between the H'Mong and the <b>Yellow</b> cattle <b>breeds.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|The American {{yellow and}} {{mangrove}} (including golden) warblers differ {{in some other}} reproductive parameters. While the former is somewhat more of an r-strategist, the actual differences are complex and adapted to different environmental conditions. The yellow warbler starts breeding in May/June, while the mangrove warbler can be found breeding all year round. American yellow warblers {{have been known to}} raise a brood of young in as little as 45 days, but usually take about 75 days. The tropical populations, by contrast, need more than 100 days per breeding. Males court the females with songs; an American yellow warbler has been observed to sing more than 3,200 songs in one day. They are, like most songbirds, generally serially monogamous; some 10% of mangrove warbler and about half as many American yellow marbler males are bigamous. Very few if any American <b>yellow</b> warblers <b>breed</b> more than once per year; around one in twenty mangrove warbler females will do so however. If a breeding attempt fails, either will usually try and raise a second brood successfully though.|$|R
50|$|It can {{be grown}} indoors as a houseplant and used in {{habitats}} for amphibians. It prefers shade and moderate moisture. It can even grow submersed in swampy environments. In colder regions the plant dies back during winter, but it returns with lush growth as the temperature increases. It is capable of vegetative reproduction, so to eradicate it once it has become established in an area, the entire plant must be removed, or else it can sprout new growth. It is a common weed in many places. Nurseries grow several varieties, including gold, <b>yellow,</b> and white <b>breeds,</b> but the mossy-green type is most popular with gardeners.|$|R
50|$|These genes assort independently, so {{a single}} genetic cross {{involving}} two black Labradors {{each with a}} recessive allele at both the B and the E locus (BbEe) {{has the potential of}} producing all of the possible colour combinations, while crosses involving chocolate dogs can never produce black (there being no dominant B allele in either parent) but can give rise to yellow, while <b>yellow</b> Labradors will <b>breed</b> true with regard to fur colour but those with black skin can potentially produce a Dudley. Dudleys breed true for both fur and skin. The ability of the E locus to override the coat colour directed by the B locus is a classical example of epistasis, where multiple genetic loci affect the same observed trait.|$|R

40|$|The Capricorn yellow chat Epthianura crocea macgregori (Aves: Meliphagidae) {{occurs in}} the {{seasonal}} wet-dry tropics. This region, although coastal, is typified by highly variable annual rainfall. The Capricorn <b>yellow</b> chat <b>breeds</b> in wetlands, predominantly in the summer-autumn period, but {{has the capacity to}} breed in response to out-of-season rainfall events, consistent with an opportunistically breeding species. Most studies of breeding cues in passerines have been on species centred on temperate climates with predictable rainfall season, arid biomes with a highly variable rainfall quantity and season, and the relatively non-seasonal wet tropics. This study was focused on a species that occurs in an intermediate situation with a highly variable but summer dominant rainfall season. It aimed to identify which proximal cues are used by birds in such environments to prepare for breeding. Monthly observations at a breeding ground over a 45 -month period were regressed against environmental and climatic variables. There was a significant positive relationship of chat abundance with average minimum monthly air temperature and the extent of inundation. Invertebrate food availability was also sampled. Cross-correlation with prior monthly rainfall showed that abundance of insects (Diptera, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera) and semi-aquatic invertebrates peaked 1 - 2 months following large rainfall events, coinciding with peaks in presence of dependent young of Capricorn yellow chats. Thus, the Capricorn yellow chat matches the model for arid-adapted birds in which seasonal cues (e. g. increasing day-length or temperature) in spring lead to breeding preparedness, but breeding only occurs in response to proximal factors such as rainfall. However, the Capricorn yellow chat differs in that breeding is delayed until rainfall is sufficient to inundate its wetland habitat and stimulate the production of food resources associated with the low vegetation and muddy margins of the temporarily flooded pools and channels; suggesting that inundation {{may be the most important}} breeding cu...|$|R
40|$|Background Diversity {{patterns}} of livestock species are informative {{to the history}} of agriculture and indicate uniqueness of breeds as relevant for conservation. So far, most studies on cattle have focused on mitochondrial and autosomal DNA variation. Previous studies of Y-chromosomal variation, with limited breed panels, identified two Bos taurus (taurine) haplogroups (Y 1 and Y 2; both composed of several haplotypes) and one Bos indicus (indicine/zebu) haplogroup (Y 3), as well as a strong phylogeographic structuring of paternal lineages. Methodology and Principal Findings Haplogroup data were collected for 2087 animals from 138 breeds. For 111 breeds, these were resolved further by genotyping microsatellites INRA 189 (10 alleles) and BM 861 (2 alleles). European cattle carry exclusively taurine haplotypes, with the zebu Y-chromosomes having appreciable frequencies in Southwest Asian populations. Y 1 is predominant in northern and north-western Europe, but is also observed in several Iberian breeds, as well as in Southwest Asia. A single Y 1 haplotype is predominant in north-central Europe and a single Y 2 haplotype in central Europe. In contrast, we found both Y 1 and Y 2 haplotypes in Britain, the Nordic region and Russia, with the highest Y-chromosomal diversity seen in the Iberian Peninsula. Conclusions We propose that the homogeneous Y 1 and Y 2 regions reflect founder effects associated with the development and expansion of two groups of dairy cattle, the pied or red breeds from the North Sea and Baltic coasts and the spotted, <b>yellow</b> or brown <b>breeds</b> from Switzerland, respectively.
