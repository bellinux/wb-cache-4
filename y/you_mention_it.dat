She stated that for her, saying [...] "goodbye" [...] is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment. Leil Lowndes {{wrote in her}} 2009book How to Instantly Connect with Anyone that if someone says [...] "have a nice day", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding [...] "Thanks, but I have other plans" [...] or [...] "Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, but now that <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I think I'll have a nice one." [...] Lowndes suggested that the response merely be [...] "You, too." ...|$|E

It had hair like a moose and a great pair of horns. While , Monster Slayer stood watching, Gopher, [...] came up to him. [...] "I wonder what you are doing here," [...] he said. [...] "There is someone here I seek," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "Do you not fear , the Horned Monster who feeds on your kind?" [...] asked Gopher. [...] "Now that <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> it is he I seek," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "I wish to kill him." [...] "I can help you with that," [...] said Gopher, [...] "but I want a piece of his hide." [...] "You shall have it," [...] said [...] [...] Then Gopher dug a tunnel right up to [...] [...] He {{returned}} and said, [...] "I have tunneled right up to where he lies. [...] And from that spot I have tunneled to the East, the South, the West, and the North. [...] You can travel beneath him and shoot an arrow straight up into his heart." [...] , Monster Slayer, could not enter the tunnel because it was too small. [...] "Raise your right leg," [...] said Gopher. [...] While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger. [...] Then , Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where [...] lay above the opening. [...] He shot a chain-lightning arrow straight up into [...] [...] The monster roared and tore at the earth with his horns. Monster Slayer hid in the tunnel to the east. [...] tore at the earth around the tunnel. [...] Before he could reach him, Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the south. Déélgééd began to tear the earth at that spot with his horns, and Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the west. [...] dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. [...] began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down. [...] , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. [...] There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. [...] This was , the Ground Squirrel. [...] "," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "What brings you to this place?" [...] "I am looking at something," [...] said , Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder what you are looking at," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "I am looking at ," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder if I need fear him." [...] "I will go over there and see if he is dead," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing. [...] If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face." [...] "Truly, little brother," [...] answered Monster Slayer, [...] "you shall have it." [...] Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. [...] And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. [...] Gopher came and removed some of 's skin and put it on his own back. [...] So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day. [...] And Gopher gave part of the monster's bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that [...] was slain.|$|E

6000|$|... "No? After {{the fact}} <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> {{struck me as}} rather apposite; but I may have been wrong. The point's hardly worth discussing, and I'm going on to the hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{heard of}} the place in my life," [...] I {{answered}} cheerily. [...] "Till <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> to-night, my dear fellow, I hadn't the remotest idea that you still owned property in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, tell us {{all about}} <b>it,</b> Tot. <b>You</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> to me, but we couldn't go into details at the time," [...] said her father, puffing a {{vigorous}} cloud of smoke into the chimney.|$|R
60|$|VENABLES. Now that <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> {{some of his}} Shandisms do have a curiously {{feminine}} quality.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I think I am. And thirsty, by Jove! I wouldn't give my {{thirst for}} an {{elephant}} tusk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor chap! Spurstow, {{you ought}} to attend to this,' said Mottram. 'Now <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> your eyes are rather gummy and swollen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were only}} {{boy and girl}} then," [...] she said. [...] "One forgets such {{nonsense}} as one grows older. Still, I am almost glad <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it,</b> because--can't <b>you</b> see the uselessness of remembering?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll see to mine," [...] {{came from}} Pepper. [...] "Glad <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it.</b> It {{will be quite}} dark on the road to-night, and I don't want to run in a hole and take a header." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You are {{not going}} to be buried in the Pyramids, I hope?’ she interrupts, arching her {{delicate}} eyebrows. ‘You never said you were. If you are, why haven’t <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> to me? I can’t find out your plans by instinct.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it?' said Bella, looking coldly round. 'I {{suppose it}} is, now <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it.</b> I {{have not been}} {{thinking}} of the evening.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I see,' says Collier, laughing. 'Well, {{now that}} <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I {{have noticed that}} she doesn't seem to displease the optic nerve.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I think I am,' {{answered}} Alec, cheerfully. 'And thirsty, by Jove! I wouldn't give my {{thirst for}} an elephant tusk.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, {{though not}} to any great extent. We saw {{something}} {{of it in}} the papers, I remember, just before we went to Russia; and I recollect <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> as a discreditable affair to the State, though likely to lead to no very important result." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} you have to remember, Ruth, and that is the writer of an {{anonymous}} letter is generally a coward," [...] Jack answered as lightly as he could, more to ease her feelings than anything else. [...] "So don't you worry about this letter. Have <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> to any of the others?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed you did. I {{remember}} <b>it</b> perfectly. <b>You</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> as {{what was}} certainly {{to be very}} soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about it. It was owing to her persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did him {{a great deal of}} harm. You must remember it now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really. What a {{singular}} thing! Well, I {{can see a}} likeness now that <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it.</b> They have both the same hard type of face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{now that}} <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> sir, I did 'ear somethin'; {{but on a}} night like this, when all these London blades are in the village--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! ah well, it did {{not occur}} to me. Now <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I think I have heard that the Scotch have sort of {{scientific}} tendencies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I was so fortunate, sir, as to {{convince}} you of Mr. Ablewhite's innocence, <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> {{as one of the}} reasons for suspecting him, that he was in the house at the time when the Diamond was lost. Permit me to remind you that Mr. Franklin Blake was also in the house at the time when the Diamond was lost." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BARLOW (to OLIVER). <b>You</b> didn't <b>mention</b> <b>it.</b> Where have <b>you</b> met Miss Wrath? She's {{been about}} the world, I believe.|$|R
60|$|FANNY [she seizes eagerly at the chance]. <b>You</b> might <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> to them, dear. It {{would come}} {{so much better}} from you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, now <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I suppose {{one of the}} two {{contingencies}} is probable. Well, I'm awfully glad to {{have met}} you. Good-bye. I must be going.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, to be sure; now <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I {{dare say}} {{he may be}} troubling about that. Go to his bedroom, but be very quiet at present." ...|$|E
60|$|THE CLERK [feebly ironical]. I {{have noticed}} {{something}} {{about it in the}} papers. Heard <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> once or twice, now I come to think of it.|$|E
5000|$|According to Goyette's article, {{there is}} {{confusion}} about the Quebec motto. As <b>you</b> <b>mentioned,</b> <b>it</b> was written by E. E. Taché. [...] "Je me souviens" [...] {{is only the first}} line, which may be the cause of the confusion. It goes like this:Je me souviens/ Que né sous le lys/ Je croîs sous la rose.I remember/ That born under the lily/ I grow under the rose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait, Joseph; I have {{something}} to say to you. If your mistress asks where they have taken Miss Carmina, you mustn't--this is my order, Joseph--you mustn't tell her. If <b>you</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> to any of the other servants--it's quite likely they may have asked you, isn't it?" [...] he said, falling into his old habit for a moment. [...] "If <b>you</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> to the others," [...] he resumed, [...] "they mustn't tell her. That's all, my good man; that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'A plank of wood'! {{said the}} Miller; 'why, {{that is just}} what I want for the roof of my barn. There {{is a very large}} hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don't stop it up. How lucky <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it!</b> It is quite {{remarkable}} how one good action always breeds another. I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank. Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that. Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't suppose so; the thing's not important," [...] Staffer {{answered}} carelessly. [...] "However, since <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> if {{he should}} hesitate, you can show him this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{remember}} something about it, now <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> dear," [...] the good woman would confess. [...] "Always seems such an innocent type of man, a gardener." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now that <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I don't think Hartley was wise; and {{you were}} equally confiding. We have only arrived at a rather {{indefinite}} understanding about your share." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, sir, no; you {{are paid}} to mention it,' the blundering old booby could not resist the temptation of trying it again, 'and <b>you</b> must <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> to pay, <b>mention</b> <b>it</b> to pay.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>it,</b> Fanny. I {{was just}} going to drive off in despair." [...] The colonel {{vanished}} within doors, and after long delay came out flushed, but not with triumph. [...] "On the express condition that I have ladies with me, one an invalid, I am promised a room on the fifth floor some time during the day. They tell me the other hotel is crammed and it's no use to go there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Da-a-a-vid," [...] {{remarked that}} Blue Spider, when he communicated {{the secret to}} him, [...] "mum's the word.
