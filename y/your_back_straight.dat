50|$|It {{does not}} have to be a lotus posture and {{relaxing}} posture is the most important. Kneeling or sitting cross-legged, keep <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>straight</b> (most important), your chin slightly tucked in, and your shoulders slightly back. If your legs get tired, change from a kneeling to sitting position or vice versa, but try to keep <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>straight</b> while doing so. The spine is the main channel for the flow of qi within the body, and is a conduit for receiving the qi of heaven and earth. If the back is crooked, this qi does not flow well. Also, because the body and mind are one, there is a direct relationship between mental and physical posture. If you find that your mind is wandering during meditation, check your posture. When the back is not straight, the mind tends to lose focus.|$|E
