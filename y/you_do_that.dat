500|$|Andrić felt he {{was destined}} to become a writer. He began writing in {{secondary}} school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her {{one of his first}} works, she replied: [...] "Did you write this? What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for?" [...] Andrić published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called Bosanska vila (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to World War I, his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as Vihor (Whirlwind), Savremenik (The Contemporary), Hrvatski pokret (The Croatian Movement), and Književne novine (Literary News). One of Andrić’s favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose, and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andrić’s poetry from this period as [...] "subjective and mostly melancholic". Andrić’s translations of August Strindberg, Walt Whitman, and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from television}} critics. Daniel Martin, writing for The Guardian called it [...] "an astonishing achievement" [...] and [...] "absolutely bloody terrifying". He praised the way Moffat handled River Song's story, {{as well as}} for making it an [...] "intricate romp jammed with ideas that make a truly cinematic piece of drama". Gavin Fuller's review for The Daily Telegraph praised the suspense and [...] "the revelation that all the statues were Angels" [...] which he called [...] "genuinely shocking". Though he commented it [...] "took a while to get going", once it did he thought it had turned into the [...] "first genuine chiller" [...] of the series. He wrote that the [...] "only real disappointment" [...] was the [...] "inference that the TARDIS doesn't really have to make its celebrated 'vworp, vworp' noise on landing", asking [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to us long-time fans, Steven Moffat– that sound is part of the warp and weft of the programme!".|$|E

Before the show, Madonna {{expressed concern about the}} physical and time constraints of the event. [...] "I have eight minutes to set up my stage, 12 minutes to put on the greatest show on Earth, and I have seven minutes to take it down. So, that football field is clean for {{the second half of the}} game", she said. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> This is a Midwesterner girls dream to be performing at the Super Bowl half-time show. In over 25 years of performing that I've done, I have never worked so hard or been so scrupulous or detail-orientated or freaked out."

500|$|Because the {{population}} of Duttlenheim was short in numbers, it proved difficult to field a team of 11 players of equal ages; Wenger did not play for FC Duttlenheim {{until the age of}} 12. Claude Wenger, a teammate of Arsène's, noted his lack of pace as a player, which he made up for with his [...] "ability to guard the ball, [...] to have a complete vision of the pitch and having an influence among his team-mates", according to Marcel Brandner, the president of FC Duttlenheim. As a young teenager, he was called Petit; the nickname ceased when he had a growth spurt and broke into FC Duttlenheim's first team, aged 16. The team did not have a coach to prepare the players tactically, rather a person who supervised training sessions. Wenger took it upon himself to manage the side, with Claude stating [...] "Arsène wasn't the captain and yet he was. It was 'You do this, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> you do this, you do that.' He was the leader".|$|E
500|$|Katie Hasty of HitFix was not {{impressed}} by the lyrical potential of the song, stating that with lines like [...] "sunburned baby / hurts like crazy," [...] "we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight" [...] and rhyming [...] "yum yum" [...] with [...] "some some" [...] won't get this song [...] "very good scores on the SAT". She concluded by stating that: [...] "In fact, it seems that Lopez goes {{out of her way}} to sing with a little-girl inflection to her 41-year-old pipes. But it comes off youthful, upbeat, and a little lighter than the single [...] and her island-inflected collaboration with Lil Wayne, 'I'm Into You'." [...] Amos Barshad of Vulture questioned Lopez' music, stating that [...] "with the other facets of her multimedia empire clicking [...] why does she insist on continuing to make music? Why not sit back, relax, and enjoy the fact that there is something that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> people like? [...] Well, one can only assume, Jennifer Lopez keeps making music because Jennifer Lopez actually loves making music. And that's admirable".|$|E
500|$|His {{style of}} play was hard on his left knee, leading to {{injuries}} and surgeries that shortened his career. The left knee took all of the punishment and was operated on [...] "13 or 14" [...] times according to Orr. Orr was a left-hand shot who played the right side. He would race down the right wing with the puck and attempt to beat the opposing defenceman using his speed and strength. He 'protected the puck', leading with his left knee, and holding his left arm up to fend off opponents. This put him into a position where a hit by the opposing defencemen would often hit the left knee. Also, he would often end up crashing into either the opposing goalie, the net or the end boards. [...] "It was the way I played," [...] Orr has said. [...] "I liked to carry the puck and if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> you're going to get hit. I wish I'd played longer, but I don't regret it." [...] Orr stated in 2008. [...] "I had a style—when you play, you play all-out. I tried to do things. I didn't want to sit back. I wanted to be involved." ...|$|E

500|$|In April2011, it was {{reported}} that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E
500|$|The pilot episode has {{generally}} received positive reviews from television critics, who praised its storylines. Rachel Ray of The Telegraph called the premiere episode [...] "impressive", while Tierney Bricker of E! Online commented that he [...] "instantly {{fell in love}} with the storyline of one man living in two realities in order to stay with the people he loves." [...] NPR Linda Holmes asserted that [...] "Pilot" [...] laid the foundation for several emotional storylines, ultimately evaluating it as amongst the strongest showings in recent memory; [...] "This is a richly interesting narrative, and it's worth watching closely, and if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> it's entirely digestible. It's also beautifully acted and written, packed with genuinely vexing questions about grief and dreaming, and—of all things—thoughtful." [...] Holmes added that it was very engaging in contrast to similar television shows. James Poniewozik of Time noted that while its concept seemed melodramatic, the episode [...] "focuses unflinchingly on the subject of loss, yet manages to be not a downer or painful to watch, but moving, absorbing and even hopeful." [...] Poniewozik affirmed that the telecast effectively solved the issues that were raised about the series. He wrote, [...] "Awake handles the confusion problem well: yes, it takes more concentration than a Law & Order, but it's no Inception in its twistiness. Michael himself needs to hold on to markers to anchor his sense of reality—for instance, he wears a red and a green wristband in the existences in which his wife and his son are alive, respectively—and those help us follow along too." [...] Reuters Tim Molloy avouched that the episode was the [...] "best new show of the season": [...] "Despite the most complicated narrative since ABC's Lost kept skipping through time, Awake makes a fast, emotional connection that gives viewers an almost immediate stake in the lives of its compelling characters." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Smile" [...] was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews from music critics. According to Heather Phares of Allmusic, the song [...] "has a silky verse melody that just barely conceals [...] spite", while she keeps [...] "her revenge sweet, the extra sting being given to it {{by the way she}} sounds like she's singing about how ice cream or puppies or being in love makes her smile". Blender reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen [...] "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called [...] "Smile" [...] an [...] "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When you first left me / I was wanting more / But you were fucking that girl next door / What <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for?,'" [...] and {{went on to say that}} the theme of the song is melancholy, [...] "set against breezy beats", and while not being [...] "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, [...] is good but far from one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer [...] "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a [...] "breezy sha-la-la lilt that just made the song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a [...] "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that [...] "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," [...] while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she [...] "sings without a smirk of irony", is a UK chart-topper.|$|E
