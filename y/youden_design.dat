40|$|In sensory experiments, often {{designs are}} used that are {{balanced}} for carryover effects. It {{is hoped that}} this controls for possible carryover effects, like, e. g., a lingering taste of the products. Proper randomization is essential to guarantee the usual model assumption of independent identically distributed (i. i. d.) errors. We consider a randomization procedure that permutes treatment labels and assessors. This restricted randomization leaves the neighbour structure unchanged and validates the assumption of i. i. d. errors if the design used is a Generalized <b>Youden</b> <b>Design</b> (GYD). However, {{the use of a}} neighbour balanced GYD may require too many assessors. The question arises, whether nearly balanced designs may be used without grossly violating the validity of the analysis. We therefore do a simulation study to assess the properties (under this restricted randomization) of nearly balanced designs like, e. g., the ones proposed by P 9 rinel and Pag?s (2004, Food Quality and Preference 15, 439 ? 446). We observe that, if there are no carryover effects, the variance estimates for treatment contrasts are not significantly biased whenever we use designs that are nearly GYD. Additionally, designs that are nearly carryover balanced still produce conservative variance estimates, even in the presence of large carryover effects. In all, ?nearly neighbour balanced nearly GYD? as proposed by P 9 rinel and Pag?s (2004) appear to be useful in experimental situations where the use of GYD is too restrictive. It should be stressed, however, that these results are true only if randomization is used as a protection against effects unaccounted for in the statistical model...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{phenotyping}} includes {{monitoring of}} rather complex plant processes which {{are linked to}} environmental factors. As complete homogeneity of the factors like temperature, light, water and airflow is usually impossible, it is of importance to optimize experiment design to exclude {{the impact of these}} compound factors. Furthermore, an optimization of cost, throughput and reliability of the data for high-throughput (HTP) phenotyping depends largely on the experimental design. To do this, an existing R package “agricolae” in statistical software R (de Mendiburu, 2009) was modified to generate 13 frequently used experimental designs (completely randomized design, randomized complete block design, Latin squared design, split-plot design, Graece-Latin design, augmented design, <b>Youden</b> <b>design,</b> Balance incomplete design, cyclic design, lattice design, alpha design, strip-plot design, and factorial design). The modified R package has been applied in generating different experimental designs for our common experiment with maize, barley, rapeseed, wheat, and sugar beet in the field and Arabidopsis 1001 genome phenotyping experiment in the screen chamber in 2015. A semi-automated pipeline for statistical analysis with these experimental designs and the data from high-throughput phenotyping experiments has been developed. The statistical functions include: descriptive statistics, frequency and correlation analysis, imputation of missing data with consideration of distribution of the sample data, detection of outlier data, determination of optimal replicates, verifying the assumptions of the linear model, data transformation, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with appropriate statistical models, interaction of different factors, multiple comparisons with different methods, time-serials or repeated measured data analysis, and so on. Graphic user interfaces (GUI) are under development for all statistical analysis procedures so that non-experienced R users can easily automate the selection of a suitable experimental design and the data analysis afterwards by using a step-by-step selection workflow as well as make it possible to monitor and analyze these experiments even during the run.

40|$|Sixty years ago, Kiefer (1958) {{introduced}} generalized <b>Youden</b> <b>designs</b> (GYDs) for eliminating heterogeneity in two directions. A GYD is a row-column design whose k rows form {{a balanced}} block design (BBD) and whose b columns do likewise. Later Cheng (1981 a) introduced pseudo <b>Youden</b> <b>designs</b> (PYDs) in which k = b {{and where the}} k rows and the b columns, considered together as blocks, form a BBD. Kiefer (1975 a) proved a number of results on the optimality of GYDs. A PYD has the same optimality properties as a GYD. In the present paper, we introduce and investigate pseudo generalized <b>Youden</b> <b>designs</b> (PGYDs) which generalise both GYDs and PYDs. A PGYD is a row-column design where the k rows and b columns, considered together as blocks, form an equireplicate generalized binary variance balanced design. Every GYD is a PGYD and a PYD is exactly a PGYD with k = b. We show, however, that there are situations where a PGYD exists but neither a GYD nor a PYD does. We obtain necessary conditions, in terms of v, k and b, {{for the existence of}} a PGYD. Using these conditions, we provide an exhaustive list of parameter sets satisfying v ≤ 25; k ≤ 50; b ≤ 50 for which a PGYD exists. We construct families of PGYDs using patchwork methods based on affine planes...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} in efficiency in estimating treatment differences in <b>Youden</b> square <b>designs</b> from which individual observations {{have been lost}} is considered. A simple generalised inverse of the associated information matrix is used to develop expressions for the variances of the pairwise treatment comparisons. Results on the robustness of Youden squares {{to the loss of}} one or two observations are given, and it is shown that for two observations missing there are eight possible cases of resulting design which need to be considered. The frequencies of these cases depend on the form of the initial design, {{as well as on the}} design parameters. Examples of similar designs are used to illustrate these different frequencies of resulting designs...|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} major field survey, in the winter term of 2012, the 30 items were {{administered}} to bachelor level degree students from 23 universities and universities of applied sciences in Germany. In addition to FK, knowledge of human resources, accounting, marketing, and organization and management {{as well as of}} microeconomics and macroeconomics was assessed using the Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE; Walstad and Rebeck 2008). These further content areas were covered in 220 items. To ensure that the students could respond to a sufficient number of the financial items despite limited test-taking time, the project team used a multiple matrix design. The booklet design consisted of several complex <b>Youden</b> square <b>designs</b> (Frey et al. 2009), including 42 booklets each with three item clusters, 10 items per cluster. To confirm the item fit to the assumed levels of difficulties, each item was assigned to a level of difficulty. Therefore, nine items were assigned to the first level (understanding basic financial concepts in a company), 14 items to the second level (analyzing static concepts and static investment appraisal methods) and six items to the third level (applying and analyzing dynamic appraisal methods).|$|R
40|$|The {{robustness}} of {{incomplete block}} designs {{to the loss}} of all observations in a block is investigated in terms of the efficiency of the residual design. Previous results use the eigenvalues of the information matrix of the treatment effects to determine the overall efficiency of the implemented design, relative to the complete design, in terms of the average variance of pair-wise treatment comparisons. Here we use a simple generalized inverse of this information matrix to identify the variances of the individual pair-wise treatment comparisons and show the effects of the loss of a block on specific treatment comparisons. We determine results for balanced incomplete block (BIB) <b>designs</b> and <b>Youden</b> square <b>designs</b> and show that, although the overall efficiency remains high when a block is lost, comparisons of two treatments that appear in the missing block can be quite seriously affected. The efficiencies of individual treatment comparisons in a BIB design are shown to depend on the number of treatments, the number of blocks used in the initial design and the number of treatments in a block. However, we also show that, for a single replicate of a Youden square, the efficiencies of individual treatment comparisons depend only {{on the size of the}} block that is lost and not on the number of treatments being compared...|$|R
40|$|Six goats {{randomly}} {{divided into}} three groups were used in a 4 X 3 <b>Youden</b> Square <b>design,</b> using four distinct diets [control (C), citric pulp (CP), wheat meal (WM) and rice meal (RM) ] in order to evaluate which diet will predispose the formation of uroliths. Serum calcium and phosphorous were determined, as well as urinary pH, density, calcium and phosphorous. The goats fed RM had the highest serum and urinary phosphorous values (5. 34 ± 1. 71 and 156. 9 ± 85. 5 mmol/L, respectively), while the animals that received CP had the lowest values for blood and urine phosphorous (2. 29 ± 0. 36 and 2. 02 ± 1. 24 mmol/L, respectively). The results of urine pH showed that CP diet caused alkaline urine (8. 44 ± 0. 33), with higher values than WM and RM (6. 27 ± 0. 29 and 6. 37 ± 0. 54, respectively). The urine from one animal that received WM diet and from another that received RM diet presented triple phosphate crystals, while the urine from the goats receiving CP did not present any of these crystals. A determinant factor for crystal formation is the high phosphorous concentration in the urine. Acidic urine pH does not prevent the formation of crystals if urinary phosphorous concentrations are high...|$|R

Treatments included: 1) control, 2) limonene at 10 mg/kg diet DM, 3) limonene at 20 mg/kg diet DM, 4) limonene at 40 mg/kg diet DM, 5) limonene at 80 mg/kg diet DM, 6) CRINA-L (a blend of essential oil components) at 180 mg/kg diet DM, 7) tylosin at 12 mg/kg diet DM. Each period included 11 d with 10 d washouts between periods. Samples were collected on d 0 (before treatment initiation), 4, 7, and 10 for measuring F. necrophorum by most probable number (MPN) method using selective culture medium. Results indicate that CRINA-L (P = 0. 52) and tylosin (P = 0. 19) did not affect ruminal F. necrophorum populations. Limonene linearly decreased (P = 0. 03) F. necrophorum populations, and the optimal dietary concentration for limonene was 40 mg/kg DM. Limonene did not affect ruminal degradation rate of lysine, NH 3 concentration, or VFA profiles in ruminal fluid. Limonene was useful for reducing ruminal concentrations of F. necrophorum. It may have potential to control liver abscesses, although further research will be needed to assess the effect of limonene under feedlot conditions...|$|R

Dogs were fed canned diets with either no gelling agent (control) or one of three gelling agents, wheat starch, a guar gum/carrageenan mixture (50 : 50), and a locust bean meal (LBM) /carrageenan mixture (50 : 50) incorporated at two levels (0. 2 and 0. 5 % of the diet on a wet weight basis). Six dogs were fed each diet in a 6 × 7 <b>Youden</b> square <b>design.</b> Dogs fed diets containing gelling agents had higher ileal digestibilities of OM (P = 0. 05), fat (P < 0. 01), GE (P = 0. 02), and total amino acids (P = 0. 04) and lower (P < 0. 01) total tract DM digestibilities when compared to dogs fed the control diet. Fecal output by dogs fed the control diet, expressed on both an as-is (73. 4 g/d) and DM (45. 6 g/d) basis, was lower (P < 0. 01) than for dogs fed gelling agent-containing diets (mean 102. 3 g/d as-is and 57. 6 g/d DM).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to evaluate the physical-chemical characteristics (density, pH, acidity, fat, protein, lactose and total of solids contents) and milk fatty acids composition (C: 4 to C: 20) in response to roughage sources (alfalfa hay T 1; oat hay T 2 and maize silage T 3). Nine Saanen lactating goats were used, in a triple <b>Youden</b> square <b>design</b> (3 animals x 2 periods). There was no treatment effects in the physical-chemical variables in the univariate analyses; by multivariate analyses three distinct patterns of fatty acids could be defined: milk with greater quantity of short chain fatty acids and acids C 17 : 1 omega 7 e C 18 : 2 omega 6 (T 1); milk with equivalent amounts of short, medium and long chain fatty acids (T 2); and milk with greater amounts of acids C 16 : 1 omega 7, C 17 : 0, C 18 : 1 omega 9 and C 20 : 0 (T 3). These {{results indicated that the}} roughage sources used in the diet of lactating dairy goats affected the fatty acids composition, without altering the milk physical-chemical characteristics. The acids more sensitive to the treatment effects were: C 10 : 0, C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0, C 16 : 1 omega 7, C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 3 omega 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{determined}} the apparent or standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids (AID or SID of AA) in growing pigs fed diets containing three protein feedstuffs with different fiber characteristics at two dietary crude protein (CP) levels. Twenty boars (Yorkshire×Landrace) with average initial body weight of 35 (± 2. 6) kg were {{fitted with a}} simple T-cannula at the distal ileum. These pigs were offered six diets containing soybean meal (SBM), canola meal (CM) or corn distillers dried grains with solubles (corn-DDGS) that were either adequate (19 %) or marginal (15 %) in CP using a triplicated 6 × 2 <b>Youden</b> Square <b>Design.</b> Except for Met, Trp, Cys, and Pro, AID of AA was greater (p< 0. 05) in the SBM diet compared with the CM diet. Apparent ileal digestibility for Gly and Asp was greater (p< 0. 05) in the SBM diet compared with the corn-DDGS diet. The AID of Ile, Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, Tyr, and Asp was greater (p< 0. 05) in the corn-DDGS diet compared with the CM diet. Standardized ileal digestibility of AA was greater (p< 0. 05) in the SBM diet compared with the CM diet for all AA except Trp and Pro. The SID of Ile, Leu, Val, Ala, Tyr, and Asp was greater (p< 0. 05) in the corn-DDGS diet compared with the CM diet. It was concluded that protein feedstuff affects ileal AA digestibility and {{is closely related to}} dietary fiber characteristics, and a 4 -percentage unit reduction in dietary CP had no effect on ileal AA digestibility in growing pigs...|$|R

Methods In Exp. 1, 18 growing barrows (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire; 31. 5 ± 3. 2 kg) were individually placed in stainless-steel metabolism crates (1. 4 × 0. 7 × 0. 6 m) and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 test diets. In Exp. 2, eight crossbred pigs (30. 9 ± 1. 8 kg) were allotted to a replicate 3 × 4 <b>Youden</b> Square <b>designed</b> experiment with three periods and four diets. Two pigs received each diet during each test period. The diets included one nitrogen-free diet and three test diets. Results The relative amounts of gross energy (GE), CP, and all AA in the Canadian barley were higher than those in Australian and French barley while higher concentrations of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, total dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber and β-glucan as well as lower concentrations of GE and ether extract were observed in the French barley compared with the other two barley sources. The DE and ME as well as the SID of histidine, isoleucine, leucine and phenylalanine in Canadian barley were higher (p< 0. 05) than those in French barley but did not differ from Australian barley. Conclusion Differences in the chemical composition, energy content and the SID and AID of AA were observed among barley sources obtained from three countries. The feeding value of barley from Canada and Australia was superior to barley obtained from France which is important information in developing feeding systems for growing pigs where imported grains are used...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Supplementation of protein to calves grazing actively growing pastures has been shown to increase animal performance. The role of protein supplementation is to stimulate: 1) forage intake and digestibility, 2) microbial protein (MP) synthesis in ruminal fluid and 3) provide adequate amount of undigested intake protein (UIP), which together with MP will be absorbed in the small intestine to meet the protein requirements for ruminant tissue growth. The purpose of the research reported here was to evaluate the effect of different sources of organic nutrients and their blends on feed intake, digestibility, and digesta flow using stocker heifers grazing bermudagrass. Seven Brahman heifers (average initial BW 230 kg) were assigned to seven supplement treatments during three 15 d periods in a 3 X 7 <b>Youden</b> square <b>design</b> while grazing late season bermudagrass pasture. Supplements consisted of the following: minerals only (MIN), corn (CRN), corn gluten meal (GLU), cottonseed meal (CSM), feather meal (FEA), corn gluten/feather meal (GFE) or corn gluten/cottonseed/ feather meal (GCF) all contained Bovatec. The protein containing supplements were formulated to contain 35 % CP and 2. 5 Mcal ME/kg, and were individually fed at. 2 % BW per day. Lanthanum and chromium were dosed to serve as flow markers and to estimate fecal output. Single pulse doses of CO-EDTA (solution), ytterbium (forage), and samarium (supplement) were used to estimate turnover rate parameters. Extent of digestion was determined using INDF. Intake was calculated from the estimated fecal output and digestibility. There was a significant effect (P. 05) were detected on fiber digestibility; nor on flow of OM, NDF, and INDF to duodenum; nor on turnover rate parameters due to treatments. The only significant differences (P <. 05) found in turnover rate parameters were due to site and marker.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of graded inclusions of wheat bran (0 %, 9. 65 %, 48. 25 % wheat bran) and two growth stages (from 32. 5 to 47. 2 kg and 59. 4 to 78. 7 kg, respectively) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID), apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and hindgut fermentation of nutrients and energy in growing pigs. Six light pigs (initial body weight [BW] 32. 5 ± 2. 1 kg) and six heavy pigs (initial BW 59. 4 ± 3. 2 kg) were surgically prepared with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. A difference method was used to calculate the nutrient and energy digestibility of wheat bran by means of comparison with a basal diet consisting of corn-soybean meal (0 % wheat bran). Two additional diets were formulated by replacing 9. 65 % and 48. 25 % wheat bran by the basal diet, respectively. Each group of pigs was allotted to a 6 × 3 <b>Youden</b> square <b>design,</b> and pigs were fed to three experimental diets during three 11 -d periods. Hindgut fermentation values were calculated as the differences between ATTD and AID values. For the wheat bran diets, the AID and ATTD of dry matter (DM), ash, organic matter (OM), carbohydrates (CHO), gross energy (GE), and digestible energy (DE) decreased with increasing inclusion levels of wheat bran (p< 0. 05). While only AID of CHO and ATTD of DM, ash, OM, CHO, GE, and DE content differed (p< 0. 05) when considering the BW effect. For the wheat bran ingredient, there was a wider variation effect (p< 0. 01) on the nutrient and energy digestibility of wheat bran in 9. 65 % inclusion level due to the coefficient of variation (CV) of the nutrient and energy digestibility being higher at 9. 65 % compared to 48. 25 % inclusion level of wheat bran. Digestible energy content of wheat bran at 48. 25 % inclusion level (4. 8 and 6. 7 MJ/kg of DM, respectively) fermented by hindgut was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than that in 9. 65 % wheat bran inclusion level (2. 56 and 2. 12 MJ/kg of DM, respectively), which was also affected (p< 0. 05) by two growth stages. This increase in hindgut fermentation caused the difference in ileal DE (p< 0. 05) to disappear at total tract level. All in all, increasing wheat bran levels in diets negatively influences the digestibility of some nutrients in pigs, while it positively affects the DE fermentation in the hindgut...|$|R

In the experiment, which lasted 8 weeks, ewes were allocated, after equal distribution for milk yield, body weight (BW) and lactation number, into three treatments of 6 ewes each in a <b>Youden</b> square experimental <b>design</b> with 4 consecutive periods of 14 days. Ewes in all groups were offered a concentrate mixture ad libitum (1. 12 kg/ewe/day, dry matter (DM) basis) and lucerne hay (0. 90 kg/ewe/day, DM basis). FOW {{were added to the}} concentrate mixture at inclusion levels (on an as-fed basis) of 0, 100 and 200 kg/t for treatments FOWO, FOW 100 and FOW 200, respectively. There were no differences among groups in milk protein (60. 0 g/kg), lactose (53. 0 g/kg) or ash (9. 6 g/kg) contents, but milk fat content increased linearly (P < 0. 01) with increasing dietary levels of FOW. Average milk yield (1 137 g/day) and yields of components tended (P < 0. 10) to decrease with increased FOW feeding. The best estimate of the NE 1 density of FOW was 2. 55 MJ/kg DM at 2. 7 ×M NE intake, a value only slightly lower than that of 2. 62 at 2. 7 ×M based upon a Van Soest et al. (1984) discount from equations of Van Es (1978), who suggested 3. 00 MJ/kg DM at 1. 1 ×M of NE intake.

Effects of {{limonene}} on ruminal fusobacterium necrophorum concentrations, fermentation, and lysine degradation in cattle. Journal of Animal Science, 94 (8), 3420 - 3430. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2016 - 0455 Previous {{in vitro}} {{data showed that}} Fusobacterium necrophorum was inhibited by limonene. We further evaluated effects of limonene on growth of F. necrophorum in vitro {{as well as on}} ruminal concentrations of F. necrophorum in vivo. With in vitro cultivation in anaerobic brain-heart infusion broth, limonene decreased growth of F. necrophorum. Thymol also reduced growth of F. necrophorum, but it was less effective than limonene. Tylosin effectively reduced growth of F. necrophorum in vitro. Although the response over fermentation times and concentrations of antimicrobials differed somewhat between tylosin and limonene, the 2 antimicrobial agents yielded similar inhibitory effects on growth of F. necrophorum at concentrations ranging from 6 to 24 mg/L. The effects of limonene on ruminal F. necrophorum concentration in vivo were tested in 7 ruminally cannulated heifers (225 kg initial BW) used in a 7 × 4 <b>Youden</b> square <b>design.</b> Treatments included: 1) control, 2) limonene at 10 mg/kg diet DM, 3) limonene at 20 mg/kg diet DM, 4) limonene at 40 mg/kg diet DM, 5) limonene at 80 mg/kg diet DM, 6) CRINA-L (a blend of essential oil components) at 180 mg/kg diet DM, and 7) tylosin at 12 mg/kg diet DM. Each period included 11 d with 10 d washouts between periods. Samples of ruminal contents were collected before treatment initiation and after 4, 7, and 10 d of treatment for measuring F. necrophorum by the most probable number method using selective culture medium. Limonene linearly decreased (P = 0. 03) ruminal F. necrophorum concentration, with the lowest concentration achieved with 40 mg of limonene/kg dietary DM. Limonene tended (P ? 0. 07) to linearly reduce ruminal molar proportions of propionate and valerate while tending to linearly increase (P ? 0. 10) those of butyrate and 2 -methyl butyrate. Limonene did not affect ruminal NH 3 concentrations or degradation rates of lysine. Neither CRINA-L (P = 0. 52) nor tylosin (P = 0. 19) affected ruminal F. necrophorum concentrations. CRINA-L significantly decreased ruminal concentrations of NH 3 and molar proportions of 3 -methyl butyrate, whereas tylosin significantly decreased molar proportions of propionate while increasing those of butyrate and tending to increase those of acetate. Limonene supplementation reduced ruminal concentrations of F. necrophorum suggesting that it may have the potential to reduce the prevalence of liver abscesses, although {{further research is needed to}} assess the effect of limonene in feedlot cattle. © 2016 American Society of Animal Science.
