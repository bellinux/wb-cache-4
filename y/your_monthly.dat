That {{soon after}} the {{departure}} of the said Mr. Francis he did again deprive the said Mahomed Reza Khân of his said offices, and did make several great changes in the constitution of the criminal justice in the said country; and after having, under pretence of the Nabob's sufficiency for the management of his own affairs, displaced, without any specific charge, trial, or inquiry whatsoever, the said Mahomed Reza Khân, he did submit the said Nabob to the entire direction, in all parts of his concerns, of a Resident of his own nomination, Sir John D'Oyly, Baronet, and did order an account of the most minute parts of his domestic economy to be made out, and to be delivered to the said Sir John D'Oyly, in the following words, contained in a paper by him intituled, INSTRUCTIONS from the Governor-General to the Nabob Mobarek ul Dowlah respecting his conduct in the management of his affairs. [...] "You will be pleased to direct your mutseddies to form an account of the fixed sums of <b>your</b> <b>monthly</b> expenses, such as servants' wages in the different departments, pensions, and other allowances, {{as well as of the}} estimated amount of variable expenses, to be delivered to Sir John D'Oyly for my inspection. I have given such orders to Sir John D'Oyly as will enable him to propose to you such reductions of the pensions and other allowances, and such a distribution of the variable expenses, as shall be proportionable to the total sum of <b>your</b> <b>monthly</b> income; and I must request you will conform to it." [...] And he did, in the subsequent articles of his said instructions, order the whole management to be directed by Sir John D'Oyly, subject to his own directions as aforesaid; and did even direct what company he should keep; and did throw reflections on some persons, in places the nearest to him, as of bad character and base origin,--persons whom he should decline to name as such, [...] "unless he heard that they still availed themselves of his goodness to retain the places which they improperly hold near his person." [...] And he did particularly order the said Nabob not to admit any English, but such as the said Sir John D'Oyly should approve, to his presence; and did repeat the said order in the following peremptory manner: [...] "You must forbid any person of that nation to be intruded into your presence without his introduction."

6000|$|Your pretty {{read book}} (that is a {{misprint}} for red, {{but it looks}} well, better than it deserves, so I let it stand,) the neat and attractive volume, with its coquettish inscription over its mystifying date, came in to me exactly as a new year's gift. I was delighted to get it, for I had not perused it {{in the pages of}} Harper, for reasons that you will understand--knowing as you must how little the habit of writing in the serial form encourages one to read in that odious way, which so many simple folk, thank heaven, think the best. I was on the point of getting April Hopes to add to the brave array of its predecessors (mine by purchase, almost all of them,) when your graceful act saved me the almost equally graceful sacrifice. I can make out why you are at Buffalo almost as little as I believe that you believe that I have [...] "long forgotten" [...] you. The intimation is worthy of the most tortuous feminine mind that you have represented--say this wondrous lady, with the daughter, in the very first pages of April Hopes, with whom I shall make immediate and marvelling acquaintance. Your literary prowess takes my breath away--you write so much and so well. I seem to myself a small brown snail crawling after a glossy antelope. Let me hope that you enjoy your work as much as you ought to--that the grind isn't greater than the inevitable (from the moment one really tries to do anything). Certainly one would never guess it, from your abounding page. How much I wish I could keep this lovely new year by a long personal talk with you. I am troubled about many things, about many of which you could give me, I think (or rather I am sure,) advice and direction. I have entered upon evil days--but this is for your most private ear. It sounds portentous, but it only means that I am still staggering a good deal under the mysterious and (to me) inexplicable injury wrought--apparently--upon my situation by my two last novels, the Bostonians and the Princess, from which I expected so much and derived so little. They have reduced the desire, and the demand, for my productions to zero--as I judge from the fact that though I have for a good while past been writing a number of good short things, I remain irremediably unpublished. Editors keep them back, for months and years, as if they were ashamed of them, and I am condemned apparently to eternal silence. You must be so widely versed in all the reasons of things (of this sort, to-day) in the U.S. that if I could discourse with you awhile by the fireside I should endeavour to draw from you some secret to break the spell. However, I don't despair, for I think I am now really in better form than I have ever been in my life, and I propose yet to do many things. Very likely too, some day, all my buried prose will kick off its various tombstones at once. Therefore don't betray me till I myself have given up. That won't be for a long time yet. If we could have that rich conversation I should speak to you too of <b>your</b> <b>monthly</b> polemics in Harper and tell you (I think I should go as far as that) of certain parts of the business in which I am less with you than in others. It seems to me that on occasions you mix things up that don't go together, sometimes make mistakes of proportion, and in general incline to insist more upon the restrictions and limitations, the a priori formulas and interdictions, of our common art, than upon that priceless freedom which is to me the thing that makes it worth practising. But at this distance, my dear Howells, such things are too delicate and complicated--they won't stand so long a journey. Therefore I won't attempt them--but only say how much I am struck with your energy, ingenuity, and courage, and your delightful interest in the charming questions. I don't care how much you dispute about them if you will only remember that a grain of example is worth a ton of precept, and that with the imbecility of babyish critics the serious writer need absolutely not concern himself. I am surprised, sometimes, at the things you notice and seem to care about. One should move in a diviner air.... I even confess that since the Bostonians, I find myself holding the [...] "critical world" [...] at large in a singular contempt. I {{go so far as to}} think that the literary sense is a distinctly waning quality. I can speak of your wife and children only interrogatively--which will tell you little--and me, I fear, less. But let me at least be affirmative to the extent of wishing them all, very affectionately, and to Mrs. H. in particular, the happiest New Year. Go on, my dear Howells, and send me your books always--as I think I send you mine. Continue to write only as your admirable ability moves you and believe me ...|$|E

To answer those questions, we design and analyze in this paper a model where a Content Provider (CP) can choose the proportion of data to sponsor and a level of advertisement to get a return on investment, and several Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in competition. We distinguish three scenarios: no sponsoring, the same sponsoring to all users, and a different sponsoring depending on the ISP you have subscribed to. This last possibility may particularly be considered an infringement of the network neutrality principle. We see that sponsoring can be beneficial to users and ISPs, especially with identical sponsoring. We also discuss the impact of zero-rating where an ISP offers free data to a CP to attract more customers, of and vertical integration where a CP and an ISP are the same company...|$|R

40|$|The {{size of your}} solar {{electric}} system depends on: • How much electricity is used {{and the percentage of}} solar electricity to be generated. • Type of PV material used (crystalline silicon or thin-film). • Roof or other PV material mounting surface orientation, tilt, area and condition. • Local solar resource (solar radiation) and peak (direct) hours of sunlight. • Budget. Review your utility bills to determine how much electricity you use [...] show in kilowatt-hours (kWh). One method for approximating system size is using Daily Peak Sun Hours: 1. Determine <b>your</b> average <b>monthly</b> electricity use in kWh. 2. Divide by 30 for average use per day. 3. Find the Peak Sun Hours for your location on the map. Peak sun hours are the hours of direct sunlight that fall on a PV panel (not total hours of daylight). 4. 1. A Tennessee home’s monthly average electricity use is 1, 217 kWh/month. 2. 1, 217 kWh ÷ 30 = 40. 6 kWh average per day. 3.

60|$|In all {{the sights}} {{to be seen}} about the world there is no sight {{in which there is}} less to be seen than in a gold-mine. The two young men were made to follow their {{conductor}} along a very dirty underground gallery for {{about a quarter of a}} mile, and then they came to four men working with picks in a rough sort of chamber, and four others driving holes in the walls. They were simply picking down the rock, in doing which they were assisted by gunpowder. With keen eyes Crinkett searched along the roof and sides, and at last showed to his companions one or two little specks which he pronounced to be gold. 'When it shows itself like that all about, you may guess whether it's a paying concern! Two ounces to the ton, my boys!' As Dick and Caldigate hitherto knew nothing about ounces and tons in reference to gold, and as they had heard of nuggets, and lumps of gold nearly as big as their fist, they were not much exalted by what they saw down the 'Old Stick-in-the-Mud.' Nor did they like the darkness and dampness and dirt and dreariness of the place. They had both resolved to work, as they had often said, with their own hands;--but in thinking over it their imagination had not pictured to them so uncomfortable a workshop as this. When they had returned to the light, the owner of the place took them through the crushing-mill attached, showed them the stone or mulloch, as it was thrust into the jaws of the devouring animal, and then brought them in triumph round to the place where the gold was eliminated from the débris of mud and water. The gold did not seem to them to be very much; but still there it was. 'Two ounces to the ton, my boys!' said Crinkett, as he brought them back to his house. 'You'll find that a 10s. share'll give you about 6d. a month. That's about 60 per cent, I guess. You can have <b>your</b> money <b>monthly.</b> What comes out of that there mine in a March, you can have in a April, and so on. There ain't nothing like it anywhere else,--not as I knows on. And instead of working your hearts out, you can be just amusing yourselves about the country. Don't go to Ahalala;--unless it is for dropping your money. If that's what you want, I won't say but Ahalala is as good a place as you'll find in the colony.' Then he brought a bottle of whisky out of a cupboard, and treated them to a glass of grog apiece.

40|$|What do you owe? What’s most important? How do you decide? When you don’t {{have enough}} money to cover your family’s basic living {{expenses}} and pay all your creditors, you face some difficult financial decisions. It may be tempting to use credit cards, take out a home equity loan or borrow money to pay bills. But taking on more debt is generally not a good idea. Unless your situation turns around quickly it only puts you further behind and creates bigger problems. Instead, focus on cutting your spending and working with your creditors to reduce your payments until your situation improves. When family income is reduced, your spending habits must change. The sooner you change, the more likely your financial problems can be lessened. Your family {{should be part of the}} decision-making process, since their cooperation is essential to carry out the plans. Sizing Up Your Situation When your bills are more than you can pay, you need to contact the people to whom you owe money, your creditors, and explain your situation. Creditors are usually willing to work with you if you contact them before you get behind in your payments. Before you can talk to your creditors, you need to take a hard look at your situation and make some decisions about how much, and when you can pay each creditor. Answer these questions: How long is your present financial situation likely to last? How much income can you count on each month? How much money is needed to cover <b>your</b> family’s essential <b>monthly</b> living expenses? How many creditors do you owe and what is the total amount you owe?
