Reich argued that psychic health and the ability to love depended on orgastic potency, the full discharge of the libido: [...] "Sexual release in the sex act must correspond to the excitement which leads up to it." [...] He wrote: [...] "It is not just to fuck... not the embrace in itself, not the intercourse. It is the real emotional experience of the loss of <b>your</b> <b>ego,</b> of your whole spiritual self." [...] He argued that orgastic potency was the goal of character analysis.|$|E
500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed." [...] He has said the experience was [...] "an important realisation for me: not to let <b>your</b> <b>ego</b> get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role." ...|$|E

500|$|Used in {{the opening}} sequence, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was played 13minutes into the film, where Bond is shown imprisoned and being {{tortured}} {{for over a year}} in a prison camp in Korea. Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of Die Another Day. Nevertheless, she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like [...] "I'm gonna destroy my ego ... Sigmund Freud ... Analyze this" [...] were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline. She told an interviewer from Genre magazine that the lyrics were about [...] "destroying <b>your</b> <b>ego,</b> and it's juxtaposing the metaphor of, you know, the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside the whole universe of Bond". [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was never adapted into the main score of the film. The song was later added to the track list of American Life and was also featured on her third greatest hits album, Celebration (2009).|$|E

DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw <b>your</b> <b>ego</b> to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E

Hence, performing anjali mudra is an honouring of both the self and the other as the gesture acknowledges the divinity of both practitioner and recipient.

Anyone from any previous religion, age, or knowledge group can take Amrit (Amrit Chhakh) when they are convinced that they are ready. This baptism is done by the Panj Pyare in front of the Guru Granth Sahib. The devotee must arrive to the place of baptism, usually a Gurdwara, in the morning after bathing completely including having washed their hair and must be wearing the 5 articles of the Khalsa uniform.

5000|$|He has {{described}} his conducting philosophy as follows:Perhaps also of interest, is the transition I made from violinist to conductor. I {{was a good}} violinist, but I believe I am a better conductor. Maybe you need that self-belief to be a conductor—but it’s not meant in an arrogant fashion. Indeed, in of myself I am often full of huge Irish Catholic self doubts! All that to say, is that I have always known that I had my limitations as a violinist, but that I could rally many personal resources together to inspire musicians and to achieve a unified result, which combines everyone’s skills and contribution ... (It often sounds a bit new age-y, but when I conduct I focus on a point in space above the performers and I imagine everyone’s creative spirit converging on this point. Even if it is imaginary, it helps define that music is something that flows through you and comes from a spiritual place—and hopefully leaves <b>your</b> own <b>ego</b> aside in the process. - Or at very least {{you are not the}} dominating spirit!) ... Further to this is the notion that you are trying to achieve something that is beyond good or bad, right or wrong. If everyone is inspired to focus on a strong musical vision, one that is achieved together, then the performers can let go of the tensions and stress and fear of playing badly. When it works well, one can feel the flow of the music. On a more practical level, I have discovered that if you are an a***hole in rehearsal you eat alone that evening—something that can lead to a lonely life on the road. Better to be a colleague—to treat everyone as equal, making it clear that they have a job and you have a job—that none {{is more important than the}} other. (Not that “all are equal but some are more equal than others!”) That way you can enjoy a drink with friends- God help the tyrannical conductor! ...|$|R
40|$|It’s time to {{turn the}} volume down, says David Burchell LET’S TRY {{for a moment to}} place {{ourselves}} in the position of an ordinary Indonesian citizen at present. Call it a leap of empathy, if you like. Indonesia has become a transit point for the international drug trade. Partly in response to pressure from Western countries, our government has imposed punitive sentences for drug trafficking, and imposes them without compunction. Perhaps forty of fifty people a year are apprehended on such charges. Almost always they plead their innocence, and concoct an excuse. One of these cases, however, involves an Australian citizen. Perhaps because she comes from a jurisdiction that retains the idiosyncratic British jury system of ascertaining guilt - where juries, it is said, are sometimes apt to be swayed by emotional appeals from young, vulnerable-looking women - she bases much of her defence upon a highly emotional appeal to the judges, and to waiting television crews. On the face of it, though, the case is clear cut. She has been found with a large quantity of cannabis in her possession. The customs officers who apprehended her claim she acted suspiciously when they asked to open her bag, and suggest she may even have offered them a bribe. Well-connected people in Jakarta are saying that the initial tip-off about the young woman’s bag came from the Australian Federal Police themselves. There is much talk in Australia about criminal activity among airport baggage handlers, but there is no clear evidence of a connection. In Australia, meanwhile, the case has become a national issue of the first order. The airwaves run hot. Television crews jostle for the best photos of the accused. The young woman is presented as a kind of religious martyr figure, complete with a conversion, religious advisers, and pitiable bouts of grief and wailing. Despite the shortage of hard evidence in her favour, a sizeable number of Australian citizens are firmly convinced both of her innocence (‘you can see it in her eyes’), and of the manifest fraudulence of the legal system that convicted her. (According to a recent Age poll, supporters outnumber sceptics by almost 3 to 1, with another third undecided.) Many pledge never to visit Indonesia again. Some demand back the donations they gave to charitable organisations {{in the wake of the}} Boxing Day disaster of 2004. Finally, a few days after the court verdict, someone sends a suspicious substance to the Indonesian Embassy in Canberra, in a seeming terror attack. Next day the newspapers and TV are reporting that there has been an ‘incident’ at the embassy - but their main concern seems to be that this may damage the young Australian woman’s chances of a successful court appeal. (As if this were more important than the lives of two dozen Indonesian Embassy staff!) What - you ask yourself - is going on? Have Australians taken leave of their senses? To answer this question, it’s advisable to jump back into your own skin. In order to understand recent events, you tell <b>your</b> Indonesian alter <b>ego,</b> a little bit of context is necessary. Australians have been getting a little emotional for a while now. Sometimes this is excusable, even commendable, but not always. The story, you explain, starts in the last months of 2001. In the weeks after the jihadist attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon in the United States, Australians become increasingly conscious of a steady flow of would-be asylum-seekers appearing in leaky boats on the fringes of Australia’s migration zone. Many are from Muslim countries in the epicentre of jihadism, the Middle and Near East. Their appearance causes a wild and emotional public debate. Some fear that there are terrorists among them. On local railway station platforms, citizens can be heard declaring that you can just ‘tell’ that some of them aren’t ‘right’ from the TV photos. (Apparently you can see it in their eyes.) Many more fear an influx of illegal immigrants posing as refugees, and learn to steel their hearts against the emotional appeals of dubious foreigners. In turn, the previously modestly sized refugee lobby is swollen by a vast body of concerned Australians stricken by the sight of women and children gazing out from behind razor-wire fences. Comparisons to Nazism and the death camps are freely made. Young radicals mount exercises to free the ‘prisoners’. Children’s book authors have their characters join in. The messy questions of due legal process, and the exact status of the detainees, are brushed aside. Critics ‘know’ that the detainees are fraudulent, and insist that their appearance of distress is a performance. Supporters, on the other hand, describe them all, without exception, as refugees. Sympathetic public figures brush aside complicating factors. Instead, they urge us to experience the issue on a direct emotional level. We should place ourselves empathetically in these people’s places, and imagine the abuses that are being carried out in Australia’s name as if they were being carried out on themselves. Some Australians do so. Others, it seems, simply determine to harden their hearts further. They’ve closed off the empathetic aorta. These appeals reach a crescendo in the early months of 2005, when it is discovered that an emotionally disturbed young Australian woman of foreign birth has deludedly represented herself to immigration officials as an overstaying tourist. It emerges that she has been locked up for a protracted period in one of the detention centres, in a disoriented state and without proper psychiatric care. Legal advocates of asylum seekers depict the case as archetypical. The vulnerable young woman is presented at a press conference, where she is assisted in reading out a prepared appeal claiming that she is just one of many, and that all detainees should be released immediately. Now just about everybody - regardless of whether they read the broadsheets or listen to talkback radio - is emotionally tuned to fever-pitch, for better or for worse. Some have their humanitarian instincts aroused. Others are defensive about slights on Australian justice and its treatment of foreigners. All are sensitised to the thought that any Australian citizen may be subjected to a legal nightmare at any time, and be left unaided. Only two great foreign calamities have been capable of uniting these opposed waves of emotional anger. The tidal waves that struck South Asia on Boxing Day 2004 had provided an opportunity for humanitarianism and national pride to be assuaged simultaneously. For a moment it had seemed our national catharsis would find a harmonious resolution. Then, shortly after the case of Cornelia Rau, the case of Schappelle Corby hit like a second tsunami. Now humanitarianism and national pride were united once more, in the figure of the vulnerable young Australian woman held behind bars in a foreign land, perhaps for life. This time, it seems, regardless of their views on the other great national controversies, many Australian from all walks of life had made that mental effort, that emotional leap, and has come to the same conclusion. And this time we are angry together - an altogether more potent elixir. Lest you leave <b>your</b> Indonesian alter <b>ego</b> with the wrong impression, you stress that the emotionalism of Australians is often a good thing. Had their been no outpouring of emotion over conditions in the detention centres, conditions there might never have come under scrutiny, and the question of detaining children might never have been raised. Detention may have gone on being indefinite - well, indefinitely. Now it probably won’t In good part, it’s emotion that will have pushed the government towards a pragmatic compromise on mandatory detention, if such a compromise is found. Likewise, had Cornelia Rau not become a cause celebre, others would very likely be put through the same awful ordeal. And as asylum-seeker advocates would not be slow to point out, ordinary Germans once trusted unemotionally in the goodwill of their authorities, with catastrophic results.
