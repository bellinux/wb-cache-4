500|$|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's {{version of}} intimacy. You can hear me... You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you {{recognize}} my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? If <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} what you think of my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
2500|$|Sara {{states that}} {{if he wants to}} {{progress}} in his current relationship, he needs {{to find out what happened}} to move on emotionally. Since Tsukuru doesn't use the Internet, she'll help him getting started: [...] "We live in a pretty apathetic age, yet we're surrounded by an enormous amount of information about other people. If <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> you can easily gather that information about them. Having said that, we still hardly know anything about people." [...] After using Google and Facebook to locate these former friends, she updates Tsukuru on their current whereabouts and even arranges for his travel tickets.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} performance, PC Magazine {{described}} the Priv as having [...] " [...] like [...] that's been throttled down after some gaming", noting that its AnTuTu scores {{were lower than}} those of the Nexus 6P and Samsung Galaxy S6. It also noted that while it wasn't [...] "technically" [...] unresponsive, [...] "there are some complex animations and missed touch or typing inputs that might make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is". The Wall Street Journal felt that the Priv felt [...] "inexcusably slow" [...] at times, reporting instances of slow or unresponsive apps. The battery life was praised, with The Wall Street Journal remarking that it [...] "outran" [...] the Nexus 5X, 6P and iPhone 6S, while PC Magazine credited its aggressive suppression of background activity as improving its standby battery life, stating that it survived a weekend of use with 25% capacity still remaining. In contrast, The Verge and Ars Technica claimed they were unable to reach the device's advertised battery life. PC Magazine praised the Priv's call quality, noting that it had a clear microphone and [...] "delivers very loud maximum speakerphone and earpiece volume with zero distortion or wobble." [...] The Priv's rear-facing camera was criticized for having autofocus issues and for producing washed-out images with poor contrast and low-light performance.|$|E
5000|$|Savage is {{in almost}} every scene of the film and he appreciates the level of {{collaboration}} involved. [...] "Working with these guys, <b>it</b> really makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it's</b> a group project. They're all young (and) they are very open and receptive to everyone's ideas. It's a really great set to be around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose {{we take a}} {{pull over}} to the Island? I {{intended}} to go this afternoon; but if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> <b>it</b> now, we can be off at once." ...|$|R
60|$|WHEN I {{got there}} it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies {{in the air that}} makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> mournful, because <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it's</b> spirits whispering--spirits that's been dead ever so many years--and you always think they're talking about YOU. As a general thing it makes a body wish HE was dead, too, and done with it all.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the {{conflicting}} personalities of his protagonist couple, Sparks faced difficulty {{in finding a}} vehicle that would draw Will and Ronnie to spend time together. “It had to be during the summer, she [...] had to be new in town, and whatever happened had to start in June and end in August. Because you always want a conclusion,” said Sparks of his requirements. He mentioned summer camp or a summer job as typical vehicles used in books, but dismissed them as unoriginal and boring. “So it’s got to be original, it’s got to be interesting, {{and at the same}} time it’s got to be universal, that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> could happen to anybody.” Sparks eventually chose to have Will and Ronnie bond over a loggerhead sea turtle nest, knowing that Loggerhead eggs often hatch in August. The scene of the hatching nest took place during the first week of August and involved 26 live loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings. Sea turtle hatchlings have an innate sense to head toward the ocean water as soon as they are born, so scenes of the nest hatching had to be taken swiftly. Said Mike Dodd of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the biologist who supervised the scene, the hatchlings [...] "did all they know how to do: They crawled down to the water and swam off." [...] Sparks told an interviewer he suspected filmmakers would digitally add more turtles to the scene. At the time of filming, the loggerhead sea turtle was listed as a threatened species. The environmentally friendly theme was an added bonus to Tybee Island, which was then promoting ecotourism.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'll {{come along}} {{to my room}} I'll give you a cigar," [...] he said. [...] "Then, if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> {{you can tell me}} about the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you {{can take}} a bath three times a day, if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> on board," [...] Jocelyn continued. [...] "I'm afraid you won't find much else to do." ...|$|E
60|$|I surely {{need not}} add, dear lad, that if <b>you</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> will {{only have to}} pacify me by a long letter on general subjects, when I shall hasten to respond in recompense for my assault upon the postal highway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, no!" [...] she protested, laying {{her hand}} upon his. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> that, <b>it</b> is ended.--Now come, {{this is a}} gala day. You have come so far to see me. I am seriously flattered. You must be starved, too. Not another word until we have lunched." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] Aynesworth answered, [...] "but {{you must}} {{remember}} {{that you are a}} little out of touch with your fellows just now. I daresay when you were my age, you would have felt as I feel. I daresay that as the years go on, <b>you</b> will <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see," [...] said Lottie, {{instantly}} availing {{herself of}} the opening, [...] "how {{you can get}} up and pray, Sunday after Sunday, whether <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can walk}} till we get tired," [...] he said, [...] "and then if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> we can jump into a taxi {{and take a}} ride around Central Park before we retire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} {{introduce}} Mr. Ormesby, who will kindly resume his place," [...] said Haldane pleasantly. [...] "Sit down and choose a cigar if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> You sent word {{you wanted to}} talk to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allonby, of the Dayspring!" [...] said Devine. [...] "Now, {{the last}} time we worried about the thing you told me you {{considered}} our chances good enough to put your savings in. Would <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> doing <b>it</b> to-day? I want the information, not the dollars. You know it's generally wisest to be straight with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lydia Blood!" [...] {{cried the}} other woman, {{springing}} responsively to her feet, also, and starting toward the girl, [...] "don't you go a step without <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> just <b>like</b> <b>it!</b> Take off your things this minute and stay, if you wouldn't jus' as lives go. It's {{hard enough to}} have you go, child, without seemin' to force you!" ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. [patting {{him on the}} back] Bear <b>it</b> <b>like</b> a man, Tavy, even if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> an ass. <b>It's</b> the old game: she's not {{tired of}} playing with you yet.|$|R
6000|$|Berrie, though equally gay, {{was not so}} sure of {{his ability}} to return to work. [...] "I reckon you'd better go easy till daddy gets back; but if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> we'll ride up to the post-office this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have the}} oil and the ship--and {{that will have to}} be enough," [...] he said, and then {{straightened}} himself with a fierce gesture. [...] "Get out, and sleep--if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> The thing has shaken me, and I'm not sure I'm very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess it}} does. One piece of it, anyway. Sandy {{knew where he}} was appreciated, and we have room for a good many men of your kind in this country. That's about all I need say. When <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> come right back to me." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If {{you got a}} copy of {{the record}} early and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> sharing <b>it</b> {{with the rest of the}} world, then please don't ... We spent two years making this record and we want to put it out when we want to put it out. I don't care about money - after it comes out, give it to whoever you want for free but until then, keep it to yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can offer}} you a not entirely scaly job,' said Smith, 'if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> taking <b>it.</b> In the course of {{conversation}} with my father during the match this afternoon, I gleaned {{the fact that he}} is anxious to secure your services as a species of agent. The vast Psmith estates, it seems, need a bright boy to keep an eye upon them. Are you prepared to accept the post?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now that I've {{made good}} {{by getting the}} {{decision}} over Al., they'll be giving me a chance of a big fight. Maybe with Jimmy Garvin. Well, if that happens, see what I mean? I'll have to be going away somewhere and getting into training. I shouldn't {{be able to come}} and sit with you. But, if <b>you</b> gents <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> I'd be mighty glad to come in till I'm wanted to go into training-camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{please give}} the pin to Tom," [...] said Baxter, [...] "and if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> write {{me a letter}} some day," [...] and he told them of the cities he {{expected}} to visit during his next selling tour. Then the Rovers and their one-time enemy separated.|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} laughed. [...] "I wouldn't worry. We're not {{particular in}} this country. Go up, and {{show him the}} card if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> I've been in a tight place myself once or twice, and we'll take it as an introduction. A good many people know me--you are Mr. Brooke?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] {{he remarked}} confidentially, [...] "youse'll {{be all right}} here. Six per ain't all de dough dere is in de woild, but, bein' cashier, see, you can swipe a whole heap more {{whenever}} <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> And if Tony registers a kick, I'll come around and talk to him--see? Dat's right. Good-morning, loidy." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} book {{mentioned}} above, the author states that “in business as in war success is often {{given to the}} best self-disciplined, the toughest and the most prepared. You do not need anybody disciplining you or making you do the things you know already you ought to do. You do them when you {{ought to do it}} even if <b>you</b> do not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what it is," [...] said Tom; [...] "we must agree on something, or we shall both get left. All we're doing now is to confuse the poor girl. She evidently likes us both the same. What I mean is, we're both so alike that she can't {{possibly}} make a choice unless one of us chucks <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> chucking <b>it,</b> Dick. What?" ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Rihanna spoke of how [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] {{was one of her}} favorite songs on the album, saying [...] "I love that song [...] That {{is one of my favorite}} songs on the album. <b>It</b> makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> celebrating... <b>It</b> gives <b>you</b> a great feeling inside, like you want to go out and have a drink... People can't wait for the weekend." [...] Also in {{an interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Avril Lavigne spoke about being included on the song, saying, [...] "It was really exciting because 'I'm With You' is one of my favorite songs that I've done, I always love performing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just go on, and do {{it again}} {{whenever}} <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> I know what loneliness is, and how telling worries often cures them. I meant every word I said this morning, and will prove it by doing any thing in the world I can for you. Believe this, and let me be your friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I give it up!" [...] laughed Newman. [...] "But {{of course}} it will never do to go on making mistakes. Go your way, by all means. I shall miss you; but you have seen I make friends very easily. You will be lonely, yourself; but drop me a line, when <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> and I will wait for you anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you think," [...] Ellen exclaimed, [...] "that you're {{going to}} march into Clematis Villa just when <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> and behave {{as though nothing}} has happened, all I can say, my man, is that you're going to be disappointed! You've kept away so long you can keep away for good. We can do without you, me and Alf." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rohit Ramachandran of Nowrunning.com rated it 3.5/5 {{stating that}} [...] "Aachariyangal's got a {{sophisticated}} plot that's narrated with due simplicity and directed with candid straightforwardness." [...] Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express concluded [...] "Aachariyangal {{is a fairly}} enagaging fare from a debutant maker, who has {{made an effort to}} strike a different chord." [...] Times of India gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote [...] "if Aachariyangal works to a certain extent, it is mainly because of the inherent what-next suspense that the plot holds". Behindwoods gave 1.5 out of 5 and wrote [...] "Aachariyangal might not make your day but it has its trump cards lined-up just when <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> brushing <b>it</b> away".|$|R
5000|$|Knutsen and Morris, the {{two players}} who {{combined}} for the fatal slapshot, expressed remorse following Cecil's death. Morris, who deflected the puck, explained, [...] "You try to say, 'It {{happens all the}} time,' but you can't. I don't {{know how many times}} pucks get deflected over the glass, but it doesn't make it any better. You can always say, 'It's not my fault,' but <b>you</b> always <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is, a little." [...] Knutsen, who was given the option of sitting out the next game by Blue Jackets coach Dave King but chose to play, told reporters, [...] "I think about it all the time. It was a terrible accident, and I cannot get it off my mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pitchfork {{rated the}} album 7/10, saying the album [...] "feels {{especially}} emblematic {{of a band}} that's fully liberated itself from any commercial or audience expectations and shifted its experimental ethos into overdrive". They were complimentary of tracks such as Something Makes <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like,</b> calling <b>it</b> [...] "lovely" [...] and complimenting its [...] "restless, bleary-eyed vocal turn by French singer Soko that's offset by an easy-going Sweet Jane groove", but criticised other tracks such as [...] "the annoyingly repetitious French-touch house of Solid Gold and the all-too aptly titled Milkin' It". The A.V. Club were also fairly complimentary, calling the album [...] "creative and fun", but also called it [...] "a little half-baked, and ultimately impersonal", rating it a B-.|$|R
