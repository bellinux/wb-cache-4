40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary protein (31, 41, 45, and 55 %) was {{evaluated}} in quadruplicate in the <b>yellow</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus argentiventris). Specimens {{were kept in}} sixteen 200 L plastic tanks for 95 days and the values of growth rate, feeding efficiency and proximate composition of <b>yellow</b> <b>snapper</b> (18 g) were examined. Every 15 days were carried out individual weight measurements and standard length of the total population. At {{the beginning and end}} of the experiment, liver and muscle samples were taken for proximate analysis of crude protein and ether extract. In general, the highest gain was obtained with fish fed with 55 % crude protein in the diet. The best feed conversion ratio (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR), percent weight gain (WG%), average daily gain (ADG), and feed efficiency rate (FER) were obtained with the fish fed 55 % of protein (CP). The protein content in liver decreased in fish fed with protein levels and higher energy compared with the initial fish. Finally, the use of practical diets containing 55 % CP is appropriate for optimal growth and efficiency of feed utilization of <b>yellow</b> <b>snapper.</b> The results obtained in this study may be due to the early stage of development of <b>yellow</b> <b>snapper</b> where protein and energy requirements are higher...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} {{recruitment and}} ontogenetic habitat shifts of the <b>yellow</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus argentiventris in the Gulf of California, by conducting surveys and col-lections in multiple mangrove sites and major marine coastal habitats from 1998 to 2007. Over 1, 167 juvenile individuals were collected and 516 otoliths were aged {{to describe the}} temporal pattern of the settlement. L. argen-tiventris recruits in mangroves, where juveniles remain until they are approximately 100 mm in length or 300 -days-old. Back-calculated settlement dates and underwater surveys indicated a major recruitment peak during Sep-tember and October, around 8 days {{before and after the}} full moon. The majority of mangrove sites in the Gulf of California had a similar L. argentiventris average size {{at the beginning of the}} settlement season for the cohort of 2003; although there were significant differences in indi-vidual sizes at the end of the nursery stage. When sub-adults leave mangroves, they live in shallow rocky reefs and later become abundant in deeper rocky reefs. The density of migratory individuals (10 – 20 cm SL) decreased exponentially as the distance between a reef and a nearby mangrove site increased.

40|$|Este artículo contiene 5 páginas, 2 figuras. Interannual and interdecadal {{variability}} of the recruitment and spawning stock biomass of fish {{has been observed}} for many pelagic commercial species. For reef fish, climate variability has been considered only as a pre-recruitment factor that has stochastic impacts on the survival of eggs and larvae during their pelagic stage. Here we show that fisheries landings of reef fish are related to climatic conditions that occurred {{at the time of}} settlement. Using detailed studies on the life history of 2 important commercial species (<b>yellow</b> <b>snapper</b> and leopard grouper) and a compilation of landing statistics over 11 yr in the Gulf of California, we established that increasing recruitment translated into greater fisheries landings and increased revenue once individuals recruited into fishery stocks. Recruitment appeared to be modulated by El Niño/La Niña events. Monitoring of reef fish recruitment could be used to adapt artisanal fisheries management ahead of time, allowing regulation of effort or setting of quotas based on the {{variability of}} climate indices. This work was supported by the David and Lucille Packard Foundation, the Moore Family Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Ontogenetic of fish is a {{term used}} to study the {{development}} of the behavior of an individual throughout its life (life-span) from hatched to death. The mangrove ecosystem is a potential habitat for fish, especially the juvenile stage. Juvenile found in this habitat is an important economically fish. In various types of fish, the phenomenon of increasing the size of the fish body followed by changes in the types of food causing ontogenetic habitat of fish. It is evident in <b>yellow</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus argentiventris. The juveniles live in mangrove habitat to approximately 100 mm or 300 days old, after which the fish move to deeper surrounding habitat. Mangrove forest that has a high complexity is to serve as an adaptation of fish to avoid predators and foraging. Several different habitats, both the mangrove ecosystem and other ecosystems provide different foods according to the needs at each phase-change of fish life. Animals that undergo ontogenetic habitat drift has management consequences that are more sensitive than animals inhabiting on single habitat. Hence, particularly habitat conservation resource management is needed. Not only conservation of the habitat, but also other habitats related to  the migration of fish.     Keyword: conservation, diet, growth, mangrove, ontogenetic </p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{provides}} a {{comparative study of}} the inhibitory effect of several plant protein sources on digestive proteases of two snappers: <b>yellow</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus argentiventris) and dog snapper (Lutjanus novemfasciatus). Seed extracts did not affect gastric proteases whereas they significantly inhibit intestinal proteases. Inhibition of alkaline proteases showed that pancreatic proteases of L. argentiventris were more sensitive to seed protease inhibitors than those of L. novemfasciatus. Legume seeds showed the highest inhibitory capacity on alkaline proteases causing inhibition higher than 50 % in total proteolytic activity. Protease inhibition on digestive extracts was assessed using different relative concentration of seed extracts and represented by constructing dose response curves. In {{order to reduce the}} inhibitory effect, seed extracts were acid-treated before the inhibition assay. Results showed that acid treatment did not affect the inhibitory capacity of seeds on alkaline proteases in both species. However, when the action of gastric enzymes was simulated on seed extracts, the inhibitory capacity was reduced significantly, mainly in the case of L. novemfasciatus. The responses of fish enzymes to heat-treated seed extracts were also tested. Only higher temperatures were capable of reducing the inhibitory capacity of seed, with the specific response to the snapper species. The use of biochemical assays allows us to quantify the action of inhibitors on total proteolytic activity. In addition, zymograms obtained by substrate-SDS-PAGE provided qualitative information about th...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} services that coastal habitats supply is the provision of seafood that feeds people and supports local fishing economies. Despite this importance, there has been little analysis of the ecological processes that contribute to the local economies, and the impact that human activities have on these processes. The objective of this thesis is to study the relationship between coastal habitats and the dynamics of commercial reef fishes in the Gulf of California, and estimate the value of the services these habitats provide for fisheries. In the first section I will describe the interconnections between the life history of yellow snappers and leopard groupers, and their major nursery habitats (mangrove forests and Sargassum beds, respectively). In the second section, beyond recruitment, I will explore whether all mangrove patches contribute equally to maintaining adult fish populations. I will study the relationship between juvenile snapper abundance and the amount of suitable mangrove nursery area, and estimate the contribution of mangrove patches of different sizes to the replenishment of fish populations. The last section includes fishery statistics for both species, and an economic valuation of mangrove ecosystems for the entire Gulf of California. I will analyze <b>yellow</b> <b>snapper</b> and leopard grouper abundance and fishery data, to determine whether it is possible to predict fish recruitment and landings based on available a priori climate indices. In the final part of this thesis I will test the hypothesis that the amount of mangrove forests has a direct bearing on the production of many commercially important fisheries. The results of this thesis show that the life history characteristics of two {{of the most}} important commercial reef fish species in the Gulf of California are affected by the impact of climate variability on their nurseries. I determined that the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) explained the abundance of juveniles and fisheries landings for both species; increasing recruitment translated into greater fisheries landings once individuals recruited into fishing stocks. I also showed that standard underwater visual surveys combined with traditional fisheries statistics could provide a model to predict fluctuations in abundance over time, and could be used to adapt artisanal fisheries management ahead of time, regulating effort or setting quotas based on expected climate-mediated recruitment of fish into adult populations...|$|E
