50|$|There were stalls by Islamic {{businesses}} and charities like Muslim Hands and Islamic Relief. There was also stalls selling Islamic music, clothing, food and books. There was also opportunities {{to get free}} henna tattoos and your name written in Arabic. There was also an interactive section on the Five Pillars of Islam, an exhibition of <b>young</b> <b>British</b> Islamic <b>art,</b> and a section on famous Islamic scientists and mathematicians. There was also a fun fair in the grounds and lectures by various people from {{within and outside the}} Islamic population like Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, singer Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens and Muslim BBC news reporter Asad Ahmad. There was screenings of Islamic films, and Islamic musicians.|$|R

Sensation attracted over 300,000 visitors, {{a record for}} a contemporary exhibition.|$|E
50|$|Established {{alternative}} spaces such as City Racing at the Oval in London and Milch gave {{many artists}} their first exposure. There was much embryonic {{activity in the}} Hoxton/Shoreditch area of East London focused on Joshua Compston's gallery. In 1991, the Serpentine Gallery presented a survey of this group of artists with the exhibition Broken English. In 1992, Charles Saatchi staged a series of exhibitions of <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Art,</b> the first show included works by Sarah Lucas, Rachel Whiteread and Damien Hirst.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, after few years spent with a daily job in {{advertising}} companies, Fontana became {{actively involved in}} contemporary art as an independent curator for galleries and public institutions. With Laura Ruggeri and Gianni Romano she initiated the first archive of women artists working in Italy, which is now housed at DOCVA (Documentation Centre for Visual Arts) in Milan. In 1991 she organized [...] "An English View" [...] at the British Academy in Rome, the first show in Italy of YBA (<b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Art).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Together with Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Angela Bulloch and Henry Bond, he was [...] "the {{earliest}} of the YBAs"—the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists who dominated <b>British</b> <b>art</b> {{during the}} 1990s.|$|R
2500|$|Writing in his {{commentary}} {{on the influence of}} the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists, High <b>Art</b> Lite, the art historian Julian Stallabrass said, [...] "The Cult of the Street is telling of many characteristics of High Art Lite and its engagement with mass culture and the media. It takes as its subject not just the conventions of the street but youth and their modes of display in shops, clubs, parties, restaurants and even private homes ... they don't do much, Bond's people; they shop, of course, persistently, and present themselves to each other and the camera, dance sometimes, but the book is composed above all of an intricate fabric of exchanged glances and gazes." ...|$|R
50|$|Sadie Judith Coles (born February 1963) is a <b>British</b> <b>art</b> dealer, {{the owner}} of Sadie Coles HQ, a {{contemporary}} art gallery in London, that {{has been at the}} forefront of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists movement.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 Matthew Dalziel and Louise Scullion began a {{collaborative}} practice, since then Dalziel + Scullion {{have produced a}} significant body of work that has been shown widely nationally and internationally including the Venice Biennale; <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Art</b> in Rome; The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh; The Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne; Madison Square Park, New York;The National Maritime Museum, London and at The Meguro Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. Their practice is currently based within the University of Dundee where they also teach in the School of Fine Art.|$|E
5000|$|After {{leaving the}} BBC, Collings wrote Blimey! From Bohemia to Britpop: The London Artworld from Francis Bacon to Damien Hirst, which humorously chronicled {{the rise of}} the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Art</b> (YBA) movement. Published in 1997 by 21, a new company founded by David Bowie, among a group of others, Blimey!was {{described}} by Artforum magazine as “…one of the best-selling contemporary-art books ever." [...] (Kate Bush on the YBA Sensation, Artforum, 2004) The article {{went on to say that}} Collings [...] "invented the perfect voice to complement YBA: He makes an impact without (crucially) ever appearing to try too hard. [...] " ...|$|E
5000|$|His work is surreal in {{tone and}} is often made using collage and the {{appropriation}} of pre-existing images such as postcards, film stills, and publicity photographs. Art historian Julian Stallabrass said, [...] "The contrast {{at the heart of}} these works Stezaker is not between represented and real, but between the unknowing primitives of popular culture, and the conscious, ironic artist and viewer of post-modern images." [...] One work included in an exhibition at Salama-Caro Gallery, London, in 1991, depicted an image of a punch clock together with the caption [...] "Why Spend Time on an Exhibition Like This?" [...] Colin Gleadell wrote in The Daily Telegraph in 2007 that Stezaker [...] "is now being hailed as a major influence on the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Art</b> movement," [...] in reference to Young British Artists.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} how sculptural discourse was absent from <b>British</b> <b>art</b> shown outside of Britain in the 1990 s, despite the international prominence of two distinct groups of British artists: the so-called <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists (YBAs) and other British artists folded into a postcolonial or identity-based construction...|$|R
50|$|Lucas's {{work has}} been {{included}} in major surveys of new <b>British</b> <b>art</b> {{in the last decade}} including Brilliant!—New Art From London at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, in 1995, Sensation (<b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists from the Saatchi Collection at the Royal Academy in 1997), and Intelligence—New <b>British</b> <b>Art,</b> 2000, at Tate Britain. In 2003, Sarah Lucas participated in the 50th International Biennale of Art in Venice, Outlook: Contemporary Art in Athens, and In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, a three-person exhibition for Tate Britain with Angus Fairhurst and Damien Hirst in 2004. From October 2005 to January 2006, Tate Liverpool presented the first survey exhibition of Lucas's work.|$|R
50|$|A {{second wave}} of <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists {{appeared}} in 1992-1993 through exhibitions such as 'New Contemporaries', 'New British Summertime' and 'Minky Manky' (curated by Carl Freedman). This included Douglas Gordon, Christine Borland, Fiona Banner, Tracey Emin, Tacita Dean, Georgina Starr and Jane and Louise Wilson. One exhibition which included several of the YBA artists was the 1995 quin-annual <b>British</b> <b>Art</b> Show.|$|R
5000|$|Higgs {{included}} Home {{in group}} shows he curated - such as [...] "Imprint 93" [...] at City Racing (London June-July 95), [...] "Multiple Choice" [...] at Cubitt Gallery (London March-April 96) and [...] "A to Z" [...] at Approach Gallery (London 1998) - as well issuing a pamphlet {{and later a}} badge by Home {{as part of his}} prestigious edition of Imprint 93 multiples. At this time uber curator Hans Ulrich Obrist also included Home in his survey of <b>young</b> <b>British</b> <b>art</b> [...] "Life/Live" [...] Musée d’art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (October 96- January 97, subsequently toured). In the mid-nineties Home was also appearing regularly as a live artist at [...] "Disobey" [...] events organised by Paul Smith and featuring music from the likes of techno acts Panasonic and Aphex Twin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{show was}} {{presented}} in a large empty warehouse, the East Country Yard building, in South Dock, Rotherhithe within the 460 acre Surrey Commercial Docks complex. The docks were closed in 1969, and by 1990 were being redeveloped by a plethora of property development companies. One of them, Skillion—who had purchased several large buildings but had not yet begun to develop them—was approached by Bond. Reviewing the show in Time Out the art critic David Lillington said, [...] "The East Country Yard is a gigantic complex of old warehouses in which each artist has a 200-foot-long room." [...] Equally, writing in his book Lucky Kunst: The Rise and Fall of <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> <b>Art,</b> commentator Gregor muir said, [...] "'East Country Yard' in South Dock, Docklands ... featured huge installations by Gary Hume and Anya Gallaccio, and could claim {{to have taken place}} in a space four times the size of Saatchi Gallery." ...|$|E
2500|$|Post-modern, {{contemporary}} <b>British</b> <b>art,</b> {{particularly that}} of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists, has been said to be [...] "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety". [...] The annual Turner Prize, founded in 1984 and organized by the Tate, has developed as a highly publicized showcase for contemporary <b>British</b> <b>art.</b> [...] Among the beneficiaries have been {{several members of the}} <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists (YBA) movement, which includes Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, and Tracey Emin, who rose to prominence after the Freeze exhibition of 1988, with the backing of Charles Saatchi and achieved international recognition with their version of conceptual art. This often featured installations, notably Hirst's vitrine containing a preserved shark. The Tate gallery and eventually the Royal Academy also gave them exposure. The influence of Saatchi's generous and wide-ranging patronage was to become a matter of some controversy, as was that of Jay Jopling, the most influential London gallerist.|$|R
500|$|British {{attitudes to}} modern art were [...] "polarised" [...] {{at the end}} of the 19th century. Modernist {{movements}} were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; Impressionism was initially regarded by [...] "many conservative critics" [...] as a [...] "subversive foreign influence", but became [...] "fully assimilated" [...] into <b>British</b> <b>art</b> during the early-20th century. Representational art was described by Herbert Read during the interwar period as [...] "necessarily... revolutionary", and was studied and produced to such an extent that by the 1950s, Classicism was effectively void in <b>British</b> visual <b>art.</b> Post-modern, contemporary <b>British</b> <b>art,</b> particularly that of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists, has been pre-occupied with postcolonialism, and [...] "characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety".|$|R
50|$|Gillian Wearing OBE RA (born 1963) is an English {{conceptual}} artist, {{one of the}} <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists, and {{winner of}} the annual <b>British</b> fine <b>arts</b> award, the Turner Prize, in 1997. In 2007 Wearing was elected as lifetime member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London.|$|R
25|$|Chadwick's {{impact on}} the <b>British</b> <b>art</b> scene {{as an artist and}} teacher helped pave the way for the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artist (YBA) generation. Her {{expanded}} use of materials can be seen carried through the work of many these artists. Without Chadwick's Cacao, for example, it is impossible to imagine Anya Gallacio's chocolate and flower installations. Since Chadwick's Barbican organised retrospective, the full measure of her contribution to the trajectory of contemporary <b>British</b> <b>art</b> is starting to be realised. The Richard Saltoun Gallery in London represents the estate of Helen Chadwick and has continued to show the artists work. Works From The Estate (2013) marked what would have been the artists 60th birthday, showing some of Chadwick's most famous works. The following year Bad Blooms (2014) exhibited Chadwick's Wreaths of Pleasure (1992–93).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists revitalised (and in {{some cases}} spawned) a whole new {{generation}} of contemporary commercial galleries such as Karsten Schubert, Sadie Coles, Victoria Miro, Maureen Paley's Interim Art, and Jay Jopling's White Cube. The spread of interest improved the market for contemporary <b>British</b> <b>art</b> magazines through increased advertising and circulation. Frieze launched in 1991 embraced the YBAs from the start while established publications such as Art Monthly, Art Review, Modern Painters and Contemporary Art were all re-launched with more focus on emerging British artists.|$|R
5000|$|Sarah Kent (born 1947) is a <b>British</b> <b>art</b> critic, {{formerly}} art {{editor of}} the weekly London 'what's on' guide Time Out. She was an early supporter of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists in general, and Tracey Emin in particular, helping her to get early exposure. This has led to polarised reactions of praise and opposition for Kent. She adopts a feminist stance and has stated her position to be that of [...] "a spokesperson, especially for women artists, in a country that is essentially hostile to contemporary art." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jan Wyck {{began to}} school <b>young</b> <b>British</b> artists whilst {{continuing}} {{to work on}} his own projects, and became highly influential in the development of <b>British</b> <b>art</b> in the period, particularly in the genre of battle painting. One of his principal students that went on to produce great works of national importance was John Wootton, who exemplified British equestrian and military art in the early eighteenth century. Another student was the amateur painter Sir Martin Beckman and Matthias Read. Read moved to Whitehaven and became known as the [...] "Father of Cumbrian Painting".|$|R
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to a number of {{commercial}} and public art galleries; including the newly expanded Whitechapel Gallery. The artists Gilbert and George have long made their home and workshop in Spitalfields, and the neighbourhood around Hoxton Square has become a centre for modern <b>British</b> <b>art,</b> including the White Cube gallery, with many artists from the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists movement living and working in the area. This has made the area around Hoxton and Shoreditch fashionable, with many former residents now driven out by higher property prices, and a busy nightlife has developed, with over 80 licensed premises around Shoreditch.|$|R
25|$|Cohen {{is one of}} the world's most {{influential}} and prolific collectors of British and international contemporary art. He began collecting Modern <b>British</b> <b>art</b> in the 1970s and in the early 1990s became a patron and supporter of the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists (YBAs). He also collected American and German art of the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Japanese art (especially the Superflat movement) and more recently has added contemporary Chinese and Indian art to his interests. Every year he is listed in ARTnews magazine's list of ‘The World's Top 200 Collectors’ and {{is often referred to as}} the Medici of the North.|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} of N. Dunn in 1844, his {{partners}} brought his Chinese Collection to London once again in 1851, {{to coincide with the}} Great International Exhibition. This time the collection was largely ignored, and much of it was auctioned at Christie’s in December of that year. The auction opened a new chapter in the story of Asian influence in <b>British</b> <b>art.</b> A third of the objects were bought by one London dealer, and through his shop the remnants of the Collection were disseminated to <b>young</b> <b>British</b> artists and designers ready to transfer global discoveries into modern design.|$|R

50|$|Ian Davenport {{was born}} in Sidcup, and studied art at the Northwich College of Art and Design in Cheshire before going to Goldsmiths College from where he {{graduated}} in 1988. Some of his classmates included Damien Hirst, Michael Landy, Gary Hume and Sarah Lucas. In the same year, he exhibited in the Damien Hirst-curated Freeze exhibition which first brought together many of the later-to-be <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists. Davenport's first solo show was in 1990 {{and in the same}} year he was included in the <b>British</b> <b>Art</b> Show. In 1991, he was nominated for the annual Turner Prize.|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{empirical}} {{study of the}} field of contemporary <b>British</b> <b>art</b> in the 1990 s. It considers the nature of this field as an artistic avant-garde and discusses Bourdieu’s theory of <b>art</b> production. The <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists (yBas) are studied through three distinct levels of analyse derived from Bourdieu’s methodology and theory of practice. Issues of habitus and field structure are highlighted in order to examine the processes and operations of the artistic avant-garde. The article also briefly addresses the products of this field through issues of style and technique and offers some reflections on this sociological approach to art...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Treadwell {{discovered}} {{a new wave of}} young talent emerging from <b>British</b> <b>art</b> schools, most notably two graduates working with extraordinarily disturbed figuration. Alun Jury hailed from Cheltenham College of Art. Paul Rosenbloom, his tutor at Cheltenham, phoned Treadwell directly to advise him that he had a student who was perfect for the Treadwell Gallery. He was followed by a precocious and somewhat provocative <b>young</b> <b>British</b> painter Duncan Mosley from Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, who Treadwell went on to describe in the book Kiss My Art as [...] "a truly rare talent".|$|R
25|$|Chadwick began exhibiting {{regularly}} from 1977, gradually building {{her reputation}} as an artist. Her rise into the public sphere was marked by the inclusion of her work Ego Geometria Sum (1983) in a group exhibition entitled Summer Show I (1983) at the Serpentine. In 1985 she began an active teaching career as a visiting lecturer across a number of London art schools. Her posts at Goldsmiths (1985–90), Chelsea College of Arts, London (1985–95), Central Saint Martins, London (1987–95) and the Royal College of Art (1990–94) ensured an important influence on contemporary <b>British</b> <b>Art</b> in the late 1980s and ‘90s, specifically on the <b>Young</b> <b>British</b> Artists.|$|R
