5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was shown}} to {{potential}} distributors throughout various stages of its production. Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks, it was turned down as the filmmakers {{did not feel that}} it was a good deal. As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue <b>Yonder</b> Films.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} third {{straight}} opening day {{start for the}} Dodgers in the 2013 season, the first Dodger starter to do so since Derek Lowe (2005–2007). In that opening day start he pitched a complete game, four hit, shutout over the Giants and also hit his first career home run. He was the first pitcher to throw a shutout and {{hit a home run}} on opening day since Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians did so against the Chicago White Sox on April 14, 1953. Kershaw picked up his 1,000th career strikeout on April 17, 2013, when he struck out <b>Yonder</b> Alonso of the Padres. He was the second youngest Dodger to reach that mark, behind only Fernando Valenzuela. On May 14, Kershaw passed the 1,000 inning mark for his career. His ERA of 2.70 at the time was the fifth best of the live-ball era at the 1,000 inning mark and the best career mark. He also threw 130 pitches that day, the most of his career and the most by a Dodger pitcher since Odalis Pérez in the 2003 season.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 15 for a Jackie Robinson Day {{game against the}} Padres. Eric Stults hit a three-run homer off Chad Billingsley and the Dodgers again were unable to get key hits and lost 6-3. Chris Capuano made his first {{start of the season}} on April 16, replacing the injured Zack Greinke in the rotation. He struggled early, allowing four runs in the first inning and then left the game {{in the top of the}} third after suffering his own injury, a strained left calf. The Dodgers lost 9-2. Kershaw picked up his 1,000th career strikeout when he fanned <b>Yonder</b> Alonso of the Padres in the 2nd inning on April 17.

As a result, their sound was often [...] "sweeter" [...] than what many of the hot jazz musicians would have preferred. In addition to their sessions with Goldkette, Beiderbecke and his friends recorded under their own names for the Okeh label. For instance, on February 4, 1927, Frank Trumbauer and His Orchestra recorded [...] "Trumbology", [...] "Clarinet Marmalade", and [...] "Singin' the Blues", all three of which featured some of Beiderbecke's best work.
