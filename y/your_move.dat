'Intense' is targeted to the Hispanic audience and follows a young couple as they experience the thrills of driving the redesigned IS 250.|$|E

Submissions would influence the content of the ad and a live, on-air improve performance based on the viewer's ad suggestion will follow at the final commercial break. East and west coast live broadcasts of the commercials will be completely different each time based on their respective social media suggestions. Each Thursday's advertisement would be broadcast live from under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. In anticipation of the campaign launch, a 15-second promotional teaser was premiered on 18 September in NBC's late night programming commercial pods. Additionally, the selected comedic concepts and submissions were made be available for viewing and sharing on a custom page at NBC.com the day after each live broadcast.

Rihanna did military chic in her [...] "Hard" [...] video (she even straddled a tank), and just about every one of Perry's pop contemporaries have ventured down the same path. But they were never really in the military; they were just making it more fabulous. Perry takes the opposite tact: She cuts off her hair, she eschews makeup, she fights, crawls, suffers.

Here's a suggestion: a co-op focused RE that teams Claire up with the almost as underused Jill. It's <b>your</b> <b>move</b> Capcom." [...] Reacting to Claire's return in Revelations 2 IGN's Mitch Dyer wrote: [...] "The Resident Evil series places women in prominent, powerful, playable roles. Jill Valentine, Rebecca Chambers, Sheva Alomar, and Ada Wong, to name a few. Still, they're often opposite a male lead. This is the first time a Resident Evil game has revolved around the story of two women. It's fun to get to play as Claire again." [...] According to a CVG preview of Revelations 2, [...] "she's older, calmer and more capable, but she still retains everything that made her compelling in the first place. Where Rachael from the first [...] was part centrefold, part melted-ice cream, Claire feels distinct from many women in the Resi universe in that there's more to her than lady-lumps and lycra. She's the perfect choice for the game's brand of isolated horror." ...|$|E
