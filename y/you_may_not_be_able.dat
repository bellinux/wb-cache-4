6000|$|... "The {{trouble is}} that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to avoid it later. You're here, and some part will {{probably}} be forced on you. However, as I said, I think you're right about Bella." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, I couldn't {{expect to}} find every quality in my husband, could I? It would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> reasonable. I assure you, dear, that taking your tout ensemble, I like you far the best of all. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the handsomest, and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the cleverest--one cannot expect one's {{absolute}} ideal,--but I love you far, far the best of any.

6000|$|... "You can do {{that and}} welcome," [...] said Jack's father. [...] "But take my advice and take a good lunch along, because <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get {{anything}} up there. I don't know whether there are any farmhouses around or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should the}} talk make me afraid, Macumazahn? Zikali {{did not say}} that this evil spirit of a buffalo would hurt me. If I fear, it is for you, seeing that if you are hurt <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to go with me to look for Bangu's cattle." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well; but be {{sure you}} take notice of the exact {{position}} of the stone, or <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find it again yourself. One big stone {{is a good deal}} like another. Choose a stone with a tree growing near it, and make a cross with your knife on the bark. That will serve as a guide to you, and you would recognize the stone by it even if you could not find it in any other way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, (replied he) I know <b>not</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> in {{the right}} in not {{attempting}} it, for perhaps they might dazzle you with their Lustre." ...|$|R

60|$|Lord Monmouth worshipped gold, though, if necessary, {{he could}} squander {{it like a}} caliph. He had even a respect for very rich men; it was his only weakness, the only {{exception}} to his general scorn for his species. Wit, power, particular friendships, general popularity, public opinion, beauty, genius, virtue, all these are to be purchased; {{but it does not}} follow that you can buy a rich man: <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> or willing to spare enough. A person or a thing that you perhaps could not buy, became invested, in the eyes of Lord Monmouth, with a kind of halo amounting almost to sanctity.|$|E

He could have gone {{straight}} from Dumfries by a good road {{on the other side of}} the mountain, but he preferred this way and a rough climb across.

[...] Whitney paused and looked hard at Andrew. [...] "Before we go any farther, you have to decide whether you really want to find out that reason.

60|$|Also, observe, that though, {{when you}} are master of your art, you may modify your outline by making it dark in some parts, light in others, and even {{sometimes}} thick and sometimes slender, a scientifically accurate outline is perfectly equal throughout; and in your first practice I wish you to use always a pen with a blunt point, which will make no hair stroke under any conditions. So that using black ink and only one movement of the pen, not returning to thicken your line, you shall either have your line there, or not there; and that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to gradate or change it, in any way or degree whatsoever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Draught!" [...] sneered {{the other}} man, with a {{provoking}} laugh, [...] "draught! Don't {{talk to me}} about draughts.

And yet, sir," [...] he continued more quietly, [...] "though I know you'll not believe it, I don't mind admitting that some of the happiest days of my life were spent in that same old box. Ah, those were good old times! Bright, innocent days, I can tell you. I'd wake up there in the mornings and fairly shout with high spirits.

6000|$|... "So {{much for}} business, {{but there are}} two things more: I have no {{relatives}} living save my wife's sister. Therefore, Sir Hugh and Captain Richard, I have made you my joint heirs with her; my testament duly signed and witnessed is in that case with the other papers. My wealth is not great. Still there are certain land and manors in England, a sum of money placed with a merchant in London, whose name you will find written in the testament, my plate and gold coin here, though the former <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to move. Therefore I charge you to bury it and return for it later on, if you can. It is of value, since all my life I have collected such trinkets.
