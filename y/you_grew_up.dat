Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We thought we had a lotta songs that should've been hits. If <b>you</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. So we thought since our music was doin' something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened was we were so alien that no one wanted to touch us. And so we wouldn't get played" ...|$|E

I simply appropriated him, ordaining him on the spot (so as to fulfill one of his personal goals before he could). And in filling out the character of Scot Sloan, I also borrowed from Scotty's mentor, the Reverend William Sloane Coffin, a campus hero and antiwar activist of near-mythic reputation.

You’re a minister’s daughter so <b>you</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E

He was a tall thin man with what I might call a devil-may-care, {{and at the same time}} a mournful expression. I have no doubt that had his death not been so sudden he would have told you something about himself. I have his effects tied up in a bundle. I examined them at the time, but there was nothing of any value in them except a signet-ring. It bore a coat-of-arms with a falcon at the top.

I could only bring Prince Pink to the place where you were being brought up, hoping that when <b>you</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> he might love you, and by your care be restored to his natural form. And you see everything has come right, as I hoped it would. Your giving me the silver ring was the sign that the power of the charm was nearly over, and my enemy's last chance was to frighten you with her army of rats. That she did not succeed in doing; so now, my dear Felicia, if you will be married to my son with this silver ring your future happiness is certain. Do you think him handsome and amiable enough to be willing to marry him?" ...|$|E

You {{seemed to}} me a rare mixture of impressibility, sympathy, sensitiveness to many influences, with a certain quality of common sense;--no, not that, but a higher and finer attribute, for which I find no better word. However tremulously you might vibrate, this quality, I supposed, would always bring {{you back to the}} equipoise. You were a creature of imagination, and yet as truly a New England girl as any with whom <b>you</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in your native village. If there were one person in the world whose native rectitude of thought, and something deeper, more reliable, than thought, I would have trusted against all the arts of a priesthood,--whose taste alone, so exquisite and sincere that it rose to be a moral virtue, I would have rested upon as a sufficient safeguard,--it was yourself!" ...|$|E

We loved you equally, and could not bear the thought of losing either of you. We had two sons instead of one, that was all; and had one been proved to be ours, we should have lost the other. We intended to tell you in a short time how the matter stood, and that while one was our adopted son and the other our own, we neither knew nor cared which was which, loving you both equally and regarding you both as our own. Indeed we should never have told you about it, had it not been that as the story of the confusion at your birth was known to a great many men who were at that time in India, it was almost sure to come to your ears sooner or later. Had we ever dreamt that it would come like this, of course we should have told you long ago. But how can Edgar have learnt it? Still more, how can anyone have been able to tell him--what even we do not know--that he is not our son?" ...|$|E
