60|$|Jasper {{sets the}} example of nearly {{emptying}} his glass, and Neville follows it. Edwin Drood says, ‘Thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much,’ and follows the double example.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> kindly," [...] {{said the}} widow, [...] "a good {{neighbour}} as our minister says, is {{the pool of}} Bethesda; and as you say, Mowbray will rally." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and Miss Fairclough," [...] Lessingham went on, [...] "have rather {{scoffed at}} my {{presence}} here {{on behalf of}} our Secret Service. It seemed to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> ridiculous. Now you understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY BRITOMART [highly indignant] How {{dare you}} say Pip! pip! to me, Sarah? <b>You</b> are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> naughty children. What do you want, Barbara? ...|$|R
60|$|May God bless <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> my <b>very</b> dear friends! My husband bids me {{remember}} him {{to you in}} cordial regard. I long to see you, and to hear (first) that you are well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Flynn, at {{any rate}} {{it must be a}} great comfort for you to know that you did all you could for him. <b>You</b> were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> kind to him, I must say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I read Bessie's {{letter about}} a couple of hours ago, and I congratulate <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much. I think that you will have the sweetest and loveliest wife in South Africa, Captain Niel; and I think that Bessie will have a husband any woman might be proud of;" [...] and she half bowed and half curtseyed to him as she said it, with a graceful little air of dignity that was very taking.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] she said, {{controlling}} herself and rising quickly. [...] "I thank you--thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much." [...] She turned to Mrs. March {{and shook hands}} with her and then with him. [...] "I might have known--I did know that there wasn't anything more for you to tell. But at least I've found out from you that there was nothing, and now I can begin to bear what I must. How are those poor creatures--his mother and father, his sisters? Some day, I hope, I shall be ashamed to have postponed them to the thought of myself; but I can't pretend to be yet. I could {{not come to the}} funeral; I wanted to." ...|$|E
6000|$|What, however, {{produced}} a greater effect upon Schuyler than any encomium or entreaty {{on the part}} of Congress, were the expostulations of Washington, inspired by strong friendship and kindred sympathies. [...] "I am exceedingly sorry," [...] writes the latter, [...] "that you and General Montgomery incline to quit the service. Let me ask you, sir, when is the time for brave men to exert themselves in the cause of liberty and their country, if this is not? Should any difficulties that they may have to encounter at this important crisis deter them? God knows there is not a difficulty that <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> justly complain of, that I have not in an eminent degree experienced, that I am not every day experiencing; but we must bear up against them, and make the best of mankind, as they are, since we cannot have them as we wish. Let me therefore conjure you, and Mr. Montgomery, to lay aside such thoughts--as thoughts injurious to yourselves and extremely so to your country, which calls aloud for gentlemen of your ability." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is enough}} for the present, Andre. <b>You</b> have <b>both</b> done <b>very</b> well, to pick up so much news as that. We will be off, at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{might have}} known you could not be kept apart if I once let Leonard in,' he said, as he {{arranged}} her on the sofa, and satisfied himself {{that there were no}} tokens of the repressed agitation that left such dangerous effects. 'Will <b>you</b> <b>both</b> be <b>very</b> good if I leave you to be happy together?' he presently added, after a few indifferent words had passed.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} more," [...] I said, [...] "and I {{want to say it}} to you now. It may seem to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> unnecessary. Perhaps it is. Still, it is better that we should come to an {{understanding}} about it. A year has passed since Isobel, the child, came to us. To-day she is a woman. If we still keep her with us there must be a bond, a covenant between us, and our honour must stand pledged to keep it. I think that <b>you</b> <b>both</b> know <b>very</b> well what I mean. I hope that <b>you</b> will <b>both</b> agree with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{went back}} into the house, and the two friends began to cut up rough, and their looks didn't please me at all, I assure you. [...] "Let the man go. What {{are you going to do}} with him?" [...] "I'll tell you what I'm going to do with him. I'm going to take him to London to- night, as sure as I'm alive. I'm not alone here, {{whatever}} you may think. You mind your own business, and keep yourselves to yourselves. It'll be better for you, for I know <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> well." [...] I'D never seen or heard of 'em in all my life, but my bouncing cowed 'em a bit, and they kept off, while Thompson was making ready to go. I thought to myself, however, that they might be coming after me on the dark road, to rescue Thompson; so I said to the landlady, [...] "What men have you got in the house, Missis?" [...] "We haven't got no men here," [...] she says, sulkily. [...] "You have got an ostler, I suppose?" [...] "Yes, we've got an ostler." [...] "Let me see him." [...] Presently he came, and a shaggy-headed young fellow he was. [...] "Now attend to me, young man," [...] says I; [...] "I'm a Detective Officer from London. This man's name is Thompson. I have taken him into custody for felony. I am going to take him to the railroad station. I call upon you in the Queen's name to assist me; and mind you, my friend, you'll get yourself into more trouble than you know of, if you don't!' You never saw a person open his eyes so wide. [...] "Now, Thompson, come along!" [...] says I. But when I took out the handcuffs, Thompson cries, [...] "No! None of that! I won't stand THEM! I'll go along with you quiet, but I won't bear none of that!" [...] "Tally-ho Thompson," [...] I said, [...] "I'm willing to behave as a man to you, if you are willing to behave as a man to me. Give me your word that you'll come peaceably along, and I don't want to handcuff you." [...] "I will," [...] says Thompson, [...] "but I'll have a glass of brandy first." [...] "I don't care if I've another," [...] said I. [...] "We'll have two more, Missis," [...] said the friends, [...] "and confound you, Constable, you'll give your man a drop, won't you?" [...] I was agreeable to that, so we had it all round, and then my man and I took Tally-ho Thompson safe to the railroad, and I carried him to London that night. He was afterwards acquitted, on account of a defect in the evidence; and I understand he always praises me up to the skies, and says I'm one of the best of men.' ...|$|E
40|$|To my husband, Todd, who has {{inspired}} me to accomplish goals that I had never thought attainable. “You have supported me throughout our lives together as a wife, mother, student, and professional. All that I have and have accomplished is because of your love and support. You are {{the love of my}} life, and I am the person I have become because of your partnership. I will love you forever. To my children, Haiden and Gable, who have accommodated their lives when their mother had class or had to accomplish her work. I hope you feel that in some, simple way, I’ve provided a role model for both of you and have demonstrated the importance of advancing your education, working hard, balancing life, and achieving your goals. Haiden, you will accomplish all the goals that you set for yourself, and I am so proud of how you’ve grown to support the family throughout my journey in accomplishing this goal. Gable, you have always been the one to bring laughter to any situation. You have made me see stressful situations from a different viewpoint filled with laughter. I am so proud to have the both of you and am priviledged to be your mother. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much. To my mother, father, and brother. Thank you all for being such a supportive syste...|$|E
40|$|To {{my sweet}} aunties, Nora and Toots, I miss <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much. Acknowledgments This {{study is the}} {{capstone}} experience of the very special years I have spent in my doctoral program at The University of Texas at Austin. My time in Austin has been highly rewarding, both personally and professionally. For giving me this opportunity, I {{would like to thank}} my advisor and mentor, Dr. Herb Rieth, for inviting me to be one of his advisees, and for his unqualified and unwavering support over the years. His vision of what I could achieve and the daily modeling of kindness and humor as he prodded me along set a very high standard—I can only hope {{to be the kind of}} mentor to others that he has been to me. I would like to express my appreciation to my committee members, Diane and Brian Bryant, Mark O’Reilly, and Min Liu, for the time and energy each of you has invested in my work, not just in this dissertation process, but over the years at UT. I would like to thank two professors from my master’s program at Montclair State University, too. To Elaine Fine, thank you for your love and enthusiasm for the field of special education and for encouraging me to pursue a higher level of learning, and thank you to Dr. Pau...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Kiss {{my little}} Awk for me, and thank her {{for wanting to}} send me Miss Jenny, dear little maid; I {{like to think of}} it. You will not let her quite forget me. You must show her my name if it is put up in church, like Edmund's and all the little ones'; and you will {{sometimes}} tell her about dear old Ned on a Sunday evening when <b>you</b> are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> good.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} Jonas, [...] "you, Rollo, {{were playing}} here alone. Your little cousin {{came to see}} you; and you were very glad to have him come. He helped you build, and {{when he wanted to}} have the window in a particular way, you ought to have let him. To quarrel with a visitor for such a cause as that, was very ungentlemanly and unkind. So you see <b>you</b> were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much to blame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I must go now; just {{a little}} stroll, that's all; good-bye! Now don't be {{following}} me, Pierre. Mrs. Glendinning, will you keep Pierre back? I know you want him; you were talking over some private affair when I entered; <b>you</b> <b>both</b> looked so <b>very</b> confidential." ...|$|R
40|$|First and {{foremost}} I {{would like to}} thank Bryan Hunt (my bobsie twin) for whom no amount of words can describe the generous help I have received throughout the years. You have been the greatest support system anyone could have or wish for. Thank you for being my friend unconditionally. If it weren’t for your six simple words “you know what you could do, ” I would not have finished my bachelor’s degree a year early and I would not have even attempted a master’s degree. I would not, for certain, have made it without you. For that I will forever be indebted to you. Thank you to my parents who listened to tearful phone calls late into the evening and always made sure that I knew things would be okay. Thank you for being my friend as well as my parent. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much. A huge thanks extended to my committee for not only taking the time to read and re-read drafts of this thesis but for being flexible and willing to meet whenever I needed them to. And finally, last but certainly not least, I {{would like to thank}} Colleen and Emily for coming to visit me in Pullman when I needed them most. You gave me {{something to look forward to}} when I returned home and the last needed push to finish my thesis. I am so happy you both came back into my life. Colleen, thank you for your wedding, it took my mind off of my thesis and the daily grind of grad school...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} so many people {{throughout}} this scholarly journey who have shared their time, wit, wisdom and experiences with me and without the benefit of {{each and every one of}} them, this thesis would have been depleted. My first thoughts turn to my family who have all appeared during the creation of this tome. My never ending love and appreciation go firstly to my husband Andy who, apart from the endless reading, re-reading and tactful editing, has supported and encouraged me throughout the process. Without his unwavering love, understanding and support, completing this thesis would have been a lonelier and less agreeable task, so thank you for your support and your belief in me. Thank you to my two precious bundles of joy, Hayden and Keira, who were born during my candidature and who have been very patient during this journey. You are the very best and most beautiful of distractions and I look forward to spending more time together. Your smiling faces kept me going during difficult stages and you helped to keep things in perspective. So thank you both for your patience and understanding. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much. I couldn’t have managed to complete this without the help given by my parents and friends. Many, many thanks go to my mother with her constant encouragement and help with childcare, to my father who has inspired me throughout this process – whether he knew it or not – and to my stepmother Julia who unleashed the passion for green men. And finally, many thanks to Joan and Peter, my parents-in-law in England for you...|$|E
60|$|It's {{comfort and}} {{pleasure}} after all {{to have a}} good account of <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> my <b>very</b> dear friends, even though one knows by it that you have been sending one 'al diavolo' for weeks or months. Forgive me, do. I feel guilty somehow to the extreme degree, that four letters should have been written to me, even though I received none of them, because I ought to have written at least one letter in that time.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{certainly}} not. What impediment? If I did, I {{should not}} have broached the subject. I declare I think <b>you</b> would <b>both</b> be <b>very</b> happy together. Of course, there is one impediment; we all know that. That must be your look out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right. That's right. Stick to {{that and}} I'll stick to you. It {{will be a great}} {{gratification}} to me to have by me a friend of my old friend De Guest. Tell him I say so. And now you may as well get into harness at once. FitzHoward is there. You can go in to him, and at half-past four exactly I'll see <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> I'm <b>very</b> exact, mind,--very;--and therefore you must be exact." [...] Then Sir Raffle looked as though he desired to be left alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not that}} I doubt your courage, lads, for I marked <b>you</b> <b>both</b> under fire at Montjuich, but the {{fatigues}} will be terrible. You have already supported, in a manner which has surprised me, the work which you have undergone. You have already borne far more than your full share of the hardships of the campaign, and I have, in my dispatches, expressed a very strong opinion to the government as {{to the value of}} the services you have rendered. <b>You</b> are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> young, and I should be sorry to see your lives sacrificed in such an enterprise as that I am undertaking, and shall think no less of you if you elect now to have a period of rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, indeed, he did. He is {{very much}} hurt that you should behave {{to me as if}} you had a sort of enmity towards me. He would like you to make a friend of me. I assure <b>you</b> we <b>both</b> feel <b>very</b> kindly towards you, and are sorry you should cherish such feelings.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I thought Harry had {{him on the}} hip, there: and the spectre evidently {{thought so}} too; for he rose at once and said rather stiffly, [...] "I fear, sir, you are a {{confirmed}} sceptic upon this point, and further argument might only result in {{one or the other}} of us losing his temper. Perhaps it would be better for me to withdraw. I have the honour to wish <b>you</b> <b>both</b> a <b>very</b> good evening." [...] He spoke once more with the hauteur and grand mannerism of the old school, besides bowing very low at each of us separately as he wished us good-night.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{know that}} <b>you</b> <b>both</b> feel <b>very</b> bad, {{and that it}} is {{difficult}} to turn out; still it is worth making the effort, and you will be very glad of it afterwards. Come, jump up, else I shall empty the water-jug over you. There, you need not take much trouble with your dressing,' he went on, as the boys, seeing that he was in earnest, turned out of their berths with a grievous moan. 'Just hold on by something, and get your heads over the basin; I will empty the jugs on them. There, now you will feel better; slip on your clothes and come up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to me, Mr. Orme. Madeline is very young. And so indeed are you too;--almost {{too young}} to marry as yet, even if my girl were willing {{that it should be}} so. But we all like you very much; and as <b>you</b> <b>both</b> are so <b>very</b> young, I think that you might wait with patience,--say for a year. Then come to Noningsby again, and try your fortune once more. That is my advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very sorry," [...] said Mrs. Drane, [...] "that I {{should appear}} to have been discourteous to one who had done us a service, for which, I assure <b>you,</b> we are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much obliged, but Dr. and Mrs. Tolbridge managed the whole affair of our removal from Mrs. Brinkly's house, and I did not suppose there was any one, besides them and ourselves, who would take the {{slightest}} interest in the matter." ...|$|R
40|$|Many times, {{moving a}} loved one into a {{long-term}} care facility is a true act of love and unselfishness. If the caregiver and the care recipient cannot leave the house, <b>you</b> have <b>both</b> become <b>very</b> isolated. Imagine mom {{being able to go}} outside her door to find someone to talk with. There are activities, meals to be shared with friends, and a barrier free area where she can roam...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Greatson," [...] she said, [...] "you {{will think}} that I am {{a very strange}} girl. I {{am going to be}} married in a few months to a man I do not care for one little bit, {{and it seems to me}} that that will be the end of my life. I want you to marry Isobel, and I hope <b>you</b> will <b>both</b> be <b>very</b> happy--and--will <b>you</b> please kiss me once? I am Isobel's cousin, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know," [...] she said, airily. [...] "What {{should you}} think if I told you I had known he was here ever since last night?" [...] She went on in delight at the start he gave. [...] "I saw him come into the hotel while you were gone for the guide-books, and I {{determined}} {{to keep it from}} you as long as I could; I knew it would worry <b>you.</b> We've <b>both</b> been <b>very</b> nice; and I forgive you," [...] she hurried on, [...] "because I've really got something to tell you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Andrea Jürgens is the {{daughter}} of Margret and Heinz Jürgens, and was born in Wanne-Eickel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. She performed her debut hit [...] "Und dabei liebe ich euch beide" [...] (And Yet I Love <b>You</b> <b>Both)</b> in her <b>very</b> first television appearance which took place in the ARD-Silvestergala on New Year's Eve of 1977/1978. The song was written by Jack White and Jon Athan. Its lyrics address the post-divorce situation from a child's perspective. Further appearances on various television and radio shows followed. In the March 1978 Andrea Jürgens was the viewers'-choice winner on ZDF-Hitparade, a television show conducted by Dieter Thomas Heck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{interposed}} Mr. Moore, who had hitherto sat {{a silent}} but amused spectator of this worldly combat, and whose {{indifference to the}} party politics of the day, {{as well as to}} the gossip of the neighbourhood, made him an impartial, if apathetic, judge of the merits of such an encounter, [...] "you have both sufficiently blackballed each other, and proved how cordially you detest each other, and how wicked you think each other. For my part, my hate is still running in such a strong current against the fellows who have broken my frames that I have none to spare for my private acquaintance, and still less for such a vague thing as a sect or a government. But really, gentlemen, <b>you</b> <b>both</b> seem <b>very</b> bad by your own showing--worse than ever I suspected you to be.--I dare not stay all night with a rebel and blasphemer like you, Yorke; and I hardly dare ride home with a cruel and tyrannical ecclesiastic like Mr. Helstone." ...|$|R
40|$|First and foremost, I want {{to thank}} {{my mom and dad}} for {{supporting}} me, both emotionally and financially, as I continued to embark on strengthening my educational career. Your quest to encourage me to continue my education has gotten me to the where I am today. The value <b>you</b> <b>both</b> place on education and how you continued to instill this value in me while growing up has provided me with a significant motivation to continue this journey. We have been through so much, but our strong, little family has not faltered as we continue to support and love one another unconditionally. Thank you for everything you have given me [...] . <b>you</b> are <b>both</b> truly an inspiration. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> so <b>very</b> much. To my sister, Megan. Although you are not physically here, I felt your support through your strong and ever-present spirit. You are {{a very important part of}} my life and a key contributor as to who I have become today. You embraced life for what it was worth and because of that, you have taught me to love, cherish, and value the short life we are given. I know that you are proud of my accomplishments. Thank you for always being there for me [...] . you will always be in my heart. I love you...|$|R
60|$|MRS. HIGGINS. Just so. She {{had become}} {{attached}} to <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> She worked <b>very</b> hard for you, Henry! I don't think you quite realize what anything {{in the nature of}} brain work means to a girl like that. Well, it seems that when the great day of trial came, and she did this wonderful thing for you without making a single mistake, you two sat there and never said a word to her, but talked together of how glad you were that it was all over and how you had been bored with the whole thing. And then you were surprised because she threw your slippers at you! I should have thrown the fire-irons at you.|$|R
