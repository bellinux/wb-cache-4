2500|$|Although his terse one-liners {{are well}} known, {{he is also}} known for having a dark sense of humour. On the 20th lap of the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Räikkönen had just taken the lead from Lewis Hamilton and his race {{engineer}} Simon Rennie advised that Fernando Alonso was five seconds behind {{and that he would}} be kept informed of Alonso's pace; Räikkönen replied, [...] "Just leave me alone, I know what I'm doing!" [...] Later in the same race, he admonished his team again, when being told to manage the tyre temperature: [...] "Yes, <b>yes,</b> <b>yes,</b> <b>yes,</b> I'm doing that all the time. You don't have to remind me every ten seconds!" [...] The first quote attracted significant press coverage, and Räikkönen made no attempt to apologise in the post-race interview. It was earlier reported that he printed 500 T-shirts with the quote for the entire Lotus team, but this was later invalidated by Räikkönen in an interview with an FOM media personnel. The quote is also featured on his official website.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>yes,</b> <b>yes,</b> hell <b>yes,</b> {{of course}} I get it. But--Oh, I think we'd better use {{something}} more dignified and forceful, like 'We lead, others follow,' or 'Eventually, why not now?' Course I believe in using poetry and humor {{and all that}} junk when it turns the trick, but with a high-class restricted development like the Glen we better stick to the more dignified approach, see how I mean? Well, I guess that's all, this morning, Chet." ...|$|R

5000|$|However, {{the late}} McKinstry might have replied that a truly intelligent, {{knowledgeable}} entity (on {{a par with}} humans) {{would be able to}} work out answers such as (<b>yes</b> | <b>yes</b> | <b>yes</b> | don't know | ...) by applying its knowledge of the relative sizes of the objects named.

60|$|And Torfrida said <b>yes,</b> and <b>yes,</b> and <b>yes,</b> {{and felt}} {{in her heart}} that she knew all that already. Had not she, too, taught, entreated, softened, civilized? Had not she, too, spent her life upon a man, and that man a wolf's-head and a landless outlaw, more utterly than Godiva could ever have spent hers on one who lived lapped in luxury and wealth and power? Torfrida had done her best, and she had failed, or at least fancied in her haste that she had failed.|$|R

6000|$|There was far {{too much}} noise for any one to hear the town crier, who went along {{jingling}} his bell, and shouting, [...] "O <b>yes!</b> O <b>yes!</b> O <b>yes!</b> By order of the Lord Mayor and Council, no householder shall allow any one of his household to be abroad beyond his gate between the hours of nine o'clock at night and seven in the morning," [...] or {{if any of the}} outermost heard it, as did Ambrose who was on his way home to his night quarters, they were too much excited not to turn a deaf ear to it.|$|R

40|$|U. S. {{banks have}} {{disappeared}} by merger {{at the rate}} of 1. 75 per business day between 1980 and the present. During these two decades, approximately 8, 200 unassisted bank mergers and 1, 160 assisted mergers of distressed banks have occurred. 1 From a peak of 14, 483 commercial banks in 1984, the number of insured commercial banks fell to 8, 563 by the end of 1999. The ownership of about $ 2. 5 trillion of banking assets has changed through mergers during this time – more than half the U. S. total. These mergers have brought consolidation with a vengeance. The 25 largest banks control 70 % of all assets, and are expected to control 85 % of bank assets in another decade –mostly via mergers. Figure 1 presents estimates of the banks and bank assets acquired in the 1980 - 1999 period; Figure 2 illustrates the dramatic {{decline in the number of}} commercial banks (and savings institutions). This dramatic industrial shift raises some basic questions: why are banks merging? will mergers enhance efficiency in banking? is consolidation good for banking customers? It has been widely assumed by the business press, bankers, and most regulators that the answers to these questions are <b>yes,</b> <b>yes,</b> and <b>yes.</b> This reflects widespread agreement that the United States economy is “overbanked ” and therefore inefficient.

5000|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} received a 2013 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Animated Program. Robert David Sullivan of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and gave a fairly positive review, commenting, [...] "In {{the early years of}} The Simpsons, the annual 'Treehouse Of Horror' outing was a fun contrast to most of the show’s episodes. There was <b>yes</b> warmth, <b>yes</b> subtlety, <b>yes</b> lessons learned, and <b>yes</b> attempt at a coherent story—just a lot of gross-out humor and a chance to see Springfield stretched even further past reality. Yes that the entire show has adopted these qualities, the Halloween tradition doesn't seem as special. But, like the couch gag at the start of each episode, 'Treehouse Of Horror' tempts us with the chance to see something that doesn't feel borrowed (and a bit dumbed down) from the show’s glory years." ...|$|R
