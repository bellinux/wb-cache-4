40|$|OBJECTIVE: For {{the early}} {{detection}} and treatment of malnourished hospital patients no valid screening instrument for the Dutch language exists. Calculation of percentage weight loss and body mass index (BMI) by the nurse at admission to the hospital appeared to be not feasible. Therefore, the short, nutritional assessment questionnaire (SNAQ), was developed. RESEARCH, DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and ninety one patients on the mixed internal and surgery/oncology wards of the VU University medical center were screened on nutritional status and classified as well nourished (18. 5), moderately malnourished (5 - 10 % weight loss in the last 6 months and BMI> 18. 5) or severely malnourished (> 10 % weight loss in the last 6 months or > 5 % {{in the last month}} or BMI< 18. 5). All patients were asked 26 questions related to eating and drinking difficulties, defecation, condition and pain. Odds ratio, binary and multinomial logistic regression were used to determine the set of questions that best predicts the nutritional status. Based on the regression coefficient a score was composed to detect moderately (2 points) and severely (3 points) malnourished patients. The validity, the nurse-nurse reproducibility and nurse-dietitian reproducibility was tested in another but similar population of 297 patients. RESULTS: The questions 'Did <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> unintentionally?'. 'Did you experience a decreased appetite over the last month?' and 'Did you use supplemental drinks or tube feeding over the last month?' were most predictive of malnutrition.

RESULTS: Factors positively associated with attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> among non-Hispanic Blacks included self-perceived overweight, female sex, higher education, physician recommendation to <b>lose</b> <b>weight,</b> and having a chronic medical condition.

40|$|IntroductionApproximately 40 % {{of women}} of childbearing age report that they are {{attempting}} to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b> No professional medical organization recommends attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during pregnancy because of the possible risks to both mother and baby. Since half of all pregnancies are unintended, women may attempt to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> before they know they are pregnant, and some women may continue or initiate weight loss attempts even after they know they are pregnant. This study examines the extent to which pregnant women report attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and associated sociodemographic and health characteristics. MethodsWe used aggregated multiple-year data (1996 - 2003) from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to assess the prevalence of attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> among pregnant women {{and the extent to which}} sociodemographic and health characteristics are associated with the behavior. ResultsThe prevalence of attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during pregnancy was 8. 1 %. Attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during pregnancy was associated with age 35 - 44 years, Hispanic ethnicity, obesity, alcohol consumption, and mental distress during the previous month. ConclusionA substantial proportion of pregnant women attempt to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b> Preconception and prenatal care should include counseling women to achieve a healthy weight before becoming pregnant, to maintain healthy weight during pregnancy, and not to attempt weight loss during pregnancy. Further research should be conducted to understand how attempting weight loss during pregnancy translates into dietary change and weight loss and associated maternal and fetal outcomes...|$|R
