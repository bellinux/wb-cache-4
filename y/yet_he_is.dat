5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

25|$|Brosius {{remains a}} long-time {{advocate}} for the significance and wealth of RNA molecules even in modern cells. <b>Yet,</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> skeptical of the drastic transformation {{in the perception of}} RNA within the scientific community. The idea of pervasive importance of RNA was formerly frequently rejected. Currently, the trend of thought is to raise any background transcript or any detectable snippet of a transcript after processing or decay to a functional status.|$|E

Following the battle, Edward is proclaimed king, George is proclaimed Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, {{although}} he complains to Edward {{that this is an}} ominous dukedom. King Edward and George then leave the court, and Richard reveals to the audience his ambition to rise to power and take the throne from his brother, although as <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> unsure how to go about it.|$|E
25|$|Meredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, India on 30 June 1928. In 1931 Starr {{established}} a retreat center at East Challacombe, North Devon (a {{couple of miles}} from Combe Martin), where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking {{in a sense of}} humor and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> considered to have {{played a central role in}} introducing Meher Baba to the western world.|$|E

25|$|Meyer {{was very}} up front {{throughout}} his life about being too selfish {{to be a father}} or even a caring partner or husband. <b>Yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also said to have been very generous with all his friends and acquaintances, and never isolated friends from one another. Biographers have attributed most of his brutish and eccentric nature {{to the fact that he}} was abandoned by his father, an Oakland police officer and overly coddled by his mother, Lydia, who was married six times. Meyer had a half sister, Lucinda, who was diagnosed in her 20s with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to California State mental institutions until her death in 1999. Mental illness ran in his family and was something he secretly feared. During his entire life Russ Meyer spoke with only the highest reverence for his mother and sister.|$|E
25|$|He bowls {{marathon}} spells, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{usually on}} the attack. His unique bowling action {{begins with a}} short run-up, and culminates with an open-chested extremely wristy release from a partly supinated forearm which had him mistaken for a leg-spinner {{early in his career}} by Allan Border. Aside from his stock delivery, the off-break, of which he claimed to have two variations (during a recorded television 'doosra' show off with Mark Nicholas from Channel 4 in 2004), his main deliveries are a fast topspinner which lands on the seam and usually goes straight on, and the doosra, a surprise delivery which turns from leg to off (the opposite direction of his stock delivery) with no easily discernible change of action. Additionally, he would occasionally use one of his several unnamed novelties. His super-flexible wrist makes him especially potent and guarantees him turn on any surface.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, {{there was}} a {{consensus}} that [...] "The giant center of Michigan practically stands in a class by himself at the pivot position". [...] University of Chicago star Walter Eckersall, said: [...] "Schulz, of Michigan, easily outshone his opponents in every game. [...] He is finely built, runs fast, snaps accurately, tackles hard, and is all over the field in every play". [...] One writer referred to Schulz in 1907 as a [...] "human catapult" [...] and said: [...] "Schulz of Michigan is a very heavy man, weighing over 200pounds, <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> strikingly fast on his feet and is unusual on that account. [...] He propels his massive frame at a rate of speed that terrifies opponents.... The acknowledged prowess of Schulz makes him an especial object of unfair attack in scrimmages by opponents who hope, by disabling him, to weaken the Michigan team".|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Todd's {{introduction}} to OLTL, he was a competitive athlete. His fraternity {{was the most important}} part of his life; Howarth stated that Todd was [...] "under intense pressure from the male figures in his life". He felt that the key to understanding Todd was his concern about his status and how others perceived him. He thought that Todd mistreated people because it made him feel better about himself and that he did not want to appear vulnerable, so his defense mechanisms [...] "spun out of control". Howarth, during an April 1994 Soap Opera Update interview, said that the only thing that he admired about Todd was his clothing style. His interviewer called Todd's early fashion sense [...] "grunge, Salvation Army like 'rags'," [...] and Howarth described Todd's later wardrobe as [...] "all Ralph Lauren" [...] and [...] "ouble R.L. 80 dollar pants and a 400-and-something-dollar jacket". St. John, as Todd's second portrayer, described the character as [...] "kind of both good and bad. He's got his good side with his kids, and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> conniving and vicious and all those negative things".|$|E
500|$|Brosnan's Bond was {{introduced}} in Goldeneye; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond {{into the history of}} the others in the series through the post-credits sequence use of the , previously seen in Goldfinger and Thunderball, [...] "thus immediately evoking the memory of [...] Connery". Brosnan's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being [...] "closer to the Fleming novels than Moore... <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also lighter and less intense than Dalton". Black also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions, with Bond not smoking. Brosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond's smoking habit, saying [...] "I don't give a damn about everyone's perception of the character: I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn't smoke", although he did smoke a Cuban cigar in Die Another Day. Brosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals, and provided a [...] "mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour"; Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were [...] "flippant, but not crass".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after meeting}} Wind, Jonathan and Charlotte {{find one of}} Brauner's magical portraits. [...] Unable to destroy it from outside, the two travel into the world within. [...] Soon, they find Brauner's channeler, a Dullahan. [...] Shortly after its defeat, one of the vampire sisters appears and disdains their efforts, saying their control is lessened in only a minor degree. [...] Later, when {{entering}} the second portrait, they find Brauner and the two twins; Brauner laughs {{at the notion of}} reviving Dracula, as he has failed too many times to control humanity, but concedes his power is too great to ignore. [...] Both sisters desire to kill the two humans, but Brauner sees Dracula's servant Death as a greater threat, as he could wrest control from him far more easily than them. [...] While exploring the castle, Charlotte and Jonathan encounter Death, who acts as if Dracula were already revived. [...] When informed Dracula is still dead, and that another vampire is controlling the castle, he scoffs at the idea of a hand other than Dracula's to rule Castlevania. [...] <b>Yet,</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> gravely disturbed when he sees the statements are true, and promptly leaves to seek a way to destroy Brauner and revive Dracula.|$|E

500|$|Now {{he discovers}} that the self he chooses has a {{boundless}} multiplicity within itself inasmuch {{as it has}} a history, a history in which he acknowledges identity with himself. This history is of a different kind, for in this history he stands {{in relation to other}} individuals in the race, and to the whole race, and this history contains painful things, and <b>yet</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the person he is only through this history. That is why it takes courage to choose oneself, for {{at the same time as}} he seems to be isolating himself most radically he is most radically sinking himself into the root by which he is bound up with the whole. This makes him uneasy, and yet it must be so, for when the passion of freedom is aroused in him-and it is aroused in the choice just as it presupposes itself in the choice-he chooses himself and struggles for this possession as for his salvation, and it is his salvation. Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216When a person turns and faces himself in order to understand himself, he steps, as it were, in the way of that first self, halts that which was turned outward in hankering for and seeking after the surrounding world that is its object, and summons it back from the external. In order to prompt the first self to this withdrawal, the deeper self lets the surrounding world remain what it is-remain dubious. This is indeed the way it is; the world around us is inconstant and can be changed into the opposite at any moment, and there is not one person who can force this change by his own might or by the conjuration of his wish. The deeper self now shapes the deceitful flexibility of the surrounding world in such a way that it is no longer attractive to the first self. Then the first self either must proceed to kill the deeper self, to render it forgotten, whereby the whole matter is given up; or it must admit that the deeper self is right, because to want to predicate constancy of something that continually changes is indeed a contradiction, and as soon as one confesses that it changes, it can of course, change in that same moment. However much that first self shrinks from this, there is no wordsmith so ingenious or no thought-twister so wily that he can invalidate the deeper self’s eternal claim. There is only one way out, and that is to silence the deeper self by letting the roar of inconstancy drown it out. Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, 1845, Hong translation, p. 314Just as a man changes his clothes for celebration, so a person preparing for the holy act of confession is inwardly changed. It is indeed like changing one’s clothes to divest oneself of multiplicity in order to make up one’s mind about one thing, to interrupt the pace of busy activity in order to put on the repose of contemplation in unity with oneself. And this unity with oneself is the celebration’s simple festive dress that is the condition of admittance. Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong, p.19If a person whose life has been tried in some crucial difficulty has a friend and sometime later he is unable to retain the past clearly, if anxiety creates confusion, and if accusing thoughts assail him with all their might as he works his way back, then he may go to his friend and say, [...] "My soul is sick so that nothing will become clear to me, but I confided everything to you; you remember it, so please explain the past to me again." [...] But if a person has no friend, he presumably goes to God if under other circumstances he has confided something to him, if in the hour of decision he called God as witness when no one understood him. [...] And the one who went to his friend perhaps was not understood at times, perhaps was filled with self-loathing, which is even more oppressive, upon discovering that the one to whom he had confided his troubles had not understood him at all, even though he had listened, had not sensed what was making him anxious, but had only an inquisitive interest in his unusual encounter with life. But this would never happen with God; who would dare to venture to think this of God, even if he is cowardly enough to prefer to forget God-until he stands face-to-face with the judge, who passes judgment on him but not on the one who truly has God as a witness, because where God is the judge, there is indeed no judge if God is the witness. It by no means follows that a person’s life becomes easy because he learns to know God in this way. On the contrary, it can become very hard; it may become more difficult than the contemptible easiness of sensate human life, but in this difficulty life also acquires ever deeper and deeper meaning.
