40|$|<b>Youth</b> <b>with</b> an Autism Spectrum Disorder {{can also}} have an other {{clinical}} disorder, for example a depression. This depression could be a multiple disability for this <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> autism. The <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> an Autism Spectrum Disorder and depression can have more limits in daily functioning, in comparison to <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> only an Autism Spectrum Disorder. It’s important to know at which aspects in daily functioning the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders have the greatest limits. Because if these aspects are known, the youth can be supported at these aspects. This results in the following question: In which degree do Dutch children and youth from 4 to 18 years with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and an depression have limits in their adaptive skills? The level of the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders are compared <b>with</b> the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> autism, the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> a depression and <b>with</b> the <b>youth</b> without psychopathology on four adaptive skills; contact with other children; contact with parents, adults and authority; school, work and future and the adaptive skill autonomy. This research with 635 participants shows that there’s a difference between <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders and <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> an Autism Spectrum Disorder on the adaptive skill autonomy. <b>Youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders and <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> only a depression differ on the adaptive skill contact with other children.

In an article examining the phenomenon of panic disorder in youth, Diler et al. (2004) found that only a few past studies have examined the occurrence of juvenile panic disorder. They report that these studies have found that the symptoms of juvenile panic disorder almost replicate those found in adults (e.g. heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, hot flashes, nausea, abdominal distress, and chills). The anxiety disorders co-exist with staggeringly high numbers of other mental disorders in adults. [...] The same comorbid disorders that are seen in adults are also reported in children with juvenile panic disorder. Last and Strauss (1989) examined a sample of 17 adolescents with panic disorder and found high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and conduct disorders. Eassau et al.

Within the sample, adolescents were found to have the following comorbid disorders: major depressive disorder (80%), dysthymic disorder (40%), generalized anxiety disorder (40%), somatoform disorders (40%), substance abuse (40%), and specific phobia (20%). Consistent with this previous work, Diler et al. (2004) found similar results in their study in which 42 <b>youths</b> <b>with</b> juvenile panic disorder were examined.

Results indicated that there were significant differences in daily PA between genders and age groups, not between weekdays and weekends, and that overall, 95 % of the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> DS who participated met the national physical activity guidelines. Regarding the minimum monitoring period, the results demonstrated that 4 days and 14 hours of monitoring per day were required to reliably estimate typical PA in <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> DS. In study 2, I aimed to objectively estimate PA using accelerometers and to determine the minimum monitoring days and hours needed in <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> ASD. Results demonstrated that there were significant differences in daily PA between genders and age groups, not between weekdays and weekends, and that approximately 90 % of the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> ASD who participated met the physical activity guidelines. In addition, at least 2 days and 9 hours of monitoring per day were needed to reliably estimate typical PA in <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> ASD. Finally, in study 3, I aimed to compare PA and the minimum monitoring days and hours needed between <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> DS and <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> ASD with the PA data measured on the ankle using accelerometers. Results indicated that placing an accelerometer on the ankle as the monitoring placement appeared to be reliable when measuring PA in <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> DS and ASD. No significant differences were observed for PA between the DS and ASD group, and 3 days of monitoring may be the most reasonable minimum number of monitoring days if both groups are combined into a larger group, categorized as developmental disabilities. However, the minimum monitoring hours appeared to need more investigation to be established...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the lipid profile and the {{prevalence}} of lipid abnormalities in <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> and without type 1 diabetes and explore the role of glycemic control on the hypothesized altered lipid profile in <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 512 <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> type 1 diabetes (mean duration 4. 22 years) and 188 healthy control subjects aged 10 – 22 years in Colorado and South Carolina. SEARCH for Diabetes in <b>Youth</b> (SEARCH) participants <b>with</b> type 1 diabetes and healthy control subjects recruited from primary care offices in the same geographic regions were invited to attend a research visit. Fasting lipid profiles were compared between <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> type 1 diabetes (stratified according to cate-gories of optimal [A 1 C 7. 5 %] and suboptimal [A 1 C 7. 5 %] glycemic control) and healthy nondiabetic youth, using multiple linear and logistic regression. RESULTS — <b>Youth</b> <b>with</b> type 1 diabetes and optimal A 1 C had lipid concentrations that were similar (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and LDL particle size) or even less atherogenic (HDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and triglyceride–to–HDL cholesterol ratio) than those observed in nondiabetic <b>youth,</b> whereas <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> suboptimal glycemic control ha...|$|R
40|$|Problem {{behavior}} and situational adversity theories {{were used to}} investigate HIV risks among homeless youth. Problem behavior theory posits that <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> certain personality characteristics {{are more likely to}} engage in additional risk behaviors. Situational adversity warns against exposure to the social context of homelessness. We investigated the interaction between these concepts to explain two HIV-related risk behaviors: (1) non-condom use and (2) high-risk drug use among homeless youth (n= 460) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. An index of recurring problem behaviors represented that theory and two measures of homelessness represented situational adversity. <b>Youth</b> <b>with</b> both problem behaviors and homelessness experiences were the least likely to use condoms and the most likely to use high-risk drugs compared to <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> only problem behaviors, <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> homelessness experiences only or <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> neither. One finding contradicted the situational adversity hypothesis, and in the absence of problem behaviors, duration homelessness was not related to high-risk drug use...|$|R
