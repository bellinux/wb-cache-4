As soon as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in {{contraband}} and get up to all manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants. I have never persecuted anyone from {{this or any other}} sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics make {{reference}} to Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and have three parts to the vocal harmony. Andrzej Ciuk, one of {{the editors of the}} book Exploring Space noted that the proverbial status of the phrase [...] "opposites attract" [...] as a defining key ingredient of cultural concept of [...] "love" [...] and this was evident also in the song with the lyrics: [...] "You met your match when you met me, I know that you'll disagree its crazy, But opposites attract you'll see, And I won't let <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> so easy".|$|E

[...] Whilst he has distanced himself from this period of his life, the [...] "misunderstanding has remained and today...he carries that weight on his shoulders." ...|$|E

500|$|A new costume was {{required}} for Ryan once Seven had the majority of her Borg implants removed. She wore a new silver jumpsuit for the following several episodes. During the filming of the episode [...] "Day of Honor", [...] director Jesús Salvador Treviño criticized the outfit, saying that [...] "almost any camera angle inevitably winds up emphasizing her sexuality." [...] Ryan described the new costume as [...] "a little snug"; she wore a corset-like device which gave her the appearance of mechanical ribs. Treviño praised Ryan's third costume, which replaced the silver jumpsuit, noting how it reduced her sexual characteristics: [...] "It is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from that titillation stuff which I think is so demeaning {{not only to the}} audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about".|$|E
2500|$|David Brooks {{reviewed}} the follow-up {{book about the}} next generation titled Millennials Rising (2000). [...] "Millennials" [...] is a term coined by Strauss and Howe. Brooks wrote: “This {{is not a good}} book, if by good you mean the kind of book in which the authors have rigorously sifted the evidence and carefully supported their assertions with data. But it is a very good bad book. It's stuffed with interesting nuggets. It's brightly written. And if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the generational mumbo jumbo, it illuminates changes that really do seem to be taking place.” [...] Further, Mr. Brooks wrote that the generations aren't treated equally: [...] "Basically, it sounds as if America has two greatest generations {{at either end of the}} age scale and two crummiest in the middle".|$|E
2500|$|Treviño {{praised the}} {{subsequent}} changes to her costume {{in order to}} reduce its sexuality, saying that [...] "it is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from that titillation stuff which I think is so demeaning not only to the audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about." [...] The later versions of her costumes still required 20 minutes to get into before filming could start, but Ryan said they were much more forgiving, [...] "In the silver costume, if I got goosebumps, you could see them. The brown costume is a thicker, stronger fabric. It's not quite so clingy, so the waist doesn't have to be cinched in." [...] That version of the costume also removed the vertical bones of the corset, which allowed Ryan to have greater flexibility while wearing it.|$|E
