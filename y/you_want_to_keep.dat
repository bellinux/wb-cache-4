500|$|Legia Warsaw goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański was {{the first}} player Arsenal {{recruited}} of the new season. Next to arrive was striker Eduardo, who signed from Dinamo Zagreb, shortly followed by French defender Bacary Sagna. Lassana Diarra was purchased on transfer deadline day from Chelsea, but later transferred to Portsmouth in January after he was frustrated at limited playing time; he said, [...] "I read that the club [...] wanted to keep me.

500|$|However, due to {{construction}} on the Queens Boulevard Line, the G train frequently terminated at Court Square even at times when the published timetable said it ran to 71st Avenue. Some riders were suspicious that the service disruptions were [...] "simply a de facto way to implement the original plan of halving G train service."

500|$|Routine decrees (ferman) or {{titles of}} {{privilege}} (berat) {{were written by}} a scribe, but those written to certain officials and those that were particularly important were preceded by the Sultan's handwritten note beside his seal (tughra). The tughra and the notation might be surrounded by a decorated frame. The note would emphasize a particular part of his edict, urging or ordering it to be followed without fault. These were called Hatt-ı Hümayunla Müveşşeh Ferman (ferman decorated with a hatt-ı hümayun) or Unvanına Hatt-ı Hümayun (hatt-ı hümayun to the title). The note might use a clichéd phrase like [...] "to be done as required" [...] (mûcebince amel oluna) or, [...] "my command is to carried out as required {{and no one is}} to interfere with its execution" [...] (emrim mûcebince amel oluna, kimseye müdahale etmeyeler). Some edicts to the title would start with a note from the Sultan praising the person(s) to whom the edict was addressed, in order to encourage or honor him. Rarely, there might be a threat such as [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> your head, carry out this order as required" [...] (Başın gerek ise mûcebiyle amel oluna).|$|E

60|$|Freddie {{groped for}} his eyeglass, which had fallen again. He {{regarded}} it a trifle sternly. He {{was fond of}} the little chap, {{but it was always}} doing that sort of thing. The whole trouble was that, if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it in its place, you simply couldn't register any sort of emotion with the good old features: and, when you were chatting with a fellow like Wally Mason, you had to be registering something all the time.|$|R
