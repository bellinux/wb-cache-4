500|$|On 23 October, {{he made a}} {{televised}} speech condemning the UAR and expressing his disappointment with Nasser, saying [...] "unity does not mean annexation and the presidential system {{does not mean the}} separation of the ruler from the ruled." [...] He also accused the Egyptian authorities of establishing a system of rule dependent on [...] "1,001 spies" [...] and responsible for sowing division in the republic. Quwatli told the Syrian people they controlled their own destiny, saying [...] "Ranks and titles come and go, but you the people are immortal!" [...] He concluded his speech with self-criticism, stating [...] "I was able to serve your struggle as an ordinary citizen more than I was able to serve <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was president." ...|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E

500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E
500|$|Later reviews were {{generally}} positive. In a retrospective review, Christgau gave Janet an [...] "A–" [...] {{and said that}} although the costly production by Jam & Lewis makes the music sound [...] "more pornographic than obscene", [...] "this achievement is Janet's, period ... Better nose than Michael, better navel than Madonna, better sex than either." [...] Laura Sinagra wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that with janet, Jackson [...] "took more risks" [...] lyrically than on her previous albums. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine notes that the album [...] "was {{at the forefront of}} the increasingly popular sampling trend in the '90s, with one song even employing three different samples as its foundation. Some make perfect sense on a thematic as well as sonic level, like Kool & the Gang's [...] "Kool It (Here Comes the Fuzz)" [...] and Stevie Wonder's [...] "Superwoman, Where Were <b>You</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Needed You" [...] on [...] "New Agenda," [...] or the orchestral flourish from Diana Ross & the Supremes' [...] "Someday We'll Be Together" [...] on [...] "If," [...] which seems to exist for the sole purpose of providing the impetus behind one of the greatest dance-break routines in music video history." [...] Commenting on the album's broad range, he states: [...] "The mother of eclectic, genre-hopping records by Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, janet. incorporates new jack swing, house, pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz, and even opera, but the album's range of styles isn't jarring in the least... Janet has never been one thing and janet. is a feminist statement, to be sure." [...] Alex Henderson of AllMusic offered a positive review, saying [...] "nyone who expected Jackson to top Rhythm Nation—her crowning achievement and an incredibly tough act to follow—was being unrealistic. But with janet., she delivered a respectable offering that, although not as strong as either Control or Nation, has many strong points." ...|$|E

[...] However, the postmark showed Chadron, Nebraska, a few miles south of the Dakota line just off the Indian reservation. McCreight knew Chief Flying Hawk, but did not know that he had any relatives, much less a son. McCreight tells the story: ...|$|E

2500|$|God speaks from a whirlwind. His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor {{enter into}} the {{courtroom}} confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence. Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: [...] "Where were <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> laid {{the foundations of the}} earth?" [...] Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly. In 42:1–6 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge [...] "of things beyond me which I did not know". Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and [...] "therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of I puritani 's success, Bellini was awarded two honours: the first by King Louis-Philippe, naming him as chevalier of the Légion d'honneur; the second by King Ferdinand II in Naples, awarding him the cross of the [...] "Order of Francesco I". Bellini then dedicated I puritiani [...] "To the Queen of the French", Queen Marie-Emélie. But from a personal point of view, Bellini expressed his sadness at not having seen Florimo for so long, and there flowed a succession of invitations, then demands that Florimo come to Paris to visit him, but from February to July, Florimo ignored the offers and finally, in a letter to him, Bellini stated: [...] "I'll no longer ask for reasons, and I'll see <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see you." [...] After that, he attempted to persuade his uncle, Vincenzo Ferlito, to visit, but without success.|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: [...] "I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just {{trying to figure out how}} blue rhymes with <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was writing them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was." [...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they [...] "had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17". They later bought a drum machine [...] "so it would feel like we were more in a band".|$|E

2500|$|His third {{stint in}} prison was after Pakistani President Iskandar Mirza was ousted in a {{military}} coup by General Ayub Khan. The new military regime sought to purge political opponents, which led to Khan {{and hundreds of other}} politicians being disqualified from participating in politics. Wali Khan commented about his imprisonment to Ayub Khan's Information secretary in 1969 shortly after the Democratic Action Committee's conference with Ayub Khan had finished. Gauhar writes that, [...] "Wali Khan narrated how Khawaja Shahabuddin asked him on three occasions during the conference, 'how is it that I never met a bright and able person like <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was Governor of NWFP for three years.' Wali Khan let it pass on the first two occasions but on the third occasion he could not restrain himself and rejoined, 'Because all those three years you kept me in prison!'" [...] This was followed by another brief arrest in 1969 after another military ruler, Yahya Khan, assumed power after Ayub Khan resigned.|$|E
2500|$|Any romantic designs Clairmont {{might have}} had on Shelley were {{frustrated}} initially, but she did bring the Shelleys into contact with Lord Byron, with whom she entered into an affair before he left England in 1816 to live abroad. (A year marked by agricultural failures and widespread European famine, but also of significant literary advances as the Godwin-Shelley-Byron circle holed up indoors, 1816 would later {{be known as the}} [...] "year without a summer".) Clairmont hoped to become a writer or an actress and wrote to Byron asking for [...] "career advice" [...] in March 1816, when she was almost 18. Byron was a director at the Drury Lane Theatre. Clairmont later followed up her letters with visits, sometimes bringing Mary, whom she seemed to suggest Byron might also find attractive. [...] "Do you know I cannot talk to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see you? I am so awkward and only feel inclined to take a little stool and sit at your feet," [...] Clairmont wrote to Byron. She [...] "bombarded him with passionate daily communiques" [...] telling him he need only accept [...] "that which it has long been the passionate wish of my heart to give you". She arranged for them to meet at a country inn. Byron, in a depressed state after the breakup of his marriage to Annabella Milbanke and the scandal over his relationship with his half-sister Augusta Leigh, made it very clear to Clairmont before he left that she would not be a part of his life. But she was determined to change his mind.|$|E
