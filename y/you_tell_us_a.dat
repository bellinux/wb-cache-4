40|$|ABSTRACT The {{identity}} of the teacher-researcher in an early childhood classroom is complex, weighed down with social and cultural perceptions regarding academic research and the education of young children. Certain levels of education, such as a bachelor’s or master’s degree, are considered ‘appropriate ’ and are valued in early childhood educators. However, the degree of doctorate is not considered ‘appropriate ’ for a teacher of early childhood, {{and the desire to}} remain in the classroom while holding this degree is often met with surprise and disapproval. What does this mean in terms of our attitudes toward early education? Do some students warrant a teacher with a doctorate while others do not? This narrative inquiry examines one ‘over-educated ’ teacher’s experience of situating herself within the preschool classroom as both teacher and researcher, both insider and outsider. Triumph and Guilt: the interview I sit in the cool of the school office clutching the phone and trying to act nonchalant. While pacing. And sweating profusely. And praying that the kids don’t come crashing in, saying something inappropriate. Phone interviews are not my favorite things. ‘So can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> bit about your classroom philosophy?’ I sigh, internally, an easy question.

40|$|Brief biography: Dr. Eugenia Etkina, born in Moscow, Soviet Union. Professor in the Physics Department, at Rutgers University, USA. Has 30 {{years of}} {{teaching}} experience in physics and astronomy instruction at middle school, high school and university levels. She earned her Ph. D. in physics education from Moscow State Pedagogical University. In 1995 - 1997 she taught physics courses for students at-risk at Rutgers university (New Jersey, USA), for which she together with Dr. Horton developed a highly successful approach. Her main research interest is in the cognitive and epistemological aspects of learning physics, acquisition and transfer of scientific abilities and the process of constructing physics teacher. Her doctoral students earn Ph. D. s in Learning Sciences, Ed. D. s in Science Education in the GSE and Ph. D. s in Physics Education Research in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Questions for professor Etkina. 1. Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> little about your education as a physics teacher? 2. What kind of things helps a person become a better physics teacher? 3. Why do you use the word “magic” to talk about physics teaching? 4. What that’s mean for you “didactic physics”? 5. What kind of knowledge does a physics teacher need? 6. What would you say to pre service physics teachers, in order to improve their future practice...|$|E

40|$|Purpose/aims Canada’s first {{national}} mental health strategy requires a transformation {{away from a}} singular focus on symptom reduction towards personal recovery: supporting individuals in exercising self-determination, participating in meaningful occupations and relationships, and living satisfying and hopeful lives. The implementation of recovery-oriented care, however, faces two inter-related knowledge gaps that may be addressed by research: (1) how persons diagnosed with mental illness enact their well-being {{in the context of}} their everyday lives; and (2) how to differentiate the conceptualization of personal recovery from how it is experienced distinctively by every person. In this study, I aim to address these associated knowledge gaps by exploring what is revealed as meaningful for individuals diagnosed with mental illness in their first-person accounts of being with and being apart from others, and discussing what these accounts may add to generally understood conceptions of personal recovery such as connectedness (Leamy, Bird, Le Boutillier, Williams, 2 ̆ 6 Slade, 2011). Methods Using a philosophical hermeneutics approach of entering into what is strange and unfamiliar in a text, and of reflecting critically on the choices made during the interpretive process itself (Davey, 2006, pp. 1 - 36), I analyzed and interpreted the collective narrative of five adult participants diagnosed with mental illness. Their collective narrative was generated during a two-hour long focus group that took place as part of a larger participatory action research study focussed on transforming mental health services at an urban hospital towards recovery-oriented care (Park et al. 2014). During these focus groups, participants were asked to tell stories regarding an aspect of recovery (e. g. “Could <b>you</b> please <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> story related to hope?”) and about significant experiences in their everyday lives (e. g. “Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about <b>a</b> time that stands out in your memory?”). Results and implications The philosophical hermeneutics analysis revealed how activities, such as “fighting” and “hiding”, were modes of action that supported the participants’ well-being and empowerment. These actions reveal the agency and intentionality of the participants when negotiating being with or being apart from others. Outlining how I operationalized a philosophical hermeneutics approach, I will also discuss the implications of this hiding and fighting for widening present conceptions of what it may mean to be a “socially-occupied being” (Lawlor, 2003) and how everyday actions are modes of being to both connect to others as well as maintain what Corin (1998) called “positive withdrawal”. Keywords Sociality, philosophical hermeneutics, personal recovery Discussion Questions (1) How could current conceptions of the meaningful activities of personal recovery be widened and nuanced? (2) What are the uses and value of first-person perspectives? For whom? For which purposes? In which settings? (3) How may occupational scientists and researchers uncover and be responsive to unexpected, unacknowledged, or overlooked actions that people diagnosed with mental illness take for their well-being...|$|R
