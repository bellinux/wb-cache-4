Set in and around Jerusalem between Pompey's Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC) and Titus' Siege of Jerusalem (70), it is narrated in four main sections from the perspective of four key figures: Mary, Judas Iscariot, Caiaphas and Barabbas.

PROFESSOR GOLDSTEIN: If this is the effect, it is certainly contrary to everything we propose. First of all, we {{say that it is}} an obligation of state agencies to make every possible effort to maintain children in their own family setting. Second, we urge that every effort be made to maintain the continuity of ties with the family from whom the child has been removed. It is—or at least it should be—a function of foster parents to keep alive these ties and bonds because the primary goal of temporary placement is to restore a child as quickly as possible to the family from which she came...|$|R

After all, isn’t economics just common sense? No, there are factsâ€”which are often surprising and counter-intuitiveâ€”that have been determined only by the special skills of economists. Certainly there are things economists don’t know. But economists can be confident about quite a lot of what they do think they know, even when they are disbelieved by large parts of the public not to mention political leaders and policy makers.
