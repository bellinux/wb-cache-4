500|$|Hassan is Amir's closest {{childhood}} friend. He {{is described}} as having a China doll face, green eyes, and a harelip. Hosseini regards him as a flat character in terms of development; he is [...] "a lovely guy and you root for him and <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> but he's not complicated". The reader eventually discovers that Hassan is actually the son of Baba and Sanaubar, although Hassan never discovers this during his lifetime. Moreover, it would make Hassan a Pashtun according to tribal law and not Hazara as he's actually the son of Baba, and ironic for Assef to bully him as both Assef and Hassan are half Pashtuns. Hassan is later killed by the Taliban for refusal to abandon Amir's property.|$|E
500|$|Gwen's {{father and}} a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of {{distrust}} and the Lizard for his rampage. Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him.</b> In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. I think it's horrible. If <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> couldn't marry him. It's heartless.|$|R
60|$|Ast. As men are apt, {{interpreted}} my words, To all {{the advantage}} he could wrest the sense, As if I meant <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Uncle, if <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> as I do, you couldn't {{tell me to}} be afraid! It's cowardly {{and mean}} to be afraid. You must have forgotten!" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was written}} by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen (formerly of the band Junior Senior), and {{produced}} with Paul Blair (a.k.a. DJ White Shadow) and Fernando Garibay, while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York. The electropop song begins with Gaga's voice uttering the line [...] "It doesn't matter if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> or capital H-I-M" [...] on a loop, backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass. As the synths change into a beat, Gaga belts out the song's first verse, followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion-backed chorus, [...] "I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way", which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being [...] "meant {{to be heard in}} a big space. It's fast and hard-hitting." [...] After the chorus she chants the line [...] "Don't be a drag, Just be a queen" [...] a number of times on top of handclaps, before moving to the second verse. After the second chorus an interlude follows, where Gaga chants the names of various communities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show, Glee, and the song [...] "There But For the Grace of God Go I" [...] by Machine. The music fades out for a moment as Gaga sings a cappella, before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Born This Way" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate dance beat tempo of 124 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major as Gaga's voice spans the tonal nodes of F3 to C5. [...] "Born This Way" [...] follows a chord progression of F5–F–E–B–F in the chorus.|$|E

2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel {{particularly}} envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who [...] "would be that incorrigible kid who could lie to your face, letting you know very well that he's lying, and make <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> for it all the same." [...] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, how is this? But {{two days}} gone {{you told me}} that <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> {{and that there was no}} such god as this man, and no such man as this god." ...|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS. How do I know? Besides, {{you might}} have married <b>him</b> not because <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> but because <b>you</b> didn't <b>love</b> anybody else. When one is young, one marries out of mere curiosity, {{just to see what}} it's like.|$|R
6000|$|As Anne {{knelt on}} one knee to kiss hands with tears in her eyes, the Queen impulsively threw her arms round her neck and kissed her. [...] "Ah, <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> and he <b>loved</b> <b>you,</b> il mio tesorino?" ...|$|R
2500|$|CVG listed {{him as one}} {{of their}} two-hundred reasons to [...] "Love PC Gaming", quoting one of his battle cries ("Go for the eyes, Boo!") for their reasoning. He was listed by MSN Entertainment as one of the [...] "Gaming's unsung heroes", saying he [...] "provides great comic relief and is a fondly remembered man." [...] GameDaily named him one of the Most Lovable Lummoxes in video gaming, stating [...] "Every good party of adventurers in a CRPG needs a tank...In Baldur's Gate, the human ranger Minsc is that tank, and a {{valuable}} asset to the player's quest." [...] Dakota Grabowski of GameZone listed Minsc as the top BioWare created teammate, commenting [...] "His voice-acting was hands-down one of the best attributes of the Baldur's Gate series" [...] and that [...] "BioWare will never surpass their creation of Minsc (and Boo!).". Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer considered him {{to be one of the}} best BioWare characters, saying [...] "If you played Baldur's Gate, one character stood out from the pack. ... Strangely enough, this is what makes <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> all the more." [...] In 2011, Empire ranked him and Boo as the 11th greatest video game character, adding that [...] "Few names bring a wistful smile to the faces of aging PC gamers like that of Minsc and his trusty hamster companion".|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him,</b> dear?" [...] said Miss Frost with emphasis, {{knitting}} her thick, passionate, earnest eyebrows. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> sufficiently? That's the point." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BARLOW. It's the men {{who need}} beating nowadays, not the children. Beat the {{softness}} out of him, young woman. It's the only way, if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> enough--if <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> {{and that is}} why <b>you</b> won't <b>love</b> any one else," [...] cried Clara, who had seen her friend in her moods before; but never {{understood}} them, and thought she had found a clew now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! that's {{just the}} point," [...] {{continued}} her ladyship; [...] "he should be dead to you; to you he {{should now be}} {{just the same as}} though he were in his grave. <b>You</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> some time since, and accepted him; but <b>you</b> found your <b>love</b> misplaced,--unreturned, or at any rate coldly returned. Though <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> <b>you</b> passed a deliberate judgment on him, and wisely rejected him. Having done so, his name should not be on your lips; his form and figure should be forgotten. No thoughts of him should sully your mind, no <b>love</b> for <b>him</b> should be permitted to rest in your heart; it should be rooted out, whatever the exertion may cost you." ...|$|R
6000|$|NED. [His face {{brightening}} instantly, {{leaning forward}} and laying a hand soothingly on hers.] That should {{not make any}} girl unhappy.

5000|$|The {{radio and}} video edit {{of the song}} {{excludes}} the lines [...] "Is he worth all this, is it a simple yes? / Cause {{if you have to}} think, it's fucked / Feels like <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> more, than he <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> / And you wish you’d never met." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very little. In fact, {{only that}} he had told you the way to Westerhouse; but that was quite enough. I {{do not know whether}} you told <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> or not; but it is quite plain to me that you made him think so.

60|$|We say, If <b>you</b> <b>love</b> God, <b>you</b> will obey him; {{which is}} quite true. But what Moses says is truer still, and deeper still. Moses says, If you obey God, <b>you</b> will <b>love</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
