[...] Rankin said that [...] "the concept for the video was 3D" [...] to best portray how [...] "the people look at <b>your</b> <b>relationships</b> with an optimism that can't be seen from the inside."

It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse. But I do think a lot of creativity depends on <b>your</b> <b>relationships</b> with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever. Your personal happiness or unhappiness comes out in your work, it's a reflection of your emotional state and you can't separate the two." ...|$|E
