50|$|High lead logging is {{a method}} of cable logging using a spar, yarder and loader. It was {{developed}} by Oscar Wirkkala. It is accomplished with two lines (cables) and two winches (or cable drums). The mainline or <b>yarding</b> <b>line</b> extends out from one winch, while a second usually lighter line called the haulback line extends out from the other winch to a 'tail block' or pulley at the tail (back) end of the logging site, and passes through the tail block and connects to the main line. Butt rigging is installed where the two lines join and the logs are hooked to the butt rigging with chokers. The procedure is to wind up the main line and the logs are pulled in, wind up the haulback and the butt rigging is pulled out for more logs or another 'turn'.|$|E

50|$|The {{playing field}} of rugby {{is divided into}} halves by a halfway line. An American {{football}} field has a 50 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> which is {{sometimes referred to as}} the midfield line. On an American football field there are a further 18 solid <b>yard</b> <b>lines</b> crossing the field, marked at 5 yd intervals between each goal-line and the 50 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> These lines are named for the distance that they are from the nearest goal line, for example 5 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> 10 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> 35 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> etc. Rugby union pitches have only two further solid lines called the 22 metre lines. They are so called because they are marked 22 m from the goal lines. This unusual distance exists because rugby changed from Imperial units to Metric units in 1977; the line had previously been a 25-yard-line. Interestingly the metric equivalent of 25 yards is 22.86 metres which should round to 23 metres; some sources argue that the reason for rounding down to 22 was to further restrict players within the 1968 25-yard line kicking law; a rule that had been introduced to encourage more running play.|$|R
50|$|On the Rams next {{possession}} {{they drove}} to the Cowboys 43 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Then the Cowboys defense came up with another turnover as Cliff Harris intercepted Ferragamo. The Cowboys offense took over at the 43 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> as the third quarter came to an end.|$|R
50|$|Coleman {{was also}} a talented special teams player. Against Michigan in 1951, he tackled the Michigan kick {{returner}} on the nine <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> on the opening kickoff. Against Ohio State that same year, he tackled the return man at the seven <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> on the opening kickoff.|$|R
50|$|The Wildcats {{would get}} the ball one more time, {{returning}} the ensuing kickoff to their own 37 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Following an offsides penalty which moved {{the ball to the}} 42 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> Northwestern's final play for the end zone was unsuccessful and the Spartans won 41-38.|$|R
50|$|The Rams got {{the ball}} with 4:22 left and Ferragamo {{connected}} with wide receiver Billy Waddy for a 36-yard gain to the Cowboys 44 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> A holding penalty on the Rams pushed {{them back to the}} 46 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> and they ended up punting back to the Cowboys.|$|R
5000|$|Baulk: An {{imaginary}} line {{on which}} a ball is placed for its first shot in the game, or when taking a lift. The A-baulk coincides with the western half of the <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> along the south boundary; the B-baulk occupies {{the eastern half of}} the north boundary <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cowboys offense {{took over}} at the 32 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> with 6:59 left. On the first play Dorsett hit a hole and raced up the middle for a 26-yard gain to the Rams 42 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> From there the Cowboys could not go any further and had to punt.|$|R
50|$|In overtime, the Steelers won {{the coin}} toss {{and got the}} ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an {{interception}} to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26 yards to the Steeler 28 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.|$|R
50|$|Extra {{points were}} {{attempted}} from the 15 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|The opening kickoff was {{received}} by Terrence McGee, who was originally ruled to have gained possession {{at his own}} 1 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> before taking a knee in the end zone. This would have placed the ball at the Bills 1 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> to start the game, however coach Mike Mularkey challenged the play successfully, allowing the Bills to start at their own 20 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> However, the drive stalled just after crossing midfield and Buffalo punted. The Patriots then drove deep into Bills territory behind the running of Corey Dillon, leading to a field goal by Adam Vinatieri. After the teams exchanged punts, Drew Bledsoe was intercepted by Eugene Wilson inside the New England 5 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> The Patriots turned their field position around and drove 92 yards inside the Bills 5 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> but again settled for a field goal. After yet another Bills punt, the Patriots drove down the field with several passes from Tom Brady to David Givens. Brady then finished the drive with a touchdown throw to a wide open David Patten. On the ensuing Buffalo possession, Bledsoe was intercepted by Teddy Bruschi, who returned the ball over 40 yards to the Bills 27 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Three plays later, Brady found Christian Fauria for a touchdown. After the kickoff, Bledsoe was sacked by Tully Banta-Cain making the score 20-0 at halftime.|$|R
5000|$|The Golden Tornadoes' final {{possession}} of the 2009 season began on their own 3 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> with 2:12 remaining in the game. Junior quarterback David Girardi completed a first down pass to Barge for a ten-yard gain. Three incomplete passes resulted in a 4th and 10 for Geneva from their own 13 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Heavy pass rush caused Girardi to scramble from the pocket who then completed a pass to Barge for a gain of 10 and a first down. Another pass to Barge, this time for 14 yards moved the ball out to Geneva's 37 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> A short gain on a pass by Girardi to Thurston moved the ball out to Geneva's 41 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> The Golden Tornadoes then relied [...] "900 Saint Vincent" [...] for a 47-yard gain down to Greenville's 12 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> The play called for Girardi {{to take a few}} steps towards Geneva's bench, asking for a new play. The ball was then directly snapped to running back Matt Barge who then lateralled the ball back to Girardi. Girardi then completed a deep post to Nuetzel for a huge gain. Geneva gained 8 more yards on two short passes to Dean and Thurston. A final incomplete pass led to a 4-2 at Greenville's 3 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> when Nick Dipietro kicked the game-winning field goal with :19 seconds left in the game.|$|R
5000|$|Edmonton {{started using}} a {{receiver}} formation {{known as the}} [...] "five-pack" [...] which had been very effective in the Western final. Quarterback Tracy Ham drove Edmonton from their own 32 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> to the Winnipeg 16. After a procedure penalty, Ham's pass was intercepted by Greg Battle at the 1 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> {{and returned to the}} Edmonton 43. Bomber quarterback Tom Burgess led his team to the Edmonton 14 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> but could not score the touchdown, as his pass was nearly intercepted by Brett [...] "The Toaster" [...] Williams. Trevor Kennard kicked a 14-yard field goal.|$|R
50|$|Staubach {{threw his}} only {{interception}} {{of the game}} when he went deep over the middle from his own 13 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> {{where there was no}} receiver in sight. Redskins safety Mark Murphy came down with the ball and returned it down to the Cowboys 25 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> On the Redskins first play Theismann threw into the end zone for receiver Ricky Thompson. Cowboys safety Cliff Harris bumped Thompson and was called for pass interference. The penalty placed the ball at the Cowboys one <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> where John Riggins scored to give the lead back to the Redskins, 27-21.|$|R
50|$|With Los Angeles leading 37-32 at two minute warning, {{the game}} was {{suspended}} {{for an hour and}} ten minutes due to lightning in the area. When the game resumed, the Rams faced 3rd & 11 at their own 5 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Case Keenum threw an incompletion, and the Rams punted to Tampa Bay. Jameis Winston drove the Buccaneers to the Rams 15 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> in the final minute. With 4 seconds left in regulation, Winston rolled out to his left, but with no receivers open, scrambled 10 yards downfield, and was tackled at the 5 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> to end the game.|$|R
50|$|Kickoff {{was made}} from the 40 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> rather than midfield.|$|R
50|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter Bombers' Roger Savoie hit Hamilton running back Gerry McDougall, causing him to fumble. Bud Tinsley {{recovered}} for Winnipeg at the Tiger-Cats' 43 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Bombers' Farrell Funston took a sideline pass from quarterback Ken Ploen 41 yards to the two <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> From there Charlie Shepard ran for the touchdown.|$|R

50|$|A poor Stanford punt {{from their}} own 7 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> and a 19-yard return from Macgarrett Kings gave Michigan State {{advantageous}} field position at the Cardinal 27 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> A rush for negative yardage and a false start penalty backed MSU up to the Stanford 34 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> On 2nd and 17, Connor Cook completed a 9-yard pass to tight end Josiah Price, making it 3rd and 8. Taking the shotgun snap, Connor Cook hit Tony Lippett over the middle for a 25-yard touchdown pass, giving Michigan State their first lead, 24-17. Stanford was unable {{to pick up a}} first down on their next possession and were forced to punt. The Michigan State offense did no better, after the offensive line allowed a sack on 3rd and long. After a 38-yard punt, Stanford got the ball back at their own 28 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> trailing by a touchdown.|$|R
50|$|The {{second quarter}} started with more punts from both teams. One of Danny White's punts {{went out of}} bounds at the Rams 7 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> The Cowboys defense figured they had the Rams in trouble again so close to their goal line. But behind the running of Wendell Tyler and Cullen Bryant the Rams quickly were able {{to drive to the}} Cowboys 36 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> where they faced a 4th and 1. The Rams decided to go for it instead and {{attempting}} another field goal. They were successful on fourth down and then made the Cowboys pay on the next play. From the 32 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> Ferragamo threw over Cowboys linebacker DD Lewis who was covering Tyler. Tyler caught the pass at the 15 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> and outraced the Cowboys defense to the end zone for the score. The Rams took the lead 7-2.|$|R

50|$|On {{the next}} drive, Washington forced Oregon State into a 4th and 20 {{position}} {{on their own}} 28 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> A Husky rush forced the punter to attempt {{to run for the}} first down instead of punting the ball, being stopped 10 yards short, turning the ball over on downs to the Huskies on the Beavers' 38 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Washington drove to the 8 <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> but then threw an interception in the end zone to give possession back to the Beavers. Oregon State then capped off an 80-yard drive with a 20-yard scramble for a touchdown by Gonzales, and the Beavers led 14-10 at halftime.|$|R
50|$|It didn’t {{take the}} Cowboys defense very long {{to make a}} play as the third quarter got under way. Dennis Thurman intercepted Ferragamo at the Cowboys 46 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> and {{returned}} it to the Rams 34 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> But once again the Cowboys offense could not put a drive together and could {{not take advantage of}} the turnover and had to punt.|$|R
50|$|On the Cowboys second {{possession}} {{they once}} again fumbled the ball away. This {{time it was}} Robert Newhouse who gave {{the ball to the}} Redskins on the Cowboys 45 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> The Redskins drove to the Cowboys one <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> but this time Theismann made sure there would be no field goal attempt as he scored himself, giving the Redskins a 10-0 lead.|$|R
50|$|It {{took only}} two {{plays on the}} Cowboys first {{possession}} before rookie Ron Springs fumbled at the Cowboys 34 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> The Redskins took over {{and drove to the}} Cowboys three <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> On third and goal Larry Cole sacked Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann and forced the Redskins to kick a field goal by Mark Mosley for an early 3-0 lead.|$|R
50|$|The game's first score {{resulted}} from a fumble by Ottawa’s punter Bill Van Burkleo after he slipped in a muddy area of the field. George Reed recovered on the Ottawa's 31 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Saskatchewan got the touchdown when Ron Lancaster passed to Alan Ford from the 27 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Van Burkleo conceded a safety {{to add to the}} Saskatchewan lead.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2009 {{football}} season the field turf {{was dedicated to}} Ernie Davis, the first African American Heisman Trophy winner. The field now reads [...] "Ernie Davis Legends Field" [...] between the 45 <b>yard</b> <b>lines</b> on the home side. Davis's number 44 was also placed along that <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> The dedication {{took place at the}} Syracuse vs. West Virginia game October 10, 2009.|$|R
50|$|With 9:15 {{remaining}} in the game, MSU began their drive {{in an attempt to}} make the game closer. MSU managed to move the ball down to the Bear 11 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> where Cook scrambled for an apparent touchdown. After instant replay overturned the score, Jeremy Langford ran it in to bring the score to 41-35 with 4:55 {{remaining in}} the game. Instead of attempting an onside kick, Michigan State elected to kick the ball deep and put the game in the hands of their defense. Baylor was able to move the ball downfield to the MSU 33 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> and appeared in control of the game when a slant pass to Corey Coleman reached inside the five <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> However, Coleman was flagged for an offensive facemask which brought the ball back to the 22 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> A false start, a short pass to the sideline for one yard, a rush for loss, and a short four yard gain to the flat resulted in a fourth down from the 27 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> With the clock under 1:15, Baylor attempted a 44-yard field goal. During the kick MSU senior defensive end Marcus Rush was able to get a hand on the ball, which resulted in the ball popping up and into RJ Williamson’s hands. Williamson began to return the ball for MSU and was aided by a decleating block on Chris Callahan by Tony Lippett. Williamson returned the ball to the Baylor 45 <b>yard</b> <b>line</b> where he was run out of bounds with 1:06 remaining.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter the Cowboys defense {{shutdown}} the Redskins offense. The Cowboys offense took advantage and scored the only touchdown of the quarter, which gave them their first lead of the game. After a short Redskins punt the Cowboys took over at their own 48 <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> They needed only nine plays, which included a Butch Johnson reverse that gained 13 yards. Preston Pearson took a short pass from Staubach and got the Cowboys to the two <b>yard</b> <b>line.</b> Like Ron Springs in the first half, it was now Newhouse's turn {{to make up for}} his earlier fumble. He scored from the two <b>yard</b> <b>line,</b> giving the Cowboys a 21-17 lead.|$|R

50|$|The <b>yard</b> <b>lines</b> in Canadian {{football}} are {{vitally important}} during game play, because a team's advance is measured against these lines, {{which in turn}} determines ball possession, whereas the halfway, 22 and 10 <b>yards</b> <b>lines</b> only determine the position of players during various rugby union kick-offs (which could be from the halfway line or 22s) or line-out {{in the case of}} the broken line 5 yd from the side lines.|$|R
