On the Bulk Recordings {{edition of the}} album, [...] "halfsharkalligatorhalfman" [...] is preceded by {{an excerpt from the}} comedy film Cabin Boy. Lily Moayeri of Rolling Stone called the album a [...] "psychedelic hip-hop concept album." [...] Allmusic reviewer Steve Huey wrote that the album [...] "shed some light on the burgeoning turntablist revival via the scratching fireworks of DJ Q-Bert" [...] and its [...] "futuristic, horror-soundtrack production seemed {{to bridge the gap between}} hip-hop and the more electronic-oriented trip-hop". Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReviews also praised its sound, writing that [...] "Cuts are provided with infinite skill and precision by DJ Q-Bert" [...] and that the DJ Shadow/Automator remix of [...] "Waiting List" [...] is [...] "so good that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> miss the original, if indeed there was one." [...] An instrumental version of the album was released in 1996 under the title Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats). Kembrew McLeod of Allmusic wrote of the instrumental album, stating [...] "If any other artist released an album such as this it would be considered throwaway trash—something for the hardcore fans. But Dan the Automator's backing tracks are so fresh and original, it's actually nice to just hear the beats minus the rhymes." ...|$|E

Music hall is the toughest thing in the world. ... I often used to get the bird, and I've had pennies thrown at me many a time." [...] Nevertheless, she mastered the genre, according to her biographer Derek Pepys-Whiteley: ...|$|E

The media never had a more {{prolific}} and intrepid source [...] If you weren't around here at the time, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> credit what a threat Duke posed, although he was {{best known as a}} former Grand Wizard in the Klan who had at various times spoken warmly of Adolf Hitler. Duke's meteoric rise obviously signified that plenty of voters shared, or were at least prepared to overlook, his racist views. But he had been at great pains to create a more moderate persona, appearing in natty suits, and adopting the pose of a mainstream conservative politician who happened to have been a 'rascal"'in his long-ago youth. He was glib and, thanks to his plastic surgeon, quite photogenic.|$|E

[...] "Vell, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>'ardly</b> expect," [...] he added, [...] "that a {{child of}} my age should git the profit all at once. I suppose it's like a bad ease o' waxination-- it ha'n't took properly yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was cheering. That {{you might}} get into some scrape or other, we could {{reasonably}} believe; but, as you had your man with <b>you,</b> we <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> suppose that misfortune had fallen upon both of you." ...|$|R

[...] "There is not one person who will dispute that The Backstreet Boys are as corny as a {{heart-shaped}} box of chocolates on Valentine's Day, but like that item, they are a sweet treat. [...] Their boy band dance moves were impressive but definitely giggle-worthy as one could only describe them as over the top. [...] They had four female back-up dancers {{to help with the}} evening's entertainment and more costume changes than a Beyonce concert, but by gosh it was fun to watch." [...] Rebecca Barry (The New Zealand Herald) did not think highly of the band's performance at Auckland's Vector Arena. She wrote, [...] "The band still rely on their old stable of choreographed white-man manoeuvres: it's raining on my face, the lawn mower, side-scissor robot shuffle – and Carter's fans' favourite, slowly-remove-jacket-to-show-off-newly-sculpted-arms. Seriously, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> recognise the guy. Smarmy though he was, his voice soared on ballads such as Incomplete." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian Viglione was {{introduced}} to the drums by his father on Christmas Day at age five with his interest quickly deepening at age nine when rock music became a primary focus and passion. A pivotal moment occurred in 1990 when Viglione's father brought him to see The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine and Viglione witnessed his first up-close exposure to the drummer who would become his principal inspiration on the instrument. [...] "I spent every possible hour jamming with my friends up in our attic from the time I was in the fourth grade through when I graduated high school. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> tear us all away from playing!" [...] At sixteen years old, Viglione began playing gigs in clubs with bands around New England before moving from New Hampshire to Boston in 1999. There, he played with several Boston punk bands on both drums and bass guitar. [...] "I knew it was 'now or never' when I moved from my small town to pursue my dream. Both of my parents understood how dedicated I was to making it come true and I was very lucky to have their encouragement through all of the craziness and uncertainty of those times." [...] Viglione played bass for a year in a and was exposed to music that played a large and influential role in his playing. [...] "I was listening to a lot of Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Black Flag, Swans, Miles Davis, Diamanda Galas, The Gun Club, Einstürzende Neubauten, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane records. Very cathartic music that taught me a lot about the beauty of how to balance using space and aggression in music." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I promised,' {{said the}} visitor, rising, 'that I would write {{to him after}} seeing <b>you</b> (I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> fail to see you sooner or later), and tell him if you were well and happy. I had better say you were well and happy.' ...|$|R

60|$|They {{were on the}} top of the house--a {{great point}} with my aunt, being near the fire-escape--and {{consisted}} of a little half-blind entry where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see <b>hardly</b> anything, a little stone-blind pantry where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see nothing at all, a sitting-room, and a bedroom. The furniture was rather faded, but quite good enough for me; and, sure enough, the river was outside the windows.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Mr Wegg,' said Venus, {{smiling in}} a sprightly manner, 'I suspect <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> guess what I {{am going to}} do next.' ...|$|E

60|$|HE [humbly] Yes: I deserve that. I {{think if}} I {{were going to}} the stake with you, I should still be so happy with <b>you</b> that I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> feel your danger more than my own.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{was very}} {{glad to see you}} as bad as myself, sir," [...] said Mrs. Frederick Langford. [...] "I was very much ashamed of being so foolish, but then, <b>you</b> know, I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> ever read through that scene without crying." ...|$|R

The band broke up that same year by differences between the members and the promotion that offered them the TV channel that manage their career.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right, doctor," [...] {{said she}} soothingly. [...] "I {{am so sorry}} about it. You can have Doctor Horton to-morrow, but I am sure you will allow me to help <b>you</b> to-night. I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> believe my eyes when I saw you by the roadside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! {{my little}} Queen, are you there?" [...] said grandpapa, {{holding out his}} arms to her. [...] "And," [...] added he, [...] "is not this your first {{introduction}} to the twins, grandmamma? Why you are grown as fine a pair as I would wish to see on a summer's day. Last time I saw <b>you</b> I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> tell <b>you</b> apart, when you both wore straw hats and white trousers. No mistake now though. Well, I am right {{glad to have you}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know,' said Newman; 'small things offer--they {{would pay}} the rent, and more--but you wouldn't like them; no, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> be {{expected}} to undergo it--no, no.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I wouldn't; and I'll tell <b>you</b> why. I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> {{marry him}} for love {{at this time}} o' day. And as we've quite enough to live on if we give up the dairy to-morrow, I should have no need to marry for any meaner reason [...] . I am quite happy enough as I am, and there's an end of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I was alluding, Mr. Sapsea,” said Kimber, “to a {{stranger}} who entered into conversation {{with me in}} the street as I came to the Club.

6000|$|Later in the evening, after Mrs. Cadwallader was gone, Celia said privately to Dorothea, [...] "Really, Dodo, {{taking your}} cap off made you like {{yourself}} again {{in more ways}} than one.

6000|$|... 'You must let me {{congratulate you}} now on this {{unexpected}} dawn of hope, after your long trial, my dear brother. It {{is a sort}} of unconscious encouragement <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> hope for.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he--does he--think--WHAT does he think! Tell him--tell him--" [...] Then he sunk down in {{his chair}} limp and weak, and says, so as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> hear him: [...] "Go away--go away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> {{blame the}} boys," [...] he added. [...] "They {{had had a}} hard day, {{and it was not}} the first time Grenfell had done them out of their supper." ...|$|E
60|$|Lifting the lid, however, no {{blaze of}} {{diamonds}} was disclosed, but only, lapped in fleecy cotton, a small, beautifully shaped hand, most delicately sculptured in marble.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{it was not}} kind," [...] he said, {{interrupting}} her. [...] "In fact, it was selfishness. And now I want to {{tell you}} quickly, Miss Asher, while I have the chance, the reason of my coming here to-day. It was not to offer you my congratulations or my sympathy, although you must know that I feel for you and your uncle as much in every way as any living being can feel. I came to offer my love. I have loved you almost ever since I knew you as much as any man can love a woman, and whenever I have been with <b>you</b> I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> hold myself back from telling you. But I was strong, and I did not speak, for I knew you did not love me." ...|$|R
