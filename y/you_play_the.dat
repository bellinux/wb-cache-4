5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game, the rules change three times, so {{it is as if}} you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
500|$|Kristine Sutherland {{appears as}} Joyce Summers, Buffy's mother. Whedon enjoyed {{that she got}} [...] "to play just {{completely}} sexy , because when <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> mom on a show you're sort of relegated to momhood, so {{it was nice to}} see that side of her." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode furthers {{the story}} line of {{deterioration}} of the political balance of the Seven Kingdoms, with Eddard Stark revealing what he has discovered to Cersei Lannister while King Robert is still away on a hunt. The title of the episode {{is part of a}} quote from Cersei Lannister during the final confrontation with Eddard: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground." [...] The catchphrase has been frequently used during the promotion of both the books and the television series.|$|E
500|$|The delays caused Pierre Renoir to {{pull out}} of the film because of prior {{commitments}} to stage plays in Paris. Renoir then asked Michel Simon to play Octave but Simon was busy with other projects. Renoir finally cast himself, later saying that he [...] "was just waiting for the moment when Pierre would say 'Why don't <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> role yourself, Jean?' He didn't have to ask me twice." [...] He added that after having gained experience and confidence as a director his [...] "most stubborn dream has been to be an actor." [...] Renoir rewrote the role of Octave to better suit himself since he and Pierre were physically and personally very different.|$|E
500|$|The album's songs also feature offbeat sounds, improvisational elements, and {{conversational}} vocals {{derived from}} rap. The Revival {{begins with a}} directive from a grave voice: [...] "Play this record as frequently as possible, Then, as it becomes easier for <b>you,</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> record once a day, or as needed." [...] The album also features dialogue between an old lady who asks the group {{whether it will be}} like their last album, on which she was also featured; they respond to her question [...] "No, ma'am". [...] "All the Way" [...] has a scrambling beat, whistle sounds, and the rhythmic call and response [...] "What are we, what are we, what are we? ... Just a bunch of brothers having a party". The end of [...] "Feels Good" [...] features witty jazz keyboard playing behind a lively voice saying [...] "it feels good ... in the hands, feet, bones, heart, and soul". Ed Hogan of Allmusic writes that [...] "the last part sounds like a Sunday morning testimonial." ...|$|E
5000|$|... the {{infection}} system was {{conceived as a}} simulation that had <b>the</b> capacity to <b>play</b> out differently each time <b>you</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> game, leading to potential replayability. However, the game was also very story-led with set-pieces that required specific characters getting infected at certain times. These two aspects were constantly pulling in different directions. I think {{we ended up with}} a slightly messy compromise with good story elements and a genuinely new mechanic but also some logical inconsistencies which, ironically, became glaringly obvious if <b>you</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> game more than once.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm always ready, {{to swear}} off," [...] said the young man, gloomily. He added, [...] "But you've got brains, Bess, and I {{hate to see}} <b>you</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> fool." ...|$|R

500|$|Final Fantasy Adventure was {{featured}} in Nintendo Power when it was re-released in the United States. The game holds an aggregated score of 79.07% approval rating on Game Rankings based on seven reviews. IGN praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music. They additionally praised the game's puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to , though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. RPGFan also praised the game stating it was [...] "possibly {{the best thing that}} ever happened to Gameboy." [...] RPGamer praised the game's plot stating,"The story is one where you can relate to the characters and also the world around them." [...] Ndojo also gave similar praise to the game however noting it being vastly different from Final Fantasy stating, [...] "If you’re expecting Final Fantasy in the traditional sense, you’re going to be disappointed. However, if <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game for a while, you just might find that it’s equally entertaining in its own fashion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bloodnok reappears, {{pursued by}} the Red Bladder, but mysteriously {{transforms}} into Grytpype-Thynne, who announces to Neddie that [...] "we have found Goon Show number 1-6-3, in which <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> lead {{all the way through}} as an underfloor heating detective". [...] Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, this line falls victim to one of Sellers' [...] "fluffs", for which he was notorious, followed by an attack of giggling, another one of his trademarks. [...] After some asides by his castmates, he delivers the line, which plays into a risqué reference to former Goon Michael Bentine. [...] Neddie is then nailed under floorboards for his role, and left there for some months.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Spurrier's {{skills as}} a young {{baseball}} player caused a local businessman to talk the Reverend Spurrier into coaching the Little League team sponsored by his business so that his son {{would be on the}} squad. The younger Spurrier has often repeated an anecdote about playing baseball on a team coached by his father. [...] "How many of you believe that it's not whether you win or lose, but how <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game, that counts?" [...] the elder Spurrier once asked his players. When some raised their hands, he told them, [...] "Well, I don't believe in that saying. If they're keeping score, we're going to play to win." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, Huckabee drew {{endorsements}} from a {{large number}} of religious activists, including Billy McCormack, a pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana, and a director {{and vice president of the}} Christian Coalition of America, founded in 1988 by a previous presidential candidate, Pat Robertson. He was criticized for using a bookshelf that resembled a cross in a Christmas commercial as a form of signaling to Christians, and laughed them off saying [...] "I will confess this: If <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> spot backwards, it says, 'Paul is dead. Paul is dead.'" [...] He also faced a [...] "drumbeat" [...] of questions about the role of faith in his gubernatorial administration and about past statements he made in 1998 about the U.S. being a [...] "Christian nation" [...] in which he said, [...] "I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ." [...] Huckabee told NBC that his comment was not politically incorrect and was [...] "appropriate to be said to a gathering of Southern Baptists". Huckabee has credited God with some of his political success.|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Douglass C. Perry {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.3 out of 10. Although he {{was critical of}} the scripted nature of the infection system, he concluded [...] "the deeper <b>you</b> <b>play,</b> <b>the</b> more satisfying and challenging it becomes, and the more it draws you in. The Thing is well-paced, designed with an excellent variety of levels [...] Everything {{is consistent with the}} movie, the theme of which has been handled with exquisite care and thought. With the exception of the blood test goofs and the rather thin storyline, The Thing warrants your time and money." [...] Steve Polak scored the PC version 8.5 out of 10, writing [...] "The Thing is for the most part an immersive and enjoyable game. The visuals and sound are top notch and the sense of desperation you feel when you are stuck outside and about to succumb to the elements or being hunted by packs of the foul creatures is very real. The squad based elements and the way you keep your men from losing their minds also adds to the depth of the play experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Texas hold 'em (also {{known as}} Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a {{variation}} of the card game of poker. [...] Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" [...] or [...] "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" [...] or [...] "fifth street"). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards. (If a player's best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called [...] "playing the board". If <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.) Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.|$|E
2500|$|At a PAP rally on 7 September, the PAP {{team also}} called to {{attention}} Chee's history in ousting Chiam See Tong as secretary-general of SDP in 1993, {{saying that the}} PAP [...] "did not have a tradition of [...] "backstabbing" [...] its mentors". In response, Chee, {{as well as the}} SDP's Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC candidate Bryan Lim, provided an account of the incidents that led to Chiam’s resignation on the party’s website, saying that Chiam resigned on his own accord. Lina Chiam, the chairman of Singapore People's Party (SPP), confirmed that the two sides had held “friendly talk” on the issue. At the same PAP rally, Sim Ann accused Chee of being adept at [...] "chut pattern", a Singlish phrase meaning being full of antics. Chee responded the following day at a SDP rally by stating that he would not respond to personal attacks and would stay focused on policy issues during the election season, saying, [...] "If you attack, you attack the policy, not the person... In football terms, <b>you</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> ball, not the man." [...] Chee also addressed the different target population figures cited by government officials in the past, including the much debated 6.9 million figure in the Population White Paper, [...] asking if the PAP would consider the SDP's proposal to base the optimal population on the happiness of residents, and a point system when bringing in foreigners for skilled jobs.|$|E
