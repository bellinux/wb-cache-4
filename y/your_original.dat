2500|$|Film sound {{re-recording}} is a time-honored practice. Sound designer Walter Murch {{is known}} for a technique called [...] "worldizing" [...] in which [...] "real world" [...] ambiance is added, via re-recording, to dry recorded program. Sound designer Nick Peck describes the worldizing process: [...] "Place a speaker in a room or location with the desired aural fingerprint and position a microphone {{some distance from the}} speaker. Next, play back <b>your</b> <b>original</b> sounds through the speaker and re-record them on another recorder, capturing the sound with all the reverberant characteristics of the space. This requires much time and effort, but when only the most authentic reproduction will do, worldizing can get you there." ...|$|E
