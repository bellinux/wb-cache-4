Malaysian journalism historian Ahmat Adam, writing in 1995, notes that Lie's entry into the press sparked a wave of peranakan Chinese writers to become newspaper editors, and Sumardjo suggests that Lie remained best known to native Indonesians through {{his work in the}} press.|$|E

The term was extensively used to describe certain major New York City newspapers around 1900 as they battled for circulation.|$|E

25|$|After halting the American advance, the Spanish {{resumed their}} {{withdrawal}} towards Santiago. The battle had cost U.S. forces 17 dead and 52 wounded, while Spanish forces suffered seven dead and seven wounded.

25|$|The War was {{the first}} {{conflict}} in which military action was precipitated by media involvement. The war grew out of U.S. interest in a fight for revolution between the Spanish military and citizens of their Cuban colony. American <b>yellow</b> <b>press</b> fanned the flames {{of interest in the}} war by fabricating atrocities during the Cuban War of Independence, in order to justify intervention in a number of Spanish colonies worldwide, like Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam and the Caroline Islands.|$|E
500|$|Biographer John Watson {{notes that}} Innis's work was profoundly {{political}} while McLuhan's was not. He writes that [...] "the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, {{is the key}} to Innis's work. This also underlies the politicization of Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan." [...] Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. [...] "For Innis, the <b>yellow</b> <b>press</b> of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command." [...] Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the [...] "dialectic of power and knowledge" [...] in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.|$|E

2500|$|Yellow journalism, or the <b>yellow</b> <b>press,</b> is a US {{term for}} a type of journalism that {{presents}} little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines to sell more newspapers. [...] Techniques may include exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering or sensationalism. By extension, the term yellow journalism is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this period}} the {{truncated}} Hungary was {{an ally of}} Germany. In 1937 the Minister of Justice began restricting the great amount of pulp literature and <b>yellow</b> <b>press.</b> In 1938 a decree ordered the whole press {{under the control of}} the Government. In the same year the [...] "First Jewish Law" [...] was issued. Among others the goal of these two were to [...] "clean" [...] Hungary's cultural life, to eliminate pulp literature. As the Újság, a Hungarian extremist newspaper, commented in 1938: [...] "These are not at all capable to nurture Hungarian self-knowledge, Hungarian honesty, Hungarian heroism, consequently to nurture the Hungarian folk, national and racial self-knowledge." [...] Since most of the comics were published in the mostly Jewish owned <b>yellow</b> <b>press,</b> comics vanished after the law took effect. The situation became even worse after the German troops marched into Hungary: all leftist and liberal media was banned. The only comics of the time were antisemitic ones, from magazines as the militant Harc (combat) or anticommunist ones from newspapers as Egyedül vagyunk (we are alone).|$|E
2500|$|Operation Northwoods was {{a series}} of {{proposals}} prepared by Pentagon officials for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962, setting out a number of proposed false flag operations that could be blamed on the Cuban Communists in order to rally support against them.

In an echo of the <b>yellow</b> <b>press</b> headlines of the earlier period, the specific phrase [...] "A 'Remember the Maine incident" [...] was used.|$|E

2500|$|White, in death, was not {{spared the}} frenzy of printed invective, which not only excoriated him as a man, but {{questioned}} his professional achievements as an architect, as well. The Evening Standard concluded he was “more of an artist than architect,” his work spoke of his “social dissolution.” The Nation was also critical: “…He adorned many an American mansion with irrelevant plunder.” The <b>yellow</b> <b>press</b> used lurid language to demonize White as “a sybarite of debauchery, a man who abandoned lofty enterprises for vicious revels.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While Hearst and the <b>yellow</b> <b>press</b> did not {{directly}} cause America's war with Spain, they did inflame public opinion in New York City to a fever pitch. However New York's elites read other papers, such as the Times and Sun which were far more restrained. The Journal and the World were local papers oriented to a very large working class audience in New York City. They were not among the top ten sources of news in papers in other cities, and their stories simply {{did not make a}} splash outside New York City. Outrage across the country came from evidence of what Spain was doing in Cuba, a major influence in the decision by Congress to declare war.|$|E
2500|$|Sari Edelstein {{has argued}} that [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] is an allegory for Gilman's hatred of the {{emerging}} yellow journalism. Having created The Forerunner in November 1909, Gilman made it clear she wished the press to be more insightful and not rely upon exaggerated stories and flashy headlines. Gilman was often scandalised {{in the media and}} resented the sensationalism of the media. The relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper within the story parallels Gilman's relationship to the press. The narrator describes the wallpaper as having [...] "sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin". Edelstein argues that given Gilman’s distaste for the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Press,</b> this can also be seen as a description of tabloid newspapers of the day.|$|E

2500|$|The album has {{received}} mixed reviews from the Turkish media. Some journalists defended Tarkan saying that critics should {{be engaged in}} discussing his music rather than his dressing style, which characterized most of the publicism that appeared {{in connection with the}} release. Columnist Tuna Serim pointed out in one of her articles that there was a definite hunt for Tarkan news in the Turkish media, channels were ready to change their original schedules to feature Tarkan-related news, which are considered to be of primary importance. She also pointed out that the release of a music video is not given primary coverage in television news programmes in any country, while the release of [...] "Vay Anam vay" [...] was featured and discussed in the news programmes in Turkey. Cengiz Semercioğlu of Hürriyet thinks that there is an [...] "anti-Tarkan lobby" [...] in the domestic press, which might have resulted {{from the fact that the}} singer keeps a certain distance from the <b>yellow</b> <b>press,</b> so whatever he does, the press is going to tear into pieces with criticism. In other journalists and critics' opinion this is the worst album he has ever made, repeats himself and there is nothing original in it. There was one critic who refused to comment on the album or even to listen to it. Others do not otherstand what other critics find unacceptable in the album.|$|E
2500|$|Pulitzer, though lacking Hearst's resources, {{kept the}} story on his front page. The <b>yellow</b> <b>press</b> covered the {{revolution}} extensively and often inaccurately, but conditions on Cuba were horrific enough. The island was in a terrible economic depression, and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler, sent to crush the rebellion, herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps, leading hundreds of Cubans to their deaths. Having clamored for a fight for two years, Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came: A week after the United States declared war on Spain, he ran [...] "How {{do you like the}} Journal's war?" [...] on his front page. In fact, President William McKinley never read the Journal, nor newspapers like the Tribune and the New York Evening Post. Moreover, journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to New York City, and that newspapers {{in the rest of the}} country did not follow their lead. The Journal and the World were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers, and the stories simply did not make a splash outside New York City. Rather, war came because public opinion was sickened by the bloodshed, and because leaders like McKinley realized that Spain had lost control of Cuba. These factors weighed more on the president's mind than the melodramas in the New York Journal.|$|E
60|$|People accuse journalism {{of being}} too personal; {{but to me it}} has always seemed far too impersonal. It is charged with tearing away the veils from private life; {{but it seems to me}} to be always {{dropping}} diaphanous but blinding veils between men and men. The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Press</b> is abused for exposing facts which are private; I wish the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Press</b> did anything so valuable. It is exactly the decisive individual touches that it never gives; and a proof of this is that after one has met a man a million times in the newspapers it is always a complete shock and reversal to meet him in real life. The Yellow Pressman seems to have no power of catching the first fresh fact about a man that dominates all after impressions. For instance, before I met Bernard Shaw I heard that he spoke with a reckless desire for paradox or a sneering hatred of sentiment; but I never knew till he opened his mouth that he spoke with an Irish accent, which is more important than all the other criticisms put together.|$|E

60|$|First, I {{would make}} a law, if there is none such at present, by which an editor, proved to have {{published}} false news without reasonable verification, should simply go to prison. This {{is not a question}} of influences or atmospheres; the thing could be carried out as easily and as practically as the punishment of thieves and murderers. Of course there would be the usual statement that the guilt was that of a subordinate. Let the accused editor have the right of proving this if he can; if he does, let the subordinate be tried and go to prison. Two or three good rich editors and proprietors properly locked up would take the sting out of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Press</b> better than centuries of Dr. Horton.|$|E

60|$|It is {{customary}} {{to remark}} that modern problems cannot easily be attacked {{because they are}} so complex. In many cases I believe it is really {{because they are so}} simple. Nobody would believe in such simplicity of scoundrelism even if it were pointed out. People would say that the truth was a charge of mere melodramatic villainy; forgetting that nearly all villains really are melodramatic. Thus, for instance, we say that some good measures are frustrated or some bad officials kept in power by the press and confusion of public business; whereas very often the reason is simple healthy human bribery. And thus especially we say that the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Press</b> is exaggerative, over-emotional, illiterate, and anarchical, and a hundred other long words; whereas the only objection to it is that it tells lies. We waste our fine intellects in finding exquisite phraseology to fit a man, when in a well-ordered society we ought to be finding handcuffs to fit him.|$|E
