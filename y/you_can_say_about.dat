500|$|When {{designing}} the game world, the team initially created a [...] "hybrid city", which producer Dan Houser describes as [...] "a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic" [...] city. Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design {{on a real}} location meant [...] "you {{have a lot of}} things <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it". As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in Grand Theft Auto (1997), basing it loosely on New York City. The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing Brooklyn and Queens, a commercial centre resembling Manhattan, and suburbs similar to New Jersey. The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to [...] "start out feeling poor and work to being richer". Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a [...] "hybrid of a generic American city", including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia. He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously. Sam Houser cited films and shows like Heat (1995) and The Sopranos (1999–2007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game. He also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda series (1986–present) and the film Goodfellas (1990), describing Grand Theft Auto III as [...] "a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG". Dan Houser also cited The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64 as influences.|$|E

[...] In court, the judge Mr Justice Popplewell, caused hilarity by asking Christie to explain the phrase, asking [...] "What is 'Linford's lunchbox?'" [...] The {{reference}} became a part of pop culture, as evidenced in a joke by Nick Hancock: [...] "There's nothing new <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Linford Christie, except he's slow and has got a small penis".|$|E

2500|$|Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, {{described}} Business as Usual: [...] "Aside {{from the}} strength of the music, part of the [...] appeal was its economy. The production sound was low-key, but clean and uncluttered. Indeed, the songs stood by themselves with little embellishment save for a bright, melodic, singalong quality". Gerry Raffaele for The Canberra Times felt [...] " [...] generally stays at a high level, tight and jerky, although I still favour the tracks which have appeared as singles ... There is a delicacy about this music — and that is not a thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> too many rock groups".|$|E
2500|$|Their next single was a re-worked {{version of}} [...] "Down Under", Ham added an improvised flute solo, {{and the group}} had {{revisited}} its tempo and arrangement with McIan. It appeared in October that year and reached No.1 in November, where it remained for sixweeks. Business as Usual was also released in October and went to No.1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, spending a total of nineweeks at the top spot. The Canberra Times Garry Raffaele opined that it [...] "generally stays at a high level, tight and jerky ... There is a delicacy about this music — {{and that is not}} a thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> too many rock groups. The flute and reeds of Greg Ham do much to further that". McFarlane noted that [...] "side from the strength of the music, part of the album's appeal was its economy. The production sound was low-key, but clean and uncluttered. Indeed, the songs stood by themselves with little embellishment save for a bright, melodic, singalong quality".|$|E
2500|$|Leibowitz {{systematically}} dismantled each prosecution witness' story under cross-examination. He got Dr. Bridges {{to admit}} on cross-examination that [...] "the best <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the whole {{case is that}} both of these women showed they had sexual intercourse." [...] Paint Rock ticket agent W. H. Hill testified to seeing the women and the black youths in the same car, but on cross-examination admitted to not seeing the women at all until they got off the train. Posse member Tom Rousseau claimed to have seen the women and youths get off the same car but under cross-examination admitted finding the defendants scattered in various cars {{at the front of}} the train. Lee Adams testified that he had seen the fight, but later saying that he was a quarter mile from the tracks. Ory Dobbins repeated that he'd seen the women try to jump off the train, but Leibowitz showed photos of the positions of the parties that proved Dobbins could not have seen everything he claimed. Dobbins insisted he had seen the girls wearing women's clothing, but other witnesses had testified they were in overalls.|$|E
