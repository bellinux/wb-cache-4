It is believed that Dalrymple conveyed this information to Francis Beaufort, who later refined the wind scale that bears his name and that is still in use today.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Wind {{energy has}} been shown to be one of the most viable sources of {{renewable}} energy. With current technology, the low cost of wind energy is competitive with more conventional sources of energy such as coal. Most blades available for commercial <b>grade</b> <b>wind</b> turbines incorporate a straight span-wise profile and airfoil shaped cross sections. These blades are found to be very efficient at lower wind speeds in comparison to the potential energy that can be extracted. However as the oncoming wind speed increases the efficiency of the blades decreases as they approach a stall point. This paper explores the possibility of increasing the efficiency of the blades at higher wind speeds while maintaining efficiency at the lower wind speeds. The design intends to maintain efficiency at lower wind speeds by selecting the appropriate orientation and size of the airfoil cross sections based on a low oncoming wind speed and given constant rotation rate. The blades will be made more efficient at higher wind speeds by implementing a swept blade profile. Performance was investigated using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

40|$|For over a year, sound {{recordist}} Tom Lawrence has been capturing {{the sounds of}} Pollardstown Fen in Ireland.

Above the water's surface, grasshoppers and crickets stridulate; that is, they rub one part of their body across another to produce 'those fiddling tunes so evocative of summer'. Below the surface, something similar happens as water beetles, water scorpions, great diving beetles, water boatmen and lesser water boatmen and hundreds of other species produce sounds day and night at over 2 Khz, reaching 99 decibels in some cases - the equivalent of sitting in the front row of an orchestra "Tapping, knocking, hammering, drumming, clicking, creaking, cracking, croaking, buzzing, fuzzing, bleeping, <b>winding,</b> <b>reeling,</b> revving, puttering, pattering, humming, pulsing, squealing, shrieking [...] the insects reveal themselves".

40|$|Abstract — A tape {{system is}} {{time-varying}} as tape <b>winds</b> from one <b>reel</b> to the other. The variations in reel radii consist of two components: the nominal reel radii change due to tape <b>winding</b> and the <b>reel</b> eccentricities {{as a result}} of non-circular reels. These variations introduce disturbances in the tape tension. This paper presents a feedforward control that addresses the time-varying reel radius to regulate the tension. The algorithm is {{based on the fact that}} the change of the nominal radius is slow and hence the nominal plant in two consecutive revolutions can be considered as the same. The reel eccentricity disturbance is then repetitive in these two revolutions. We investigate the tension error in the previous revolution and calculate the compensation input that should have cancelled it. The compensation input is interpolated properly and then fed forward to the system in the current revolution. A new compensation input sequence is computed for the immediately following revolution. This computation pattern continues until the end of the tape winding process. Simulation results demonstrate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other recently developed methods. I...|$|R

40|$|Socio-scientific issues (SSIs) are {{challenges}} at {{the intersection}} of science and everyday life that require use of scientific knowledge, argumentation skills, personal values, and morals to articulate science-informed decisions. While addressing SSIs, the ways in which individuals define a problem will influence the solution or decision reached. The problem definition can differ along many dimensions, including content and construal level. A construal is a mental construction of the past and future, other places and people, and unlikely events. Construal Level Theory (CLT) suggests pro-environmental intentions are associated with abstract situations. I explore the application of CLT to teaching and learning about science-informed decision-making through two instructional units: an undergraduate biodiversity SSI (n = 73) and a 6 th <b>grade</b> <b>wind</b> energy SSI (n = 116). Data collected included student artifacts and, for the undergraduate study, a survey on value orientations. Research questions explore how students problematize each SSI topically and along a continuum from concrete to abstract and how their problematization is related to the decision-making processes and their ultimate decision. In the undergraduate population, students’ abstract and concrete problematizations was related to values they chose to use as criteria in their decision-making processes, however it did not predict their decisions. In the 6 th grade population, abstract and concrete problematizations and perceptions of the wind turbine were associated, but there was no association with their decisions. Advisers: Cory T.

50|$|In both types, a {{particular}} gear combination {{can only be}} engaged when the two parts to engage (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for the next gear are at a proper speed to engage. The vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the <b>grade,</b> <b>wind,</b> and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used {{to speed up the}} engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for engaging the next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the clutch, shift to neutral, then engage the clutch momentarily to force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to the next gear, a process called double clutching. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with the clutch engaged to the engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.|$|R

40|$|A five pole, one slot per phase, full pitch, twelve coil, wye connected, {{three phase}} linear {{induction}} pump {{has been designed}} for operation with 400 C sodium. The design incorporated a <b>graded</b> <b>winding</b> {{in order to reduce}} the net pulsating component of the magnetic flux density wave and a pump duct using copper side bars. The small laboratory-size pump was designed in two steps: stator design and winding design. First, the stator and core dimensions were established on the basis of maximum pressure development and maximum power at the design flow and slip. Maximum pressure output was a requirement of the intended pump application. The condition of maximum power output was used in order to provide a good pump efficiency. Second, the parameters for the induction pump equivalent circuit were determined for several winding methods. The winding method which offered 3920 ampere turns per phase (equivalent to a flow rate of 4. 88 gpm, a pressure of 60 psi, a line voltage of 250 volts, and a wave length of 21. 2 cm as calculated in the first step) was selected. The theoretical performance characteristics of the flat induction pump were computed using the equivalent circuit parameters for a winding with 60 turns per coil. The measurement of developed pressure (0 to 42. 13 psi), sodium flow rate (0 to 9. 93 gpm), and power input (0 to 103. 9 watts) after installation of the pump in an operational sodium circulating loop provided an experimental determination of the pump performance characteristic.
