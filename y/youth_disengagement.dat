Employing counterstories and Youth Participatory Action Research (YP AR) methods, study participants reported that violent and traumatic home and community environments; assuming jobs and parental roles; lack of caring teachers and non-culturally relevant curriculum and pedagogy contributed to their school <b>disengagement.</b> <b>Youth</b> in the study indicated that caring teachers and adults and experiences creating art would support their re-engagement in schools.

40|$|Media {{research}} has {{long known that}} those who produce content and those who receive it construe textual meaning differently. Such differences may be interpreted in political, cultural, institutional and psychological terms. However, the insights from audience reception and ethnographic studies have yet fully to inform research on responses to online content. This article addresses attempts to overcome <b>youth</b> civic <b>disengagement</b> through the design and promotion of public sector, Internet-based content and services. Specifically, it integrates interviews with website producers and teenage users to compare and contrast the encoding and decoding processes in an exemplar website (www. epal. tv). An analysis in terms of genre reveals a range of communicative challenges for website producers in terms of subject matter, formal composition and mode of address. Further, critical questions arise {{in relation to the}} action consequences of online participation, interface design as this relates to teens' Internet literacy, and the power relations instantiated between producer and user. It is concluded that audience studies can constructively be extended to the analysis of Internet use and, substantively, that the policy challenge lies less in the question of whether youth is civically engaged and more in the question of who will listen to youth if and when they do become so engaged...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} {{in recent years in}} the labour market issues that youth face. <b>Youth</b> exclusion, <b>disengagement,</b> and overall underutilisation in the labour market has short term costs to the economy, as well as long term impacts on society. The consequences range from reduced economic productivity to increased criminal activity. We document a {{rise in the number of}} NZ youth classified as not in employment, education or training (i. e. NEET). This trend signals increasing difficulties for young people making the transition from education into the labour market. In this report we project the loss to productivity, measured in foregone wages, and the expected cost to public finances for Auckland and NZ NEET as at December 2012. We focus on youth aged 15 - 24 years, and where data are available report separately for 15 - 19 and 20 - 24 year olds. We find the expected per capita cost of each NEET youth aged 15 - 24 in the Auckland cohort to be approximately $ 28, 981 over the next 1 - 3 years. The estimated cost is slightly higher than comparable costs for the aggregate group of NZ NEET, due largely to the higher foregone wages of Auckland NEET. Disaggregating our analysis by ethnicity, we find that Auckland NEET youth of Maori and Pacifica descent are associated with a relatively high per capita cost at roughl...|$|R

40|$|Young people’s mode of {{political}} participation {{in recent years}} has been an object of concern and debate among political scientists and youth researchers. Research-based evidence has shown that many of them are not interested in politics like the youth of yesteryears. This trend has been described as “youth de-politisation” or <b>youth</b> political <b>disengagement.</b> Young people are said to now find comfort in pleasure and “protest politics” which often do not lead them to political positions in government or in governance institutions. Some researchers have thus described them as a ‘protest generation’ in contrast to the ‘political generation’ of their parents and grandparents. This could have crucial political implications in the future, more so because a large proportion of the world’s population today consists of young people as the UN has documented. This paper thus seeks to examine these political implications (which have received little attention from researchers) from two theoretical perspectives: political science and youth studies. Questions as to whether this alleged growing youth de-politisation is jeopardizing or will jeopardize future democracy and governance, especially from the point of view of competent political leadership, or if it is merely a replacement of traditional and/or institutional forms of politics by young people with new patterns of expression and participation that some researchers term ‘juventization’, is examined. The cause(s) of this depolitisation is also looked into, and suggestions about youth participation in the future are made...|$|R
40|$|Across the Western world, many democracies {{are facing}} the same problem as Canada – youth civic engagement, {{knowledge}} and attentiveness to the political realm are in sharp decline. This reality creates a difficult situation for policy makers and politicians alike, as disengagement to this degree has never been experienced before. In Canada, youth voter turnout is at all time lows, with no signs of rebounding. More and more, young people today lack both the {{skills they need to}} engage with the political system and the interest to do so. There are some attempts being made across the country to help improve upon this through high school civics education, but they lack the appropriate pedagogy and sufficient support from politicians and governments at large. Though, in Ontario civics education does exist and through a discussion of the policy process and agenda setting, its presence will be considered in terms of how it passed through policy channels {{to become a part of}} the high school curriculum. Furthermore, research has shown that <b>youth</b> civic <b>disengagement</b> is a very real problem across Canada and led to some experts calling today’s youth political dropouts. Without action to bring more young people back from their apathetic stand, our democracy will face crucial challenges with regard to participation at the polls and maintaining an informed and active citizenry into the future. However, new approaches have been applied in other jurisdictions and have shown some success, offering frameworks for Canada to consider...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} political {{efficacy and}} youth non-voting in New Zealand. Drawing from {{a focus group}} discussion and depth interviews with 20 young people, I compare and contrast the attitudes and experiences of 18 - 24 year-old voters and non-voters. I assess whether the theory of political efficacy is a useful conceptual tool for distinguishing between their attitudes, and evaluate the ability of efficacy theory to explain youth non-voting in New Zealand. The thesis {{draws attention to the}} oft-overlooked benefits of using qualitative methods to conduct political science research. Based on my research, I find that the standard (quantitative) operationalisation of efficacy obscures the complex and nuanced nature of young people's thoughts about politics. Depth interviews and focus groups are found to be valuable means to gain insight into the political attitudes of young people, as - unlike quantitative methods - they allow participants to elucidate themselves using language and ideas of their own. A purposive sampling strategy using snowball referrals also proved to be a useful way to recruit young non-voters, indicating to future researchers that such an approach may {{be a good way to}} access disengaged populations. Contrary to the predictions of efficacy theory and to the findings of research in the quantitative tradition, I find fewer differences between young voters and non-voters than expected: the interviews and focus group in fact reveal surprising similarities in the political efficacy of young voters and non-voters. Through my research I identify three types of young non-voters: 'disinterested', 'inconvenienced' and 'principled' non-voters, each of whom give different and diverse explanations for their non-participation. These findings suggest that the usefulness of efficacy theory as an explanation for youth non-voting may have been overstated, and my research highlights the need to remain open to other explanations for <b>youth</b> electoral <b>disengagement</b> - such as rational choice and post-materialist theories...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} young women participating in anarchist and environmental activism within the UK {{as a means of}} exploring the relationship between youth, gender, and political participation in a postfeminist, neoliberal context. Recent scholarship has identified young women as the ideal subjects of neoliberalism, where flexibility and reflexivity are prized and rewarded. Young women have been presented with new subject positions and forms of citizenship engagement but these are, for the most part, individualised and depoliticised. Concurrently theorists have warned of an impending crisis of democracy precipitated by <b>youth</b> political <b>disengagement,</b> while governments have condemned ‘incorrect’ or ‘disruptive’ forms of youth civic engagement. This thesis intervenes in these debates by exploring the significance of social movement participation for young women in contributing to their political agency and gendered subjectivity. The research utilised a qualitative feminist methodology, analysing data from 20 semi-structured interviews, three diaries completed by interview participants, and 200 hours of participant observation. The thesis finds little evidence that young activist women are individualised or disengaged. Instead, their participation in collective action and their identification as feminists contribute to my theorisation of them as ‘wilful women’, whose conscious, reflexive political engagement marks them apart from individualised neoliberal subjects. Through a relational, feminist political agency they are able to reframe femininity as active and compassionate rather than passive and compliant, and engage politically on this basis. The study also finds that the non-hierarchical organisational structures of activist organisations effectively contribute to the creation of anti-oppressive pedagogic strategies for confronting inequality within activist cultures. This thesis makes an original contribution by developing a set of theoretical concepts that enable an understanding of the means by which young activist women construct dissident, wilful gendered subjectivities that confront sexism and inequality both within their own activist communities and within society at large...|$|R

The link between these two seemingly disparate texts is the issue of <b>youth</b> homelessness and <b>disengagement.</b> What makes each text inherently problematic is that the protagonists in each are young men from African-Australian backgrounds –a group who have been subjected to a huge amount of racial essentialism and negative stereotyping in the media. While the first text claims to ‘faithfully reproduce’ the voices of the young interviewees the second is blatantly subjective –an auto/biographical record of my attempt to parent a young Sudanese-Australian.

Fundamentally, we strongly assert that engagement research needs to adopt a more critical stance that provides students with opportunities to examine and to critique the educational system in which they participate (or sometimes refuse to participate).

40|$|When I first {{considered}} {{the topic of}} Generation X in India seriously at the editor’s request, I was assailed by doubts about the meaningfulness of a study that worked from the barest stereotype {{in an attempt to}} delineate any aspect of social life in a contemporary nation of the global south. India’s presence in a variety of online literatures from those on development or politics to those on trade and the economy is shadowed by clichés—the “fastest growing market” with “a middle class of 50 million,” the “second-largest” economy in the developing world, the “biggest democracy,” “friend” of the US and Europe in the fight against global terror, and so on. Similarly the presence of youth in academic and policy literatures the world over has been tainted by journalistic pronouncements about declining participation levels, civic disengagement, individualism, risk culture, remix culture, hybrid identities, and a postmodern, global cultural sensibility. Academic articles on Indian cultural production and circulation often open with implicitly homogenizing assertions: “The times they are a-changing! For India, these are historic times. Her long-established and often fiercely guarded traditions are undergoing rapid and sweeping transformations as she flexes her muscles to compete in a global economy” (Chakravorty 112). In my research on both media cultures in India and youth cultures across South Asia and the UK over the past decade these clichés have proved more a burden than a guide. They have clearly worked in the interests of some and against the interests of others. So, whose interests have they served? Numerous academic papers, projects, and studies have been funded and spawned by the notion of a risk society and <b>youth</b> civic <b>disengagement</b> and voting decline. Talk of generational breaks and intergenerational rifts, McDonaldized youth culture as well as of patterns of youth consumption can clearly serve the interest of marketers who play on notions of “cool” and “hip” regardless of the context. Counter-arguments—suggesting continuities between generations and heterogeneity within generations, cross-cut as they are by class, ethnicity, ability, religion, age, nationality, gender, and sexuality—are briefly heard and then strenuously ignored. At times it even seems that both academics and marketers are colluding to create the absurdly impossible phenomenon of which they speak: distinct generations with distinct characteristics, the world over. And this, unfortunately, means that real distinctions drawn in India by people campaigning on or researching issues of labor, class, gender, or religious discrimination between the everyday experiences of the powerful few and the exploited many, are being ignored in favor of clichés. With regard to India, for instance, {{it is not uncommon to}} hear that “everyone is now connected” so “let’s move it online. ” What these businesses mean is that “everyone who matters in terms of service capital” is now connected: the upper middle classes, to be precise. ...|$|R
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy on 5 th July 2012, available online: [URL] Sport/physical activity interventions are sometimes viewed as a panacea for youth-related social problems, and this may explain their proliferation. Yet, there is little robust evidence to support some of the claims made for the efficacy of such programmes, particularly those relating to sustained benefits for young people. Aims: The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report findings from longitudinal research on two youth sport/physical activity interventions in the UK in order identify key features in their design that were found to be central to sustained positive impact. Method: Two physical activity programmes that sought to address <b>youth</b> disaffection and <b>disengagement</b> were evaluated by one research team using a similar evaluation strategy. Between 2003 and 2007 (years 1 - 4 of each programme), over 10, 000 young people participated in the programmes (HSBC/OB and SSLfS). Impact data were collected on over 50 % of all SSLfS pupils engaged in the programme nationally (n = 4700) and 90 % of HSBC/OB pupils from the five participating schools (n = 540). An evaluation framework was designed based on a range of detailed, individualised methods including: individual pupil profiling, school-level case studies and the creation of programme logic models. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, profile comparisons and a constructivist revision of the grounded theory method. Results: Data on sustainability of impact on young people are reported from each project and the findings are considered together to identify common themes. Data suggest that six key features should be embedded in the design of physical activity/positive youth development programmes: matching pupils' specific needs with programme objectives; locating project activities outside of the 'normal' school context; working closely with pupils to choose activities, set targets and review progress; establishing positive relationships between leaders, mentors and pupils; offering young people the opportunity to work with and for other young people; and making available structured pathways to enable young people to have sustained involvement in further project or complementary activities. Importantly, what these data illustrate is that in combination and through complex interaction, these six design features can maximise the potential for sustained positive impact on youth participants. Conclusions: These data offer insights into the mechanisms that can lead to positive impact from physical activity/sport interventions/programmes. Perhaps more importantly, the findings illustrate the complex ways in which these different mechanisms interact to produce positive outcomes. © 2013 Copyright Association for Physical Education...|$|R
40|$|Over recent years, {{politicians}} and social commentators {{in many countries}} of the world have become concerned with what is perceived to be young people’s declining engagement within the political sphere. There is certainly strong evidence that turnout in national elections has fallen markedly among the youngest age groups.

Moreover, in 2005, when turnout in general rose slightly, it continued to decline for the 18 - 24 age group and remained the same for 25 - 34 year olds (Phelps 2005). Similar trends have been observed in other countries.

Service learning is a democratic, constructivist, instructional strategy that connects academic learning with community needs. This phenomenological study described: (a) how youth, their educators, and community partners who experience service learning perceive its effects on themselves, their schools, and their community lives and (b) how professional-development opportunities need to be structured in order to encourage high quality civics education instruction. The problem this study addressed was how to solve youth civic and political disengagement. This study relied heavily upon in-depth interviews of nine middle school students, six middle school educators, and one community partner from a rural community in the northeastern United States. In addition, participant journals and grant documents were reviewed.

You might {{put up with it}} for awhile. You would likely develop resentment about the situation. Eventually, as an adult, you might confront your friend and explain your feelings and try to change things. If they didn’t change, in all likelihood, you would simply stop going to the movies with them. For children and young people in schools, the school curriculum is like being forced to go to the movies, to see things they often don’t like or can’t see the point of, but where {{they do not have the}} adult prerogative, legally at least, of simply not going to school. Trapped in schools with an unresponsive curriculum, feelings amongst young people towards school can and frequently do include resentment, apathy and disengagement. Every teacher commonly experiences these feelings amongst their children, and not just amongst the children who are the lowest academic achievers. We should not underestimate the power of an unexplained and unresponsive curriculum as a factor in child and <b>youth</b> <b>disengagement</b> from school. Nor should it be underestimated as an explanation for any perceived decline in international education standards among western nations where, in most facets of life, young people influence and exercise considerable choice in most other areas of their lives expect in school. • Steve Wilson is an emeritus professor at Western Sydney University, and an adjunct professor in the university’s School of Education...|$|E
40|$|Background: In March 2015 a Working Group was {{established}} by Andrew Neophytou (CEO, Inner Eastern Local Learning & Employment Network) {{on behalf of the}} Inner Metro Youth and Community Partnership (IMCYP). This Working Group was formed to discuss and consider actions around youth transitions and pathways, as a response to worrying levels of <b>youth</b> <b>disengagement</b> and unemployment, whether viewed from a regional, state or national perspective. Part of the impetus behind the Group’s formation was concern for the wellbeing of young people (largely but not exclusively those aged 15 and over) who were at risk of disengaging from education, or were already disengaged. Like the IMYCP, e 2 e has these aims: 	Advocacy and strategic input and advice to government about children and young people, and the organisations that support them 	Sharing information and research around transitions and pathways 	Building relationships with key stakeholders to develop a cross-sectoral response to address issues relating to transitions and pathways 	Identifying potential pathways and referral options for young people that are most at risk 	Providing best-practice examples / models for work and professional development. A dozen stakeholder organisations / bodies have embraced these aims, and form the nucleus of the e 2 e Working Group: Representatives from the following stakeholders form the nucleus of e 2 e: 	Ardoch Youth Foundation 	Capital City LLEN 	City of Stonnington – Youth Services 	Education Engagement Partnership (EEP) 	Inner Melbourne VET Cluster (IMVC) 	Melbourne City Mission (MCM) / SKYS 	Melbourne Polytechnic 	Prahran Community Learning Centre (PCLC) 	SouthPort Uniting Care (SPUC) 	Taskforce Community Agency 	Victoria Police As a first step, this Working Group agreed to develop a Discussion Paper. This Paper, completed in late July 2015, provides key reflections arising out of discussions the network members have had, and the reading we’ve done.   This discussion paper is intended for a broad readership.  It includes some introductory pages (eg background; a note about terms and definitions used; statistics; and five principles for smarter thinking and investment).  The bulk of the paper covers eleven themes, each followed by a number of recommendations (averaging about six per section), which are aimed for a range of stakeholders, including government departments, peak bodies, and NFP organisations.    The eleven themes are: policy; consultation; funding / youth specific programs; workforce strategy – including professional learning; partnerships – including with industry; education disengagement; VCAL & VET; disabilities; “middle years”; abuse and trauma; and diversion.  ...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Collin, P. (2009) The Making of Good Citizens: Participation policies, the {{internet}} and youth political identities in Australia and the United Kingdom. PhD Thesis, University of Sydney. Abstract This thesis examines the relationship between youth participation policies, {{the internet}} and young people’s political participation. In recent times youth participation policies have become an increasingly popular solution {{to a range of}} perceived ‘issues’ related to young people: either problems of <b>youth</b> <b>disengagement</b> from democracy or their exclusion from democratic processes. At the same time, young people’s lives are increasingly mediated by information communication technologies: identity, social relationships, learning and cultural, political and economic practices are embedded in {{the internet and}} mobile usage. Consequently, the internet is being increasingly utilised to promote and implement the aims of these youth participation policies. Despite the need to understand the relationship between policy and practice, research rarely considers the relationship between policy, practice and young people’s views and experiences. This thesis addresses this gap in the literature by looking at what participation means in youth policy, in the practice of non-government organisations and for young people themselves. It engages directly with young people’s experiences and in doing so moves beyond questions of mobilisation and reinforcement. Instead it examines the diversity of ways in which young people conceptualise and practice participation, both online and offline. It also relates their views and actions to broader changes in governance and democracy and draws on contemporary theories of political identity and citizenship {{to make sense of the}} way that young people view, and exercise, citizenship. This study draws on original qualitative research generated in a comparative study of Australia and the United Kingdom. The experiences of young people in two national non-government organisations are studied and explored in relation to the policy discourses on youth and participation in each country setting. This study has drawn on participant observation, document analysis and in-depth interviews with twenty four young people and eight executive staff and board members across the two country settings. This thesis provides an in-depth account of how young people conceptualise and practice politics. In doing so, it argues, firstly, that the political identities of young people are shaped by dominant discourses of youth and participation and that youth participation policies are transforming the ways that young people conceptualise participation and engage in participatory activities. Although participation policies are often intended to connect young people to government policy making processes, young people remain cynical about the interest and ability of governments to recognise and respond to their views. They see governments and politicians as remote from their lives and the issues they cared about. Comparatively, they demonstrate a passionate commitment to causes, to personally defined acts incorporated in their everyday lives through local volunteering and contributing to national initiatives. Furthermore, these young people reject traditional hierarchies, show significant commitment to action over ideology and value the cultural and interpersonal dimensions of participation. They often conceptualise participation as everyday acts through networks that transcend traditional models of membership-based organisations, of state-oriented politics, of locally-based action and of formal and informal policy making processes. Secondly, young people use the Internet for a diverse range of participation activities. The internet facilitates activities which bring together the political, cultural, social and economic dimensions of young people’s lives. For instance, participatory activities, friendships, study, hobbies and consumer activities were often interwoven as young people discussed participation. However, the picture that emerged in this thesis is that the agency and autonomy that young people value in online participation contrasts starkly with government policies which favour structured, managed, prescribed processes for youth participation both on and offline. Thirdly, whilst participation policies have opened up new access points to policy-making from which young people have traditionally been excluded, they tend to legitimise managed forms of participation and de-legitimise others. Consequently, participation policies, in their present form, tend to exacerbate, rather than remedy problems of elitism and can further alienate young people from political elites. Furthermore, as discourses of participation are becoming more prevalent in the non-government sector, young people are increasingly oriented away from government towards other actors. This thesis finds that young people are becoming more, not less, alienated from formal politics as they find more resonance in non-government processes and feel more excluded from the processes of government...|$|E
