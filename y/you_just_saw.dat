At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard {{is going to make it}} all the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E

Though in duty bound, as young patriots, to jeer at him for having been born in the wrong place, the pupils of his own age could not resist the charm of his reminiscences; even Gav Dishart, a son of the manse, listened attentively to him. His great topic was his birthplace, and {{whatever}} happened in Thrums, he instantly made contemptible by citing something of the same kind, but on a larger scale, that had happened in London; he turned up his nose almost farther than was safe when they said Catlaw was a stiff mountain to climb. ("Oh, Gav, if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> the London mountains!") Snow! why they didn't know what snow was in Thrums. If they could only see St. Paul's or Hyde Park or Shovel! he couldn't help laughing at Thrums, he couldn't--Larfing, he said at first, but in a short time his Scotch was better than theirs, though less unconscious. His English was better also, of course, and you had to speak in a kind of English when inside the Hanky School; you got your revenge at [...] "minutes." [...] On the whole, Tommy irritated his fellow-pupils a good deal, but they found it difficult to keep away from him.|$|E
60|$|There are {{now some}} other points that I must bring before you. Many {{of the flames}} you see here vary very much in their shape by the {{currents}} of air blowing around them in different directions; but we can, if we like, make flames {{so that they will}} look like fixtures, and we can photograph them--indeed, we have to photograph them--so that they become fixed to us, if we wish to find out everything concerning them. That, however, is not the only thing I wish to mention. If I take a flame sufficiently large, it does not keep that homogeneous, that uniform condition of shape, but it breaks out with a power of life which is quite wonderful. I am about to use another kind of fuel, but one which is truly and fairly a representative of the wax or tallow of a candle. I have here a large ball of cotton, which will serve as a wick. And, now that I have immersed it in spirit and applied a light to it, in what way does it differ from an ordinary candle? Why, it differs very much in one respect, that we have a vivacity and power about it, a beauty and a life entirely different from the light presented by a candle. You see those fine tongues of flame rising up. You have the same general disposition of the mass of the flame from below upwards; but, in addition to that, you have this remarkable breaking out into tongues which you do not perceive {{in the case of a}} candle. Now, why is this? I must explain it to you, because when you understand that perfectly, you will be able to follow me better in what I have to say hereafter. I suppose some here will have made for themselves the experiment I am going to shew you. Am I right in supposing that anybody here has played at snapdragon? I do not know a more beautiful illustration of the philosophy of flame, as to a certain part of its history, than the game of snapdragon. First, here is the dish; and let me say, that when you play snapdragon properly, you ought to have the dish well-warmed; you ought also to have warm plums and warm brandy, which, however, I have not got. When you have put the spirit into the dish, you have the cup and the fuel; and are not the raisins acting like the wicks? I now throw the plums into the dish, and light the spirit, and you see those beautiful tongues of flame that I refer to. You have the air creeping in over the edge of the dish forming these tongues. Why? Because, through the force of the current and the irregularity of the action of the flame, it cannot flow in one uniform stream. The air flows in so irregularly that you have what would otherwise be a single image, broken up into a variety of forms, and each of these little tongues has an independent existence of its own. Indeed, I might say, you have here a multitude of independent candles. You must not imagine, because you see these tongues all at once, that the flame is of this particular shape. A flame of that shape is never so at any one time. Never is a body of flame, like that which <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> rising from the ball, of the shape it appears to you. It consists of a multitude of different shapes, succeeding each other so fast that the eye is only able to take cognisance of them all at once. In former times, I purposely analysed a flame of that general character, and the diagram shews you the different parts of which it is composed. They do not occur all at once: it is only because we see these shapes in such rapid succession, that they seem to us to exist all at one time.|$|E

50|$|Look {{away from}} the {{sometimes}} aggressively showy filmmaking and an ill-advised stab at screwball comedy {{in the second half}} (involving a Sivaji Ganesan fan), and you have some solid writing. I'm not usually a fan of narratives that stop periodically to reveal that what you thought <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> wasn't really what happened but the reveals here are cleverly done and they come together convincingly. The return of an actor-aspirant from the early parts of the film is an especially nice touch.What Naalu Peruku lacks is that certain something that sets a Soodhu Kavvum apart. But I liked the fact that the moralising is kept to a minimum, and there's no lecturing. When a desperate Prabhu tries to rob a restaurant owner, he discovers that his father works as a security guard there. In a lesser movie, he'd slap his head and transform into a good man. Here, he just becomes... less bad than he would have been without this discovery. Sometimes, a true-to-life touch like that is enough.|$|E

This depiction of the imperceptible invites comparison to contemporaneous photographs of extremely short periods of time: attempts to capture flying cannon balls (Thomas Kaife), to take flashlight portraits of patients that would undermine their bodies ’ reaction time (Albert Londe), to visualize the successive stages of a drop falling into water (Arthur Worthington).

This presentation aimed to share data analysis experiences of a team of researchers in a mathematics education study using three- tiered modeling research as a methodologic orientation. This study had three tiers: Tier 1 -Pre-service mathematics teachers, Tier 2 - A team of researchers, and Tier 3 -Principal researcher. The team of researchers in Tier 2 composed of four researchers having different interests and teaching experiences as well as different knowledge of and skills in qualitative inquiry, which brought different perspectives to the data analysis. Furthermore, their researcher positions vary on the insider-outsider continuum with respect to the data. While one researcher collected the data, two of them produced the data which was going to be analyzed. On the other hand, the data was alien to the fourth researcher; that is, his first interaction with the data was at analysis process. In this study, I will present the experiences these researchers by addressing the following research question: “How is it different to analyze your own data, the data you collected and an alien data that <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> at the analysis phase?” Both advantages and disadvantages of being various proximities to the data are going to be discussed and exemplified with researchers’ narratives.
