500|$|MacLachlan did {{not like}} the bomber training. In a letter to his mother he {{described}} his grievances, [...] "We have started bombing today. It's awful! You have to lie on <b>your</b> <b>belly</b> and look through the trapdoor {{in the bottom of the}} plane [...] All the hot oily air from the radiator blows straight into your face. It makes me feel quite sick!". He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live-munitions, but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air-to-air gunnery. He wrote of his training, [...] "I have been doing air-to-air gunnery with the front guns today. It is super!" [...] Live ammunition was used at the end of the training. MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs, which cost £1 1s each.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known chemical {{evidence of}} barley beer dates to circa 3500–3100 BC {{from the site}} of Godin Tepe in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer; examples include a prayer to the goddess Ninkasi, known as [...] "The Hymn to Ninkasi", which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people, and the ancient advice (Fill <b>your</b> <b>belly.</b> Day and night make merry) to Gilgamesh, recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh, by the ale-wife Siduri may, at least in part, have referred to the consumption of beer. The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC. A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike sake, mould was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting.|$|E

2500|$|Borlaug {{attributed}} {{his decision}} to leave the farm and pursue further education to his grandfather's urgent encouragement to learn: [...] Nels Olson Borlaug (1859–1935) once told him, [...] "you're wiser to fill your head now {{if you want to}} fill <b>your</b> <b>belly</b> later on." [...] When Borlaug applied for admission to the University of Minnesota in 1933, he failed its entrance exam, but was accepted at the school's newly created two-year General College. After two quarters, he transferred to the College of Agriculture's forestry program. As a member of University of Minnesota's varsity wrestling team, Borlaug reached the Big Ten semifinals, and promoted the sport to Minnesota high schools in exhibition matches all around the state.|$|E

5000|$|Crouch's fourth Shakespeare adaptation, I, Malvolio, {{was also}} written for teenagers, a co-commission by Brighton Festival and Singapore Arts Festival, {{where it was}} shown in 2010. It went on to have a huge success with adult audiences at the Traverse in the 2011 Edinburgh Festival. Like Crouch's {{previous}} play,The Author, I, Malvolio is a play {{about what it is}} to be a spectator and about our responsibilities as spectators. In a performance close to standup comedy, Crouch appears as the pompous, theatre-despising, puritan steward from Twelfth Night, following his humiliation at the end of that play. Wearing stained long-johns and crumpled yellow stockings, he berates the audience: 'Look at you. Sitting there with <b>your</b> <b>bellies</b> full of pop and pickled herring. Laughing at me. Go on. Laugh at the funny man. Laugh. Make the funny man cry.' His response to the audience's laughter is a recurring cry of 'You find that kind of thing funny?' ...|$|R

'When {{the dogs}} were killed and eaten, and your stomachs were heavy with untanned hide and strips of moccasins; when the old men died, and the old women died, and the babes at the dry dugs of the mothers died; when the land was dark, and ye perished as do the salmon in the fall; aye, when the famine was upon you, did the Shaman bring reward to your hunters? did the Shaman put meat in <b>your</b> <b>bellies?</b> Again I say, the Shaman is without power.

Some of the women were even frightened, but among the men there was an uplifting, as though in {{preparation}} or anticipation of the miracle. All eyes were turned upon the two central figures. The priest realized the crucial moment, felt his power tottering, opened his mouth in denunciation, but fled backward before the truculent advance, upraised fist, and flashing eyes, of Mackenzie.

500|$|In May 1975, Roddenberry {{entered a}} {{development}} deal with Paramount, with principal photography intended {{to start on}} July 15, 1976, and a budget of $5 million. He started work on treatments; his first involved {{the formation of the}} Enterprise crew, including their training at Starfleet Academy and the formation of Starfleet, but this idea was never submitted to Paramount. His first major submitted script was The God Thing. A scene involving a discussion in which Spock's tutors describe religion on Earth worried the studio. The tutor says, [...] "We have never really understood your Earth legend of gods. Particularly in that so many of your gods have said, 'You have to bow down on <b>your</b> <b>bellies</b> every seven days and worship me'. This seems to us like they are very insecure gods." [...] Roddenberry completed the script on 30 June; Paramount rejected it the following month. The studio was also unhappy with, and rejected, scripts by Robert Silverberg, Chris Knopt, Dick Simmons and Theodore Sturgeon. Roddenberry blamed religious Paramount executives including Barry Diller for turning down The God Thing, a story that writer Jon Povill summarized as [...] "God was a malfunctioning spaceship".|$|R

Work, and work as we tell you or <b>your</b> <b>bellies</b> will remain empty and you will perish. Obey the laws we set you or you will be beasts and without place in the world. You would not have been, save for the chiefs before you who ordered and regulated for your fathers. No seed of you will come after you, except that we order and regulate for you now. You must be peace-abiding, and decent, and blow your noses. You must be early to bed of nights, and up early in the morning to work if you would heave beds to sleep in and not roost in trees like the silly fowls. This is the season for the yam-planting and you must plant now. We say now, to-day, and not picnicking and hulaing to-day and yam-planting to-morrow or some other day of the many careless days. You must not kill one another, and you must leave your neighbours' wives alone.

The collier kept on talking to her, stretching his bare, grey-black hairy arm across her vision, and pointing with his knotted hand. The thick-wicked tallow candles guttered and smelled. There was a thickness in the air, a sense of dark, fluid presence in the thick atmosphere, the dark, fluid, viscous voice of the collier making a broad-vowelled, clapping sound in her ear. He seemed to linger near her as if he knew--as if he knew--what? Something for ever unknowable and inadmissible, something that belonged purely to the underground: to the slaves who work underground: knowledge humiliated, subjected, but ponderous and inevitable. And still his voice went on clapping in her ear, and still his presence edged near her, and seemed to impinge on her--a smallish, semi-grotesque, grey-obscure figure with a naked brandished forearm: not human: a creature of the subterranean world, melted out like a bat, fluid. She felt herself melting out also, to become a mere vocal ghost, a presence in the thick atmosphere. Her lungs felt thick and slow, her mind dissolved, she felt she could cling like a bat in the long swoon of the crannied, underworld darkness. Cling like a bat and sway for ever swooning in the draughts of the darkness-- ...|$|R

When she's exalted in the skies, She'll never think of mutton-pies; When you're advanced above Dean Viz, You'll never think of Goody Griz; But ever, ever live at ease, And strive, and strive your wife to please; In her you'll centre all your joys, And get ten thousand girls and boys; Ten thousand girls and boys you'll get, And they like stars shall rise and set. While you and spouse, transform'd, shall soon Be a new sun and a new moon: Nor shall you strive your horns to hide, For then your horns shall be your pride.|$|R
