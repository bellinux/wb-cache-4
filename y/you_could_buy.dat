500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. And you had no income tax." ...|$|E

[...] At a time when tobacco companies were major advertisers, Seldes discussed the contents of a study called, [...] "Tobacco Smoking and Longevity", which he said had been suppressed since 1939. Throughout the 10-year run of In Fact, Seldes published more than 50 stories on the health effects of tobacco, and the cigarette industry's attempts and suppressing such news.|$|E

The news of the order reaches the FastBurger headquarters and everyone associated with the fictional chain is laughing. The chairman is by now laughing after being told about the order on the phone, and says [...] "An Angus Burger, is he crazy?!" [...] An assistant gives him the morning Evening Standard paper and the front page story reads 'Burger King Debuts The Angus".

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the California Gold Rush, placer mining methods were used, from panning to [...] "cradles" [...] and [...] "rockers" [...] or [...] "long-toms", to {{diverting}} the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river, and then digging for gold in the gravel down to the rocky river bottom. This placer gold had been freed by the slow disintegration, over geological time, that freed the gold from its ore. This free gold was typically found in the cracks in the rocks found at the bottom of the gravel found in rivers or creeks, as the gold typically worked down through the gravel or collected in stream bends or bottom cracks. Some 12-million ounces (370t) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush. This gold greatly increased the available money in the United States, which was on the gold standard at that time—the more gold you had, the more <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy.</b>|$|E
