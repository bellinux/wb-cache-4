25|$|In 2012 Swans {{released}} the live album We Rose from <b>Your</b> <b>Bed</b> with the Sun in Our Head, featuring material culled from their 2010–2011 tour, {{in support of}} production and recording costs for their forthcoming record, The Seer. Initially released as a limited handmade edition of 1000 copies, We Rose... was re-released in May 2012 as a deluxe digipak.|$|E
25|$|Above all {{the noise}} of the internet, ‘Video Games’ still works and is magical; I still have to listen on quiet because {{whenever}} I do I become convinced something absolutely terrible is about to crash through the window; {{it might as well be}} sung by Laura Palmer and be about the Bobs at the end of <b>your</b> <b>bed.</b> Either way, it is a brilliant, beautifully-executed pop song, a proper shivery, proper classic.|$|E
500|$|The band began {{recording}} {{in spring}} 2008 at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire {{over the course}} of two weeks. Matt O'Grady and John Mitchell handled producer duties, with Mitchell also mixing the proceedings, while Tim Turan mastered the album. [...] "Save It for the Bedroom" [...] and [...] "You've Made <b>Your</b> <b>Bed</b> (So Sleep in It)", which were initially released as a single in 2007, were re-recorded during the album's studio sessions. Franceschi's sister Elissa provided additional vocals on [...] "Always Attract".|$|E

500|$|As Madonna {{finishes}} {{singing the}} intermediate lines, [...] "Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It {{is time for}} <b>your</b> <b>bed,</b> Never forget what I said, Hang on...", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm. The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music, with the glissando evoking the string arrangements. This {{is followed by the}} bridge and the chorus being repeated twice. [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out, except the orchestra, which is equalized to make it sound very thin and trebly, as if coming out from a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination. It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.|$|E
500|$|Marvel later {{released}} an comic book adaptation of The Stand, {{which began in}} September 2008 and ran for thirty issues. Writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa described Flagg as [...] "The man of nightmares. Or, put another way, our nightmares given human (more or less) form. The {{dark side of the}} American Dream...King's 'Walkin' Dude' may not be the Devil, himself, as Mother Abagail says, but he comes pretty damn close..." [...] Initially, artist Mike Perkins said he felt [...] "Flagg needed to be designed less as a man—more as a force of nature. His hair will obscure his features, his face will be almost always in heavy shadow. This is the creature lurking under <b>your</b> <b>bed,</b> in your wardrobe, in your nightmares. Slightly familiar but wholly terrifying". Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa later commented on the original idea of hiding Flagg's face: [...] "...the further into the book and the adaptation you go, the less feasible that becomes. Stephen spends so much time [...] describing 's features and smiles, you need to show those things".|$|E
500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] moves at a {{tempo of}} 123 {{beats per minute}} for 5:32, running {{slightly}} above the average song length of the album. It begins with a clean guitar intro similar to the main riff; an E minor chord on a guitar using the wah-wah pedal is then introduced, followed by heavy use of tom-tom drums. Distorted guitars then build up to the main riff, which starts 56 seconds into the song and utilizes variations of the E/B tritone. P. J. Howorth, in The Wah Wah Book, characterized the main riff as [...] "sinister". The song then follows a common structure, playing two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. On the chorus and pre-chorus, the song modulates one whole tone, up to F, and after the second chorus, Hammett plays a guitar solo with the main, pre-chorus, and chorus riffs in the background. Hammett makes use of the wah-wah pedal and {{a wide range of}} scales, including e minor pentatonic, B minor, F minor, E minor, and the E dorian mode. One of the final licks of the solo was inspired by the Heart song [...] "Magic Man" [...] as used in Ice-T's [...] "Personal". Just a few seconds before the solo ends, the breakdown starts, in which the clean drum intro starts, then the clean guitar intro when the last notes of Kirk's solo echo over it into the background, are heard together with Hetfield teaching a child the [...] "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" [...] bedtime prayer and reciting a variation of the lullaby rhyme [...] "Hush Little Baby" [...] where he is heard saying [...] "Hush little baby don't say a word, and never mind that noise you heard. It's just the beasts under <b>your</b> <b>bed,</b> in your closet, in your head". After building again to a chorus, the song starts to fade out while the band plays the same riffs as the buildup intro in reverse order. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "nightmares and all that come with them", according to Chris True of Allmusic. The title is a reference to the sandman, a character from Western folklore who makes children sleep.|$|E

2500|$|J. M. Barrie, {{the author}} of the Peter Pan stories, may have had sleep paralysis. He said of himself ‘In my early boyhood it was a sheet that tried to choke me in the night.’ He also {{described}} several incidents in the Peter Pan stories that indicate that he was familiar with an awareness of a loss of muscle tone whilst in a dream-like state. For example, Maimie is asleep but calls out ‘What was that....It is coming nearer! It is feeling <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> with its horns-it is boring for [...] you’. and when the Darling children were dreaming of flying, [...] Barrie says ‘Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.’ Barrie describes many parasomnias and neurological symptoms in his books and uses them to explore the nature of consciousness from an experiential point of view.|$|E
