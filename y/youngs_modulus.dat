In spinal fixation devices, the <b>Young’s</b> <b>modulus</b> of the metallic implant rod should be sufficiently high to suppress springback for the surgeon, but should also be sufficiently low to prevent stress shielding for the patient.

40|$|Many of the {{techniques}} currently {{used to measure the}} mechanical properties of individual nanowires make the assumption that initially the nanowires are in a zero-stress state. However, due to their small sizes and large surface areas, nanomaterials are susceptible to external environmental factors that may influence their measured properties. Therefore, the potential effects that processing and fabrication steps can have on the measured material properties must be considered. 	 In the synthesis of one dimensional nanowires, it is often necessary to passivate the surfaces of these materials to prevent against agglomeration. Using a lateral atomic force microscopy technique, this thesis demonstrates that nanowires passivated with polymer surface coatings can be subjected to a residual stress due to the swelling of the polymer coating when exposed to a solvent medium. Current models used to determine the <b>Young?s</b> <b>modulus</b> of nanowires affected by a residual stress are demonstrated to be problematic.
