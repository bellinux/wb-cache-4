500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you have to talk about these things and embarrass us? Don't <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>your</b> country?'" ...|$|E

In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E

[...] "The Love Song" [...] was {{described}} by Manson as an ode to Celebritarianism, and its title originated from his observation that [...] "Love Song" [...] {{is one of the}} most common titles in music. The lyrics are composed around an elaborate metaphor about guns. Manson explained: [...] "I was suggesting with the lyrics that the father is the hand, the mother is the gun, and the children are the bullets. Where you shoot them is your responsibility as parents." [...] The chorus is a rhetorical take on a popular American bumper sticker: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>your</b> God, gun, government?" [...] Kerrang! described [...] "The Fight Song" [...] as a [...] "playground punk anthem", and Manson revealed that its theme is Adam's desire to be a part of Holy Wood, saying that it is about [...] "a person who's grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, but when he finally , he realizes that it's worse than where he came from." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with Tropical TV, Birdman disputed the MTV poll that voted Jay Z [...] "The Hottest MC in the Game", stating that Lil Wayne {{was a better}} rapper and made more money. In early 2011, when Jay Z & Kanye West's single [...] "H•A•M" [...] was released, Jay Z took shots at Birdman, saying [...] "Really, you got Baby money" [...] and [...] " [...] ain't got my lady's money!". On August 24, 2011, a song called [...] "It's Good" [...] by Lil Wayne (featuring Drake and Jadakiss) was leaked online and included Lil Wayne responding [...] "Talkin' 'bout baby money? I gotcha baby money. Kidnap your bitch, get that, How much <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>your</b> lady? money". Jadakiss later absolved himself of involvement in any brewing beef on his official Twitter feed.|$|E
2500|$|As his volunteers (led by youth {{coordinator}} Sam Brown) went {{door to door}} in New Hampshire, and as {{the media}} began paying more serious attention to the Senator, McCarthy began to rise in the opinion polls. When McCarthy scored 42% to Johnson's 49% in the New Hampshire popular vote (and 20 of the 24 N.H. delegates to the Democratic national nominating convention) on March 12 {{it became clear that}} deep division existed among Democrats on the war issue. By this time, Johnson had become inextricably defined by Vietnam, and this demonstration of divided support within his party meant his reelection (only four years after winning the highest percentage of the popular vote in modern history) seemed unlikely. The folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary released a record [...] "Eugene McCarthy For President (If <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Your</b> Country)", endorsing McCarthy, who they said had stood alone against Johnson over [...] "more timid men" [...] now echoing him.|$|E

2500|$|Medunjanin is a Bosnian {{immigrant}} {{who came to}} the U.S. in 1994, was naturalized in 2002, and lives in Flushing, Queens. He played on his high school football team and graduated from Queens College with a major in Economics in June 2009. He works as a building manager at a property management company. On January 7, 2010, while police were executing a search warrant at Medunjanin's residence, Medunjanin left his apartment and attempted to turn his car into a weapon of terror by crashing it on the Whitestone Expressway. Moments before crashing, Medunjanin called 9-1-1, identified himself and left his message of martyrdom, during which he invoked the name of Allah, shouting an al-Qaeda slogan: [...] “We love death more than <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>your</b> life.”!"—a refrain al-Qaeda trainers use to inspire recruits to commit murder and suicide. He reportedly told authorities he trained with Zazi in the al-Qaeda camp in Waziristan, Pakistan. He reportedly discussed possible target locations in Manhattan, including the subway system, Grand Central Station, the New York Stock Exchange, Times Square, and movie theaters to carry out suicide bombings during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan. He pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, and receiving military-style training from al-Qaeda. On February 25, 2010, he pleaded not guilty to additional charges of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign country, and providing material support to al-Qaida. He faces life in prison if convicted.|$|E
