O'Brien said the song was influenced by Phil Spector, a producer and songwriter {{best known for his}} reverberating [...] "Wall of Sound" [...] recording techniques. The song's lyrics are, Yorke said, [...] "about that feeling that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you're in transit but you're not in control of it—you just go past thousands of places and thousands of people and you're completely removed from it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "What's Your Name" [...] is an midtempo electro song, and bases its melody on {{thrusting}} new wave-influenced synths. It {{contains a}} [...] "whimsical" [...] beat that utilizes sirens and wind instruments. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune compared the song's synth riff {{to the music}} that was popular during the 1980s MTV generation, while John Soeder from The Plain Dealer noted its similarity to British duo the Eurythmics. Usher monotonously repeats the pick-up line hook, [...] "What's your name?", and thereby pays homage to his bachelor history. The song's lyrics describe [...] "the feeling <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you run into a woman that makes you speak gibberish".|$|E

[...] However, Al Jean disputed this, saying [...] " [...] didn't walk out. Obviously they didn't. We've depicted the conditions in a fanciful light before." [...] Commenting on hiring Banksy to create the titles, Jean joked, [...] "This is what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you outsource." [...] Although conceding {{to the fact that}} The Simpsons is largely animated in South Korea, Jean went on to state that the scenes shown in titles are [...] "very fanciful, far-fetched. None of the things he depicts are true. That statement should be self-evident, but I will emphatically state it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} narrated {{in the first}} person through a series of [...] nine journaux intimes, kept by Mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85. French {{literary}} journals, always published posthumously, are often extremely candid accounts, particularly of the author's sexual life. Boyd, himself a francophile, includes masturbation, prostitution and Mountstuart's three marriages. While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography, a journal is different: [...] "For a start, it's written without the benefit of hindsight, so there isn't the same feeling <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you look back and add shape to a life. There are huge chunks missing." [...] The novel's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism.|$|E
500|$|... "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] {{was based}} on a real-life event: lead singer Gaz Coombes' arrest and caution for {{possession}} of cannabis at age fifteen. In a 2004 interview, Coombes said [...] "It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing. The adrenaline rush <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song." ...|$|E
500|$|The single [...] "Undone - The Sweater Song" [...] was {{described}} by Cuomo as [...] "the feeling <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> the train stops and the little guy comes knockin' on your door. It {{was supposed to be}} a sad song, but everyone thinks it's hilarious." [...] The video marks one of the early directorial efforts of Spike Jonze, whose pitch was simply [...] "A blue stage, a steadicam, a pack of wild dogs." [...] The video became an instant hit on MTV. [...] The final single, [...] "Say it Ain't So", was again inspired by Cuomo believing his parents split up when he was four because he thought his dad was an alcoholic. The music video, which was directed by Sophie Muller, was less successful than the previous Spike Jonze-directed video. It featured the band performing in the garage of their former house, and the bandmates playing hacky sack in the backyard.|$|E

500|$|However, Blackley instead {{proposed}} an aerobatics training simulation, {{which he had}} conceived while reading an aerobatics magazine on a Lexington, Massachusetts bus. Collaborating with Ultima Underworld II programmer Greg Travis, he created a thirty page concept document that outlined the game. His core idea was to recreate the [...] "yummy, visceral, fluid feeling that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> flying a real airplane". He wanted the project to bear more resemblance to a playground than to a video game, and he sought to give it simple controls and realistic terrain to decrease the learning curve for beginners. Blackley {{assumed the role of}} project leader and then engaged the team in [...] "flaming sessions" [...] to generate ideas. According to programmer Doug Church, Blackley's concept of the game was not fully developed, but he clearly expressed his thoughts and motivated the team. The first months of the project produced disparate prototypes that demonstrated prospective features. The company committed to full development of the game in early 1993, and production commenced in March.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A superb episode. Some colorful background for Homer and Marge (and a glimpse of Homer and Barney's schooldays) plus our introduction {{to the world of}} the McBain films. Excellent." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the episode was a [...] "fine program", and added that Lovitz made Artie [...] "amusingly annoying". Jacobson thought the episode captured the [...] "tone of the mid-Seventies with warmth and insight", and the courtship [...] "seemed charming but not sappy, and the show worked well overall." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was Grampa's advice to Homer about Marge, [...] "Oh, son, don’t overreach! Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl!" [...] When Homer arrives at the Bouvier house to pick up Marge for the prom, Selma tells Patty [...] "Marge's dates get homelier all the time," [...] to which Patty replies [...] "That's what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you don't put out." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought these were the best lines of the episode. IGN ranked Lovitz as the eighth best guest star in the show's history.|$|E
500|$|Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly {{coined the}} song as [...] "thumping" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "Brown and guest Justin Bieber trade verses assuring their ladies of their dedication." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV News UK said [...] "It seems that {{everything}} Justin Bieber touches turns to gold at the moment and this cutesy ballad is no exception." [...] Dorken complimented how well the song showed the blending of the pair's voices, and she commented, as [...] "the most 'pop' song on the LP, we are hoping Chris decides {{to make this a}} single... a sure fire hit." [...] Nadia Noir of WNOW-FM wrote, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you combine two of pop's best-looking/greatest dancers, the sexy rasp of Justin Bieber, and a dance-jam/love-song? A combination of all the best elements of music!" [...] Nick Levine of BBC Music said the track was part of Brown's identity crisis on the album, as [...] "Next to You" [...] was just two tracks after the [...] "grisly sex jam" [...] of [...] "Wet the Bed" [...] featuring Ludacris. Levine called the collaboration a [...] "wholesome-as-homemade-chutney hook-up." [...] While complementing that the album had [...] "something for everyone", Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called [...] "Next to You" [...] a [...] "puppy-love declaration." [...] Bri LaPelusa called the song a [...] "dreamy ballad" [...] and said it melted Brown and Bieber's [...] "angelic" [...] voices. She went on to add that [...] "Next to You" [...] "might be affirmation that Chris Brown is once again an accepted celebrity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In another {{interview}} Cedric elaborated on the kidnapping/vanishing themes, saying [...] "Lyrically, I {{wanted to}} incorporate elements of traditional songs. So {{that it would}} sound like our world had these handed down, traditional songs that were to do with real random vanishings and kidnappings. That {{is a big part}} of Latin culture. People get kidnapped all the time. I wanted to cover everything. Right from the exhilarating feeling <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you put the ransom note down, the adrenaline rush when you realise a loved one has been taken from you, followed by that bleak, dismal area of not knowing what to do. Especially if you don't come from money. We had two friends that we knew from Texas who just randomly vanished. We've never known whether they just took off or if they met foul play. I found it an interesting subject matter to tackle. I wanted the lyrics to instil that bleak feeling you can get from living somewhere like El Paso. Even though I haven't lived at home for ages, it's still with me. The stories that come from across the border still hit home really hard. I just wanted to have a soundtrack for that really." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Algerian police used {{night vision}} devices to {{identify}} the lead hijacker, Abdul Abdullah Yahia. The government sent his mother to plead for her son to release the passengers, hoping that her pleas would cause Yahia to give in. The tactic backfired. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, said that Yahia became enraged by the attempt. The hijackers began to target the French passengers; two staff members of the Embassy of France in Algeria, a secretary and a chef, were on board. The hijackers used the chef, Yannick Beugnet, by having him plead in the microphone. The hijackers demanded that if the Algerian government did not let the A300 take off before 9:30pm, the hijackers would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw {{him out of the}} door. The French diplomat said that the Algerians assured them that the hijackers were bluffing while the French demanded that the aircraft be allowed to take off. When the deadline passed, the hijackers fatally shot the chef. The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme yelled at the Algerian authorities, saying [...] "see what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you play tough?!". The airline knew that the chef was murdered since it listened to the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, {{said in an interview that}} the airline employees [...] "lived through" [...] the event [...] "with great emotion." [...] Passenger Zahida Kakachi recalls Lotfi calmly converting two stewardesses to Islam, herself and another woman, though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage or upset Lotfi.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E

If golf had come late in life to Mortimer Sturgis, love came later still, and just as the golf, attacking him in middle life, had been some golf, so was the love considerable love. Mortimer finished his dinner in a trance, which is the best way to do it at some hotels, and then scoured the place for someone who would introduce him.

There too I was awed by the greatness {{of the man who}} had painted that ceiling. It was genius, and it was stupendous and overwhelming. I felt small and insignificant. But you are prepared for the greatness of Michael Angelo. Nothing had prepared me for the immense surprise of these pictures in a native hut, far away from civilisation, in a fold of the mountain above Taravao. And Michael Angelo is sane and healthy. Those great works of his have the calm of the sublime; but here, notwithstanding beauty, was something troubling. I do not know what it was. It made me uneasy. It gave me the impression <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>when</b> you are sitting next door to a room that you know is empty, but in which, you know not why, you have a dreadful consciousness that notwithstanding there is someone. You scold yourself; you know it is only your nerves -- and yet, and yet... In a little while it is impossible to resist the terror that seizes you, and you are helpless in the clutch of an unseen horror.
