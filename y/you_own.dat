Describing his philosophical views, Zappa stated, [...] "I believe that {{people have a right}} to decide their own destinies; people own themselves. I also believe that, in a democracy, government exists because (and only so long as) individual citizens give it a 'temporary license to exist'—in exchange for a promise that it will behave itself. In a democracy, <b>you</b> <b>own</b> the government—it doesn't own you." ...|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation 3 version's {{critical}} review scores suffered {{because of the}} technical issues first uncovered by 1UP.com. While discussing the retail version on a podcast, 1UP.com staff members agreed {{that a significant number}} of the frame rate problems had been resolved, but not all of them. They concluded that the PlayStation 3 version was not quite as smooth as the Xbox 360 version and recommended that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>own</b> both , you should do the 360" [...] version. Kotaku's Michael McWhertor echoed that recommendation, though stated that those who only have a PlayStation 3 should still consider The Orange Box.|$|E

500|$|GamePro {{gave the}} Tetris & Dr. Mario {{compilation}} a rave review. They praised the Mixed Match mode and the SNES enhanced graphics and sounds, and concluded [...] "Sharp controls and absorbing action are what make these two classics even {{better as a}} pair than they were alone." [...] Next Generation, in contrast, said the compilation was only significant for being the first appearance of Tetris on the SNES, summarizing that [...] "Yeah, it's great, but chances are <b>you</b> <b>own</b> a copy of {{one or both of}} these games already." [...] They did, however, praise Nintendo for having the [...] "cajones" [...] to package their Tetris-inspired game with Tetris itself.|$|E
500|$|Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku {{praised the}} game, writing, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>own</b> a PC, you {{owe it to}} {{yourself}} to play Gravity Bone." [...] He said the game was [...] "one of the coolest things I've played on PC lately." [...] Kieron Gillen from Rock Paper Shotgun considered Gravity Bone to be an intellectual mix of Hitman, , and Team Fortress 2, stating that it is the [...] "wittiest game" [...] he has played since World of Goo. Gillen applauded every aspect of the game, stating that Gravity Bone was an [...] "indie art game whose main effect is to delight you at every turn." [...] It received the [...] "Best Arthouse Game" [...] award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} {{constructed}} in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyoncé sings the hook-intro, [...] "To the left, to the left: everything <b>you</b> <b>own</b> in a box to the left". In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, [...] "You must not know 'bout me...I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute...Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Beyoncé recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyoncé sings the bridge, where she tells her lover, [...] "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an ad-libbed chorus. The Boston Globe noted that Beyoncé sings some parts {{of it in a}} higher register [...] "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".|$|E

500|$|John Madden Football '93 was a {{commercial}} success, with {{over one million}} copies sold. It has been cited as the highest-selling game developed by Looking Glass Studios, and Neurath later called it [...] "one {{of the most successful}} games I've ever worked on". Paul Mellerick of Mega commented that [...] "the only noticeable difference between [...] and its two predecessors is the animation". He wrote that this new animation [...] "makes the game incredibly good to look at" [...] and that new motions like stumbling increase the game's difficulty. Although he believed that the [...] "two-player mode is just as exciting as ever", he was disappointed by the lack of a full-season mode, which he called [...] "unforgivable" [...] in light of this feature's appearance in Sega's NFL Sports Talk Football '93. He concluded that John Madden Football '93 was [...] "the best game the Mega Drive has to offer", but he wrote, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>own</b> John Madden Football '92, or even the original John Madden American Football for that matter, then you should ignore this game completely".|$|E
500|$|Soul Reavers {{dark and}} gothic {{atmosphere}} was generally well-received, and several publications praised the game's cut scenes. IGN's reviewer called it [...] "such an ambitious game - {{and one that}} achieves nearly everything it sets out to do - that few games come close to it", and praised the soundtrack for blending with the atmosphere unobtrusively. The Dreamcast port was cited as [...] "perhaps {{one of the best}} looking console games ever made". Next Generation Magazine echoed this, stating that, [...] "even if <b>you</b> <b>own</b> the PlayStation version, you may want to rent this anyway", but expressed disappointment that no new features were added to the Dreamcast port. AllGame's reviewer called the cut scenes [...] "seamless", and their frequency neither too high nor too low. The game's storyline was praised by Game Informer as being [...] "grim and interesting". Soul Reavers voice acting was also highly praised; GameSpot ranked this aspect of the game in its list of top ten [...] "Best Voice Acting in Games". GameSpot also considered the atmosphere as rich as that of Blood Omen, yet less dramatically overstated, and considered the graphics [...] "among the best that have ever been on the PlayStation." ...|$|E
500|$|Enema of the State {{is mainly}} {{considered}} a pop punk album and is even considered a skate punk album. According to Mike Damante of the Daily Cougar, the album [...] "embraces the pop side of pop-punk". The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding [...] "adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over {{the care and}} feeding of girls." [...] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times called Enema of the State a sampling of [...] "ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection." [...] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences. Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—"more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it." [...] The band decided to emphasize arrangements, harmonies and melodic ideas rather than the fast-paced nature of Dude Ranch; the change was {{brought about by the}} band, rather than the label. Barker hoped to give the songs varying tempos, something missing in the group's prior recordings. [...] "I told Mark and Tom, 'It's going to be repetitive if all our songs have the same punk-rock beat all the time. Why don't we try some different tempos?'" [...] DeLonge noted he was open to his proposals, and responded, [...] "Dude, I just play guitar and write melodies. <b>You</b> <b>own</b> the beats. If you have an idea, that's what you're supposed to do." [...] DeLonge later reflected on his desire for a more [...] "pop" [...] sound: ...|$|E

500|$|... 1UP.com graded it A-, {{praising the}} {{gameplay}} and [...] "predictably slick" [...] looks, but criticized the [...] "divisive industrial hard-rock nonsense.... that sullied DMC3 [...] returns here" [...] and the game's [...] "overly frugal approach to level design". GameTrailers rated it an 8.6/10, and praised the voice acting while criticizing the corny dialogue. IGN gave it an 8.7 saying, [...] "Whether it's on the PS3 or the 360, action fans {{are going to}} get one incredible experience with this game, and if <b>you</b> <b>own</b> either system, you'll have a great time." [...] However, the review also noted that, contrary to Kobayashi's claim, [...] "Dante simply doesn't have nearly as many weapons as he did in DMC3" [...] and found that [...] "the amount of backtracking and repetition makes the game feel somewhat half-heartedly finished in the design department." [...] GameSpy gave it 4 stars out of 5, stating that [...] "DMC4 succeeds on many levels because it fuses fan service with entertaining gameplay", finding that [...] "visually, DMC4 is a dynamo." [...] The review also praised Nero for [...] " [...] something fresh to the franchise" [...] and being [...] "as diverse as DMC3 SE's Vergil"; however, they also claim that [...] "it cheapens things a little to see that the team has opted to recycle assets in lieu of showing us more of this rich world" [...] and call out the [...] "annoying industrial-meets-butt-rock soundtrack". Hypers Dirk Watch commends the game for [...] "looking great, combos galore and being more fun than Devil May Cry 3". However, he criticized it for [...] "still playing like Devil May Cry 2 as well as choppy pacing and level design".|$|E
500|$|Early {{versions}} featured simplified graphics, and {{the different}} ports were met with mixed reception. John Harris of Gamasutra thought the arcade's popularity fueled the sales of the home versions, while Thomas Hanley of ScrewAttack commented that most versions were not as enjoyable without a track ball. Grannell echoed similar statements about the controls and added that many had poor visuals and collision detection. He listed the Amiga, Game Boy, and Sega Mega Drive ports as the better conversions, and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, PC, and Game Boy Advance versions among the worst. Compute! writers called the Amiga version's graphics and gameplay [...] "arcade-quality". Computer Gaming World stated that the Amiga version was superior to the arcade original. Bruce Webster of BYTE wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of Marble Madness in December 1986 [...] "are really amazing". While criticizing {{the lack of a}} pause function or a top scores list, he stated that it [...] "is definitely worth having if <b>you</b> <b>own</b> an Amiga". Bil Herd recalled that the Amiga version was so popular at Commodore International that employees stole the required memory expansion from colleagues' computers to run the game. He wrote [...] "Not an Amiga" [...] on his Commodore 128D so others would not open it looking for Amiga memory. Info gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a totally faithful adaptation". It gave the Commodore 64 version three-plus stars out of five, describing it as [...] "just a shadow of the arcade original and the excellent Amiga version" [...] and inferior to Spindizzy. The magazine liked the graphics but criticized [...] "marbles that handle like intoxicated turtles". Dragons three reviewers—Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser—praised the Apple II port, calling it a [...] "must have" [...] title for arcade fans.|$|E

2500|$|Sumner {{returned}} to the Senate in 1859. When fellow Republicans advised taking a less strident tone than he had years earlier, he answered: [...] "When crime and criminals are thrust before us, {{they are to be}} met by all the energies that God has given us by argument, scorn, sarcasm and denunciation." [...] He delivered his first speech following his return on June 4, 1860, during the 1860 presidential election. In [...] "The Barbarism of Slavery", he attacked attempts to depict slavery as a benevolent institution, said it had stifled economic development in the South and that it left slaveholders reliant on [...] "the bludgeon, the revolver, and the bowie-knife". He addressed an anticipated objection on the part of one of his colleagues: [...] "Say, sir, in your madness, that <b>you</b> <b>own</b> the sun, the stars, the moon; but do not say that <b>you</b> <b>own</b> a man, endowed with a soul that shall live immortal, when sun and moon and stars have passed away." [...] Even allies found his language too strong, one calling it [...] "harsh, vindictive, and slightly brutal". He spent the summer rallying the anti-slavery forces and opposing talk of compromise.|$|E
