60|$|I {{perceive}} therefore that, besides choosing Parliaments {{never so}} well, the New Colonial Office will have {{another thing to}} do: Contrive to send out {{a new kind of}} Governors to the Colonies. This will be the mainspring of the business; without this the business will not go at all. An experienced, wise and valiant British man, to represent the Imperial Interest; he, with such a speaking or silent Collective Wisdom as he can gather round him in the Colony, will evidently be the condition of all good between the Mother Country and it. If you can find such a man, <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> gained; if you cannot, lost. By him and his Collective Wisdom all manner of true relations, mutual interests and duties such as they do exist in fact between Mother Country and Colony, can be gradually developed into practical methods and results; and all manner of true and noble successes, and veracities in the way of governing, be won. Choose well your Governor;--not from this or that poor section of the Aristocracy, military, naval, or red-tapist; wherever there are born kings of men, you had better seek them out, and breed them to this work. All sections of the British Population will be open to you: and, on the whole, you must succeed in finding a man fit. And having found him, I would farther recommend you to keep him some time! It would be a great improvement to end this present nomadism of Colonial Governors. Give your Governor due power; and let him know withal that he is wedded to his enterprise, and having once well learned it, shall continue with it; {{that it is not a}} Canadian Lumber-log you want there, to tumble upon the vertexes and sign its name by a Birmingham shoulder-crank, but a Governor of Men; who, you mean, shall fairly gird himself to his enterprise, and fail with it and conquer with it, and as it were live and die with it: he will have much to learn; and having once learned it, will stay, and turn his knowledge to account.|$|E

You and your friends have all seen it and have come away with different views. One friend says he felt that one of the leads was not convincing in the role; you disagree—you think the failing was in the screenplay, and want to make your case. But before you have a chance to get going, another friend jumps in and says she doesn’t think this actor was miscast, just that he’s not very good, and is prepared to argue chapter and verse. You think <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a good one, and you want to make it; but you’ll only offend this friend, who’s now arguing her point with enthusiasm. Moreover, you find yourself agreeing with some of what she’s saying. Your challenge is to manage two tasks at once: pay attention to what your friend is saying, both out of courtesy and to follow her argument so you don’t repeat or overlook her points when you speak; and hold on to your own argument, that is forming in your head as you listen.
