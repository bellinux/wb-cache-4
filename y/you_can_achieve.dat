500|$|Historically, the actuarial {{profession}} {{has been reluctant}} to specify the pass marks for its examinations ( [...] , [...] ). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, [...] "Although students find it hard to believe, the Board of Examiners does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (and do). They are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>achieve</b> a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." [...] In 2000, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers [...] The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that [...] "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass.".|$|E

If you have not, and yet pursue a vocation towards which you have no call, you cannot choose but be a wretched man.

You see around you every day, how many outlets there are for short pieces of fiction in all kinds.

If thus you live with them, turning as they turn, but never turning among them, keeping your distance, but losing no yard, and can do this for seven miles over a grass country in forty-five minutes, then you can ride to hounds better than nineteen men out of every twenty that you have seen at the meet, and will have enjoyed the keenest pleasure that hunting, or perhaps, I may say, that any other amusement, can give you.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{an immense}} {{satisfaction}} {{to get your}} news--and no figure of speech {{to say that it}} has found me literally on the point of reaching out, for it, into the thick twilight of your whereabouts. I have had my general silence much on my conscience--and especially my dumbness and darkness to Rosina and Bay, for whom my movements must have been enveloped in a perfidious mystery that has caused me, I fear, to forfeit all their esteem. But let me tell you first of all how I rejoice in your good conditions and in your having found your feet. It was [...] "borne in" [...] upon me, on general grounds, that Southwold would never do for long, and it is charming that you have found so near and so nice a substitute. I especially delight (without wanting to sacrifice the rest of you) in such a letting-down-easy of the Art-Daughters. Please give them my tender love and tell them that, preposterous as it sounds, I have never, all this time, and in spite of the rosiest asseverations, crossed the channel at all. The nearest I have come to it is to have, early last month, come down here {{to the edge of the}} sea and collapsed into the peace and obscurity of this convenient corner (long familiar to me,) which, having a winter season, is practically empty at present. I will tell R. and B. when I see them just how it was that I happened to be so false--it is too long a story now. Suffice it that my reasons (for continuing to hug this fat country) were overwhelming, and my regrets (at not tasting of their brave Bohemia) of the sharpest. Moreover all's well that ends well. If I had gone abroad I should be abroad now and the rest of the summer; and therefore unable to join you on your Suffolk shore--or at least alight upon you there--which is what I shall be enchanted to do. You describe a little Paradise--houris and all; and I beseech you to keep a divan for me there. The only thing is that I fear I shan't be able to come till toward the end--or by the end--of the month. I have more or less engaged myself (to a pair of friends who are coming down here next week for my--strange as it may seem--sweet sake) to remain on this spot till toward the 25th. But I will come then, and stay as long as you will let me. If you can bespeak any quarters for me at the inn, in advance, I will take it very kindly of you. Can they give me a little sitting-room as well as a bed-room? If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>achieve</b> any effective [word illegible] at them to do so I shall be very grateful. I always need some small literary bower other than the British bed-room--and in this case I would of course [...] "meal" [...] there, as that makes them always more zealous.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} a flat domain of object names is {{inappropriate}} {{in the context of}} object composition since new naming requirements must be fulfilled. These requirements can be summarized by: (1) visibility and hiding of components, (2) checking whether two objects belong to the same composition, (3) sharing of components between compositions, (4) reference from one composition to another composition. Object naming in the object paradigm is based {{on the use of the}} concept of object identity which can be considered as an intrinsic and universal name of the object. It does not record information about the structure of objects. This naming mechanism is inadequate for fulfilling the requirements stated above. For instance, once you have the identity of an object <b>you</b> <b>can</b> access that object. This means <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not <b>achieve</b> component hiding within the composition.
