After returning to the U.S., she spent her childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. Witherspoon was raised as an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the [...] "definitive Southern upbringing" [...] which she received. She said that it gave her [...] "a sense of family and tradition" [...] and taught her about [...] "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life." [...] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected {{as a model for}} a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons. At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. Witherspoon received high grades in school, loved reading, and considered herself [...] "a big dork who read loads of books." [...] On mentioning her love for books, she said, [...] "I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything." [...] She {{has been described as a}} [...] "multi-achiever" [...] and was given the nickname [...] "Little Type A" [...] by her parents. Witherspoon attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader. She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major, [...] but left the school prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.|$|E

There's a side to the record when you listen to it that talks about what is the gold– what really is that? It's valuing whom <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life, the relationships you’ve built. It’s not just about success– or it just isn’t all your material possessions anymore– it’s how you live your life, and that’s all included in the music." ...|$|E

That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is {{at the other end of}} that line. We used to do that with him so often. And then when that person is gone, there will be nothing like that in your life ever again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ho!" [...] said Mr. Pyecroft, and {{the fashion}} of his countenance changed. Then pensively: [...] "Ther beggar! What might <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hand there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Goot! {{now open}} your eyes, and see for {{yourself}} it is the saucers <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got <b>in</b> <b>your</b> right hand, and the books <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got <b>in</b> <b>your</b> left. <b>You</b> see?

6000|$|... "Now, Louis," [...] I said, [...] "we are {{not only}} alone, but we are secure from interruption. Tell me {{exactly what it is}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{the way you}} did feel?

30|$|All {{interviews}} {{used the}} same questions and were pilot tested. The women were asked: “What experiences addressing you as a female in a gender-atypical career field <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> training company and <b>in</b> <b>your</b> vocational school?”. As part of the high interest in dealing with their experiences, they were also asked about strategies: “Do you apply specific strategies in adjusting to the male-dominated educational and professional field?”.|$|R

6000|$|... "Granted, even, {{that the}} man is as {{dangerous}} as you say," [...] he remarked, [...] "it is certainly creating a new precedent for you to bring him into the bosom of your family.
