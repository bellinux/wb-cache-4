The nurses, who both live in Jal, New Mexico, were unable to find employment in nursing after being terminated from WCMH. After signing the settlement, Wiley reinforced his support of Arafiles, saying, [...] "He’s {{done a lot of}} good in this county.

500|$|Vonnegut did not {{particularly}} sympathize with liberalism or conservatism, and mused on the specious simplicity of American politics. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my guns away from me, and you're all for murdering fetuses, and {{love it when}} homosexuals marry each other [...] you're a liberal. If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative. What could be simpler?" [...] Regarding political parties, Vonnegut said, [...] "The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people don’t acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead." ...|$|E
500|$|Like all {{the other}} republics of the Soviet Union, Armenia had its own flag and coat of arms. According to Nikita Khrushchev, the latter became a source of dispute between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Turkey in the 1950s, when Turkey objected to the {{inclusion}} of Mount Ararat, which holds a deep symbolic importance for Armenians but is located on Turkish territory, in the coat of arms. Turkey felt {{that the presence of}} such an image implied Soviet designs on Turkish territory. Khrushchev retorted by asking, [...] "Why do you have a moon depicted on your flag? After all, the moon doesn't belong to Turkey, not even half the moon... Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the whole universe?" [...] Turkey dropped the issue after this.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "No Russian" [...] was {{conceived}} {{during the initial}} brainstorming sessions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 plot. The developers at Infinity Ward wanted to discuss how terrorists operate in the modern era, and sought to create an unimaginable, albeit plausible scenario that the player would feel uncomfortable in. Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively {{want to know what}} it is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are human beings who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to turn a blind eye to it. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it apart and figure out how that happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{appraisal}} of Pacer has been mixed. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the album as [...] "exciting, gut-level rock & roll". The Rough Guide to Rock calls Pacer [...] "satisfyingly lo-fi". In Spin magazine, reviewer Joy Press {{writes that the}} album includes [...] "a half-dozen gems" [...] but that its overall [...] "foggy sound" [...] and [...] "indecipherable lyrics" [...] prevent the listener from fully embracing the work. Robert Christgau considers the album's songs to be [...] "definitely slight" [...] and [...] "uneven" [...] but praises the vocals, stating that [...] "speedy or dreamy, Kim Deal sounds so sane, so unpretentious, so goddamn nice that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her home {{and give her a}} shampoo". In The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, critic Ira Robbins writes that [...] "Other than the fine title track and a few others, the performances are forced and lackluster; the production varies between flat and colorless." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide similarly praises the title song while dismissing the rest of the album as [...] "forgettable".|$|E

John Virant, {{president and chief executive}} of Rounder Records, told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I remember watching the episode when it aired last October, and after it was over, I said to my wife, 'That's the best hour of TV I've ever seen. Someone should put that [...] out.' I inquired at Fox, just following up, and they said, 'Well, we tried, it didn't happen. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a run at it, feel free. AllMusic gives the album five out of five stars, stating that the music is [...] "every bit as fun as the episode itself", praising the voices of Benson, Marsters and Head. Reviewer Melinda Hill states it is [...] "a must-have for Buffy fans, but it wouldn't be out of place in anyone's collection".Musical Episode Soundtrack]], Allmusic.com.

Professor Martin Binks, director of the Nottingham University Institute for Entrepreneurial Innovation, said, [...] "It is brilliant in its simplicity... advertisers have been attracted to it by its novelty... the site has become a phenomenon." [...] Popular Mechanics said, [...] "There's no content. No cool graphics, giveaways or steamy Paris Hilton videos for viewers to salivate over. Imagine a TV channel that shows nothing but commercials, a magazine with nothing but ads. That's The Million Dollar Homepage. An astonishing example of the power of viral marketing". Don Oldenburg of the Washington Post {{was one of the few}} without praise for the site, calling it a [...] "cheap, mind-bogglingly lucrative marketing monstrosity, an advertising badlands of spam, banner ads and pop-ups." [...] Oldenburg continues, [...] "it looks like a bulletin board on designer steroids, an advertising train wreck you can't not look at.

500|$|After much research, Nolan's {{brother and}} co-writer, Jonathan, {{suggested}} the Joker's first two appearances, {{published in the}} first issue of Batman (1940), as the crucial influences. Christopher had Jonathan watch Fritz Lang's 1933 crime film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker, with the Joker resembling Mabuse's characteristics. Christopher Nolan referred to Lang's film as [...] "essential research for anyone attempting to write a supervillain". Jerry Robinson, one of the Joker's co-creators, was consulted on the character's portrayal. Nolan decided to avoid divulging an in-depth origin story for the Joker, and instead portray his rise to power so as to not diminish the threat he poses, explaining to MTV News, [...] "the Joker we meet in The Dark Knight is fully formed... To me, the Joker is an absolute. There are no shades of gray to him– maybe shades of purple. He's unbelievably dark. He bursts in just as he did in the comics." [...] Nolan reiterated to IGN, [...] "We never wanted to do an origin story for the Joker in this film," [...] because [...] "the arc of the story is much more Harvey Dent's; the Joker is presented as an absolute. It's a very thrilling element in the film, and a very important element, but we wanted to deal with the rise of the Joker, not the origin of the Joker." [...] Nolan suggested [...] influenced a section of the Joker's dialogue in the film, in which he says that anyone can become like him given the right circumstances. Nolan also cited Heat as [...] "sort of an inspiration" [...] for his aim [...] "to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city": [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on Gotham, you want to give Gotham a kind of weight and breadth and depth in there. So you wind up dealing with the political figures, the media figures. That's part of the whole fabric of how a city is bound together." ...|$|E
