500|$|When Lisa, Apu, and the McCartneys {{gather on}} the Kwik-E-Mart roof, Apu tells Lisa, [...] "I learned long ago to {{tolerate}} others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, 'Live and Let Live'." [...] Paul corrects Apu {{and says the}} song's title is actually [...] "Live and Let Die". In the same scene, Apu refers to himself as the [...] "fifth Beatle", and Linda alludes to {{a line in the}} Beatles' 1969 song [...] "Octopus's Garden". The McCartneys later ask Lisa if she would like to hear a song, and Apu sings part of [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", to which the McCartneys snap along.|$|E
500|$|For {{her second}} Hollywood role, Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols's Primary Colors (1998), playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton. Thompson's character, Susan, is {{described}} as that of an [...] "ambitious, long-suffering wife" [...] who {{has to deal with}} her husband's infidelity. The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office. According to Kevin O'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror, Americans were [...] "blown away" [...] by her performance and accent, and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her. Thompson rejected many of the offers, expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards, and stated [...] "LA is lovely as long as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> leave". She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point, which influenced her decision to leave film for a year. Thompson followed Primary Colors by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller Judas Kiss (1998).|$|E

500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{received}} the third base {{job for the}} Orioles in 1982 when the team traded DeCinces {{before the start of}} the season. He homered in his very first at bat of the first game of the Orioles' 1982 season against Dennis Leonard of Kansas City as part of three hits. However, he slumped to begin the season; his batting average was [...]118 through May 1. Ripken looked for advice from several Orioles players and coaches but was most aided by advice from Reggie Jackson: [...] "Just know what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do, not what everybody else tells you to do." [...] After that, Ripken hit well for the rest of the season. On May 29, Ripken did not play the second game of a doubleheader, the last time he missed a game until 1998. On July 1, Weaver decided to permanently shift Ripken to shortstop, deciding that it was harder to find a shortstop who could hit than it was to find a third baseman who could hit. Weaver said, [...] "You never know. Rip might be a great shortstop." [...] Ripken hit 28 home runs that year en route to winning the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. Aided by Ripken, the Orioles contended for the playoffs until they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers on the final day of the season.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after signing}} a record deal with Lava Records, {{aspiring}} English singer Jessie J commenced {{to work on}} her debut album. She collaborated with songwriters and producers Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly in her first writing session, where [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] was conceived {{with the intention of}} being performed by Jessie J. However, she decided not to record the song, believing it was not edgy enough for her to perform. She explained, [...] "And I remember thinking this song is amazing, but I don't know if it's me 110 percent, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> kind of feel it." [...] The song reached Cyrus while she was creating an EP with Dr. Luke. The writing team then reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for Cyrus' joint clothing line with Max Azria, exclusively sold in Wal-Mart stores. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly and Jessie J fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. [...] "They feel they're buying into a great experience but also buying into the artist," [...] Kelly said of the song's fans. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he desired to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It's the same song from a different point of view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] To record the song's instrumentation, they decided to mingle computerized sound with [...] "the warmth of live instrumentation", using live electric guitars and drums. Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to a need of tracks for The Time of Our Lives. This is the first of two collaborations between Dr. Luke and Cyrus. Dr. Luke would later co-produce Cyrus' 2013 smash hit single [...] "Wrecking Ball".|$|E

2500|$|Stewart aired archive {{footage of}} Cramer admitting to {{the ease of}} {{manipulating}} markets and commented that Cramer's on-air personality lacks honesty: [...] "I understand {{you want to make}} finance entertaining, but it's not a fucking game. And when I watch that, I get, I can't tell you how angry that makes me. Because what it says to me is: you all know. You all know what's going on. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> draw a straight line from those shenanigans to the stuff that was being pulled at Bear, and AIG, and all this derivative market stuff that is this weird Wall Street side bet."

2500|$|The {{philosophy}} of parkour {{has been compared}} to that of martial arts. In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: [...] "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?". In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. [...] "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed {{and you are going to}} sweat like never before." [...] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: [...] "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> travel the easy one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discovery is {{recognized}} as a concept album. It relates strongly to Daft Punk's childhood memories, incorporating their love of cinema and character. Thomas Bangalter specified that the album deals with the duo's experiences {{growing up in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985, rather than it just being a tribute to the music of that period. The record was designed to reflect a playful, honest and open-minded attitude toward listening to music. Bangalter compared it to the state of childhood when one does not judge or analyze music. Bangalter noted the stylistic approach of the album was in contrast to that of their previous effort. [...] "Homework [...] was a way to say to the rock kids, like, 'Electronic music is cool'. Discovery was the opposite, of saying to the electronic kids, 'Rock is cool, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> like that.'" [...] He elaborated that Homework had been [...] "a rough and raw thing" [...] focused on sound production and texture, whereas the goal with Discovery was to explore song structures and new musical forms. This change in sound was inspired by Aphex Twin's [...] "Windowlicker".|$|E
