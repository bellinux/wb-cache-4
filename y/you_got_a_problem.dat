2500|$|Young Buck {{released}} a song featuring Tony Yayo called [...] "Off Parole" [...] which insulted Lil Wayne. Young Buck said that Lil Wayne {{could not be}} angry, because Young Buck spoke the truth. Young Buck also said [...] "You think <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with Juve and B.G.; you'll have a true problem with me", referring to the Cash Money-Juvenile/B.G feud. One of the reasons 50 Cent stated he was dismissing Young Buck was what he called [...] "inconsistent behavior" [...] which included appearing on stage with Lil Wayne, then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit. After he was dismissed, Young Buck appeared in the music video [...] "My Life" [...] by The Game, which featured Lil Wayne in the vocals. As of 2009 Buck and Wayne have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track [...] "Up's and Down's" [...] for Young Buck's Back On My Buck Shit mixtape.|$|E
5000|$|Following these {{statements}} some lawmakers {{from both parties}} warned national security officials during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee that they must change their use of sweeping National Security Agency surveillance programs or face losing {{the provisions of the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that have allowed for the agency's mass collection of telephone metadata. [...] "Section 215 expires at the end of 2015, and unless <b>you</b> realize you've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> {{that is not going to}} be renewed," [...] Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., author of the USA Patriot Act, threatened during the hearing. [...] "It's got to be changed, and you've got to change how you operate section 215. Otherwise, in two and a half years, you're not going to have it anymore." ...|$|R
5000|$|When I reached New York I called Bil Dwyer who {{had also}} worked on the Columbus Dispatch... I called him just {{socially}} and told him I was in town to say hello. I didn't know where he lived, on Christopher Street. I didn't even know where Christopher Street was. So he said, [...] "My God, I'm glad <b>you</b> called! I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> here. Come on down!" [...] This was like the first night I was in town, {{and he had been}} submitting things to King Features and selling gags, by the way, to the magazines, Collier's and The New Yorker. Anyway, he had submitted a gag-type strip to King Features, and he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> call back saying that Paul Fung was being pulled off Dumb Dora and Dwyer had the assignment. Here he was suddenly with six strips and a Sunday page to do and he'd never done anything except single panels. And he was in trouble. Frank Engli was helping him. He did lettering. He later on did a strip called Looking Back, about stone age characters—very well done cartooning. But his lettering was especially good. So I went down to see them and they were laboring away at the first release. Bil was a good gag writer, but he'd never had this kind of assignment before. So he said to me, [...] "Will you sit in on this thing and especially draw the girls?" [...] So I laid out the first batch of stuff and again, it was not hard for me to do because I had those 11 o'clock deadlines every morning. And so then I inked the girls, and he inked the other characters; very simple drawing. Dwyer... was a very good gag man. Chic Young had originated the character and then Paul finally took over from Chic when Chic started Blondie. Paul was drawing it before Dwyer. I never did find out, by the way, why he withdrew. Maybe Fung had a fight with King Features. I don't know, and I never did ask. So we made the deadline, which was the thing that was bothering Dwyer, but in the mean time I had to go to work the next morning at eight o'clock.|$|R
