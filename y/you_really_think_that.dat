500|$|One of {{the sensations}} of the Games was black American track star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. According to some American press stories, Hitler left the stadium rather than {{shake hands with}} him. This was not the case; Hitler {{had been told by}} IOC {{president}} Baillet-Latour not to shake hands with the winners unless he was prepared to shake hands with all gold medalists, which he was not; this, however was not publicized. According to Butterfield, in later years retellings of what Brundage termed [...] "a fairy tale" [...] roused the American to [...] "acute fury". Hitler was, however, asked by his youth leader, Baldur von Schirach, to meet Owens, and he refused, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'd allow myself to be photographed shaking hands with a Negro?" ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{qualified}} to swim for Australia, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Evans' relay teammate Tonelli believed that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete and publicise their cause among the Australian public. Evans was fully supportive of Tonelli's campaign, reflecting that [...] "We were political tools, and the only ones to suffer would be us." [...] He rhetorically asked: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if we didn't go someone would come up to us after the Games and pat us on the back for not going?" ...|$|E
500|$|The rebel {{qualities of}} the group were on show in the lead-up to the Olympics. An {{obstacle}} arose with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in a}} boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and he and sections of the public put significant political pressure on the athletes to join the boycott. Tonelli realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes, fighting for their right to compete and publicising their cause to the Australian community. Evans was fully supportive of Tonelli's campaign, reflecting that [...] "We were political tools, and the only ones to suffer would be us." [...] He rhetorically asked: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if we didn't go someone would come up to us after the Games and pat us on the back for not going?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Prize, indeed!" [...] {{says his}} brother. [...] "And do <b>you</b> then <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your father would consent to your having {{a share in}} this terrible bloody and murthering business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{tried to}} kill {{yourself}} four times for me," [...] she said, unsteadily, [...] "and I have been chained up as a madwoman for <b>you.</b> I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> after that----" ...|$|R
2500|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{scanning}} {{a frozen}} brain is feasible today? ...|$|E
60|$|The wolf's {{jaw dropped}} in astonishment and terror. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would happen?' he gasped.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But {{to return}} to the subject, Mr. Crosbie,' said Fairford, 'do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it likely <b>that</b> this Mr. Maxwell will be of service in this matter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he {{will suffer}} too--and all for her caprices! <b>You</b> cannot <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> her money would do him any good. Who would ever {{speak to him}} again, or even see him? What would the world say of him? Why, his own father and mother and sisters would disown him, if they are such as you say they are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, tell me, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> at all times, {{and in all}} circumstances, God causes {{events that}} are {{disastrous}} to work out good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{believe he}} would. And you've never seen anything, Basil, to make <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Fulkerson didn't {{appreciate}} {{you to the}} utmost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she began, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I don't {{know the}} {{difference}} between the report of a pistol and a rifle shot--" ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. 'You {{are very}} clever, Alice, but do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I believe <b>that</b> {{this is no}} shock to you? Oh, woman, why has this {{deception}} not struck you to the ground?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hilda, my {{religious}} Hilda," [...] whispered Miriam, suddenly {{drawing the}} girl close to her, [...] "do {{you know how}} it is with me? I would give all I have or hope--my life, O how freely--for one instant of your trust in God! You little guess my need of it. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> then, <b>that</b> He sees and cares for us?" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. But do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> dear Caroline, <b>that</b> {{legislation}} would improve matters in any way? I am told that, nowadays, all the married men live like bachelors, {{and all the}} bachelors like married men.|$|R
6000|$|Both {{the other}} men were staring at him with round eyes. [...] "What a {{perfectly}} extraordinary notion!" [...] cried Flambeau. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is the truth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure of that, Mr. Slope; I {{am quite}} sure of that;" [...] said the bishop, mollified: [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Harding {{should have the}} hospital?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She gave {{a kind of}} gasp of astonishment. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{would be}} right?" [...] She edged a little away from Dr. Morrell, as if with distrust.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> Morris, <b>that</b> {{the world}} wishes {{to have its}} methods of {{communication}} revolutionised? Aren't there enough telephones and phonograms and aerial telegraphs already? It {{seems to me that}} you merely wish to add a new terror to existence. However, there is no need to pursue an academical discussion, since this wretched machine of yours, on which you have wasted so much time, appears to be a miserable failure." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Altrurian {{looked at}} Mrs. Makely with an amazement visibly {{heightened}} by the air of complacency she put on after delivering this poser: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> Christ meant <b>that</b> <b>you</b> ought always to have the poor with you?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so!" [...] said Damian, the remark seeming {{to operate as}} a {{sedative}} which enabled him to collect his scattered thoughts.--"Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> so?--I thought <b>that</b> to have looked upon her once more--but no--you are in the right, old man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sort {{of society}} {{is good for}} the child,' he said sharply, as if there had been no {{interval}} since she proposed it, 'where's Miss Florence?' ...|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST. Your {{theory of}} {{education}} is delightful. But what influence will your critic, brought up in these exquisite surroundings, possess? Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any artist is ever affected by criticism? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I could doubt her?" [...] Gavin, said compassionately, and for {{the second}} time in twenty-four hours the earl learned that he did not know what love is.|$|E
5000|$|Tension {{and comedy}} between Wilson and Mainwaring is {{heightened}} by their difference in social class: Wilson had an {{upper middle class}} childhood and a public school education, prompting resentment from the lower middle class Mainwaring, who had to work his way up and views Wilson as having it easy. Mainwaring frequently emphasises his superior rank at the bank and in the Home Guard to maintain his authority and superiority over Wilson. Wilson undermines his superior through casual charm and frequent concern at Mainwaring's plans, querying, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> wise, sir?" [...] The contrasts are established in several ways: as a civilian, Mainwaring wears a bowler hat while Wilson wears a more fashionable Anthony Eden hat. In [...] "The Honourable Man", Wilson became [...] "The Honourable Arthur Wilson" [...] after an uncle who was a peer dies. Mainwaring tried {{to stay at the}} centre of attention; Wilson detested his new style and the expectations it brought him, which only infuriated Mainwaring more, as he believed one should revel in titles of nobility rather than be ashamed of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{honestly}} {{believe that you}} are diffident," [...] she admitted. [...] "I never met a millionaire before who was, and at first I {{thought it was a}} pose with you. Perhaps I was mistaken. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> don't <b>think,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have any attraction apart from your millions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> Firmin, <b>that</b> I am here as--as an infernal {{politician}} {{to put my}} crown and my flag and my claims and so forth {{in the way of}} peace? That little Frenchman is right. You know he is right as well as I do. Those things are over. We--we kings and rulers and representatives have been {{at the very heart of}} the mischief. Of course we imply separation, and of course separation means the threat of war, and of course the threat of war means the accumulation of more and more atomic bombs. The old game's up. But, I say, we mustn't stand here, you know. The world waits. Don't you think the old game's up, Firmin?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is a}} rum start," [...] his {{companion}} said {{when he had finished}} his story. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you will some day come in for all this money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{you think}} he would never allow it! <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> such a {{creature}} as Genevieve, as perfect a lady as ever existed, must always be a victim to these hateful rules about station.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} to be a retreat made at all," [...] Mrs. Conyers said, [...] "I prefer that it should be made now. Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is any real danger of attack?" ...|$|E
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Weak? Oh, I am sick {{of hearing}} that phrase. Sick of using it about others. Weak? Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> Arthur, <b>that</b> it is {{weakness}} that yields to temptation? I {{tell you that}} there are terrible temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to. To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no weakness in that. There is a horrible, a terrible courage. I had that courage. I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the letter this woman now holds. He made three-quarters of a million over the transaction.|$|R
6000|$|The way to Mr. Froggatt's was {{not very}} long, but it was long enough to {{overcome}} Lance's never very large amount of bashfulness; and he had made reply {{that he went to}} the Grammar School, and was in the second form, that he liked singing in the choir better than--no, not than anything--anything except--except what? Oh a jolly good snow- balling, or a game at hockey. Did he like the school? Pretty well, on the whole; but he did not suppose he should stay there long, his brother at the Clergy Orphan said there was such a lot of cads, and that he was always grubbing his nose among them; but now, 'do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> now <b>that</b> cads are always such bad fellows?' ...|$|R
40|$|A {{quarter century}} ago, in a {{presentation}} at the Academy 2 ̆ 7 s annual meeting, I used the phrase 2 ̆ 2 contract reader 2 ̆ 2 to characterize the role an arbitrator plays in construing a collective bargaining agreement. That two-word phrase {{may be the only}} thing I ever said before this body that has been remembered. Unfortunately, it is almost invariably misunderstood. Time and again members have reproached me: 2 ̆ 2 What 2 ̆ 7 s the big deal about contract reading, anyway? Isn 2 ̆ 7 t it just the same as contract interpretation? 2 ̆ 2 Or, more substantively scathing: 2 ̆ 2 Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> Ted, <b>that</b> all <b>you</b> have to do to interpret a labor agreement is to read it?! 2 ̆...|$|R
