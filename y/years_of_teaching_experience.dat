25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience,</b> both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if student perceptions of teacher effectiveness as measured by two selected instruments would correlate significantly when measured during the student <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and after one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience.</b> A second purpose was to determine if administrator perceptions as measured by two selected instruments would correlate significantly with student perceptions during the student <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and after one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience.</b> ^ Student perceptions were measured by the 7 -A Student Questionnaire (7 -A SQ) and the Purdue Teacher Evaluation Scale (PTES). Administrator or supervisor perceptions were measured by the Student Teacher Reference (STR) form and a validated Administrator Evaluation (AE) form. ^ Eleven hypotheses were investigated to answer the basic questions of this study. These questions were: (1) What is the relationship between scores from the PTES and 7 -A SQ taken during the student <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and scores from the PTES and 7 -A SQ taken after one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience?</b> (2) What is the relationship between scores from the student perception instruments, 7 -A SQ and PTES, and scores from the administrator perception instruments, STR and AE, both during the student <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and after one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience.</b> ^ Student and administrator perceptions from the actual <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> were gathered during the last quarter <b>of</b> the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience.</b> Statistical procedures included use of the Pearson correlation, dependent t-test, and step-wise regression analyses. The research hypotheses were tested at the. 05 level of significance. ^ The major findings of this study were as follows: (1) Scores of the 7 -A SQ during the student <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> significantly correlated to scores found one year later, but the PTES scores did not. (2) The two most significant predictors of Administrator Evaluation scores were STR scores and 7 -A SQ scores. ^ Findings of this study support the conclusion that information sources are valuable in determining teacher effectiveness. If, however, only one source of information were available when considering a first year candidate, the most predictive source would be the student teaching supervisor rating. ...|$|R
