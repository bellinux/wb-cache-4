500|$|The song created {{controversy}} over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now {{know for a fact}} that <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> [...] But there's nothing I can do about it. That's all I can say about it." [...] The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer didn't steal the song.|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song <b>you</b> <b>wrote,</b> so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E

500|$|According to the {{commentary}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky's school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment. In 2012, delusion of reformism was {{mentioned as a}} symptom of mental disorder in Psychiatry.

In the same year, Vladimir Pashkovsky in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4.7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform.

[...] Judge Jon Blue formally imposed six death sentences, one for each of the capital charges; Blue then added a sentence of 106 years for other crimes Hayes committed during the home invasion, including kidnapping, burglary, and assault, before finishing with, [...] "This is a terrible sentence, but is, in truth, a sentence <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> for yourself in flames. May God have mercy on your soul." [...] The judge also gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011; Blue said that this date was a formality, because if Hayes appealed his case, his execution could be delayed for decades. His death sentence became a life sentence in August 2015 when the state abolished the death penalty.|$|E
500|$|Rick Rubin had {{produced}} their two previous albums. However, the Chili Peppers {{decided to look}} for other producers for Californication. David Bowie had shown great interest in working with the band and asked to produce the album; however, the Chili Peppers chose to remain with Rubin for Californication. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought necessary for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Recording took place at Cello Studios in Los Angeles. In early 1999, following the recording process, the band played [...] "Scar Tissue", [...] "Otherside", and [...] "Californication" [...] to their managers, and {{it was decided that}} [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] would be the lead single for the album. To support their reunited line-up, the band played various proms across the country to promote Californication.

500|$|Comedian Jon Stewart {{took over}} as host of the show, which was retitled The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, on January 11, 1999. Stewart had {{previously}} hosted Short Attention Span Theater on Comedy Central, two shows on MTV (<b>You</b> <b>Wrote</b> It, You Watch It and an eponymous talk show), {{as well as a}} syndicated late-night talk show, and had been cast in films and television. In taking over hosting from Kilborn, Stewart initially retained much of the same staff and on-air talent, allowing many pieces to transition without much trouble, while other features like [...] "God Stuff", with John Bloom presenting an assortment of actual clips from various televangelists, and [...] "Backfire", an in-studio debate between Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown, evolved into the similar pieces of [...] "This Week in God" [...] and Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell's [...] "Even Stevphen". Since the change, a number of new features have been, and continue to be, developed. The ending segment [...] "Your Moment of Zen", previously consisting of a random selection of humorous videos, was diversified to sometimes include recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in the show. The show's theme music, [...] "Dog on Fire" [...] by Bob Mould, was re-recorded by They Might Be Giants shortly after Stewart joined the show.|$|E
