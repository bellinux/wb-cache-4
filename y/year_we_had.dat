[...] Maryland achieved a winning record each season during Byrd's first decade of coaching, from 1911 to 1920. In that period, the team also accumulated a 7–2–1 record against arch-rival Johns Hopkins. The following decade, the team played an increasingly difficult and farther afield schedule.

500|$|Within the Labour Party, Livingstone {{was aligned}} with the hard left. Historian Alwyn W.

[...] Biographer John Carvel, a journalist from The Guardian, remarked that Livingstone's political motivation was a [...] "fundamental desire... for a more participative, cooperative society", leading him to oppose [...] "concentrations of power and... exploitation in all its forms – economic, racial and sexual." [...] However, Livingstone has also described his approach to fiscal policy as [...] "monetarist": [...] "I was a monetarist right from the beginning when I was leader of the GLC.

500|$|Beginning in 2000, {{the small}} French village of Bugarach, {{population}} 189, began receiving visits from [...] "esoterics"—mystic believers who {{had concluded that}} the local mountain, Pic de Bugarach, was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army. [...] "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told The Independent in March 2012. [...] "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last <b>year</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [...] The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal." [...] In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors. Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared {{at the height of}} the [...] "event". Two raves were foiled, 12 people had to be turned away from the peak, and 5 people were arrested for carrying weapons. Jean-Pierre Delord was criticised by members of the community for failing to take advantage of the media attention and promote the region.|$|E

2500|$|Kenseth {{was born}} in Cambridge, Wisconsin. He made an {{agreement}} with his father, Roy, that Roy should buy a car and race, and Matt would work on the car until {{he was old enough}} to race. Kenseth began stock car racing in 1988 at the age of 16 at Madison International Speedway. [...] "My dad bought a car when I was 13 and raced it at Madison," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Neither of us knew much and it was a learning experience. He continued to race in 1988 and 1989. My first car– what might be considered a sportsman– was a 1981 Camaro that Todd Kropf had driven to championships at Madison and Columbus 151 Speedway. On the third night out I won a feature. I ran 15 features in 1983 and won two of them." [...] "The first night out in the Kropf car Matt won a heat race," [...] said Kenseth's father Roy. [...] "The third night he won the feature by holding off two of the best drivers at the track, Pete Moore and Dave Phillips, for 20 laps. Matt was smooth. I knew then {{he was going to be}} a racer." [...] He ran for the points title on Saturday nights at Wisconsin Dells in 1989. He finished second in points and won eight features. On Friday nights, he ran about half of the races at Golden Sands Speedway and half at Columbus 151 Speedway. In 1990, he bought a late model from Rich Bickle. In the season-opening race at Slinger Super Speedway, Kenseth inherited the lead and won his only race of the season when track champion Tony Strupp had a flat tire. He finished sixth in season points and won the track's rookie of the year award. Kenseth entered fifteen ARTGO events that season and raced in 40 features that year. After graduating from [...] Cambridge High School that summer, Kenseth worked for four years selling and shipping parts for Left-hander Chassis, a late model racecar chassis manufacturer just south of Wisconsin in Illinois. In 1991 he won the ARTGO race at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway to become the youngest winner in the series' history. He passed Joe Shear and Steve Holzhausen, and held off Steve and Tom Carlson for the win. 1992 was a difficult year for Kenseth. He won three races and blew up more engines than he could count. He was ready to quit racing after the season. [...] "I felt we were at a standstill", he said. [...] "I wasn't gaining. My dad and I had some major discussions at the end of the <b>year.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to find the dollars for a good program or I told him I would rather not race." [...] Kipley Performance loaned a motor to Kenseth for the season-final race at La Crosse and the team ran better. Kenseth built a new car for 1993 using a Kipley engine. He used the car at Madison to win eight features and finished second in the points. Mike Butz offered Kenseth the chance to race his late model, and it took some time for the combination to stop struggling before they started winning features. At the end of the season, they won the final short track series race at Madison, La Crosse, and I-70 Speedway.|$|E

60|$|In short, in {{less than}} a year it was all done, without any quarrel, any noise, any violence,--done, I scarce knew when or how, but with the utmost {{deference}} to my wishes, the most amiable hopes that I would not put myself out, the most sincere protestations that, if I liked it better as it was, my goddesses would give up and acquiesce.

In a <b>year</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a parlor with two lounges in decorous recesses, a fashionable sofa, and six chairs and a looking-glass, and a grate always shut up, and a hole in the floor which kept the parlor warm, and great, heavy curtains that kept out all the light that was not already excluded by the green shades.|$|E

Of course she was doomed. I knew it of both of them, though I had never heard the word spoken, or had spoken it to any one. And my father was very ill,--ill to dying, though I did not know it. And my mother had decreed to send my elder sister away to England, thinking that the vicinity of so much sickness might be injurious to her. All this happened late in the autumn of 1834, in the spring of which <b>year</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> come to Bruges; and then my mother was left alone in a big house outside the town, with two Belgian women-servants, to nurse these dying patients--the patients being her husband and children--and to write novels for the sustenance of the family!
