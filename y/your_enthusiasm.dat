5|$|Lawrence Gene David (born July 2, 1947) is an American comedian, writer, actor, playwright, and {{television}} producer.

5000|$|The show {{initially}} {{received a}} mixed reception, though {{after the second}} series reviews gradually shifted towards a fairly positive tone. The Daily Mirror found the mundane settings {{to be similar to}} the American sitcom Seinfeld, saying: compared to the ridiculous carry-on of My Family, it's much more low-key and realistic. In fact it's so low-key, nothing actually happens, which could well be a nod to Seinfeld - the touchstone of all great sitcoms. The getting ready for school chaos is like Supernanny: The Movie only with nicer children. It's also taken a leaf out of Curb <b>Your</b> <b>Enthusiasm's</b> book with large chunks of improvisation - although the strongest language you'll find here is [...] "ponk".|$|R
60|$|When I try {{to account}} for this effect I find no {{difficulty}} about it. I find that, as a rule, when a thing is a wonder to us it is not {{because of what we}} see in it, but because of what others have seen in it. We get almost all our wonders at second hand. We are eager to see any celebrated thing--and we never fail of our reward; just the deep privilege of gazing upon an object which has stirred the enthusiasm or evoked the reverence or affection or admiration of multitudes of our race is a thing which we value; we are profoundly glad that we have seen it, we are permanently enriched from having seen it, we would not part with the memory of that experience for a great price. And yet that very spectacle may be the Taj. You cannot keep <b>your</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> down, you cannot keep your emotions within bounds when that soaring bubble of marble breaks upon your view. But these are not <b>your</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> and emotions--they are the accumulated emotions and enthusiasms of a thousand fervid writers, who have been slowly and steadily storing them up in your heart day by day and year by year all your life; and now they burst out in a flood and overwhelm you; and you could not be a whit happier if they were your very own. By and by you sober down, and then you perceive that you have been drunk on the smell of somebody else's cork. For ever and ever the memory of my distant first glimpse of the Taj will compensate me for creeping around the globe to have that great privilege.|$|R
