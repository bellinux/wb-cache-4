500|$|In May 1967, {{the band}} {{recorded}} and released their first album for Reprise, Part One. By the time recording sessions began, Markley had assumed absolute {{control of the}} WCPAEB's publishing rights, which explains his unusual selection for the A-side of the album's singles: a [...] "spoken rap" [...] composition [...] "1906", co-penned with session musician Ron Morgan, and a cover of the Mothers of Invention's song [...] "Help, I'm a Rock". The album itself featured songs that exhibited a wide-ranging stylistic variety, including Byrds-esque folk rock, garage rock, and Baroque pop. The song [...] "I Won't Hurt You" [...] {{was one of two}} compositions (the other being [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>This</b> Love") from the group's debut album re-recorded for Part One, where it was given a much more suddued atmosphere and a heartbeat rhythm. Shaun Harris sang the reworked version of [...] "I Won't Hurt You", rather than Lloyd, who, aside from some backing vocals on the album, would not sing lead on a WCPAEB release until the 1969 album Where's My Daddy?.|$|E

500|$|... "Till the World Ends" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song, with an electro {{beat and}} {{elements}} of trance and Eurodance. The song opens with sirens and a [...] "sizzling" [...] bassline. Spears delivers confident and breathy vocals, in lyrics such as [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> good shit / Sicker than the remix / Baby let me blow your mind tonight." [...] In the chorus, the song slows down while Spears sings [...] "I can't take it take it {{take no more}} / Never felt like felt like this before / Come on get me get me on the floor / DJ what you what you waiting for?". The melody's 4:3 cross-rhythm continues into a chant-like segment, in which [...] "whoa-oh-oh-oh" [...] is repeated. The bit was compared by Scott Shettler of AOL to the [...] "rapid word repetition" [...] of Kesha. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said the chorus [...] "comes on hard like it's the sexy spawn" [...] of American recording artist Usher's [...] "OMG" [...] (2010) and Italian band Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E
500|$|Markley became {{motivated}} by the large crowd a rock band like the Yardbirds attracted, particularly the number of teenage girls, and proposed he would finance and secure a recording contract for the Laughing Wind, {{in exchange for his}} inclusion into the group. Impressed and slightly seduced by the much older Markley's wealth and entourage, the band accepted his offer. The decision to record as the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, rather than the Laughing Wind, was made by Markley, who envisioned the band as a west coast counterpart to the Velvet Underground. Looking to have something tangible to represent the band, in 1966, the WCPAEB released their debut album on Markley's FiFo label, Volume One. Much of the album was recorded at Lloyd's personal studio and a rented store-front on La Cienega Boulevard, before Markley joined the group; however, tracks such as [...] "Don't Break My Balloon" [...] and [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>This</b> Love" [...] indicate he had some influence over the later sessions for the album's development. While Volume One did feature a small selection of original material, the majority of the album was cover versions including [...] "Louie, Louie", [...] "You Really Got Me", and [...] "Baby Blue".|$|E

It's a lot to take on, but I told her she's ready, and we'll give her all the support she needs". Lohan said that the video's storefront setting was chosen because, in her words, [...] "my life is on display". Lohan also wanted to break a mirror during the bathroom scenes, because she wanted to show her real feelings in the video. Assistant director Jeb Bryan said to Lohan, [...] "This is real glass, Lindsay. We weren't prepared for you to break these things. [...] Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> slow motion?" [...] She responded, [...] "Regular frame will make it more violent. [...] I don't want it to be too pretty". The music video was first aired on MTV's Making the Video, and later released to iTunes Store on October 25, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|The Catalan {{government}} announced a referendum, {{to be held}} in November 2014, on the question of statehood. The referendum was to ask two questions: [...] "Do you want Catalonia to become a State?" [...] and (if yes) [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> State to be independent?" [...] The Spanish government referred the proposed referendum to the Spanish Constitutional Court, which ruled it unconstitutional. The Catalan government then changed it from a binding referendum to a non-binding [...] "consultation". Despite the Spanish court also banning the non-binding vote, the Catalan self-determination referendum went ahead on 9 November 2014. The result was an 81% vote for [...] "yes-yes", with a turnout of 42%. Mas called another election for September 2015, which he said would be a plebiscite on independence. Pro-independence parties fell just short of a majority of votes in the September election, although they won a majority of seats. The new parliament passed a resolution declaring the start of the independence process in November 2015, and the following year, new president Carles Puigdemont announced a binding referendum on independence. Although deemed illegal by the Spanish government and Constitutional Court, the referendum was held on 1 October 2017. In a vote where the anti-independence parties called for non-participation, results showed a 90% vote in favour of independence, with a turnout of 43%.|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone ranked the song at number eight on its list of the 50 Best Singles of 2011, writing {{that it is a}} triumphal love song, [...] "slathered in crazy sauce; marching-band drums, backward-counting backup singers, honking horns", and praising its hook. Additionally, Rob Sheffield ranked the song at number 3 on his list of The Top 25 Songs of 2011 writing, [...] "The harder she tries to come on crazy, the less crazy she sounds. She might be the most aggressively sane pop diva ever, even when she's boofing her boof boof." [...] Consequence of Sound's staff placed [...] "Countdown" [...] at number four on their list of the Top 50 Songs of 2011 and wrote, [...] "Beyoncé has transcended the traditional confines of pop diva status ... Queen B has built an empire of love songs and tributes to her boo(s), but none, be it on this album or the three before, come off as easily and thoroughly as they do here.

2500|$|Mas and ERC leader Oriol Junqueras {{signed an}} {{agreement}} by which the ERC would support the CiU on sovereignty issues while on other matters it might oppose it. The two leaders drafted the Declaration of Sovereignty and of the Right to Decide of the Catalan People, which {{was adopted by the}} parliament at its first sitting in January 2013. [...] The declaration stated that [...] "the Catalan people have, for reasons of democratic legitimacy, the nature of a sovereign political and legal subject", and that the people had the right to decide their own political future. The Spanish government referred the declaration to the Spanish Constitutional Court, which ruled in March 2014 that the declaration of sovereignty was unconstitutional; it did, however, allow that there existed a right to decide. On 11 September 2013, an estimated 1.6 million demonstrators formed a human chain, the Catalan Way, from the French border to the regional border with Valencia. The following month, the CiU, the ERC, the ICV-EUiA and Candidatura d'Unitat Popular (CUP) agreed to hold the independence referendum on 9 November 2014, and that it would ask two questions: [...] "Do you want Catalonia to become a State?" [...] and (if yes) [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>this</b> State to be independent?". A further mass demonstration, the Catalan Way 2014, took place on 11 September 2014, when protesters wearing the Catalan colours of yellow and red filled two of Barcelona’s avenues to form a giant [...] "V", to call for a vote. Following the Constitutional Court’s ruling, the Catalan government changed the vote to a [...] "process of citizen participation" [...] and announced that it would be supervised by volunteers. The Spanish government again appealed to the Constitutional Court, which suspended the process pending the appeal, but the vote went ahead. The result was an 81% vote for yes-yes, but the turnout was only 42%, which could be seen as a majority opposed to both independence and the referendum. Criminal charges were subsequently preferred against Mas and others for defying the court order.|$|E
