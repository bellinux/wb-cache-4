500|$|Stuntman Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the {{recommendation}} of special make-up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Before the producers contacted him, Mears had already heard about {{the production of a}} new Friday the 13th and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role. He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers. The studio worried that Mears' pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character, but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role. According to Mears, [...] "They were like, 'You're really nice...are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to switch over, right?' I was like, 'I cage fight..and I've got a lot of dad issues. So yeah.'". Mears said he related to [...] "Jason the victim" [...] when he was growing up, and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film. To Mears, Jason represents people who were bullied in high schoolspecifically those with physical deformitiesfor being outcasts. Jason is unusual because he exacts his revenge on those trying to take over his territory at Crystal Lake.|$|E

2500|$|Environmental Golf Course Design is an {{integral}} part of Hurdzan's golf course design style, which has been appreciated by golf lovers through his design of the Widow's Walk Golf Course in Scituate, Massachusetts (opened in 1996) and the Harbor Links Golf Course in North Hempstead, New York. In Howard Richman's article Man with the plans in the Golf Course Management (GCM) Magazine of December 2012, Hurdzan explained his golf course design approach in these words: [...] "Form follows function — you'll hear that a lot around here," [...] Hurdzan says. [...] "The form is something that is a direct result of the function it has to serve. That is why I work so closely with superintendents. I ask them 'How are you going to mow that?' … 'How are you going to rake that?' … 'Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to irrigate that?' I try to get a superintendent to think ahead. I don't want to leave them with problems. I want to leave them with solutions. That's why I like to get them involved." ...|$|E

I {{want to know how}} you can dedicate yourself to your forthcoming positions in the musical world, when you can't dedicate yourself right now to what you're doing in a simple little march. ... The world is full of people who do things just about right. Just about. And a few on the top do them just right—most of the time. Nobody's perfect!

The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day. And I don't only mean 5 minutes of 10; I mean 10 minutes out of 10; I mean 60 minutes out of an hour, 24 hours a day, at least all of your waking hours. ... I don't want it just about right!

I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know—a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is—they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.” ...|$|E
