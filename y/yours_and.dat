Further, he has {{the distinction of being}} a contributor to The Atheist's Guide to Christmas, and the editor of the documentary The Aristocrats.|$|E

The album failed to chart outside the US despite its lead single ("We Break The Dawn") peaking within the top fifty of the UK Singles Chart. As of April 2013 the album has sold 34,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

25|$|After {{a series}} of {{hearings}} beginning in September 1949, the FCC found the RCA and CTI systems fraught with technical problems, inaccurate color reproduction, and expensive equipment, and so formally approved the CBS system as the U.S. color broadcasting standard on October 11, 1950. An unsuccessful lawsuit by RCA delayed the first commercial network broadcast in color until June 25, 1951, when a musical variety special titled simply Premiere was shown over a network of five East Coast CBS affiliates. Viewing was again restricted: the program could not be seen on black-and-white sets, and Variety estimated that only thirty prototype color receivers were available in the New York area. Regular color broadcasts began that same week with the daytime series The World Is <b>Yours</b> <b>and</b> Modern Homemakers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{programmes}} are pre-recorded. Programmes transmitted live include Today, magazine programme Woman's Hour, {{consumer affairs}} programme You and <b>Yours,</b> <b>and</b> (often) the music, film, books, {{arts and culture}} programme Front Row. Continuity is managed from Broadcasting House with news bulletins, including the hourly summaries and longer programmes such as the Six O'Clock News and Midnight News, and news programmes such as Today, The World at One and PM, which by early 2013 had returned to Broadcasting House after 15 years at BBC Television Centre in White City. The news returning to Broadcasting House has also meant that newsreaders can provide cover for continuity, which regularly occurs at 23:00 each night and 16:00 on a Sunday. This has reduced {{the total number of}} continuity announcers required each day down from four to three.|$|E
25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and <b>yours,</b> <b>and</b> a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E

500|$|The Stones then {{launched}} into [...] "I'm <b>Yours</b> <b>and</b> I'm Hers", which, according to Philip Norman, was an ironic choice given that Marianne Faithfull and Marsha Hunt, {{both of whom}} Jagger was alleged to be having relationships with at that time, were in the audience.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} [...] "Shame" [...] {{revolves}} around [...] "the {{breakdown in the}} relationship" [...] that Williams and Barlow experienced after the former left Take That. Williams starts the song with the line, [...] "Well there's three versions of this story / Mine and <b>yours</b> <b>and</b> then the truth", whilst Barlow responds channeling his original attempt for reconciliation, [...] "I read your mind and tried to call / My tears could fill the Albert Hall." [...] Stuff.co.nz described the lyrics as [...] "happy ending" [...] and [...] "patch things up", when specifically singing the lines, [...] "I don't recall the reasons why, I must have meant them at the time, is this the sound of sweet surrender?" ...|$|E

Also performed, but previously unheard by the audience, were [...] "Midnight Rambler" [...] and [...] "Love in Vain" [...] from their forthcoming album Let It Bleed (released December 1969) and [...] "Give Me A Drink" [...] which eventually appeared on Exile on Main St. (released May 1972). The show also included the concert debut of [...] "Honky Tonk Women", which the band had just released the previous day.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} artist Jeff Koons for {{the project}} in early 2013; the two had met previously at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of <b>yours,</b> <b>and</b> when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E
500|$|Bach set {{the text}} in a complex {{structure}} uniting two singers, a solo oboe and a solo cello. The soprano and alto sing of their unity in [...] "neo-erotic" [...] or [...] "overtly erotic/Pietistic" [...] language: [...] "I shall die, if I have to be without you" [...] the one; [...] "I am <b>yours,</b> <b>and</b> you are mine!" [...] the other. The cello provides an intricate counterpoint throughout, which Albert Schweitzer describes as [...] "a motif of purified happiness". The voices and the cello form a trio, another symbol of the Trinity. The musicologist Anne Leahy of the Dublin Institute of Technology notes that Bach had possibly stanza 3 in mind, which speaks of love, and used the instrument which is named after love.|$|E

Suggestions for obtaining such a peace, utilizing space programs, include removal of worldwide educational and communication barriers, building of an emotionally and socially stable society, creation of a unit or whole world rather than the mine <b>and</b> <b>yours</b> concept, <b>and</b> reevaluation and reorientation of human relations and values...|$|R
500|$|The {{mission was}} notable {{for one of}} its promotional campaigns, [...] "Send Your Name To A Comet!". Visitors to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's website were invited to submit their name between May 2003 and January 2004, and the names gathered—some 625,000 in all—were then burnt onto a mini-CD, which was {{attached}} to the impactor. Dr. Don Yeomans, a member of the spacecraft's scientific team, stated [...] "this is an opportunity to become part of an extraordinary space mission... when the craft is launched in December 2004, <b>yours</b> <b>and</b> the names of your loved-ones can hitch along for the ride and be part of what may be the best space fireworks show in history." [...] The idea was credited with driving interest in the mission.|$|E
500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{was created}} by indie {{developer}} Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family. [...] The game's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights; Rohrer created it partially as an [...] "artistic statement" [...] on defending one's family through violence. He summarized his goals with the game as creating something [...] "that makes you feel violated and {{makes you want to}} protect stuff that’s <b>yours,</b> <b>and</b> puts you in the process of securing what’s yours." [...] However, he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocritical—since they are invading others' homes as well—was partially intentional and an [...] "elegant" [...] idea.|$|E
500|$|In March 1993, {{military}} incursions by Azeri {{forces and}} artillery barrages {{were reported to}} have been coming from the region, prompting military leaders to announce an offensive against the rayon. [...] However, a different reason was given by the Armenians' most successful commander of the conflict, Monte Melkonian. [...] According to Melkonian, the commander of the southern front in Martuni (Khojavend), the decision to take the town was a matter of certainty rather than choice. He stated, [...] "This is a historical issue... of course this is historical Armenia... And we'll vindicate that reality [...] with our guns. Unfortunately! It would be nice if the Azeris would understand that reality is reality, agree and say OK, it's <b>yours,</b> <b>and</b> that's that." [...] Questioned on the possibility of a large expulsion of civilians if the region was captured, Melkonian responded, [...] "A lot of blood has been spilled on both sides... The emotions are high and that isn't conducive to living together in near or medium future." ...|$|E

In front of an estimated 250,000 fans, the Stones performed their first gig with their newest guitarist, Mick Taylor. At the beginning of the show, Jagger read an excerpt fromShelley's poemAdonaïs, an elegy written on the death of his friendJohn Keats After which they released thousands of butterflies in Jones' memory before starting the show with a song by Johnny Winter, [...] "I'm <b>Yours</b> <b>and</b> I'm Hers". During the concert, they included two songs never before heard by the audience from two forthcoming albums, [...] "Midnight Rambler", [...] "Love in Vain" [...] (Let It Bleed – released December 1969), and [...] "Give Me A Drink" [...] (appeared on Exile on Main St. – released May 1972). [...] "Honky Tonk Women", released the previous day, was also played at the gig.|$|E
500|$|Taraki {{signed a}} Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship with the Soviet Union on 5 December 1978 which greatly {{expanded}} Soviet aid to his regime. Following the Herat uprising, Taraki contacted Alexei Kosygin, {{chairman of the}} USSR Council of Ministers, and asked for [...] "practical and technical assistance with men and armament". Kosygin was unfavorable to the proposal {{on the basis of}} the negative political repercussions such an action would have for his country, and he rejected all further attempts by Taraki to solicit Soviet military aid in Afghanistan. Following Kosygin's rejection Taraki requested aid from Leonid Brezhnev, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Soviet head of state, who warned him that full Soviet intervention [...] "would only play into the hands of our enemies – both <b>yours</b> <b>and</b> ours". Brezhnev also advised Taraki to ease up on the drastic social reforms and to seek broader support for his regime.|$|E
500|$|In 1846, Seward {{became the}} center of {{controversy}} in Auburn when he defended, in separate cases, two felons accused of murder. Henry Wyatt, a white man, was charged with fatally stabbing a fellow inmate in prison; William Freeman, an African American, was accused of breaking into a house after his release and stabbing four people to death. In both cases the defendants were likely mentally ill and had been abused while in prison. Seward, having long been an advocate of prison reform and better treatment for the insane, sought to prevent each man from being executed by using the relatively new defense of insanity. Seward gained a hung jury in Wyatt's first trial, though he was subsequently convicted in a retrial and executed despite Seward's efforts to secure clemency. Freeman was convicted, though Seward gained a reversal on appeal. There was no second Freeman trial, as officials were convinced of his insanity. Freeman died in prison in late 1846. In the Freeman case, invoking mental illness and racial issues, Seward argued, [...] "he is still your brother, and mine, in form and color accepted and approved by his Father, and <b>yours,</b> <b>and</b> mine, and bears equally with us the proudest inheritance of our race—the image of our Maker. Hold him then to be a Man." ...|$|E
