Cheeko said, {{swinging}} his tail {{in the most}} impudent manner imaginable, and I hopped off, determined that I'd never raise a paw in his behalf, {{no matter how much}} trouble he might be in; but, of course, when it seemed certain he'd be made over into a pie, as I'm going to tell you about, I quite forgot that he had insulted me when I was trying to do him a favor.|$|E

I cannot afford to take Grantham House, but neither can I afford to go on living here. I have decided to make a change, to try and economize, to try and live within my means.

[...] He said that he would not provide any additional paperwork to support his compensation request, and that [...] "you can take it or leave it." [...] Snyder closed his letter by stating: [...] "Further, I am extremely disgusted by the treatment of us by the Eighth Circuit in this case, and you are instructed to remove my name from the list of attorneys who will accept criminal indigent defense work.

Track 2 takes place a few years ago; track 1 took place when it was recorded. The action {{depicted}} in [...] "The Wayward Granddaughter" [...] and [...] "Slavin' Away" [...] does not include the character Olga Sarantos plays {{on the rest of the}} record. [...] "Slavin' Away" [...] imagines that character—the main character—fantasizing, a bit remotely, about the hard lot of other women. Now, I wouldn't guess that the Main Character actually thought the woman concerned was riding around in a Norton side-car and operating her own cottage industry trinket assembly/sweatshop: but it might have pleased her to picture it so. [...] "The Wayward Granddaughter" [...] is about a different Greek-American grandmother and her popular granddaughter ("Connie"). They're from Chicago's south suburbs and don't figure in the rest of the record; I wanted to have another (slightly younger) grandmother and family in there for perspective or comparison's sake, so to speak.
