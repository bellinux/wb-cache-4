50|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>scorpions,</b> {{like most}} other scorpions, will glow when exposed to a blacklight. This is {{particularly}} useful in <b>scorpion</b> detection, since <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> are active during the night, and can be easily spotted using this method. Typical UV LED flashlights enable their human operator to readily detect scorpions {{at a distance of}} approximately 6 feet. Newly molted scorpions will not glow under ultraviolet light for a few days after molting.|$|R
50|$|The {{scorpions}} of Nevada {{are well}} represented by four main families: Buthidae, Caraboctonidae, Vaejovidae and the intriguingly named Superstitioniidae. Nevada has 23 species of scorpion, including the extremely common striped <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion.</b> Other species of scorpion include the giant desert hairy <b>scorpion,</b> Baja California <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> and Hadrurus spadix. Nevada's hot climate {{makes it an}} ideal state for certain spiders to live. Spiders include Carolina wolf spider, jumping spider, funnel-weaving spider, crab spider, black widow and tarantula.|$|R
40|$|Painful venoms {{are used}} to deter predators. Pain itself, however, can signal damage and thus serves an {{important}} adaptive function. Evolution to reduce general pain responses, although valuable for preying on venomous species, is rare, likely because it comes with the risk of reduced response to tissue damage. <b>Bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> capitalize on the protective pain pathway of predators by inflicting intensely painful stings. However, grasshopper mice regularly attack and consume <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions,</b> grooming only briefly when stung. <b>Bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> venom induces pain in many mammals (house mice, rats, humans) by activating the voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav 1. 7, but {{has no effect on}} Nav 1. 8. Grasshopper mice Nav 1. 8 has amino acid variants that bind <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> toxins and inhibit Na+ currents, blocking action potential propagation and inducing analgesia. Thus, grasshopper mice have solved the predator-pain problem by using a toxin bound to a nontarget channel to block transmission of the pain signals the venom itself is initiating. Pain is adaptive in that it warns of tissuedamage. Thus, pain sensitivity is essentialfor survival. Humans who lack pain sen-sitivity often suffer through regular injury (1). Many animals (e. g., jellyfish, ants, wasps, spiders...|$|R
50|$|While {{nearly all}} {{scorpions}} are solitary, the Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> {{is a rare}} exception: during winter, packs of 20 to 30 scorpions can congregate.|$|R
50|$|In {{the arid}} regions {{inhabited}} {{by the southern}} grasshopper mouse, the Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> is plentiful and avoided by most predators because of the very painful sting it can inflict. The grasshopper mouse can feed on this scorpion with impunity even when the scorpion stings it repeatedly in the face. Researchers have found that a neural mechanism is involved that blocks the sending of pain messages to the brain. This mouse can normally feel pain from other sources, but can be temporarily insensitive to these stimuli after a dose of venom from a <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>scorpions,</b> {{like most}} other scorpions, are {{incredibly}} resilient. During US nuclear testing, scorpions, along with cockroaches and lizards, were found near ground zero with no recorded adverse effects.|$|R

5000|$|Centruroides bicolor is {{a species}} of <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> from Central America. Its {{specific}} name [...] "bicolor" [...] is from the Latin meaning [...] "two colored" [...] and refers to the markings of this species.|$|R
50|$|Hoffmannius spinigerus is a {{medium-sized}} scorpion with large adult {{males and females}} reaching nearly 60-70 mm, weighing approximately 9.5 mg. It can be differentiated from the Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> (Centruroides sculpturatus) by the brownish-tan stripes {{on the back of}} its tail along the keels or ridges; the tail is typically thicker than the hands and pedipalps, both of which are quite slender in the <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions.</b> Some others may have a base color of light yellow/golden brown with variable underlying ducky markings along its tail. The name spinigerus is derived from the spiniform granules at the ends of the dorsal keels of the tail.|$|R
5000|$|The LD50 in mice is 25 μg/kg for {{subcutaneous}} injections, and [...]60 μg/kg for intracerebroventricular injections. <b>Bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> venom {{is generally}} considered neurotoxic, and stings can be fatal.

50|$|Margatoxin (MgTX) is a peptide that {{selectively}} inhibits Kv1.3 voltage-dependent potassium channels. It {{is found}} in the venom of Centruroides margaritatus, also known as the Central American <b>Bark</b> <b>Scorpion.</b> Margatoxin was first discovered in 1993. It was purified from scorpion venom and its amino acid sequence was determined.|$|R
50|$|The insect species {{commonly}} found in the river corridor and tributaries are midges, caddis flies, mayflies, stoneflies, black flies, mites, beetles, butterflies, moths, and fire ants. Numerous species of spiders and several species of <b>scorpions</b> including the <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> and the {{giant desert hairy scorpion}} inhabit the riparian zone.|$|R

Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.|$|R
50|$|The Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> (Centruroides sculpturatus, {{included}} in Centruroides exilicauda) {{is a small}} light brown scorpion common to the Sonoran Desert in southwest United States and northwestern Mexico. An adult male can reach 8 cm in length (3.14 inches), while a female is slightly smaller, with a maximum length of 7 cm (2.75 inches).|$|R
50|$|Centruroides {{scorpions}} are {{unusual in}} that they are the only genus in the southwest that can climb walls, trees, and other objects with a sufficiently rough surface. <b>Bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> practice negative geotaxis, preferring an upside down orientation, which often results in people being stung due to the scorpion being on the underside of an object.|$|R
5|$|Arachnids {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine, and their venom has been studied for bioactive factors. In 1993 Margatoxin was synthesized from the venom of the Central American <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion,</b> Centruroides margaritatus. This peptide selectively inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels. Patented by Merck, {{it has the potential to}} prevent neointimal hyperplasia, a common cause of bypass graft failure.|$|R
50|$|Arizona <b>bark</b> <b>scorpions</b> prefer {{riparian}} {{areas with}} mesquite, cottonwood, and sycamore groves, {{all of which}} have sufficient moisture and humidity to support insects and other prey species. The popularity of irrigated lawns, and other systems which increase environmental humidity in residential areas, has led to a massive {{increase in the number of}} these animals in some areas.|$|R
50|$|The Robust {{burrowing}} scorpion (Opistophthalmus carinatus) is {{a widespread}} species of scorpion in the drier regions of southern Africa. It is a burrowing scorpion, which often places its burrow beside a large rock. Compared to others of its genus, it has a particularly sturdy body with large pinchers. It {{is also known as}} the Carinated <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion</b> or African yellow-leg scorpion.|$|R
50|$|The {{hot summer}} sun {{is too much}} for the <b>bark</b> <b>scorpion,</b> and they will seek shelter during the day.
