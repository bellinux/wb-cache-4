Distressed at having lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she {{immediately}} regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>out,</b> Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor. Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined {{by the rest of}} the student body.|$|E

The {{attendees}} greet Karofsky's {{election as}} Prom King with great enthusiasm, but a stunned silence falls when Kurt is declared Prom Queen due to having received an {{overwhelming number of}} unwanted write-in votes in the secret balloting. Humiliated, Kurt flees in tears, but is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>out,</b> Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. The traditional dance between King and Queen is next, and Karofsky is faced with having to partner with a boy {{in front of his}} classmates. He rejects Kurt's suggestion to come out at the prom, and abandons Kurt on the dance floor as the music begins; Blaine dances with Kurt instead. At the end of the season, the glee club travels to the Nationals competition in New York City. Kurt and Rachel sneak into the Gershwin Theatre where Wicked is playing, and from the stage they sing [...] "For Good", a song from the musical. They both decide to come back to New York after graduation. New Directions finishes in twelfth place at Nationals, and upon Kurt's return to Ohio, he and Blaine declare their love for one another.|$|E
500|$|In India, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{met with}} polarised {{reactions}} from film critics. While certain critics praised the visual richness and {{the performances of}} the cast, certain others were negative about the lengthy run time and criticised the script strength and inconsistencies.

2500|$|When picking {{characters}} {{to die in}} battle scenes, Martin chooses secondary or tertiary characters from the character lists without giving much thought, as he sees these characters as hardly developed {{and in some cases}} just as names. However, the death and time of death of many major characters have been planned from the beginning, although these scenes may not always be easy to write. A scene called the [...] "Red Wedding", which occurs about two thirds through A Storm of Swords and leaves several major characters dead, was the hardest scene Martin had ever written. He repeatedly skipped writing the chapter and eventually wrote it last for A Storm of Swords. Readership response ranged from praise to condemnation, but Martin said the chapter [...] "was painful to write, it should be painful to read, it should be a scene that rips <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>out,</b> and fills you with terror and grief." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some reviews were harsh, Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Too much of [...] "Echo" [...] is mired in soppy balladry and standard-issue dancery" [...] adding that [...] "When it works, however, {{as on the}} soaring Happy and feathery, synth-laden I Got You, all is (momentarily) redeemed". The Guardian said that [...] "Echo's 13 tracks, which were co-written by Justin Timberlake, OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder and other costly names, follow the formula of her debut: the slow, piano-accented build-up, punctuated by sharp intakes of breath and vocal curlicues, then the climactic {{explosion}} as the drums crash in and she hits the chorus. That voice is impressive enough and there's no denying the stolid catchiness of some songs – notably Happy and her cover of Oasis's Stop Crying <b>Your</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>Out</b> – but she appears to lack the lightness of touch this album desperately needs". Slant Magazine stated that [...] "...less compelling material, particularly in the album's second half, finds Lewis's talent squandered. The gooier adult contemporary numbers, of which [...] "I Got You" [...] is the worst, tend to add a lot of unnecessary vocal doctoring to the mix, edging on the faceless robo-pop that has become all too ubiquitous {{in the age of}} Auto-Tune. And too much of the album's runtime is dominated by altogether thoughtless ballads, like the languid late-album duo of [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Down," [...] in which Lewis confronts dull, piano-driven arrangements with vocals that, while technically unimpeachable, lack any warmth or emotional expression".|$|E

5000|$|Muraqaba {{is known}} as spiritual communion. In this {{practice}} one tries to unveil the mystery of life by losing oneself in it.

But it's our hearts which are draped by sins and so the heartbeat is heard as dhak dhak and not Allah Allah.
