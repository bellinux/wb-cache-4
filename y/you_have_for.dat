25|$|The kiss on {{the lips}} can be {{performed}} between two friends or family. This move aims to express the affection that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> a friend. Unlike kissing for love, a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The {{kiss on the}} lips is a practice {{that can be found}} in the time of Patriarchs (Bible). In Ancient Greece, the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank. In the Middle Ages, the kiss of peace was recommended by the Catholic Church. The kiss on the lips was also common among knights. The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.|$|E
500|$|The group {{purposely}} {{cut short}} {{the amount of}} time set aside for recording the album, and did not notify its label before beginning work on the record. The members hoped that these steps would bring them back to the days when they were a young, broke band who had to finish an album before the money ran out. [...] "There was something really interesting about that creative process when we were starting out," [...] explained Stump. [...] "The more time you have, the more potential <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> excess." [...] He felt that the process was reminiscent of the making of Take This to Your Grave because both albums were created using a [...] "first-thought, best-thought" [...] mentality: [...] "I think we were trying to find what making a record that way would sound like now, but with four adult Fall Out Boys." [...] Trohman called the recording process [...] "fun because [...] was so collaborative," [...] but difficult because it was rushed.|$|E
500|$|But here I {{would not}} be misunderstood. By the love of our country, I do not mean loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> your country by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public good you can. For I am certain persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E

500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E
500|$|O'Toole {{relished the}} {{opportunity}} {{that came with}} Jonathan's passing, {{even though she was}} saddened to see a friend leave the show. Martha taking the senate seat was a chance to explore more adult stories with her character beginning midway through season five, which was important for the actress since Clark was becoming an adult on the show. It also allowed for O'Toole the chance to depict [...] "strong emotions" [...] over Jonathan's death. Al Gough feels that Jonathan's passing allowed for them to explore more of Martha's smart and strong side, as well as her relationship with Lionel. The idea was to show that there was some form of attraction between Martha and Lionel, but that Martha would never have any romantic relationship with the billionaire, especially after all that he had done to her family. O'Toole likens Martha's interest in Lionel with that of watching a dangerous animal: [...] "It's that attraction <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] The actress believes that Martha's ultimate motivation was to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When it came time for Martha to leave the show, writer Todd Slavkin contends that they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on film. Slavkin explains that they could not do anything equivalent to what they gave John Schneider, as there were already so many storylines going on by the season six finale that they could not fit anything else in. The writers also realized that they could not kill off the character, and so chose to send her to the US Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage.|$|E

[...] Antiquiet published a negative review which described the album as [...] "music for the sneering scumbags who find kinship in {{the dregs of}} cultural rot". The website initially gave the album 1 out of 5 stars. Wes Borland responded to the review, stating [...] "The hatred <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> Fred {{is part of the}} reason we've succeeded.

Breslin notified police, who thought that the letter was probably from someone with knowledge of the shootings. The Breslin letter was sophisticated in its wording and presentation, especially when compared to the crudely written first letter, and police suspected that it might have been created in an art studio or similar professional location by someone with expertise in printing, calligraphy, or graphic design. The unusual writing caused the police to speculate that the killer was a comic letterer, and they asked staff members of DC Comics whether they recognized the lettering.

2500|$|... "Time-Bomb" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaskarth along with Squire, Bouvier and Comeau for a Simple Plan song. However, during {{the writing process}} they deemed it more of an All Time Low song. Gaskarth was then featured on the Simple Plan song [...] "Freaking Me Out" [...] from Simple Plan's Get Your Heart On! album. Gaskarth said the track [...] "paints a picture of a relationship in trouble, symbolised by a bomb that's about to go off." [...] According to Barakat, the track was [...] "the perfect song to bridge the gap" [...] between Nothing Personal and Dirty Work. Gaskarth said [...] "Just the Way I'm Not" [...] was an ode to Def Leppard, going as far to include a snare sample from one of their songs on the track. It talks about how [...] "relationships don't always work out as perfectly as a Top 40 hit would have us believe." [...] He called it [...] "a fun song, but a very personal one" [...] with a [...] "huge, anthemic chant-along chorus." [...] According to Gaskarth, [...] "Under a Paper Moon" [...] was inspired by Ella Fitzgerald's [...] "It's Only a Paper Moon" [...] where she [...] "talks about how when this person she wants around isn't with her everything feels fake ... I wanted to adopt and modernise [...]" [...] With [...] "Return the Favor", Gaskarth was [...] "thinking way outside of the box", mentioning that it was inspired by vaudeville and Queen.
