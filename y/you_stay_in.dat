25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante {{continued}} {{to write and}} record solo material. He had been doing so {{since the age of}} nine, but had never considered releasing his material to the public. That was until several of his friends—including Johnny Depp, Perry Farrell, Gibby Haynes and former Red Hot Chili Peppers band mate Flea—encouraged him to release the material he wrote in his spare time during the Blood Sugar Sex Magik sessions. Frusciante began working on final cuts of the songs he had been writing, and producing them at his home in mid-1992. The production process, however, became hampered by his increasingly severe addiction to heroin. Usually Just a T-Shirt was recorded in the order it appears, with the final tracks being recorded shortly prior to Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers. Frusciante's use of heroin and cocaine became more extreme during the final stages of recording in late 1993; he began viewing drugs as the only way to [...] "make sure <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, a Baptist {{minister}} from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging {{women in the}} sex industry to quit. He commended Veitch [...] "for her zeal and desire to reach the lost for Christ", but asked, [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the industry and {{have a relationship with}} God?", and quoted , a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?" [...] At the 2006 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, photographer Michael Grecco photographed Veitch, Albee, and Huerter and included the image in his 2007 book [...] In the image caption, he called the trio a [...] "devout Christian trinity". Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the organization's evangelism [...] "America's most unusual Christian outreach operation". A journalist for UK newspaper The Observer compared JC's Girls to XXXchurch.com, writing in 2006 that both of [...] "these ministries are in some way reforming the church as well as their would-be followers." ...|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E

[...] According to a disclosure form Allen filed on May 12, 2000, he was paid $450,000 by the firm between January 1999 and April 2000.|$|E
