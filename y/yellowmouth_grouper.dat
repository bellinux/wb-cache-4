50|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus hyphessometochus is a diplectanid monogenean {{parasitic}} on {{the gills}} of the <b>Yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper,</b> Mycteroperca interstitialis. It {{has been described}} by Kritsky, Bakenhaster and Adams in 2015.|$|E
50|$|The type-host {{and only}} {{recorded}} host is the <b>Yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper,</b> Mycteroperca interstitialis (Serranidae: Epinephelinae). The type-locality if 115 miles NW of Tampa, Florida; the single other locality is 135 miles SW of Galveston, Texas.|$|E
50|$|These {{fish have}} a few threats facing them. There is always the threat of overfishing. <b>Yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper</b> has an amazing taste so people are always looking to eat some which causes the market for them to spike {{resulting}} in overfishing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper</b> will {{occasionally}} swim into shallower waters, but normally {{lives in}} deep waters. It {{is also found}} on rocky bottoms and coral beds that range from 4 to 55 meters in depth. The smaller individuals will stay in the shallows.|$|E
50|$|Mycteroperca interstitialis (commonly {{known as}} the <b>yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper,</b> {{crossband}} rockfish, grey mannock, hamlet, harlequin rockfish, princess rockfish, rockfish, salmon grouper, salmon rock fish and the scamp) is a species of grouper that lives in the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean in the tropical waters. It {{is also found in}} pockets in Brazil. It is a fairly large fish and it gets its name from the yellow around its mouth.|$|E
50|$|Mycteroperca microlepis (the gag, gag grouper, velvet {{rockfish}} or charcoal belly) is {{a species}} of grouper from warmer parts of the West Atlantic, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. It is a drab, mottled-gray fish lacking the distinguishing features of most other groupers. Its pattern of markings resemble the box-shaped spots of the black grouper. It lacks the streamer-points on the tail fin that scamp (Mycteroperca phenax) and <b>yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper</b> (M. interstitialis) have, and lacks yellow coloration around the mouth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper</b> is very widely spread. It {{covers the}} waters {{surrounding}} Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Aruba; Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bermuda; Brazil; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Cuba; Dominica; Dominican Republic; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Mexico; Montserrat; Netherlands Antilles; Puerto Rico; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; United States; United States Minor Outlying Islands; Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of; Virgin Islands, British; Virgin Islands, U.S. It is fished around the southwest Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper</b> {{is fairly}} large and robust. It has yellow {{markings}} on its sides {{as well as}} its mouth and they also appear on its upper dorsal fin. It has rusty brown stripes that run down the side of its body and a white underbelly. The fins are a blueish colour but also include a bit of gray. They can potentially grow up to 70 cm, but most stop growing at 40 cm. Some variants of this fish have mort distinct brown markings as opposed to yellow. The juvenile is similarly coloured except it contains darker brown stripes and overall is darker brown.|$|E
40|$|Seventeen of twenty-three {{species of}} {{groupers}} {{collected from the}} western Atlantic Ocean and adjacent waters were infected with 19 identified species (13 new) of Pseudorhabdosynochus Yamaguti, 1958 (Dactylogyridea, Diplectanidae); specimens of the Spanish flag Gonioplectrus hispanus, coney Cephalopholis fulva, marbled grouper Dermatolepis inermis, mutton hamlet Alphestes afer, and misty grouper Hyporthodus mystacinus were not infected; the <b>yellowmouth</b> <b>grouper</b> Mycteroperca interstitialis and yellowfin grouper Mycteroperca venenosa were infected with unidentified species of Pseudorhabdosynochus; the Atlantic creolefish Paranthias furcifer was infected with an unidentified species of Diplectanidae {{that could not be}} accommodated in Pseudorhabdosynochus. The following species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are described or redescribed based entirely or in part on new collections: Pseudorhabdosynochus americanus (Price, 1937) Kritsky & Beverley-Burton, 1986 from Atlantic goliath grouper Epinephelus itajara; Pseudorhabdosynochus yucatanensis Vidal-Martínez, Aguirre-Macedo & Mendoza-Franco, 1997 and Pseudorhabdosynochus justinella n. sp. from red grouper Epinephelus morio; Pseudorhabdosynochus kritskyi Dyer, Williams & Bunkley-Williams, 1995 from gag Mycteroperca microlepis; Pseudorhabdosynochus capurroi Vidal-Martínez & Mendoza-Franco, 1998 from black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci; Pseudorhabdosynochus hyphessometochus n. sp. from Mycteroperca interstitialis; Pseudorhabdosynochus sulamericanus Santos, Buchmann & Gibson, 2000 from snowy grouper Hyporthodus niveatus and Warsaw grouper Hyporthodus nigritus (new host record); Pseudorhabdosynochus firmicoleatus n. sp. from yellowedge grouper Hyporthodus flavolimbatus and snowy grouper H. niveatus; Pseudorhabdosynochus mcmichaeli n. sp., Pseudorhabdosynochus contubernalis n. sp., and Pseudorhabdosynochus vascellum n. sp. from scamp Mycteroperca phenax; Pseudorhabdosynochus meganmarieae n. sp. from graysby Cephalopholis cruentata; Pseudorhabdosynochus beverleyburtonae (Oliver, 1984) Kritsky & Beverley-Burton, 1986 from dusky grouper Mycteroperca marginata; Pseudorhabdosynochus mizellei n. sp. from red hind Epinephelus guttatus; Pseudorhabdosynochus williamsi n. sp. from rock hind Epinephelus adscensionis; Pseudorhabdosynochus bunkleywilliamsae n. sp. from Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus; Pseudorhabdosynochus mycteropercae n. sp. from tiger grouper Mycteroperca tigris; and Pseudorhabdosynochus tumeovagina n. sp. from speckled hind Epinephelus drummondhayi. Pseudorhabdosynochus woodi n. sp. from red hind Epinephelus guttatus is described based on specimens from the US National Parasite Collection (USNPC). Drawings of the haptoral and copulatory sclerites of the type specimens in the USNPC of Pseudorhabdosynochus monaensis Dyer, Williams & Bunkley-Williams, 1994 from rock hind Epinephelus adscensionis are presented. Finally, a note confirming Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli Yamaguti, 1958 rather than its senior synonym Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1938) Kritsky & Beverley-Burton, 1986 as the type species of Pseudorhabdosynochus is provided...|$|E
