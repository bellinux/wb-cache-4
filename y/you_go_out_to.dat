6000|$|... "In {{company he}} is. But he always {{says he could}} never do with a talking wife. He must have quiet at home. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> gossip, he affirms; you come home to read and reflect." ...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{individuals}} who {{have contributed to the}} success of this study and who need to be recognized for their contributions. Foremost, this study {{would not have been possible}} without the guidance of my thesis supervisor, Dr. Eric MacIntosh. His leadership, knowledge and endless support were extremely helpful and made the completion of this research possible. A big thank <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the members of my committee, Dr. Norman O’Reilly & Dr. Benoit Séguin. Their knowledge and expertise were also very helpful and their feedback and recommendations played a key role in this study. I would also like to thank the members of the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group who gave me an opportunity to do this case study and were a pleasure to work with. An additional thank <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> my colleagues at the Canadian Olympic Committee who have supported me through these last few months and made the completion of this project possible. A special thank <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> to my supervisor, Jessica Bromley for supporting me through this process and teammates Andrée St-Éloi-Chartrand and Derek Covington for all of their extra efforts during my time away. Last but not least, a big thank <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> my friends and family for their endles...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Depend upon it, 'tis {{easier to}} keep the peace at a distance. Fancy the having to call for her {{whenever}} <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dinner. And oh! imagine the father, mother, and half-dozen sisters that will be always staying there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Brown, reflectively, [...] "there is {{something}} I could suggest, but I {{would like to}} ask another question." [...] He stopped a moment, and tapped the palm of one hand with his glasses. [...] "Why did <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Africa?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{the very}} people we were talking of at Leeds," [...] said Moulder, turning to Kantwise. [...] "Mason and Martock; don't you {{remember}} how <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Groby Park to sell some of them iron gimcracks? That was old Mason's son. They are the same people." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her lip curled, and then, {{turning to}} me, she continued: [...] "If there are houses in your island without mothers in them, {{it is not}} so {{elsewhere}} in the world. That <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> travel so poorly provided with knowledge is a marvel to us; and as I have had the pain of telling you this, I must regret that you ever left your own home." ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland laughed. [...] "Madam," [...] he said, [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there <b>to</b> {{the prairie}} and trust {{yourself}} alone {{to such a}} man as I am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want you," [...] Jeanne said, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{leave the}} door unlocked. That is all. It {{will not make}} any {{difference}} to you so far as your position here is concerned, because your mistress is sending you all away in a few days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard about}} yesterday," [...] said Dunster. [...] "It {{must have been}} a rag! Couldn't we work off some other rag on {{somebody}} before I go? I shall be stopping here till Monday in the village. Well hit, sir--Adair's bowling is perfectly simple if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And your father, {{your poor}} father, Amy. Because {{he is not}} free to show himself and to speak for himself, you would let such people insult him with impunity. If you don't feel for {{yourself}} because <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> work, you might at least feel for him, I should think, knowing what he has undergone so long.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't much matter. You said {{something}} about some property you've got in diamonds, and you said once that <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> look after it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{about the}} iron church, papa. He {{says it is}} come--or part of it has, come--and he wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Cumberly Green about the site." ...|$|R

[...] "Why don't boys like <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the country to work, instead of staying in the city, where you can hardly keep soul and body together?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You, my children, are now God's people; if you {{are truly}} faithful, you shall assuredly prevail; if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> battle firmly, absolutely, entirely trusting in the {{strength}} of His right hand--that right hand, that Almighty arm shall be on your side. And who then shall stand against you?--though tens, {{and hundreds of thousands}} swarm around you, they shall yield before you--they shall fall before you as the giant Goliath fell before the shepherd David.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Strangewey," [...] {{she begged}} earnestly, [...] "you won't believe a word she says, will you? All my life I {{have been looking}} for a single and steadfast attachment. Of course, if Louise wants to monopolize you, I shall fall into the background, as I usually do; but if you think that I am going to accept hints and let <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dinner alone, you are very much mistaken. To-night, at any rate, I insist upon coming!" ...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Janice Hermann is a {{wonderful}} adviser who provided me with {{a tremendous amount of}} support and encouragement throughout my graduate endeavors at Oklahoma State University. She is a thoughtful person who always had my best interests in mind when guiding me through the graduate process. Additionally, the PITA emails really kept me on track – thank you. A big thank <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Stephany and Joshua for their support and understanding. I {{would also like to thank}} my mom and dad, Adelaide and Tom Phelps...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Chatto, {{rising to}} go, [...] "as {{everything}} is satisfactory I hope <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Hotten's house {{and have a}} friendly talk. It is his wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{see that}} stream which comes foaming down the notch into the lake in front of us?" [...] she asked. [...] "Let us suppose that you lived in a cabin beside that brook; and that once in a while, when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> draw your water, you saw a nugget of--gold washing along with the pebbles on the bed. How many days {{do you think you}} would be in coming to the {{conclusion}} that there was a pocket of gold somewhere above you, and in starting in search of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{ask me for}} any {{meanings}} now," [...] she said. [...] "I {{want you}} and your uncle {{to take me to}} the Collingwoods'. I suppose you are on your way there, for they wrote you were coming. And oh! let us be quick, for I'm afraid Jane will come down, and she will be sure to wake up aunty. I saw one of <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the barn, and knew you intended to leave, so I got ready just as fast as I could. But I must leave some word for aunty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'His feelin's is all wery well, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller; 'and as they're so wery fine, and it's a pity {{he should}} lose 'em, I think he'd better keep 'em {{in his own}} buzzum, than let 'em ewaporate in hot water, 'specially as they do no good. Tears never yet wound up a clock, or worked a steam ingin'. The next time <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a smoking party, young fellow, fill your pipe with that 'ere reflection; and for the present just put that bit of pink gingham into your pocket. 'Tain't so {{handsome}} that you need keep waving it about, as if you was a tight-rope dancer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, boys, that {{twenty minutes}} {{is about the}} right length of time for the recess, all told--that is, from the time <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{the time when you}} are all back in your seats again, quiet and ready to resume your studies. I found {{yesterday}} that it took five minutes for you all to come in--that is, that it was five minutes from the time the bell was rung before all were in their seats; and to-day I shall ring the bell after fifteen minutes, so as to give you time to come in. If I find to-day that it takes ten minutes, then I will give you more time to come in to-morrow, by ringing the bell after you have been out ten minutes." ...|$|E
40|$|I am very {{grateful}} for the wonderful journey I have experienced in the Counselor Education Program at SUNY Brockport. The amount of self-awareness I have achieved, {{in the past three}} years, has been enormous. It has been a whirlwind of experiences that made me grow as a person and has allowed me to form wonderful connections with my professors, supervisors and clients. The memories of my experiences will be cherished and applied toward my future endeavors to inspire individuals the way this program has inspired me.

40|$|Many ‘thank you’s are {{in order}} towards {{everyone}} who has supported me physically, emotionally, and financially during my tenure at the University of Texas at Arlington. I {{would like to thank}} Dr. Smith and Dr. Dobbs for agreeing to chair my thesis. A special thank <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Dr. del Carmen for his many hours of encouraging words to motivate me to successfully complete my thesis, graduate from the university, and to strive onward toward a doctorate. My grandparents have been a huge support base, especially financially over the past years. I appreciate my parents for my up-bringing, and instilling in me a drive for success and over-achievement...|$|R

"I don't {{think that}} sort of {{excitement}} will be nice," [...] Dick replied; [...] "it must be horribly anxious work to think every time <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> work that the place may be attacked and every one killed before you get back. But that is all nonsense, you know; I have been reading {{about some of the}} Kaffir wars; they are in the bush-country, down by the sea. We are going up on to the high lands at the back of Natal. Father says very likely we may buy a farm in the Transvaal, but mother does not seem to like the accounts of the Dutchmen or Boers, as they are called, who live there, and says she would rather have English neighbours; so I expect {{if we can get a}} farm somewhere in the Natal colony, we shall do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We shall remember, mother!--we shall remember!' {{continued}} the Pagan softly, 'and be happy in our remembrances! My brother, who loves me not, will love you when I am gone! You will walk {{in my little}} garden, and think on me {{as you look at}} the flowers that we have planted and watered together in the evening hours, when the sky was glorious to behold, and the earth was all quiet around us! Listen, mother, and kiss me! When I go to the far country, I will make a garden there like my garden here, and plant the same flowers that we have planted here, and in the evening I will go out and give them water at the hour when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> give my flowers water at home; and so, though we see each other no more, it will yet be as if we laboured together in the garden as we labour now!' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{is placed}} {{the last of}} the Divine sciences, not as their {{culminating}} power, but as the last which can be rightly learned. You must know all the others, before <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> battle. Whereas the general principle of modern Christendom is to go out to battle without knowing any one of the others; {{one of the reasons for}} this error, the prince of errors, being the vulgar notion that truth may be ascertained by debate! Truth is never learned, in any department of industry, by arguing, but by working, and observing. And when you have got good hold of one truth, for certain, two others will grow out of it, in a beautifully dicotyledonous fashion, (which, as before noticed, is the meaning of the branch in Logic's right hand). Then, when you have got so much true knowledge as is worth fighting for, you are bound to fight for it. But not to debate about it, any more.|$|E

Not until {{she sees her}} home again will she find her womanhood, and then all this story will be {{forgotten}} by her. Of her father you must tell her that he died when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> hunt the river-beasts together, and if she seeks for certain others, that they have gone away. But I think that she will ask little more when she learns that he is dead, since I have laid that command upon her soul." ...|$|R
