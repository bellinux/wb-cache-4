60|$|The duke looked sad; {{his wife}} seemed plunged in {{profound}} thought; {{there was a}} silence of many moments. At length the duchess looked up, and said, in a calmer tone, and with an air of great seriousness, 'It seems that we have mistaken the character of our son. Thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to us so quickly in our trouble, Mr. Bernard. It was very kind, as you always are.' Mr. Bernard took the hint, rose, bowed, and retired.|$|E
40|$|Thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> today. It’s a {{pleasure}} to be here in Salt Lake City. You’ve got nearly everything here—mountains, desert, and, of course, the lake. In fact, as a native Californian, I would say the only thing that’s missing is the ocean. My subject today is the outlook for the economy. We are now two full years into the economic recovery, yet progress on restoring the economy from the damage caused by the financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession remains discouragingly slow. The news from the jobs front has been particularly disappointing, with the unemployment rate—currently 9. 2 percent—stubbornly high. This afternoon, I’ll give my perspective on why economic growth has been so modest and offer my outlook for the future, which anticipates some improvement during the second half of this year and next year. I’ll also talk about inflation, which has seesawed in recent months. Finally, I’ll explain what the Federal Reserve is doing to promote maximum employment and price stability. As usual, my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. Before I go any further, I should say a few words about the budget and debt limit situation in Washington, which is going down to the wire. I’ll refrain from commenting o...|$|E
40|$|Thank <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> today. This {{afternoon}} I’ll {{be talking}} about the economy—where it’s headed and my thoughts about why it hasn’t done better. I should stress that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. My title is “Sailing into Headwinds: The Uncertain Outlook for the U. S. Economy. ” You’ll notice that I use the word “sailing, ” not “sinking. ” Given the very real economic disappointments we’ve experienced lately, it’s {{important to keep in mind}} that we are making forward progress. Our economy continues to expand, even if the pace is slow. For those of you who are familiar with sailing, it’s like beating to the windward with a very stiff breeze in our face. You don’t get there fast and the voyage is rough, but eventually you do reach safe harbor. I am confident we will find safe harbor, even if we feel a little seasick right now. Certainly we have experienced lackluster growth over the past several months and we face significant risks that could hold back the tempo of recovery. But the situation is much improved from the depths of the recession. The private sector is adding jobs and a truly terrible financial crisis is largely behind us. To keep things in perspective, think back to where we were just tw...|$|E
