500|$|Taylor's {{high-profile}} {{verbal and}} physical clashes with Huff were well-noted. [...] "He was always hooting his mouth {{off on the}} field," [...] Huff said of Taylor. [...] "He'd tell me, 'Yeah, you're just a big talker.' He brought the best out in <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> an unusual player, a great player, but an agitator ... I did everything I could to that sonofabitch." [...] The 1962 championship game between the Packers and Giants featured hard hitting and skirmishes throughout by both players, after which Taylor acknowledged there were [...] "some hard feelings" [...] between the two. Boxing promoter Al Flora, after watching the game on television, offered Taylor and Huff $2,000 for a four-round boxing match {{to be held in}} Baltimore on January 28, 1963. His offer was turned down, however.|$|E
2500|$|Truesdale {{had kind}} words for his successor, Peter J. Hurtgen. [...] "He's not an ideologue," [...] Truesdale said in October 2002.

But he was always very fair." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} arrived in 2007. When Gould was in Los Angeles in 1956, he met Cornelia Foss and her husband Lukas. Cornelia was an art instructor who had studied sculpture at the American Academy in Rome; Lukas worked for both the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Brooklyn Philharmonia. After several years, Gould and Cornelia Foss became lovers. Foss left her husband in 1967 for Gould, taking their two children with her to Toronto. She purchased a house near Gould's 110 St. Clair Avenue West apartment. In 2007, Cornelia Foss finally admitted that she and Gould had had a love affair lasting several years. According to Foss, [...] "There {{were a lot of}} misconceptions about Glenn, and it was partly because he was so very private. But I assure <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an extremely heterosexual man. Our relationship was, among other things, quite sexual." [...] Their affair lasted until 1972, when she returned to her husband. As early as two weeks after leaving her husband, Foss noticed disturbing signs in Gould. She alluded to a serious paranoid episode: ...|$|E

30|$|B: But {{we have to}} {{know this}} that some people only to give just like you said in teamwork.
