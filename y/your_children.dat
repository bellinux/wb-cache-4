5|$|Many of Khrushchev's {{innovations}} {{were reversed}} after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, {{as was the}} division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program {{for high school students}} was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries. People were required to register to attend, and church-going would bar you from party membership, from promotion, from better housing and <b>your</b> <b>children</b> {{would not be able to}} get into the better schools.|$|E

25|$|Hauerwas {{finds the}} {{language}} of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even {{the understanding of the}} family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to <b>your</b> <b>children,</b> not just because you brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up {{in a way that is}} conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s bottom line is that there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.|$|E

[...] Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy. It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general, potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one's opponent will be moving quickly.|$|E

He then explained how the Spirit came to be poured out, recounting Jesus’ ministry and passion and then proclaiming his resurrection and enthronement at the right hand of God.
