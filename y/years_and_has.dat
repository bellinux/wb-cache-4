5|$|Air Vice Marshal Ellis Charles Wackett, CB, CBE (13August 1901– 3August 1984) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

Commencing his service career as a Royal Australian Navy cadet during World WarI, Wackett transferred to the Air Force in 1923 while on an engineering course in Britain. He qualified as a pilot before completing his studies and returning to Australia, where he inaugurated parachute instruction within the RAAF and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft in 1926. The following year, he led a three-month survey flight to Papua New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{hypothesis}} of LDR is in contradiction to some embryological studies on birds which show that, from five developmental sites, the digits that develop are the three middle digits (II, III, IV). This inconsistency has {{been a matter of}} debate for almost 200 <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> been used by Alan Feduccia to support the controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but from some other group of archosaurs which had lost the first and fifth digits. To explain the discrepancy between morphological and embryological data in the context of bird origins, an alternative scenario to LDR was developed by Tony Thulborn and Tim Hamley in 1982. In this scenario, the digits I and V of theropods were reduced in the process of Bilateral Digit Reduction (BDR), with the remaining digits developing to resemble the former digits I-III. Limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for the BDR hypothesis due to it - and other ceratosaurians - having a reduced first digit, with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among the tetanurans (the sister group of the ceratosaurians).|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a fan-made mod called The Nameless Mod (TNM) was {{released}} by Off Topic Productions.

The mod was developed over 7 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> thousands of lines of recorded dialogue and two different parallel story arcs. Upon its release, TNM earned a 9/10 overall from PCPowerPlay magazine. In ModDB's 2009 Mod of the Year awards, The Nameless Mod won the Editor's Choice award for Best Singleplayer Mod.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom {{for a long period of}} time, sometimes for many <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>has</b> shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E
