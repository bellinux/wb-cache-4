5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the more <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> the better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.|$|E

His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work {{involved}} travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying {{to find someone to}} transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. [...] "I showed him how", Gerry Kulwicki said. [...] "And he said: 'Why don't <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for a while, you can do it better.'" ...|$|E

Carlos Beltrán was the best, at 88.3%. Sharing his {{philosophy}} on stealing bases, he said: [...] "It takes the art of stealing away if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> when you're four runs up or four runs down, and the opposing team is just worried about getting outs, not stolen bases. The idea is to steal them when you need them." ...|$|E

500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You {{have an idea of}} how you're going to do something, and it's your vision... unless <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing." ...|$|E
500|$|As [...] states, this [...] "short tutti {{outburst}} ... closes this superb chorus in a {{blaze of}} 'Herrlichkeit'." [...] , commenting on the change of mood in the final section, writes, [...] "The sense of relief after the stifling pathos of the opening sections is palpable ... After so much pathos, the final coda led by the sopranos releases the pent-up energy in an explosion of joy." [...] comments, [...] "The words, to the end of this section, are based on Isaiah 58:7-8 ... It brings Jesus’ words to mind, ‘Inasmuch as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> unto them, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> unto me’ and his denunciation of the careless rich. Isaiah continues, ‘Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee.’ Bach sets the paraphrase of these last words to a glorious fugue, with two expositions, and so brings to an end one of his finest choruses and one that is worthy indeed of the inspired words of Isaiah.” [...] also expresses his admiration for Bach's setting: [...] "The chorus of the first movement, set to two beautiful verses of Isaiah, brings out the meaning of that text in the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed [...] are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,' and the cantata ...|$|E

500|$|According to Lee, several core {{concepts}} {{were already}} in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's [...] "frozen heart" [...] hook: [...] "That was a concept and the phrase... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart." [...] They already knew the ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter what you have to do to the story, do it.

500|$|Wolpaw {{said that}} while many story {{elements}} of Portal are revisited in Portal 2, he avoided some of the memes—such as the frequently repeated [...] "the cake is a lie". He said, [...] "if {{you thought you were}} sick of the memes, I was sick of it way ahead of you". Wolpaw [...] "couldn't resist putting in just one" [...] cake joke. The writers did not try to predict or write new memes, and Wolpaw said, [...] "you can't really plan for [...] because if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> probably seems weird and forced". Portal 2 produced its own memes, including a space-obsessed personality core. Valve later created a Space Core modification for the game [...] (see below), and the Space Core also appeared as a laser-based engraving on a panel manufactured by NASA for the International Space Station.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", said Charles, [...] "but I forgive you because <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> to get your bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E
500|$|Kolbe {{thought at}} first that casting Robinson was [...] "really off-the-way" [...] but he felt the actor made the episode [...] "bloom". He gave general {{guidelines}} to Robinson about how he could approach the character, but it was Robinson who developed the traits of the character. Kolbe also praised the writing saying that [...] "I wish there was more writing like this for television. I think we'd have a much healthier industry." [...] Robinson said that Garak was a complicated character which required the use of subtext, adding that it wasn't {{a simple way to}} portray a character [...] "but when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> well, you really get people's attention". He was told by the producers that they intended to bring him back onto the show, but in a later interview, he said that this was commonplace in the industry and doesn't usually occur. When he was brought back for the second-season episode [...] "", executive producer Ira Steven Behr apologized for not bringing him back sooner.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most {{of the time we}} have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in {{restaurant}} and {{walk down the}} street. During the bridge, as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings [...] "Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't forget how <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna believe you and me/We can figure it out", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut. The video ends with a close-up shot of Rihanna against a white backdrop; when the song's audio finishes, the singer turns {{her head to the}} side and looks into the distance, as the camera pans away.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{was missing}} for a {{performance}} one evening, and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman. He broke up the tête-à-tête with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both, and ordered Lennon onto the stage. Lennon was furious, and complained {{that he could not}} go on stage dripping wet. Fascher snapped back: [...] "I don't give a shit, you're going onstage and I don't care if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> naked." [...] A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter. Fascher ran to see what the commotion was, and saw Lennon playing guitar, but only wearing underpants with a toilet seat around his neck. (Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist Bill Harry not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants). Fascher's brother, Fred, sang lead vocals with the group on [...] "Be Bop A Lula", while he sang with them on [...] "Hallelujah I Love Her So", and his alliance with the Beatles continued, as he later went to work at the Star-Club.|$|E
