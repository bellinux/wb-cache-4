500|$|Edwards {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 153,000 people to celebrate his second victory of the season, earning him $425,675. He was pleased with the result, saying it was [...] "a very special win" [...] and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in 2005: [...] "I tried hard to stay calm. And I'm not the best at it sometimes. We all know that." [...] He added, [...] "We do this to win. Winning these races is the greatest. Winning a championship would be the ultimate. What we’re trying to do is win the championship this year. That’s our number-one goal.” Second-place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed, saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red-flag period prevented him from winning the race: [...] "Carl wasn't going to get beat today. He had it in the bag. He was so strong... I was terrible on cold tires. I wish all of <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> that felt like. I hate it." [...] Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road.|$|E
500|$|Production Designer Allan Cameron found a {{dormant volcano}} near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the {{location}} because, [...] "A city {{hidden in the}} crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out {{in the middle of}} the desert you would never see it. You would never think of entering the crater unless <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was inside that volcano." [...] A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was [...] in length and featured [...] "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite these}} {{occasional}} supply ships, the French garrison was rapidly {{running out of}} food. To conserve resources, the French forced the civilian population out of the city; the civilian population dropped from 45,000 in 1799 to 9,000 by 1800. Nelson himself took nominal command of the blockade, while Ball was made president of the Maltese National Congress. As liaison between the Maltese military and civilian commanders, he directed the distribution of supplies to the Maltese population, which was beginning to suffer from disease brought about by food shortages. He was replaced on Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington. On 1 November Nelson again offered terms of surrender to Vaubois, and was again rebuffed, with the reply [...] "Jaloux de mériter l'estime de votre nation, comme vous recherchez celle de la nôtre, nous sommes résolus défendre cette fortresse jusqu'à l'extrémité" [...] ("Keen to deserve the esteem your nation, as you seek that of ours, we are resolved to defend this fortress until the end"). By this point, Nelson was conducting the blockade at a distance, based at the Neapolitan court in Palermo. There he indulged in gambling and social engagements, becoming {{closer and closer to}} Emma, Lady Hamilton, wife of the ambassador Sir William Hamilton. His behaviour was heavily criticised, not just by his commanding officer Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, who had recently replaced Earl St Vincent, but also by old friends such as Thomas Troubridge, who wrote to him [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> your friends feel for you I am sure you would cut out all the nocturnal parties [...] [...] [...] I beseech your Lordship, leave off". In December 1799, Erskine was replaced by Lieutenant-General Henry Edward Fox, who immediately redistributed 800 troops from the garrison at Messina to Malta under Brigadier-General Thomas Graham. These troops filled the gap left by the withdrawal of Portuguese forces, which had been ordered to return to Lisbon. Disease began to spread within the city as rations became scarcer. The arrival of an aviso in January 1800 with the news of the events of 18 Brumaire that made Bonaparte First Consul of France prompted a brief respite and a public statement from Vaubois that the city would never be surrendered, although conditions continued to deteriorate.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{the word}} in a musical context was {{documented}} as early as 1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune. Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916 Times-Picayune article about [...] "jas bands." [...] In an interview with NPR, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the original slang connotations of the term, saying: [...] "When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z.' [...] It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S.' That was dirty, and if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies." [...] The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the Twentieth Century.|$|E
