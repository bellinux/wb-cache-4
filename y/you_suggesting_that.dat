6000|$|But Binet was {{far from}} agreement. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Polichinelle should play Scaramouche?" [...] he asked, incredulously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> we may meet Mr. Lessingham?" [...] Helen enquired, lazily. [...] "I am {{perfectly}} {{certain that}} he knows nothing of the equipment of the melodramatic spy. As to Zeppelins, don't you remember {{he told us that}} he hated them and was terrified of bombs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother!" [...] Charlotte {{broke in}} terribly upon her. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> I should be {{married in a}} storage warehouse? Well, I haven't fallen quite so low as that yet. If I can't have a home wedding, I will have a church wedding, and I will wait till doomsday for it if necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I dismiss Wilding?" [...] {{cried the}} Duke. [...] "You know his influence, {{and the bad}} {{impression}} his removal would leave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am in your hands,' he cried. 'What would <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{we should}} do? Would {{it not be}} best that I should remain here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact, it was Miss Kenwardine to whom you owed most," [...] Jake said meaningly. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> she's dangerous, too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Robina, [...] "I have." [...] I {{gathered}} from her tone that the Joan of Arc expression had departed. Had Primgate wanted to paint her {{at that particular}} moment I should have suggested Katherine--during the earlier stages--listening to a curtain lecture from Petruchio. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> all women should take her for a model?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC) on April 8, 2010, Pardy was interviewed regarding the case of Nazia Quazi, a dual Indian and Canadian citizen who, after visiting her father in Saudi Arabia, was unable to return to Canada, since her father was able to assume “guardianship” over her and block her exit from the country, in accordance with Islamic law and tradition. Pardy suggested that Canadian policy toward Israel was to blame for Ms. Quazi's situation. Pardy argued that [...] "the fact that we Canada have taken ourselves out as a balanced observer the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ... is not looked at with any degree of friendliness in Saudi Arabia.” When the host directly asked him [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Canada’s Israel policy could leave young Canadian women in limbo?", Mr. Pardy replied [...] "Yes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the Blood of God, boy! Do you {{imply that}} I had knowledge? Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I would have bought any life {{at such a}} price?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know where}} Miss Gascoyne is, but <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had {{something}} to ask me, and I shall be busy by and by," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you are {{responsible}} for the whole affair. You introduced Douglas to her. <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he should bring her home. Go to her to-morrow and ascertain her intentions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{tells me}} so," [...] she answered, with a laugh. [...] "How uncourtier-like you are, Paul! Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> any man {{could see me}} and not love me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are insolent!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You will be {{good enough}} to answer questions, not to ask them. Answer me, then. Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I have your necklace?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Odds death!" [...] blazed Grey, {{giving a}} free rein to his dislike of this calm gentleman. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> a man's honour is imperilled in His Grace's service?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] I cried, {{putting out}} a hand as if I would cover her mouth. Then {{collecting}} myself. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Cosimo could lend himself to so infamous a compact?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> my {{presence}} {{may be of}} service to you, I am happy that circumstances should have delayed my departure," [...] was his lordship's courteous answer. [...] "A chair, Dom Miguel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, father," [...] {{said our}} hero {{with a modest}} look, [...] "it may be, as <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> <b>that</b> Winnie Van der Kemp does not care for me more than for a fathom of salt water--" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{also failed}} to understand; but a light broke in upon me. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> he should?" [...] I asked, and the girl {{answered}} with some reluctance: [...] "Yes; was it not natural that I should?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, it is {{a perfect}} thing in its way. Don't {{say a word to}} her; but if you are {{consulted}} for my next birthday present, Grace, couldn't <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> one does cease to be a girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Jimmy gravely. [...] "Nobody {{would expect}} {{anything}} else from you. I don't mind admitting that I {{have been a}} little anxious about what Eleanor might do--but we'll change the subject. <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Merril was getting into trouble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Her colour rose. [...] "Well, sir? What do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I implied or {{seemed to}} imply?" [...] But as {{suddenly}} her manner changed. [...] "I {{think we are}} too concerned with trifles where the matter on which I have sought you is a serious one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{difficult}} situation, Bellamy," [...] he said. [...] "You are asking {{a great deal}} when <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> we should interfere in the slightest manner with the course of justice. You are absolutely convinced, I suppose, that this man Laverick {{had nothing to do}} with the murder?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since {{she was at}} Rio Frio {{when she}} sent the note, it is plain that Gomez added the few lines that led you into the trap. But we must think how we can rescue Mr. Grahame. <b>You</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the men who came with you from San Lucar have no plans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adrea, {{you talk}} like a child," [...] he said sternly. [...] "I made no such {{insinuation}} as <b>you</b> <b>suggest!</b> <b>You</b> know <b>that</b> I did not! Sit down!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, what an idea!" [...] {{his mother}} exclaimed reprovingly. [...] "On the contrary, the Torskis {{are one of}} the most aristocratic {{families}} in Russia, and you know what the Abbeways are. The girl is excellently bred, and I think her charming in every way. Whatever made <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> she might have German blood in her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{considered}} this with visible intensity. [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> is <b>that</b> {{the things you}} speak of depend on other people?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is an {{extraordinary}} story,' Mr. Singleton said, when he heard it all. 'I cannot doubt that it is as <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> <b>That</b> my little Dorothy should behave {{in this way is}} too ridiculous to be believed for a moment; though I own that I should have been ready, if obliged, to swear in court that it was she who came to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "My good resolutions? Really, Clarence, {{sometimes}} {{if it were}} not cruelty to animals I should like to hit you.

6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} hasn't. For what do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I suppose {{her to take}} you? But you've been with her every day, you've seen her freely, you've liked her greatly--I stick to that--and you've made your profit of it.
