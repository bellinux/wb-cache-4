A few hours later, the fire closed in on the church Helligåndskirken and at 8 p.m. its carillon bells came to life as they did every half-hour [...] playing Thomas Kingo's Vreden din afvend, herre Gud, af Naade (Eng.

500|$|A peace {{agreement}} of ten years was concluded between the Muslims and Quraysh of Mecca at the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in 628. It {{has been recorded}} that Muhammad told Khalid's brother, Walid bin Walid, that: [...] "A man like Khalid, can't keep himself away from Islam for long". Walid wrote letters to Khalid persuading him to convert. Khalid, who was not unduly drawn towards the idols of the Kaaba, decided to convert to Islam and {{is said to have}} shared this matter with his childhood friend Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl who opposed him. Khalid was threatened by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb with dire consequences, but was restrained by Ikrimah who is reported to have said: [...] "Steady, O Abu Sufyan! <b>Your</b> <b>anger</b> may well lead me also to join Muhammad. Khalid is free to follow whatever religion he chooses".|$|E

500|$|The group's {{position}} in the Norwegian metal scene was controversial from the beginning. Bryzak writes that [...] "standing up for their faith in Life and Hope, Antestor received serious death threats during this time {{from some of the}} major bands and key players of the scene." [...] When asked if the band ever played with other groups in the black metal scene, Antestor said in a 2000 interview with Tcu zine: [...] "We played with some early form of the band Old Man's Child once. Apparently they expressed their opinion of us with their legs {{and walked out of the}} venue during our set. It was their way of saying 'screw you Christians.'" [...] In the liner notes of Martyrium, Antestor corresponds in a slightly bitter tone: [...] "For those of you who despised us, disbelieved in us and misplaced <b>your</b> <b>anger</b> upon us, may God have mercy on your poor souls!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Gaston {{has escaped}} and rushes in to find Hélène, but their joy is {{short-lived}} as the Crusaders, {{led by the}} Count, burst {{into the room and}} demand Gaston's death, still believing that he was responsible for the attempt on the Count's life.

2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] Now that you have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on <b>your</b> <b>anger.</b> [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back <b>your</b> <b>anger</b> and respect the state's credibility. [...] I would feel pity if Your Imperial Majesty followed <b>your</b> <b>anger</b> and not your credibility." [...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E

2500|$|The Pesher on Psalms has {{the theme}} of {{salvation}} that takes part of an interpretation on those who are wrongdoers before the eyes of God and how those who do good will see the rewards of life. For instance, 4Q171 Fragment 1 is about how {{it is important that}} as a devoted believer you shall respect the Law and those who don’t will not be saved. [...] "Renounce <b>your</b> <b>anger</b> and abandon your resentment, don't yearn to do evil, because evildoers will be wiped out" [...] (37:8-9a). It is significant {{to take into account the}} fact that such interpretations of the psalms have shown to have a deeper meaning and connects all human beings. All this by simply splitting up those who are good and those who are not.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1990, Petrelis {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. to [...] "wreak havoc {{on what he}} saw as a complacent lesbian and gay community." [...] Years later, Petrelis {{recalled}} a confrontation with Kramer at an ACT UP meeting in New York as prompting the move."Your obnoxiousness is not appreciated here," [...] he remembered Kramer shouting. [...] "Why don't you move to Washington, where <b>your</b> <b>anger</b> is more necessary?" [...] There, Petrelis helped organize a local chapter of ACT UP, which began meeting in March 1990. With ACT UP/DC, Petrelis protested censorship of homoeroticism in the arts, pressured Amnesty International to recognize people imprisoned for sodomy to be counted as victims of human rights abuse, demanded an end to the United States' immigration restrictions against people with HIV, traveled to President George H. W.Bush's family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, to disrupt the president's vacation, disrupted the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' press conference to protest Roman Catholic Church teachings on condom use, helped stuff condoms and AIDS awareness posters into hundreds of vending box copies of the Washington Post to criticize the newspaper's AIDS coverage, helped organize large demonstrations at the United States Capitol, and launched a nationwide boycott of the Philip Morris Co. (now Altria Group, Inc.), to protest the company's support for Jesse Helms, a Republican senator from North Carolina.|$|E
2500|$|Invocation. Hamlet {{addresses}} the Ghost (Hamlet: Spectre infernal! Image venerée! [...] "Infernal apparition! Venerated image!"). The ghost gives a sign indicating that Horatio and Marcellus should withdraw, and Hamlet orders {{them to do}} so. The ghost speaks: Écoute-moi! [...] "Listen to me!". He identifies himself and commands Hamlet to avenge him. Hamlet asks what is the crime he must avenge, and who has committed it? Sounds of music from within the castle, fanfares, and distant cannon are heard, and the Ghost responds: [...] "Hark: it is he they are honoring, he who they have proclaimed King! ... The adulterer has defiled my royal residence: and he, to make his treason more complete, spying upon my sleep and {{taking advantage of the}} hour, poured poison on my sleeping lips. ... Avenge me, my son! Avenge your father! ... From your mother, though, turn <b>your</b> <b>anger</b> away, we must leave punishment in the care of heaven." [...] The ghost withdraws, his parting words: Souviens-toi! [...] "Remember me!" [...] Hamlet draws his sword and proclaims his intention to obey the ghost's command (Hamlet: Ombre chére, ombre vengeresse, j'exaucerai ton vœu! ... je me souviendrai! [...] "Beloved shade, avenging shade, I shall fulfill your command! ... I shall remember!"). The English musicologist Elizabeth Forbes has written: [...] "Even the composer's detractors, and there have been many, are agreed that Thomas' music for this scene is masterly; he catches the chilling, gloomy atmosphere perfectly...." [...] In his review of the recording with Thomas Hampson as Hamlet, Barrymore Laurence Scherer says [...] "Thomas captures Hamlet's shadowy malaise in both vocal line and somber accompaniment.... The intimacy of the recording provides Thomas Hampson with ample opportunity {{to make the most of}} the relationship between words and music..." [...] The orchestral music which accompanies his vow to avenge his father's murder is another example of a theme which reoccurs multiple times at key points in the drama.|$|E

60|$|Though {{they began}} by {{discussing}} {{all manner of}} subjects in Weeks' little room eventually the conversation always turned to religion: the theological student took a professional interest in it, and Hayward welcomed a subject in which hard facts need not disconcert him; when feeling is the gauge you can snap <b>your</b> <b>angers</b> at logic, and when your logic is weak that is very agreeable. Hayward {{found it difficult to}} explain his beliefs to Philip without a great flow of words; but it was clear (and this fell in with Philip's idea of the natural order of things), that he had been brought up in the church by law established. Though he had now given up all idea of becoming a Roman Catholic, he still looked upon that communion with sympathy. He had much to say in its praise, and he compared favourably its gorgeous ceremonies with the simple services of the Church of England. He gave Philip Newman's Apologia to read, and Philip, finding it very dull, nevertheless read it to the end.|$|R
