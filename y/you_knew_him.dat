5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

60|$|Some of <b>you</b> <b>know</b> who he is. Some of you, perhaps, do not. If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> <b>you</b> {{will be glad}} to be {{reminded}} of him to-day. If <b>you</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> I will tell you who he is.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with Mr. Osmond's type, if it be one? His being so independent, so individual, is what I most see in him," [...] the girl declared. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> against <b>him?</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> {{scarcely}} at all." ...|$|R
60|$|He's {{not a bad}} sort when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him.</b> He's {{just like}} my mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Honora, [...] "and you {{can never}} realize how tired, unless <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> as I did. When love dies, it turns into hate." ...|$|E
60|$|H. What a {{basis to}} judge a book upon! As first you said <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> and now you don't know whether you did or not.|$|E

60|$|LADY DEDMOND. There's a Mr. Malise {{coming here}} to-night. I forget if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|MISS THREEGAN. (Extracting long {{lavender}} silk stocking {{from the}} rubbish.) <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> better than I do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>know</b> <b>him!</b> Don't <b>know</b> him!" [...] Sputtered Jenny. [...] "Of course <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> can't {{help but}} <b>know</b> <b>him.</b> I mean Brownie the Thrasher." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you assert," [...] exclaimed the president, [...] "that at {{the time}} when you denounced Trudaine, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> to be {{intriguing}} to aid your mother's escape?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; he's doing awfully well." [...] And a {{sound like}} a faint sigh caught his ears. [...] "Would you say he's changed much since <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> Dad?" ...|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON [reading the title] The Story of a King By His Wife. [He {{looks at}} the {{portrait}} frontise]. Ay: there he is. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> here, I suppose.|$|E

6000|$|... "He's more awful than {{anything}} you can think of. Was my dad at all like him, Guardy? Mother's always so mysterious about him. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> well." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{began to}} like him. There was {{something}} a little dainty about him, when <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> better--really rather fastidious. A showman, true enough! Blatant too. But fastidiously so.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nobody you know; yes! <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> very well. It is my dear, dear friend; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> very well. The bailiffs went to {{his hotel}} yesterday, and dragged him out of bed, {{and took him to}} prison. Oh! I shall go quite distracted. I want to sell my china to pay his debts.

6000|$|ANNA--[Excitedly.] Yes, that's him! Anna Christopherson--that's my real name--only {{out there}} I called myself Anna Christie. So <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> eh? ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{companion}} then, {{during a}} moment's silence, {{might have been}} noting the emphasis of her assent. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. A gentleman {{born and}} brought up, {{who ought to}} have set a better example. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> sir--and my poor dear Anne <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> only too well." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I suppose then we {{must call}} him General Denot--simple General; it sounds as well as Count or Marquis in these days. Was he a General when <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> in La Vendée?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{alters the}} affair," [...] {{the man said}} gravely. [...] "It will add to your danger; for as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> I suppose he <b>knows</b> <b>you,</b> also." ...|$|R
6000|$|After dinner, Mr. Western, as {{a matter}} of course, brought up the subject of Sir Francis Geraldine. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> Miss Altifiorla?" ...|$|R
