25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought {{together and then}} separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between <b>your</b> <b>shoes</b> and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} the singer using sexually {{explicit}} language to describe an evening {{at her home}} where she is cooking a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone, [...] "I'm in my penthouse half-naked / I cook this meal for you naked". Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in <b>your</b> <b>shoes,</b> do the type of things I never ever do. I take one look in the mirror, and I say to myself, 'Baby girl, you can't survive like this.'" [...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness. As she continues to describe her love–hate relationship detailing her emotions, Beyoncé sings the song's bridge: ...|$|E

2500|$|Jessie J {{has been}} criticized by people who find the lyrics of the song hypocritical: a [...] "rich rock star" [...] telling {{the rest of us}} that money doesn't matter, or {{questioning}} why she then charges for her music. She has repeatedly explained in interviews that this is a misreading of her meaning, which skewers the superficiality of conspicuous consumption -- or more simply, that [...] "show-offs suck." [...] "For me, so much I hear about how much money people have and how people just take stuff too seriously. It’s not me saying that you can live for free, because obviously that isn’t the case; but I’m saying that you don’t always have to let it be about that.

2500|$|Nickelodeon {{included}} a Noggin programming block {{as part of}} its lineup from 1999 to 2000. The block was originally titled [...] "Noggins Up" [...] and became [...] "Noggin on Nickelodeon" [...] during its second year on the air. It showcased one tween-oriented program every weekday. The timeslot proved successful in attracting thousands of visitors to the Noggin.com site. Nickelodeon revived the block for a single day on April 7, 2003 to advertise the restructuring of Noggin's lineup. The event incorporated episodes of Tweenies, Oobi and Miffy and Friends into the Nick Jr. block. Commercials for the Noggin channel were also played between each regular program. Following the block's removal, premiere episodes of Noggin series (such as A Walk In <b>Your</b> <b>Shoes,</b> Bill Nye the Science Guy and Jack's Big Music Show) were frequently simulcast on Nickelodeon and Noggin.|$|E

2500|$|Though Maywood {{officials}} {{stopped short}} of filing for bankruptcy or even giving up the city's municipal status, the city still faces a serious problem with a huge deficit. The city did keep a few employees as independent contractors when they outsourced most city functions to Bell and police duties to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In September 2010, the troubled nearby city of Bell agreed to cancel the contract to handle the day-to-day operations of neighboring Maywood. Maywood has been overrun with political crises — from recalls to a city clerk {{accused of trying to}} contract a hit man to kill Councilman Aguirre. In early 2006, a newly elected Aguirre called Maywood a [...] "sanctuary city" [...] for illegal immigrants, stating: [...] "I think we needed to amplify the debate by saying that no human being is illegal. These people are here ... making your clothes, shining <b>your</b> <b>shoes</b> and taking care of your kids. And now you want to develop this hypocritical policy?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Clark met Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson at the Maurice Publishing Company. The two collaborated musically {{and were}} linked romantically {{over the coming}} decade. In 1949 Henderson {{introduced}} Clark to Alan A. Freeman who, together with her father Leslie, formed Polygon Records for which she recorded her earliest hits. Clark had recorded her first release that year, [...] "Put <b>Your</b> <b>Shoes</b> On, Lucy", for EMI. Because neither EMI nor Decca, for whom she also had recorded, were keen to sign her to a long-term contract, her father, whose own theatrical ambitions had been thwarted by his parents, teamed with Freeman to form the Polygon record label {{in order to better}} control and facilitate her singing career. This project was financed with Clark's earnings. She scored a number of major hits in the UK during the 1950s, including [...] "The Little Shoemaker" [...] (1954), [...] "Majorca" [...] (1955), [...] "Suddenly There's a Valley" [...] (1955) and [...] "With All My Heart" [...] (1956). [...] "The Little Shoemaker" [...] was an international hit, reaching No. 1 in Australia, the first of many No. 1 records in her career. Although Clark released singles in the United States as early as 1951 (the first was [...] "Tell Me Truly"/"Song of the Mermaid" [...] on the Coral label), it was 13 years before the American record-buying public discovered her.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting <b>your</b> <b>shoes</b> coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound.
