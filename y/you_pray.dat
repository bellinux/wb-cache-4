2500|$|Omar Ibn Said (c. 1770–1864) {{is among}} the best {{documented}} examples of a practicing-Muslim slave. He lived on a 19th Century North Carolina plantation and wrote many Arabic texts while enslaved.

Some of his works include the Lords Prayer, the Bismillah, this is How <b>You</b> <b>Pray,</b> Quranic phases, the 23rd Psalm, and an autobiography. In 1857, he produced his last known writing on Surah 110 of the Quran. In 1819, Omar received an Arabic translation of the Christian Bible from his master, James Owen.
