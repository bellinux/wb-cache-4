40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} whether spectral analysis of unprocessed radiofrequency (RF) signal offers advantages over standard videodensitometric analysis {{in identifying the}} morphology of coronary atherosclerotic plaques.  Methods— 97 regions of interest (ROI) were imaged at 30  MHz from postmortem, pressure perfused (80  mm Hg) coronary arteries in saline baths. RF data were digitised at 250  MHz. Two different sizes of ROI were identified from scan converted images, and relative amplitudes of different frequency components were analysed from raw data. Normalised spectra was used to calculate spectral slope (dB/MHz), <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> (dB), mean power (dB), and maximum power (dB) over a given bandwidth (17 - 42  MHz). RF images were constructed and compared with comparative histology derived from microscopy and radiological techniques in three dimensions.  Results—Mean power was similar from dense fibrotic tissue and heavy calcium, but spectral slope was steeper in heavy calcium (− 0. 45 (0. 1)) than in dense fibrotic tissue (− 0. 31 (0. 1)), and maximum power was higher for heavy calcium (− 7. 7 (2. 0)) than for dense fibrotic tissue (− 10. 2 (3. 9)). Maximum power was significantly higher in heavy calcium (− 7. 7  (2. 0)  dB) and dense fibrotic tissue (− 10. 2  (3. 9)  dB) than in microcalcification (− 13. 9   (3. 8)  dB). <b>Y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> was higher in microcalcification (− 5. 8  (1. 1) dB) than in moderately fibrotic tissue (− 11. 9   (2. 0)  dB). Moderate and dense fibrotic tissue were discriminated with mean power: moderate − 20. 2  (1. 1)  dB, dense − 14. 7  (3. 7)  dB; and y-axis intercept: moderate − 11. 9  (2. 0)  dB, dense − 5. 5   (5. 4)  dB. Different densities of fibrosis, loose, moderate, and dense, were discriminated with both <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept,</b> spectral slope, and mean power. Lipid could be differentiated from other types of plaque tissue {{on the basis of}} spectral slope, lipid − 0. 17 (0. 08).

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{yield point}} return {{have been studied}} in two NiAl-based alloys {{as a function of}} aging time at temperatures between 300 and 700 K. The results indicate that the upper yield stress increment, Delta sigma(sub u) (i. e., stress difference between the upper yield point and the final flow stress achieved during prestraining), in conventional purity (CP-NiAl) and in high purity carbon-doped (NiAl-C) material first increased with a t(exp 2 / 3) relationship before reaching a plateau. This behavior suggests that a Cottrell locking mechanism is the cause for yield points in NiAl. In addition, positive <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercepts</b> were observed in plots of Delta sigma(sub u) versus t(exp 2 / 3) suggesting the operation of a Snoek mechanism. Analysis according to the Cottrell Bilby model of atmosphere formation around dislocations yields an activation energy for yield point return in the range 70 to 76 kJ/mol which is comparable to the activation energy for diffusion of interstitial impurities in bcc metals.

METHODS: Forty-seven individuals underwent a muscle fatigue test for thirty-five seconds at 80 % of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), while EMG and muscle force data were recorded. The RMS value and the median frequency (MF) were calculated within consecutive one-second windows. Linear regression analysis was used to obtain the slope coefficients and the respective <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> values, which were considered to be localized muscle fatigue indices. RESULTS: In the frequency domain, the slope coefficients were negative for both muscles, while in the time domain, the coefficient for the upper trapezius was positive and the coefficient for the lower back muscles was negative (p< 0. 01). Significant differences were also found in the frequency domain between subjects with and without pain in the upper trapezius (p< 0. 01). The subjects with pain had significantly lower force values than the subjects without pain (p< 0. 05), in both the upper trapezius and the lower back muscles.

For activated charcoal, both the coefficients of determination values (0.9630 and 0.9697) are sufficiently close to 1.

Extending the broad number of species-specific calibrations, which agree well especially with our shallow-dweller calibrations, this study presents new bulk calcite Mg/Ca vs. calcification temperature relationships for shallow-dwelling Globigerinoides ruber pink, thermocline-dwelling Globorotalia menardii, and deep-dwelling Globorotalia truncatulinoides dextral and Globorotalia crassaformis not separately calibrated before. The species-specific temperature sensitivities are relatively similar (≈ 7 – 11 % increase in Mg/Ca per 1 °C), yet <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercepts</b> vary from 0. 23 – 0. 65 for the shallow and thermocline dwellers to 0. 83 – 1. 32 for the deep dwellers. Based on these differences, we established a ‘warm water’ calibration for temperatures > 19 °C (Mg/Ca = 0. 29 ·exp(0. 101 ·T); r = 0. 90; shallow and thermocline dwellers) and a ‘cold water’ calibration for temperatures < 15 °C (Mg/Ca = 0. 84 ·exp(0. 083 ·T); r = 0. 85; deep dwellers).

Thirteen tropical and 12 temperate species (all characteristic of wet forests) were grown in a glasshouse (25 / 20 degrees C day/night). A range of leaf traits were quantified, including mass-based leaf nitrogen [N], mass {{per unit area}} (LMA), light-saturated photosynthesis (A) and respiration (Rdark). Average area- and mass-based rates of net CO 2 exchange {{were higher in the}} temperate species, compared to their tropical counterparts. Average leaf [N] and LMA values were also higher in temperate species than in their tropical counterparts. The higher LMA in the metabolically more active temperate species was the most striking contrast to the patterns and predictions of the GLOPNET leaf trait data base, and was associated with different elevations (i. e. <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercepts)</b> but not slopes of bivariate trait scaling relationships. As expected, mass-based rates of A and Rdark scaled positively with increasing [N] and negatively with increasing LMA in both tropical and temperate species. No differences were found between temperate and tropical species groups in terms of log-log scaling relationships linking A and Rdark to N. However, at any given LMA, mass-based values of [N], A and Rdark were all higher in the temperate species than in their tropical counterparts. Underpinning higher A in temperate species was a higher capacity for carboxylation (Vcmax) and RuBP regeneration (Jmax), with Jmax:Vcmax being greater in temperate species. In conclusion, our results suggest that as a consequence of greater overall N investment as well as greater proportional N investment in metabolic capacity, cool-adapted temperate wet forest species exhibit higher photosynthetic and respiration rates than their warm-adapted tropical counterparts when compared in a common environment...|$|R
40|$|Journal homepage: [URL] target {{strengths}} (TSs) of the 2 {{most common}} large medusae, Chrysaora hysoscella and Aequorea aequorea, {{in the northern}} Benguela (off Namibia) have previously been estimated (at 18, 38 and 120 kHz) from acoustic data collected in conjunction with trawl samples, using the ‘comparison method’. These TS values may have been biased because the method took no account of acoustic backscatter from mesozooplankton. Here we report our efforts to improve upon these estimates, and to determine TS additionally at 200 kHz, by conducting additional sampling for mesozooplankton and fish larvae, and accounting for their likely contribution to the total backscatter. Published sound scattering models were used to predict the acoustic backscatter due to the observed numerical densities of mesozooplankton and fish larvae (solving the forward problem). Mean volume backscattering due to jellyfish alone was then inferred by subtracting the model-predicted values from the observed water-column total associated with jellyfish net samples. Zooplankton-corrected echo intensity/jellyfish density data pairs were {{in close agreement with}} linear relationships determined previously from uncorrected data. Small sample sizes precluded recalculation of TS, but nonparametric pair-wise tests failed to detect any significant differences between echo intensities for jellyfish densities observed in the present study and echo intensities predicted for those densities by density–intensity relationships arising from the previous study. Previous linear density–intensity relationships had <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercepts</b> greater than zero. On the assumption that the positive intercepts were due to backscatter from unsampled mesozooplankton, new TS relationships were calculated from downward-adjusted density–intensity relationships. New values agreed closely with TS estimates determined elsewhere using single-target echo detection techniques.

The physiological mechanisms responsible for these proxy relationships are still unknown. This culture study investigates the impact of different seawater [Mg 2 +] on calcification in two benthic foraminiferal species precipitating contrasting Mg/CaCC: Ammonia aomoriensis, producing low-Mg calcite and Amphistegina lessonii, producing intermediate-Mg calcite. Foraminiferal growth and test thickness were determined and, Mg/Ca was analyzed using Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Results show that at present-day seawater Mg/CaSW of ~ 5, both species have highest growth rates, reflecting their adaptation to modern seawater element concentrations. Test thickness is not significantly affected by different Mg/CaSW.

40|$|AbstractThe {{oxidative}} {{resistance of}} low density lipoprotein (LDL) can be experimentally {{described by the}} length of time during which no significant lipid peroxidation is observed in a pro-oxidant environment. This period of inhibited oxidation, termed the ‘lag phase’, is partially due to the radical scavenging reactions of the anti-oxidants contained in the LDL particle. We have shown that the LDL lag time decreases with increasing copper concentration, leveling out at a relatively high copper-to-LDL ratio. This behaviour demonstrates the existence of a finite number of saturable pro-oxidant copper binding sites within the LDL particle. The relationship is described by the equation, lag time = [Cu]− · K · tmin + tmin where the constant, K, is the negative reciprocal of the x-axis intercept of the graphed function, and tmin is given by the <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept.</b> By this definition of the constant, K is the amount of copper that will produce a lag time of twice tmin, while tmin is the minimum time a particular LDL will resist oxidation at a maximum copper concentration...|$|E

Although the regression slopes of the log–log plots did not differ between the warm-grown and cold-acclimated plants, cold-acclimated plants did exhibit a higher <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> than their warm-grown counterparts.

Various methods reported in the literature to calculate a CA 125 half-live value were compared. Using two exponential regression models (Van der Burg et al., 1988; Buller et al., 1991), mean half-lives in stage I-II patients after complete cytoreductive surgery were respectively 10. 7 days (range: 5 - 23) and 9. 8 days (range: 7 - 15).

Stratification of the patients by stage, grade, or histology did not reveal any significant differences in the regression rate.

The mean dark uptake rate varied from 0. 68 to 4. 82 (imol C m~ 3 h~ ' over the transect and showed a significant positive relationship with chlorophyll a. The dark uptake was usually < 5 % of the maximum photosynthetic capacity (Pm), and higher values relative to Pm were associated with low values of Pm and not with high absolute dark values. A linear relationship between dark uptake and Pm was found with a background value (<b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept)</b> of 0. 51 (xmol C m~ 3 h~ ' and a slope of 0. 77 % of Pm.

40|$|In this review, we {{describe}} and illustrate {{the selection and}} use of some appropriate regression models for bivariate statistical relationships. The most commonly used method, ordinary least squares (OLS) or type I regression, may be inappropriate when the predictor variable is subject to measurement errors since this violates a fundamental assumption of OLS {{and as a result}} estimates of slope are likely to be biased or attenuated. The <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> will be biased too as it is a function of slope estimate and the means of y-and x-variables. This bias can have some undesirable consequences if OLS regression parameters and/or functions of them are used further with meaningful interpretations. For example, in animal energy balance studies, slope estimate represents efficiency of metabolizable energy utilization for body mass growth or milk production in dairy cows. The x-axis intercept, a function of y-intercept and slope, gives an estimate of the animal's body mass maintenance energy requirement. The choice of an alternative type II or functional regression model (e. g. maximum likelihood solution, major axis, reduced major axis and others) depends on the availability and ratio of measurement or precision variances of both y-and x-variables; otherwise non-parametric models (e. g. Theil-Sen non-parametric regression or Bartlett's three-group method) can be used. When the ratio of y-and x-variable error variances is not constant over the data range then the reiterated weighted functional model as described by Ripley and Thompson in 1987 may be necessary. Application of these models and other tests (e. g. mean-square prediction error, analysis of concordance) in analytical method comparisons is outlined. Data scrutiny and outlier diagnostics are included because outliers affect most of the non-robust statistics. ? 2016 CAB InternationaPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. – Shells {{extracted}} from loess deposits at Achenheim (Rhine Graben) {{have been investigated}} for AMS 14 C and for U-Th dating by the isochron method on single shells. The two chronometers provide results {{that are not in}} agree-ment: the obtained 14 C date is 38 ka B. P. In contrast, U-Th results provide much older ages. The 238 U/ 232 Th – 230 Th/ 232 Th isochron diagram gives an age of 69 kyr, whereas a slightly younger age of 64 kyr is derived from the other, 234 U/ 232 Th – 230 Th/ 232 Th, diagram. 234 U/ 238 U ratios have not been found to vary from a shell to another: the average value is 1. 199, slightly higher than radioactive equilibrium. For both isochrons, the <b>Y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> is slightly negative, which indicates that there is no evidence for a significant detrital component. Thorium 232 that is present in the shells is probably incorporated in the material. The negative intercepts suggest that the two ages have been probably “aged ” re-sulting from a slight mobilisation of uranium. By constraining the Y-axis intercepts at 0, ages that are in good agreement from one to another, can be calculated at 60. 9 kyr and 60. 4 kyr, respectively. In both cases, the statistical quality of the alignment is only slightly deteriorated. Since U-Th ages are in agreement with stratigraphic data, in contrast to the 14 C date, one may believe that they date the end of early diagenesis, with uranium trapping. In contrast, the AMS 14 C date is either thought to reflect analy-tical limitations of AMS 14 C dating for such type of material, or to date a younger geologic event. In this latter case, a possible hypothesis is that this event has triggered the slight opening of the 238 U – 234 U system...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de revisión. In this review, we {{describe}} and illustrate {{the selection and}} use of some appropriate regression models for bivariate statistical relationships. The most commonly used method, ordinary least squares (OLS) or type I regression, may be inappropriate when the predictor variable is subject to measurement errors since this violates a fundamental assumption of OLS {{and as a result}} estimates of slope are likely to be biased or attenuated. The <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> will be biased too as it is a function of slope estimate and the means of y-and x-variables. This bias can have some undesirable consequences if OLS regression parameters and/or functions of them are used further with meaningful interpretations. For example, in animal energy balance studies, slope estimate represents efficiency of metabolizable energy utilization for body mass growth or milk production in dairy cows. The x-axis intercept, a function of y-intercept and slope, gives an estimate of the animal's body mass maintenance energy requirement. The choice of an alternative type II or functional regression model (e. g. maximum likelihood solution, major axis, reduced major axis and others) depends on the availability and ratio of measurement or precision variances of both y-and x-variables; otherwise non-parametric models (e. g. Theil-Sen non-parametric regression or Bartlett's three-group method) can be used. When the ratio of y-and x-variable error variances is not constant over the data range then the reiterated weighted functional model as described by Ripley and Thompson in 1987 may be necessary.

40|$|Exposure to novel environments alters hippocampal {{cell and}} theta local field {{potential}} activity {{to support the}} formation of new or updated spatial representations. It induces remapping of place cell fields, a reduction in CA 1 theta frequency {{and an increase in}} the spatial scale of entorhinal grid cell fields. A recent model proposes that a reduction in the slope of the theta frequency-running speed relationship (TFRSR) can account for these effects (Burgess, 2008, Hippocampus). In contrast, the model proposes that the <b>Y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> of the TFRSR is unaffected by novelty but instead correlates with anxiety/arousal. Thus, the theta frequency reduction elicited by a wide range of anxiolytic drugs (Gray & McNaughton, 2000) is suggested to result from a decrease in the intercept. Cannabinoids are anxiolytic at low doses, reduce theta frequency and disrupt the theta-timescale dynamics of place cell firing. In contrast, environmental novelty elicits a coordinated shift in CA 1 place cell firing to a later theta-phase. This thesis examines the electrophysiological effects of environmental familiarity or novelty in combination with a low, intraperitoneal dose of the cannabinoid agonist O- 2545, or its vehicle, saline. It was found that exposure to novel environments reduced the slope of the TFRSR whereas the cannabinoid reduced the intercept, in agreement with the model. These effects were not due to decreased body temperature or changes in behaviour. Combining novelty and drug reduced both slope and intercept. Furthermore, the extent of novelty-induced place cell remapping correlated with the reduction in slope. The mean theta-phase of place cell firing shifted later in novelty, but this was disrupted by the cannabinoid. In contrast, the mean theta-phase of the interneuron population was stable across conditions, but novelty increased the dispersion of interneuron theta-phase preferences. These results help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying novelty processing and cannabinoid action in the hippocampus...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe {{first part}} {{of the study was to}} characterise the {{acoustic}} properties of an IEC agar-based tissue mimicking material (TMM) at ultrasound frequencies centred around 20 MHz. The TMM acoustic properties measured were the amplitude attenuation coefficient (dB cm- 1 MHz- 1), the sound speed (ms- 1) and the backscattered power spectral density characteristics of spectral slope (dB MHz- 1), <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> (dB) and reflected power (dB). The acoustic properties were measured over a temperature range of 22 - 37 oC. Both the attenuation coefficient and sound speed, both group and phase, showed good agreement with the expected values of 0. 5 dB cm- 1 MHz- 1 and 1540 ms- 1 respectively with average values of 0. 49 dB cm- 1 MHz- 1 (st. dev. Â± 0. 03) and 1541. 9 ms- 1 (st. dev. Â± 8. 5). Overall, this non-commercial agar-based TMM was shown to perform as expected at the higher frequency range of 17 - 23 MHz and was seen to retain its acoustic properties of attenuation and speed of sound over a three year period. For the second part of the study, composite sound speed was measured in carotid plaque embedded in TMM. The IEC TMM was adapted to a clear agar gel. The contour maps from the attenuation plots were used to match the composite sound speed data to the photographic mask of plaque outline and thus the histological data. By solution of sets of simultaneous equations using a matrix inversion, the individual speed values for five plaque components were derived; TMM, elastin, fibrous/collagen, calcification and lipid. The results for derived sound speed in the adapted TMM were consistently close to the expected value of soft tissue, 1540 ms- 1. The fibrous tissue showed a mean value of 1584 ms- 1 at body temperature, 37 oC. The derived sound speeds for elastic and lipid exhibited large inter-quartile ranges. The calcification had a significantly higher sound speed than the other plaque components at 1760 - 2000 ms- 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{validate}} perfusion quantification in a low-perfused tissue by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) with shared k-space sampling using a blood pool contrast agent. Perfusion measurements were performed {{in a total of}} seven female pigs. An ultrasonic Doppler probe was attached to the right femoral artery to determine total flow in the hind leg musculature. The femoral artery was catheterized for continuous local administration of adenosine to increase blood flow up to four times the baseline level. Three different stable perfusion levels were induced. The MR protocol included a 3 D gradient-echo sequence with a temporal resolution of approximately 1. 5 seconds. Before each dynamic sequence, static MR images were acquired with flip angles of 5 °, 10 °, 20 °, and 30 °. Both static and dynamic images were used to generate relaxation rate and baseline magnetization maps with a flip angle method. 0. 1 mL/kg body weight of blood pool contrast medium was injected via a central venous catheter at a flow rate of 5 mL/s. The right hind leg was segmented in 3 D into medial, cranial, lateral, and pelvic thigh muscles, lower leg, bones, skin, and fat. The arterial input function (AIF) was measured in the aorta. Perfusion of the different anatomic regions was calculated using a one- and a two-compartment model with delay- and dispersion-corrected AIFs. The F-test for model comparison was used to decide whether to use the results of the one- or two-compartment model fit. Total flow was calculated by integrating volume-weighted perfusion values over the whole measured region. The resulting values of delay, dispersion, blood volume, mean transit time, and flow were all in physiologically and physically reasonable ranges. In 107 of 160 ROIs, the blood signal was separated, using a two-compartment model, into a capillary and an arteriolar signal contribution, decided by the F-test. Overall flow in hind leg muscles, as measured by the ultrasound probe, highly correlated with total flow determined by MRI, R = 0. 89 and P = 10 - 7. Linear regression yielded a slope of 1. 2 and a <b>y-axis</b> <b>intercept</b> of 259 mL/min. The mean total volume of the investigated muscle tissue corresponds to an offset perfusion of 4. 7 mL/(min ⋅ 100 cm 3). The DCE-MRI technique presented here uses a blood pool contrast medium in combination with a two-compartment tracer kinetic model and allows absolute quantification of low-perfused non-cerebral organs such as muscles...|$|E
