Although the town’s population increased for a few years, the new residents had little lasting effect upon the town. The oil field rapidly declined and a fire destroyed much of Elbing in 1933. Although new residences were eventually rebuilt, Elbing never regained its businesses. For several decades downtown Elbing included only a grocery/hardware store, a gas station/garage, a Post Office, and a grain elevator.

5000|$|ADDRESS TO FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN The White House, November 11, 1919. A <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>today</b> {{our enemies}} laid {{down their arms}} in {{accordance}} with an armistice which rendered them impotent to renew hostilities, and gave to the world an assured opportunity to reconstruct its shattered order and to work out in peace a new and juster set of inter national relations. The soldiers and people of the European Allies had fought and endured {{for more than four}} years to uphold the barrier of civilization against the aggressions of armed force. We ourselves had been in the conflict something {{more than a year and}} a half. - With splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns, we re modeled our industries, concentrated our financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our power was a decisive factor in the victory. We were able to bring the vast resources, material and moral, of a great and free people to the assistance of our associates in Europe who had suffered and sacrificed without limit in the cause for which we fought. Out of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes, and the victory of arms foretells the enduring conquests which can be made in peace when nations act justly and in furtherance of the common interests of men. To us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with - solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service, and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of nations.

40|$|One <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>today,</b> I was {{aboard the}} Akademik Ioffe – a {{converted}} Russian research vessel – steaming towards the sub-Antarctic Island of South Georgia {{en route to}} the Antarctic mainland. It has been one of my lifelong dreams to visit Antarctica, but I wasn’t just content to visit this remarkable land, I was determined to use this opportunity to explore the history of Antarctica in the context of today’s great challenges of climate change and the destruction of nature. I even made a film of the journey. It’s called ‘One Summer Dream’, and it uses Antarctica as a powerful visual and historical metaphor for how we can manage planet earth in the 21 st century- the heroic era of Shackleton, the power of the industrial revolution, the giant 19 th century whaling stations, the melting glaciers and the icebergs, and nature at its most beautiful and pristine. For those of you who haven’t seen the film – it’s being screened again here at the Library on Wednesday 20 th February. My premise in this film and in tonight’s lecture is that we don’t need to destroy the machines of the industrial revolution, but we do need {{to change the way we}} power them. That premise is based on hard core economic modelling that’s been conducted around the world over the past few years. And it is from this premise, that comes a fundamentally new wa...|$|E

40|$|One <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>today,</b> I posted {{an essay}} {{entitled}} “What Shall We Do with the Dead Dictator?”, which discussed the DPP government’s efforts {{to further the}} cause of transitional justice (轉型正義) by reexamining the legacy of former ROC President Chiang Kai-shek (1887 - 1975). A number of related policies ended up sparking considerable controversy, included renaming the CKS International Airport asTaiwan Taoyuan International Airport, and especially changing {{the name of the}} National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall. The KMT regained power just two months later, following which things began to move in reverse. Most recently, the Ministry of Education, in one of its last policy decisions during the Year of the Rat, announced that in July 2009 the Democracy Hall’s name plaque will be removed and the original plaque restored. This was based on an Executive Yuan decision to withdraw the former government’s request to abolish the Organic Statute of the CKS Memorial Hall 3 ̆c (國立中正紀念堂管理處組織條例廢止案), as well as a resolution by the Legislative Yuan that the Hall’s name be changed back to Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. Although the Ministry of Education had originally proposed holding a public forum to discuss whether or not to change the plaque, no such event was arranged. According to one top-ranking official, this was due to concerns that such a forum might spark tensions between DPP and KMT supporters. While it is true that political discussions in Taiwan tend to be heated, and can even turn violent, one cannot help but recalling the observation that Judge Damon Keith made in a 2002 federal appeals court ruling, namely that “Democracies die behind closed doors“...|$|E
40|$|Piracy {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} threats confronting the {{entertainment}} industry today. Every year, the industry is estimated to lose billions of dollars in revenue and faces the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. To protect itself against Internet pirates, the entertainment industry has launched the latest copyright war. So far, the industry has been winning. Among its trophies are the enactment of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Vivendi Universal 2 ̆ 7 s defeat and purchase of MP 3. com, the movie studios 2 ̆ 7 victory in the DeCSS litigation, the bankruptcy and subsequent sale of Napster and its recent relaunch as a legitimate subscription-based music service, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of the copyright bargain theory in Eldred v. Ashcroft, and the recording industry 2 ̆ 7 s relative success in its mass litigation campaign. Notwithstanding these victories, the war is expanding and has become even more difficult for the industry to fight than it was a <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>Today,</b> copyright law is no longer a complicated issue that is only of interest and concern to copyright lawyers, legal scholars, technology developers, and intellectual property rightsholders. Rather, it is a matter of public significance, affecting all of us in our daily lives. The ground has shifted. If the entertainment industry does not pay attention to the public and if it continues to use ill-advised battle strategies, it eventually might lose the war. Delivered as part of the 2003 Frontiers in Information and Communications Policy Lecture Series at Michigan State University, this Article examines the strategies used by the entertainment industry to fight the copyright wars: lobbying, litigation, self-help, education, and licensing. It also explores the impact of Eldred v. Ashcroft on these strategies, the decision 2 ̆ 7 s ramifications on future constitutional challenges to copyright laws, and recent developments in the international copyright arena. It concludes by arguing that the entertainment industry should change its existing strategies in light of the proliferation of peer-to-peer file-sharing networks and the increased consciousness of copyright issues...|$|E
40|$|In 1969 {{the first}} {{petroleum}} discovery {{was made on}} the Norwegian continental shelf. This founding {{marks the beginning of}} what has become the most important contribution to the Norwegian economy. Advanced research within the field and development of techniques and equipment has been necessary in the ongoing work, and the technology {{has come a long way}} since 1969. However, when it comes to one of the most important parts of the drilling operation, namely the drilling fluid, the techniques used today are largely based on the same techniques used over 20 <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>Today,</b> the properties of the drilling fluid are manually measured in interval of 15 minutes. By obtaining an automatic update of the drilling fluid measurements, errors caused by human inaccuracy or uncertainties in old-fashioned measurement techniques, can be avoided. It will also be highly significant for the field of automated drilling operations. In this thesis, the functionality of the drilling fluid and the possibility of using unscented Kalman filters to estimate drilling fluid properties have been studied. The implementations were divided into two cases; Case 1 and Case 2. In Case 1 the theory behind the Instrumented stand pipe was applied on pressure measurements made in the annulus. Two systems were used in this case to generate test-data (system inputs and available measurements). A simple model simulating two differential pressures; one over a vertical annulus section, and the other one over a nearly horizontal annulus section, was first implemented in Simulink&# 174;. Based on test-data from this model the unscented Kalman filter was used to estimate the drilling fluid properties density and plastic viscosity. Secondly, the unscented Kalman filter was executed with test-data from the advanced drilling simulator WeMod. In Case 2, the unscented Kalman filter from Case 1 was combined with an unscented Kalman filter estimating the mud pump pressure, choke pressure, flow through the bit, and a geometry parameter. Also in this case, the unscented Kalman filters were tested in two scenarios. First by using test-data from a simple model of a drilling system implemented in Simulink&# 174;, and secondly by using test-data from WeMod. In this thesis it was found that in the scenarios where test-data were generated by the Simulink&# 174; models, the unscented Kalman filter estimating density and plastic viscosity had an acceptable performance. In the scenarios were test-data from WeMod was used, the unscented Kalman filters estimating density and plastic viscosity did not perform as desired. It found that the frictional pressure loss in the vertical and horizontal annulus sections were different in the WeMod simulation, which may partly be the reason for way the filters did not managed to estimate the right density and plastic viscosity. </p...|$|E
