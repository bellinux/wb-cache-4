25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

[...] The {{original}} release of The Marble Index included eight of 12 songs Nico recorded. [...] "Roses in the Snow", [...] "Nibelungen", [...] "Sagen die Gelehrten" [...] and [...] "Reve Reveiller" [...] were left off the album. The finished album was barely 30 minutes long, which [...] "was as much apparently as Frazier Mohawk, mixing and sequencing it, could stand without starting to feel suicidal".|$|E

Jackman commented that with Aronofsky directing, Wolverine 2 {{will not be}} [...] "usual" [...] stating, [...] "This is, hopefully for me, {{going to be out}} of the box. It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure". The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E

500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Lopez, journalist Diane Sawyer of ABC News noted that people [...] "in the abuse counseling industry, have said you can't tell women that, they can't do that. That something that's dangerous, even {{to see it in}} their minds." [...] Lopez responded by stating: [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a movie that has the touches upon those themes, but really, it's a thriller [...] it's about empowering yourself in any situation, you know, that you have. When I read the script, I saw it as, you have the power within yourself, no matter how severe the situation can be, to change whatever that is, to find that power within yourself to change any negative situation." ...|$|E

Widmer – Assistant Radiotelephone Operator; Widmer, who {{has been}} the subject of pointed blame, is quoted as saying, [...] "The most {{disturbing}} thing I saw was one boy—and this was something that, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what haunts me from the whole, the whole ordeal down there. And there was a boy with his arm shot off, shot up half, half hanging on and he just had this bewildered look in his face and like, 'What did I do, what's wrong?' He was just, you know, it's, it's hard to describe, couldn't comprehend. I, I shot the boy, killed him and it's—I'd like to think of it more or less as a mercy killing because somebody else would have killed him in the end, but it wasn't right." [...] Widmer died on August 11, 2016 at the age of 68.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, when {{sentencing}} a defendant, Shamso Miah, for assault, Recorder Booth (Blair) {{announced that}} she would suspend his prison sentence after describing him as a [...] "religious man". The court heard that Miah had been to a mosque shortly before he broke a man's jaw following a row in a bank queue. Blair told Miah: [...] "You are a religious man and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not acceptable behaviour." [...] This was interpreted by some observers as special leniency given {{on account of the}} criminal's religiosity. The Office for Judicial Complaints released an initial statement saying they had [...] "received a number of complaints in relation to the comments" [...] that Blair had made when sentencing Shamso Miah and that the matter was under investigation. On 10 June 2010, the OJC released a statement saying that the investigation had [...] "found that Recorder Booth's observations did not constitute judicial misconduct" [...] and accordingly [...] "no disciplinary action is necessary". A private letter to the National Secular Society said, however, that the OJC had taken action in the form of [...] "informal advice" [...] from a more senior judge.|$|E
2500|$|Tha Carter III {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 84, based on 26 reviews. AllMusic editor David Jeffries praised Wayne's [...] "entertaining wordplay {{and plenty of}} well-executed, left-field ideas". The Guardians Alex Macpherson lauded Wayne's rapping, stating [...] "Just {{trying to keep up}} with Wayne's mind as he proves the case is a thrill. He breaks language down into building blocks for new metaphors, exploiting every possible semantic and phonetic loophole for humour and yanking pop culture references into startling new contexts". Jonah Weiner of Blender called it [...] "a weird, gripping triumph". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen commended its themes and stated [...] "This isn't a mixtape, it's a suite of songs, paced and sequenced for maxaqimum [...] impact." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Wayne [...] "has clearly worked to make Tha Carter III a statement of its own: one that moves beyond standard hip-hop boasting (though there's plenty of that) to thoughts that can be introspective or gleefully unhinged". Pitchforks Ryan Dombal stated, [...] "he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions into a commercially gratifying package". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau noted that [...] "every track attends to detail" [...] and quipped, [...] "From the start <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> no mixtape because it's clearer and more forceful." [...] Uncut stated that [...] "the prince of hip-hop gets a blessing from the king." [...] Mosi Reeves of Paste gave it a favorable review and noted that the album [...] "hearkens to when rap meant rapp: Isaac Hayes talking for days about some girl he broke with, or Bobby Womack signifying while strumming a blues guitar." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called Lil Wayne [...] "the man of the moment, but the disc's best moments strive for timelessness and attain it." ...|$|E
