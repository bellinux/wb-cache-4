500|$|Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized {{again in}} 2013. The act led to further related {{developments}} {{in the creation of}} the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden as co-chair along with Jarrett. Biden has a strong stance on sexual assault. For example, Biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at Stanford University, [...] "you did it... in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking." [...] He has also taken legality into the situation. Biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He stated that, [...] "No means no, if you're drunk or you're sober. No means no if you're in bed, in a dorm or on the street. No means no even if you said yes at first and <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> mind. No means no." ...|$|E

Because the risk associated with this accident also exists in the United States, it is my expectation that the same safety procedures will apply to your operations." ...|$|E

Users in over 145 {{countries can}} purchase apps, although Google notes on its support pages that [...] "Paid content {{may not be}} available in some provinces or territories, even if the governing country is listed above." [...] Developers in over 150 locations can distribute apps on Google Play, though not every location supports merchant registration. To distribute apps, developers {{have to pay a}} one-time $25 registration fee for a Google Play Developer Console account. App developers can control which countries an app is distributed to, as well as the pricing for the app and in-app purchases in each country. Developers receive 70% of the application price, while the remaining 30% goes to the distribution partner and operating fees. Developers can set up sales, with the original price striked out and a banner underneath informing users when the sale ends. Google Play allows developers to release early versions of apps to a select group of users, as alpha or beta tests. Developers can also release apps through staged rollouts, in which [...] "your update reaches only a percentage of your users, which you can increase over time." [...] Users can pre-order select apps (as well as movies, music, books, and games) to have the items delivered as soon as they are available. Some network carriers offer billing for Google Play purchases, allowing users to opt for charges in the monthly phone bill rather than on credit cards. Users can request refunds within 48 hours after a purchase if [...] "something you bought isn't working, isn't what you expected, was bought by accident, or <b>you</b> <b>changed</b> <b>your</b> mind about the purchase". Apps meeting specific usability requirements can qualify as an Android Wear app.|$|E
