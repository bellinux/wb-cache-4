500|$|Troy McClure is a stereotypical Hollywood has-been. He {{was a star}} in {{the early}} 1970s, but his career went {{downhill}} due to rumors of a paraphilia involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos and infomercials. McClure introduces himself by saying, [...] "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> me from such [...] as...," [...] mentioning two titles that are similar to his current performance. For example, in the episode [...] "Bart the Mother", McClure introduces a film about birds by saying, [...] "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> me from such nature films as Earwigs: Eww! and Man vs. Nature: The Road to Victory." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{greatest}} {{pride and}} pleasure was seeing {{you as the}} head of the greatest orchestra in Germany. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> that I missed almost no performance which you conducted, saw only you and was happy. I believed that what I was hearing emanated from you only...the Ninth Symphony will be forever unforgettable to me on account of you. You appeared to me like a God governing all the powerful elements and working enchantments on men. See, dear Richard, you own the power, the glorious gift of creating something great even as a conductor...|$|E
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> that he {{was full}} of ambitions and designs: so soon as he had his health again completely, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> the fortune he was to earn, the {{journeys}} he was to go upon, the delights he was to enjoy and confer, and (among other matters) the masterpiece he was to make of [...] "Prince Otto"! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my lord," [...] {{answered}} Oldbuck, [...] "upon {{occasion of}} an excursion hither from Knockwinnock--and {{since we are}} upon a subject so melancholy, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> perhaps <b>remember</b> whose taste supplied these lines from Chaucer, which now form the motto of the tapestry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kind of queer, wasn't it," [...] Mr. Coulson remarked meditatively, [...] "how I {{seemed to}} get hung up with both of them? <b>You</b> <b>may</b> also <b>remember</b> that at the inquest Mr. Vanderpole's {{business}} with me was testified to by the chief of his department." ...|$|R
5000|$|Similar praise {{comes from}} former President George H.W. Bush, [...] "I'm {{pleased to see}} these three {{distinguished}} Members of the Congress here. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> not <b>remember</b> this ancient history, but Hal Rogers was my Kentucky State chairman in my quest for the Presidency. And what a job that guy did, I'll tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|Wood. Yes, I think I should partly know you, sir: <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> {{some private}} {{passages}} betwixt us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is it,' {{said the}} visitor--'the Gowrie mystery! <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> that an unknown person, {{a friend of}} your ancestor, was engaged?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Mr. Quest, Edgar. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> my brother--Professor Ashleigh--as {{a man of}} science, Quest? He {{has just}} {{returned}} from South America." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-bye! <b>May</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> us {{as long as}} {{it makes}} ye happy, and forget us as soon as it makes ye sad,' said Sergeant Brett.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then there's {{only one}} thing to do. You must find my father and tell him all. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>may</b> rouse him to a sense of what is right. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> make him <b>remember</b> that he has duties as a parent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed; you cannot forget. But <b>you</b> <b>may</b> resolve that, <b>{{remember}}ing</b> me, {{you should}} remember me only for what I am worth. You should not buy your memories at {{too high a}} price." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, your {{experience}} of the fiery phenomenon is more recent than mine,' rejoined Nyttleton carelessly. 'And <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> the nature of it best.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I bear {{a message}} from Captain Borroughcliffe. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> that, {{according}} to your suggestions, the sentinels were to be changed every night, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{you are an}} admirer of poetry," [...] {{answered}} the prisoner; [...] "in that case, Mr Morton, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> these lines,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} central idea," [...] he answered--"the {{weakness}} of our navy and coast defences, {{and that is}} about all I know. My father, {{even when he was}} an admiral on active service, took an absolutely pessimistic view of both. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> perhaps <b>remember</b> this. The Lords of the Admiralty used to consider him, I believe, the one great thorn in their sides." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] the Inspector answered. [...] "It's just as Dr. Wade said. Suggest a fact in {{your past}} history, and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> {{possibly}} <b>remember</b> it; but {{ask you to}} recall anything not suggested or already known, and all seems a mere blank to you! You haven't the faintest idea, then, who the murderer was or what he looked like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot tell,' he said; 'I {{only know}} she was there; and then rising and {{standing}} beside Ethel, he continued--'Miss <b>May,</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> the night of her death?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was wholly unarmed, {{and he is}} {{a desperate}} man with a pistol. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> {{mentioning}} that his capture was not my business." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Mountclere {{paused a}} moment or two. 'By the way, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> {{that he is the}} Mr. Julian who set your song to music!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly so, sir. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> my master--he had the {{left-hand}} state-room to himself, and I slept {{next to the}} scuttle-butt. You recollect master, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very good, my dear Sir,' replied Perker, looking hard at Jingle. 'You {{will see}} me again, young man, to-morrow. I hope <b>you</b> <b>may</b> live to <b>remember</b> and feel deeply, what I {{shall have to}} communicate, Sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My husband! Oh, I {{would that}} I had him not, for I hate him, Macumazahn; {{and as for}} the rest--never! The truth is that I never cared for any man except one whose name <b>you</b> <b>may</b> chance to <b>remember,</b> Macumazahn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an {{excellent}} reason for everything that I do. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> possibly <b>remember</b> that <b>you</b> chaffed me a little, some hours ago, when the sun seemed on {{your side of the}} hedge, so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. Might I ask you, Watson, to open that window, and then to put a match {{to the edge of the}} straw?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did! {{and it was}} {{not wholly}} without foundation. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Limb. Nay, that's very true; for, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> she fed {{very much}} upon larks and pigeons; {{and they are}} very heavy meat, as Pug says.|$|E
60|$|Mary and I (as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember)</b> {{had left}} the bailiff alone at the decoy, and had set forth on our way {{together}} to Dermody's cottage.|$|E
6000|$|... "To you, Captain Lawton, {{it may be}} {{a source}} of triumph, that an uneducated woman should make a mistake in a subject on which men of science have long been at variance; but yet you find this respectable matron does not reject the lights--does not reject the use of proper {{instruments}} in repairing injuries sustained by the human frame. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> possibly <b>remember,</b> sir, her allusion {{to the use of the}} needle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is so grateful, sir, and {{so proud}} of your {{goodness}} in looking at her exercises. The difficulty of the French language seem as nothing to her, now her motive is to please you. She is so devoted to her studies that I {{find it difficult to}} induce her to take the exercise necessary to her health; and, as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> perhaps <b>remember,</b> Susan was always rather weakly as a child. She inherits her father's constitution, Mr. Lepel--not mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vivian," [...] said Mr. Grey, [...] "beware of endeavouring {{to become}} a great man in a hurry. One such attempt in ten {{thousand}} may succeed: these are fearful odds. Admirer as you are of Lord Bacon, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> perhaps <b>remember</b> a certain parable of his, called 'Memnon, or a youth too forward.' I hope {{you are not going}} to be one of those sons of Aurora, 'who, puffed up with the glittering show of vanity and ostentation, attempt actions above their strength.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{married the}} lady {{to a foreign}} gentleman, only last week, at my friend's church," [...] the Chaplain replied. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> her maiden name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{return of}} Lady Dominey to health. I {{was one of}} the few, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember,</b> privileged to make her {{acquaintance}} at the time of your marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Parted {{with every}} barrel of it. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>remember</b> I {{was bound to}} Key West, and a market. Well, I found my market here, in American waters." ...|$|E
5000|$|RMB City REWARD. Come to RMB City, to {{look for}} a missing poet. His name is Wangguowei Wasp. They say it’s the famous poet, Wang Guo Wei, reborn as a Second Life avatar. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> vaguely <b>remember</b> that <b>you</b> have read this poet’s work, that some of the phrases in his poetry could make your heart jump. Because you want to take the {{responsibility}} to find this missing life, you have decided to accept this mission. To search for him, please continue in RMB City to find the clues.|$|R
60|$|For the opakest Bodies, {{if their}} parts be subtilly divided, (as Metals, by being {{dissolved}} in acid Menstruums, &c.) become perfectly transparent. And <b>you</b> <b>may</b> also <b>remember,</b> {{that in the}} eighth Observation there was no sensible reflexion at the Superficies of the Object-glasses, where they were very near one another, though they did not absolutely touch. And in the 17th Observation the Reflexion of the Water-bubble where it became thinnest was almost insensible, so as to cause very black Spots {{to appear on the}} top of the Bubble, by the want of reflected Light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, she {{has great}} recuperative powers," [...] Hilda answered. [...] "They all have in her family, Professor. <b>You</b> <b>may,</b> perhaps, <b>remember</b> Joseph Huntley, who {{occupied}} Number Sixty-seven in the Accident Ward, some nine months since--compound fracture of the arm--a dark, nervous engineer's assistant--very hard to restrain--well, HE was her brother; he caught typhoid fever in the hospital, and you commented {{at the time}} on his strange vitality. Then there was her cousin, again, Ellen Stubbs. We had HER for stubborn chronic laryngitis--a very bad case--anyone else would have died--yielded at once to your treatment; and made, I recollect, a splendid convalescence." ...|$|R
