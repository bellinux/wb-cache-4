25|$|O you, my lovely boy, {{who hold}} in your power Time's {{hour-glass}} and his sickle—you who wane {{as you grow}} older and in that show your friends withering as you yourself grow up: if Nature, sovereign mistress over chaos, as you go onwards will ever pluck you back, she keeps you to demonstrate her power to hold up time. Yet fear her, you who are Nature's darling: she may detain her treasure, but not keep it forever. Her last account, though delayed, must be paid and her discharge is to render <b>you</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings <b>you</b> <b>up</b> short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E

500|$|Interest in {{adapting}} Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed {{shortly after}} its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese {{was interested in}} filming the novel, but never optioned it. Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: [...] "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said {{to him when he}} got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat <b>you</b> <b>up</b> here at the airport, or shall I beat <b>you</b> <b>up</b> back at my apartment? ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song are about lust and sex. Dave Davies said {{of the song}}'s lyrics, You Really Got Me' [...] such a pure record, really. It's a love song for street kids.

500|$|Lawrence Gordon Clark {{had made}} his name as a BBC {{documentary}} director during the 1960s. The Stalls of Barchester was the first dramatic production he directed. Clark recalled in an interview for the BFI's DVD release in 2012 that [...] "the BBC at that time gave you the space to fail, and generously so too. They backed <b>you</b> <b>up</b> with marvellous technicians, art departments, film departments and so forth." ...|$|E

If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear <b>you</b> <b>up,</b> really get you. It was bad. Real bad." [...] Both of Jackson's parents have rejected the longstanding allegations of child abuse by saying that spankings were common when disciplining children back then. The child abuse allegations polarized some of the siblings, with some of them rejecting the claims.|$|E
500|$|Consumed by sport, Wills, to his father's chagrin, {{fell behind}} academically. It {{was said that}} he [...] "could {{not bring himself to}} study for {{professional}} work" [...] after [...] "having led a sort of nomadic life when a youth in Australia". Suffering from homesickness, he decorated his study with objects to remind him of Lexington, including Aboriginal weapons. Horatio wrote to Tom about the latter's friends, the Djab wurrung: [...] "They told me to send <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to them as soon as you came back." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Campling of The Times {{said that}} Fry was smug, [...] "but {{then he has}} a lot to be smug about, not least the ability to waffle for 30 to 45 minutes about not very much without being boring or condescending." [...] The Good Web Guide also {{recommends}} the series, saying that [...] "whether he is bringing <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to date with his recent adventures of just riffing on something that interests him, he is always compelling company." [...] The guide also states, [...] "Stephen Fry is one of those very rare people who are incapable of being boring." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} did {{not escape}} criticism, however, with Tom Chick of IGN criticising {{the layout of}} the levels: [...] "The levels can be awfully linear, throwing <b>you</b> <b>up</b> against some frustrating brick walls where you don't know where to go or what you're supposed to do next. There are some bald key hunts." [...] The artificial intelligence of hostile NPCs received mixed reactions. GameSpot's Ron Dulin praised the AI, saying that they help the suspension of disbelief. Chi Kong Lui of Gamecritics.com, however, gave the opposite view: [...] "Enemy artificial intelligence is still pretty mindless and blasting them doesn't require much skill." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{commented that}} of the album's limited availability, [...] "it's {{hard to get the}} album because the stores {{basically}} said that the last few re-releases [...] had put out did not do well and they didn't want to take a chance. Target and Wal-Mart are not selling the album, and Target is actually my biggest retailer. Best Buy only took limited [...] because they wanted to play it safe. It kinda sets <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to fail." [...] Walmart responded that they do not issue albums with the Parental Advisory label, while Target sold the record on their website anyway.|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} built on a {{recreation}} of electronic musician Aphex Twin's piano composition [...] "Avril 14th". The song begins with a minute long introduction sung by Legend. [...] "Blame Game" [...] has a lush, cello-driven production with predominant piano. After Legend's introduction, West raps his verses in a highly melodic manner, almost singing his lines. West's forceful delivery expresses hurt and contempt. The song's soulful sound juxtaposes West's angry lyrics: [...] "been {{a long time since}} I spoke to you in a bathroom, ripping <b>you</b> <b>up,</b> fuckin' and chokin' you". He subsequently raps less antagonistically and repeatedly confesses [...] "I can't love you this much".|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' <b>you</b> <b>up</b> in my house sayin' <b>you</b> <b>up</b> in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E
500|$|... "Dress You Up" [...] {{was also}} {{the subject of much}} media attention, when it was {{included}} on the Parents Music Resource Center's (PMRC) [...] "Filthy Fifteen" [...] list, for the perceived sexual content of its lyrics. The Center's founder Tipper Gore had heard her daughter listening to the song, and considered the line [...] "Gonna dress <b>you</b> <b>up</b> in my love" [...] as exemplifying [...] "vulgar music". The PMRC called upon the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to give parents a consumer-friendly means of identifying rock records unsuitable for minors—a rating system based on lyrical content. [...] "Dress You Up" [...] received a rating of [...] "S", for [...] "sex and obscenity", from the RIAA.|$|E

6000|$|... "How shall I give <b>thee</b> <b>up,</b> Ephraim?" [...] Ephraim was a revolter from God, a {{man that}} had given himself up to devilism: a company of men, the ten tribes, that worshipped devils, while Judah kept with his God. [...] "But how shall I give <b>thee</b> <b>up,</b> Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? (and yet thou art worse than they: nor has Samaria {{committed}} half thy sins); Ezek. xvi. 46-51. My heart is turned within me, and my repentings are kindled together;" [...] Hos. xi. 8.|$|R
500|$|Japanese gaming {{magazine}} Famitsu gave Dragon Quest X a {{score of}} 36 points out of 40, who delayed their review until they had sufficient experience with the game after launch. One reviewer praised the presentation [...] "from the warmly familiar world to the story that {{has a tendency to}} wrap <b>you</b> <b>up</b> in it". They also praised the gameplay and its openness to accept novice players, despite the reviewer noting that it seemed to take longer to level up a character compared to offline Dragon Quest entries. Two of the other reviewers pointed out issues with messaging, and a lack of guidance about which enemies were too strong for a player character's current level.|$|E
500|$|Jonny Greenwood {{described}} [...] "Scatterbrain (As Dead as Leaves)" [...] as [...] "very {{simple and}} sort of quite pretty, but there's something about the music for me, the chords for me, where it never quite resolves." [...] The NME described the album's final track, [...] "A Wolf at the Door (It Girl. Rag Doll.)" [...] as [...] "a pretty song, with a sinister monologue {{over the top of}} it"; Greenwood likened its lyrics to a Grimms' fairy tale. Yorke described the song's placement {{at the end of the}} album as [...] "sort of like waking <b>you</b> <b>up</b> at the end... it's all been a nightmare and you need to go and get a glass of water now." ...|$|E
500|$|MTV {{said that}} [...] "Miles Away", the third single from the album, {{was the most}} deceptively simple track because {{although}} it appeared straightforward on the surface, {{it had a lot}} of technical tricks underneath it. The song departs from the dance theme of the album and deals with the difficulties of long-distance relationships. [...] "Miles Away" [...] is a melancholy electronic ballad, which, according to Madonna is autobiographical, and is inspired by her then husband Guy Ritchie. The relationship themed lyrics continue in the next track [...] "She's Not Me", which talks about Madonna being emulated by another woman, hence she utters the line [...] "She started dressing like me and talking like me, It freaked me out, She started calling <b>you</b> <b>up</b> {{in the middle of the}} night, What's that about?" ...|$|E
