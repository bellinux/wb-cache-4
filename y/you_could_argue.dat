[...] In a move that would lead to the discontinuation of the Supermarionation format, Anderson and Grade coordinated to transfer most of the production staff from the Century 21 base at the Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire for the commencement of filming on UFO, the Andersons' first full live-action series.|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien was {{the chief}} {{negotiator}} {{of what would be}} called the [...] "Kitchen Accord", an agreement which led to the agreement of nine provinces to patriation. In the Kitchen Accord, Chrétien, Roy McMurtry and Roy Romanow came up with the compromise of Section 33, the so-called [...] "notwithstanding clause" [...] allowing Parliament and provincial legislatures to overrule the courts in Charter cases. Chrétien remembered that Trudeau [...] "hated" [...] the idea of Section 33 and that he had to tell him: [...] "Pierre, if you don’t take the notwithstanding clause, you don’t have the Charter." [...] Trudeau only accepted Section 33 when the Ontario Premier Bill Davis, who together with New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield, were the only premiers supporting the federal government phoned him to say he would join the [...] "Gang of 8" [...] if Trudeau did not accept Section 33, which Chrétien remembered changed Trudeau's attitude completely. In a 2012 interview, Chrétien defended the controversial Section 33, saying: [...] "Because some would argue that in a society the elected people have to be supreme — not judges — and I subscribe to that. Look at what happened in the United States where the judges reign according to their so-called philosophy. That is not the tradition here." [...] With the exception of Parti Québécois Quebec Premier René Lévesque, all of the [...] "Gang of 8" [...] premiers accepted the compromise of Section 33. Chrétien's role in the dealings, however, would not be forgotten in his native province of Quebec, which did not ratify the Constitution Act of 1982 (although the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Quebec was bound by it). One of Trudeau's aides Barry Strayer later said about Chrétien's role in the constitutional battle: [...] "He was able to contemplate compromises that Trudeau would have been able to. Everybody saw him as a honest broker. Without him <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> it would not have happened".|$|E

40|$|The Constitution we {{have now}} is redacted. Any {{practicing}} lawyer will tell you that you cannot go into court and argue the Ninth Amendment.

You cannot argue the Second Amendment outside the Fifth Circuit. Whole sections of the Constitution are now gone. This is the lost Constitution. It is not a set of pre- 1937 results; it is a set of post- 1789 provisions of the Constitution that are, for all practical purposes, dead letters.

40|$|Lately, {{the concept}} of {{flexicurity}} has been enthusiastically discussed in the European Union. It has become commonplace to advocate flexicurity policy as the solution to all the economic problems of the EU countries. The European Commission has {{described it as a}} welfare state model with four components: flexible and reliable contractual arrangements, comprehensive lifelong learning strate-gies, effective active labour market policies and modern social security systems. However, although such policies may seem very desirable, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> also <b>argue</b> that the widespread use of such a vague concept as flexicurity is potentially dangerous. It is possible to identify at least four potential prob-lems: a tendency to mix up instruments and objectives, a tendency to pretend that all good things can be achieved simultaneously without the need to analyse difficult trade-offs, the view that social dialogue and consensus are always a desirable means to achieve a well functioning labour market, and the view that it is desirable to adopt common principles of flexicurity in the EU. The main danger is that the practice of trying to subsume a number of different policy approaches under the common heading of flexicurity leads to less clarity regarding the policy options available...|$|R
5000|$|Never Trust a Happy Song {{had some}} detractors. Huw Jones of Slant Magazine felt the album paled in {{comparison}} to the band's self-titled EP with adequate lyrics and shoddy song placement derailing its true strength, saying that [...] "Never Trust a Happy Songs finer moments arrive when Grouplove is crafting sun-kissed anthems that deserve to be blared across beaches or, at least, from the speakers of any open-top car en route to the shore." [...] Writing for musicOMH, Max Raymond noted that the tracks throughout the album flip-flop between overly schmaltzy sugar and transparent mediocrity with decent songwriting and face value quality: [...] "On their own merits some of these tracks are classy pop songs, but there needs to be more depth and scope to Grouplove’s sound if they are to look forward." [...] Drowned in Sound's Robert Cooke felt there was moments on the album that showed the band's potential, but it was ruined by the jumbling of different genres and questionable instrumentation choices throughout the songs. The harshest review came from James Parker, who wrote for Tiny Mix Tapes; he heavily criticized the band's upbeat, sunny demeanor for being an [...] "indie equivalent" [...] to mainstream pop hits and said that it only catered to hipster parties, concluding that [...] "Considering what this record’s meant to be doing, then, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> reasonably <b>argue</b> that it does it pretty well. Except I won’t. Because this is neither a vision of musical performance nor a kind of listening practice that I for one particularly want to defend." ...|$|R
