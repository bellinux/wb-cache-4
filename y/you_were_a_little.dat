500|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{for the failure of}} Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls [...] "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?" [...] His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding Oliveri's backing vocal contributions, Homme noted: [...] "Nick and I {{have been}} friends since a couple weeks after {{everything}} went down in 2004. People don't know that, {{and it would be}} awkward for me to run around making sure everyone knew it. Nick recorded his new record at my studio, and then he was going to drop off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.' That's a nice thing. It was easy. It's nice to know someone since <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid, and still know them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heenan is [...] {{considered}} by many to be the greatest wrestling manager of all time, including WWE, who placed him at the top of their 25 greatest managers list in 2011. Author Brian Shields notes that many consider him [...] "one of the most significant figures in professional wrestling history". For his work in promoting André the Giant's match with Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania III, often cited as the most famous American professional wrestling match, Heenan received a six-figure payoff—arguably the largest pay day in any managerial career. Broadcaster Peter Rosenberg considers Heenan a personal hero and describes him as the best commentator, manager and bad guy in WWE history. Rosenberg stated that Heenan [...] "operated on multiple levels", adding: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid, he was the foil to your hero. As an adult, you look back and appreciate just how much of a comedic genius he was." ...|$|E
