25|$|The book is very interesting, but <b>you</b> <b>still</b> {{need more}} evidence. We don't {{regard it as}} an {{historical}} book, but as a narrative one. I {{want to see more}} proof. But at least Menzies has started something, and people could find more evidence.|$|E

In Abemama, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> can find physical evidence of American and Japanese WWII relics, cultural shrines and sites/monuments relating to their traditional spirits and famous King Binoka.

The lagoon is abundant in bonefish, a popular species with sport anglers.|$|E

25|$|Version 5.5 {{followed}} in July 2000.

Version 5.5 also includes support for 128-bit encryption.
