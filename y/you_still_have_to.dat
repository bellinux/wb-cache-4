2500|$|The {{lawsuit was}} {{dismissed}} by judge Michele M. Fox on July 15, 2009. O'Brien said, [...] "I'm deeply grateful that the court's decision has vindicated the reporting in 'TrumpNation,'" [...] while Trump said, {{in regard to}} his net worth, [...] "We've proven our case. When you're worth over $5 billion or $6 billion and you've proven that, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> prove malice. The libel laws are very bad." [...] The trial {{had been scheduled to}} begin on October 13, 2009. Trump appealed the decision to dismiss the lawsuit, but an appeals court affirmed the decision in September 2011. Both courts cited Trump's lack of [...] "clear and convincing" [...] evidence as the reason for their decisions.|$|E

While participating in the popular music competition franchise, she had difficulty dealing with the limelight. Savage was quoted as saying, [...] "You have to always realize that people are watching. When I got the bad news that I wasn't getting through [...] {{it was a really}} painful time. But <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn how to hold that until you get home.

For example, the Philadelphia Cream Cheese Heaven campaign emphasises low fat in its product, so a viewer commented that, in the ad, even after dying and going to heaven, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> worry about your weight.|$|E
50|$|According to Moody, the {{composition}} was about overcoming routine roadblocks and less-than-ideal circumstances in life. He {{then goes on}} to say that while most of us weren't born into wealth, if life deals you a bad hand, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play with the cards that life deals you. Moody closes by stating that the song is intended to inspire and that if you play your hand right, you might still come out on top.|$|E

5000|$|The {{opening line}} in the song has the singer {{wondering}} why {{he went to the}} room of a [...] "stranger" [...] for comfort. It is left ambiguous whether the stranger is someone other than his lover, or whether the stranger is actually his lover, to whom he has become so alienated that she seems like a stranger. In another line, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> carry that cross?", the singer uses The Passion as a metaphor for his lover's refusal to forgive him.|$|E

50|$|As {{the twentieth}} century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and {{opportunities}} for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. An early way out was to carry the circumlocutions one degree further—finding impersonal ways of saying what was needful, avoiding both personal pronoun and title (Får det lov att vara en kopp kaffe?, approximately 'Might it be a cup of coffee?'; Så det är till att resa?, approximately 'So, it is about travelling?'), often using the passive voice. However, that soon proved of little avail. For one thing, <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> address the person you talked with directly {{from time to time}} in the conversation, otherwise you would really have sounded impolite—and over time, it became de rigueur to do so more and more often, until it was a system with both longish titles used instead of personal pronouns and impersonal circumlocutions; and for another, the impersonal constructions soon acquired their own gradations, to be observant upon—e.g., that in the second example above being perceived as more and more rustic, ending up rude.|$|R

5000|$|Property {{expressions}} {{is especially}} handy for classes with child objects. If a class exposes sub objects (object lists) you had, prior to generics, {{to write a}} lot of the same code over and over again, wrapping already existing code in a list object—which for complex class hierarchies reduces execution speed with unnecessary bloat. This has changed for the better with the introduction of generics, but <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> isolate reader and writer logic in distinct class members.

50|$|I {{created a}} series of {{characters}} that came from our visits to Maine. Offshore Flo is patterned after the Maine Diner in Wells. I wanted to {{capture the essence of}} Maine people's genuineness - down-to-earth, good-natured people - and work in the accent. I heard from displaced New Englanders. I got E-mails from people who said how dead-on the accent was and how dead wrong. It's tricky working phonetically because <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be legible, finding the balance of how far to take it. It's set in Whatchacallit, Maine.

Lead singer Ivan Moody remarked that [...] "just to work alongside an icon like Rob Halford, The Metal God, was absolutely surreal." [...] Moody has said of the song's lyrical themes: [...] "The song itself was originally written about overcoming everyday obstacles and less-than-perfect situations.
