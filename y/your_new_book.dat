60|$|Write to {{me again}} in my {{infinite}} distance. Tell me about <b>your</b> <b>new</b> <b>book.</b> No harm in telling ME; I am too far off to be indiscreet; there are too few near me who would care to hear. I am rushes by the riverside, and the stream is in Babylon: breathe your secrets to me fearlessly; and if the Trade Wind caught and carried them away, there are none to catch them nearer than Australia, unless it were the Tropic Birds. In the unavoidable absence of my amanuensis, who is buying eels for dinner, I have thus concluded my despatch, like St. Paul, with my own hand.|$|E
6000|$|Voltaire had {{acknowledged}} Rousseau's gift of {{the second}} Discourse with his usual shrewd pleasantry: [...] "I have received <b>your</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> against the human race, {{and thank you for}} it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One longs in reading your book to walk on all fours. But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves. So I content myself with being a very peaceable savage in the solitude which I have chosen near your native place, where you ought to be too." [...] After an extremely inadequate discussion of one or two points in the essay,[331] he concludes:--"I am informed that your health is bad; you ought to come to set it up again in your native air, to enjoy freedom, to drink with me the milk of our cows and browse our grass."[332] Rousseau replied to all this in a friendly way, recognising Voltaire as his chief, and actually at the very moment when he tells us that the corrupting presence of the arrogant and seductive man at Geneva helped to make the idea of returning to Geneva odious to him, hailing him in such terms as these:--"Sensible of the honour you do my country, I share the gratitude of my fellow-citizens, and hope that it will increase when they have profited by the lessons that you of all men are able to give them. Embellish the asylum you have chosen; enlighten a people worthy of your instruction; and do you who know so well how to paint virtue and freedom, teach us to cherish them in our walls."[333] ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{acknowledging}} your {{so interesting}} letter at once; because I find {{that under the}} effect of all our conditions here I can't answer for any postal fluency, however reduced in quality or quantity, at an indefinite future time. My fluency of the moment even, such as it is, has to take the present mechanic form; but here goes, at any rate, {{to the extent of}} my having rejoiced to hear from you, not of much brightness though your news may be. I tenderly condole and participate with you on your having been again flung into bed. Truly the haul on your courage has to keep on being enormous--and I applaud to the echo the wonderful way that virtue in you appears to meet it. You strike me as leading verily the heroic life at a pitch nowhere and by nobody surpassed--even though our whole scene bristles all over with such grand examples of it. Since you are up and at work again may that at least go bravely on--while I marvel again, according to my wont, at your still finding it possible in conditions that I fear would be for me dismally [...] "inhibitive." [...] I bless <b>your</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> even if you didn't in our last talk leave me with much grasp of {{what it is to be}} [...] "about." [...] In presence of any suchlike intention I find I want a subject to be able quite definitely to state and declare itself--as a subject; and when the thing is communicated to me (in advance) in the form of So-and-So's doing this, that or the other, or Something-else's [...] "happening" [...] and so on, I kind of yearn for the expressible idea or motive, what the thing is to be done for, to have been presented to me; which you may say perhaps is asking a good deal. I don't think so, if any cognisance at all is vouchsafed one; it is the only thing I in the least care to ask. What the author shall do with his idea I am quite ready to wait for, but am meanwhile in no relation to the work at all unless that basis has been provided. Console yourself, however: dear great George Meredith once began to express to me what a novel he had just started ("One of Our Conquerors") was to be about by no other art than by simply naming to me the half-dozen occurrences, such as they were, that occupied the pages he had already written; so that I remained, I felt, quite without an answer to my respectful inquiry--which he had all the time the very attitude of kindly encouraging and rewarding! ...|$|E

When you are twelve you walk back in yourself with your best dress and shoes on, and <b>your</b> <b>new</b> prayer <b>book</b> <b>your</b> mother buys you, and you {{walk up to the}} Bishop, and he stands up, and you knell down, and he mashes on your head, and you are an Episcopal. Then you are supposed to increase in spirit. Then everyone kisses you and that's a sacrament. Only I left out the bread and wine. That's a sacrament too. I tasted some of the bread in the choir room and it tasted just like my gold fish wafers." ...|$|R

6000|$|I have {{beautiful}} communications {{from you}} all too long unacknowledged and unrequited--though I shall {{speak for the}} present but {{of the two most}} prized letters from you (from Cambridge and Chocorua respectively--not counting quaint sequels from Franconia, [...] "autumn-tint" [...] post-cards etc., a few days ago, or thereabouts, and leaving aside altogether, but only for later fond treatment, please assure them, an admirable one from Harry and an exquisite one from Bill.) To these I add the arrival, still more recently, of <b>your</b> brave <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> which I fell upon immediately and have quite passionately absorbed--to within 50 pages of the end; a great number previous to which I have read this evening--which makes me late to begin this. I find it of thrilling interest, triumphant and brilliant, and am lost in admiration of your wealth and power. I palpitate as you make out your case (since {{it seems to me you}} so utterly do,) as I under no romantic spell ever palpitate now; and into that case I enter intensely, unreservedly, and I think you would allow almost intelligently. I find you nowhere as difficult as you surely make everything for your critics. Clearly you are winning a great battle and great will be your fame. Your letters seem to me to reflect a happy and easy summer achieved--and I recognise in them with rapture, and I trust not fallaciously, a comparative immunity from the horrid human incubi, the awful [...] "people" [...] fallacy, of the past, and your ruinous sacrifices to that bloody Moloch. May this luminous exemption but grow and grow! and with it your personal and physical peace and sufficiency, your profitable possession of yourself.

It is amazing how still now, {{after two years of}} massive Israeli destruction of the Palestinian society, so {{little is known about the}} real facts of how this war developed, and what Israel's role in it is.

Our starting point is that, in a fast and profoundly changing world, everybody designs. "Everybody" means not only individual people, groups, communities, companies, and associations, but also institutions, cities, and entire regions; and "design" means that, whether they like it or not, all these individual and collective entities are forced to bring all their designing capabilities into play to devise their life strategies {{and put them into}} practice. The result of this diffuse designing is that society as a whole {{can be seen as a}} huge laboratory in which unprecedented social forms, solutions and meanings are produced and social innovation is created...|$|E

We are delighted to announce the society’s sponsorship of a new UP book series and are grateful to Astrida Tantillo and others for brokering that deal.

Of particular significance is an invitation to nominate members to three positions on the board. We ask that you to do so by September 1.
