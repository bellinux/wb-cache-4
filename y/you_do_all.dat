500|$|The alto aria, [...] "" [...] (Ah, Lord, {{what is a}} human being), is {{accompanied}} by a solo oboe d'amore that [...] "expresses wonder about the nature of man" [...] and God's interest in him. The aria, as the first one, is not a da capo aria, but in two parts. The idea of man in a sinful condition which is presented first, is changed to redemption. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann relates the choice of the oboe d'amore to the answer to the singer's question [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> this for man?": [...] "Aus Liebe" [...] (through love).|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have called}} the video NSFW, {{comparing}} it to the 2013 video for [...] "Blurred Lines" [...] by Robin Thicke with Pharrell Williams and T.I.. In an interview with Capital FM, Thicke responded {{to a question about}} the videos' similarity: [...] "No comment. I'll let <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the talking. It's a subject that has no good ending." [...] Fact magazine called the video's concept simple, and said its production team was unconcerned. According to Spins Jordan Sargent, [...] "Like his new album The 20/20 Experience, in which half the songs run longer than seven minutes, the 'Tunnel Vision' video is self-consciously artistic and mature. But the video is also at times effective, particularly when the editing gets choppier during the bridge." ...|$|E

500|$|Far Side Virtual mainly designates a {{space in}} society, or a mode of behaving. All of these things {{operating}} in synchronicity: like ringtones, flat-screens, theater, cuisine, fashion, sushi. I don't {{want to call it}} [...] "virtual reality," [...] so I call it Far Side Virtual. If you really want to understand Far Side, first off, listen to [...] Debussy, and secondly, go into a frozen yogurt shop. Afterwards, go into an Apple store and just fool around, hang out in there. Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks—buy this book and go home. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> these things you'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already.|$|E
2500|$|During a talk in 1991, Schneerson spoke {{passionately about}} Moshiach (the Messiah) {{and told his}} {{followers}} {{that he had done}} all that he could to bring world peace and redemption, but that it was now up to them to continue this task: [...] "I have done my part, from now on <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> that you can." [...] A few months later, when a reporter from CNN came to meet him at dollars, he said, [...] "Moshiach is ready to come now, it is only on our part to do something additional in the realm of goodness and kindness." ...|$|E

Benedict knows that his mom could not have {{disappeared}} forever {{when she went to}} swim in the sea. He believes that she is still alive and one day she will return. The weeks and months can pass, there can be a bunch of doubters around him and even grandma can make arrangements to bring a new mommy to Dad, but Benedict knows that Mom is alive! Maybe the UFOs took her. Maybe Mickey the monkey from the fairy tale picked her up [...] will bring her back in his boat. Maybe smugglers picked her up in that sudden sea storm on that fateful day, took her far away, beyond the seven seas, but one day, someone {{picks up the phone and}} calls a number at home… ...|$|E
