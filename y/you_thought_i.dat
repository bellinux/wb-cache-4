When {{asked about the}} {{background}} of lead single [...] "First Time", Wade said, [...] "It just felt urgent, like a first kiss, a first love.

[...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E
