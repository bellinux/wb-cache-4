50|$|The {{issue of}} {{training}} and qualifications for Catholic <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> is normally a sticky question {{in many parts of}} the world. The advantages and generosity of lay volunteers, for instance, is often augmented in the minds of some people by their lack of catechetical and theological knowledge in comparison especially to priests and also by their lack of training in informal education in comparison to secular <b>youth</b> <b>workers.</b> Many systems to educate and train <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> have appeared and <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> are able to participate in schemes for catechists (such as the CCRS in the UK). Also many <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> in the Church are increasingly opting for secular training. On the whole though, the Church still lacks a formal and widely recognized system {{of training and}} achievement for <b>youth</b> <b>workers.</b> Although a Foundation Degree in Youth Work/ Youth Ministry (with professional JNC recognition) started in September 2007 at Newman University, Birmingham.

This park {{features}} a running track, three baseball diamonds, a skating rink, a public swimming pool and tennis courts. Just {{to the east of}} Riverdale Park is Withrow Park which has a large off-leash dog area, an ice rink, two baseball diamonds, play structures, and a soccer field. In South Riverdale is Jimmy Simpson Park which contains tennis courts and a community centre. In the southwest corner just north of Queen St. East on Broadview Avenue is the Royal Canadian Curling Club. The curling club features six sheets and hosts leagues for about 500 members. The last park in Riverdale located further east along Blake Street is Kempton Howard Park (formerly East View Park) and was renamed in 2007 in honour of a <b>youth</b> <b>worker</b> who was killed in 2003 in the Blake/Boultbee community in which he lived and worked.

25|$|Frank Caplan (June 10, 1911 – September 28, 1988) was a <b>youth</b> <b>worker,</b> educator, folk toy collector, and {{pioneer in}} {{developing}} and manufacturing educational toys for children. He co-founded Creative Playthings in 1945 with his wife Theresa, and worked with artists, architects, and designers, such as Isamu Noguchi, Louis Kahn, Henry Moore, Robert Winston, and the Swiss toymaker, Antonio Vitali, to create innovative educational play objects and playground designs for children. By the 1950s, Creative Playthings had gained international recognition and expanded {{to become one of}} the most important manufacturers and suppliers of materials for early childhood education. In 1975, Frank Caplan founded The Princeton Center for Infancy and Early Childhood. He researched and co-authored a national bestselling series on early childhood development with Theresa Caplan, which included, The First Twelve Months of Life (1977), The Second Twelve Months of Life (1978), and The Early Childhood Years: The 2 to 6 Year Old (1983). Together they also co-authored The Power of Play (1973). He was one of the first male nursery school teachers in the U.S. and together with Theresa Caplan collected over 50,000 American and international folk toys, folk art, and contemporary playthings, which in 1984 the couple donated to The Children's Museum of Indianapolis for a permanent gallery on folk, fantasy, and play.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this qualitative study was to gain preliminary knowledge {{of the nature of}} youth workers’ dilemmas involving families and the underlying issues they entail. This study used grounded theory methods of analysis to explore the dilemmas <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> face regarding families of participants in twelve high quality youth programs serving high school aged youth. The two questions explored were: What categories of dilemmas do <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> face regarding families? What considerations do <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> have when faced with such dilemmas? Four dilemma categories with distinct considerations were identified that specifically focused on the parents of participants. The dilemmas <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> faced included being concerned about a participant with family problems, having the parent of a participant make demands on the program, having a parent not support their child’s participation, and needing to share information with parents. This study suggests that effective <b>youth</b> <b>workers</b> engage in a reflective process as well as a strategic balancing of interests to best serve youth when such dilemmas arose...|$|R

This {{was the first}} truly local radio station for the town since BCR FM was bought by Choice Media in 2006 which eventually became The Breeze. Access FM was initiated {{as a function of}} Bridgwater's YMCA and as such held the same values as the charity. Access FM was founded by Martin Hodgson (CEO of Bridgwater YMCA), Grant Francis (owner of [...] ) and Tom Copestake, a <b>youth</b> <b>worker</b> who had worked with a Christian radio station in Coventry before moving to work at Bridgwater YMCA. Soon after the station launched on 9 June 2013, Jason Pimm joined the management team to help with development. The community station began with the intentions of providing youth based programming to 16 - 25 year olds in order to give the younger generation something new and productive to get involved with. Many of the voluntary presenters were aged 16 – 20 and the station acted as the first step into the industry. Under the management and direction of Tom Copestake and technical skills of Grant Francis, Access FM had mild success within the community, attending multiple events and marking new ground for local radio in the area. The station was the first in history to provide live broadcast coverage from Bridgwater Guy Fawkes Carnival in 2014.|$|E

One of his teachers described him as a militant radical who was interested in both far-right and far-left movements.

2500|$|The {{origins of}} Delirious? stretch back to 1992. The band began {{life as a}} {{collection}} of musicians, known simply as 'The Cutting Edge Band'. The group's function was to be a Christian worship band for a youth outreach event called [...] "Cutting Edge", instigated by the Arun Community Church in Littlehampton, West Sussex. The first members were Tim Jupp and Martin Smith, who became friends while working together at a recording studio. There they decided to form a band. Jupp had previously released an instrumental album titled [...] "Hooked On Ishmael". Originally, Jupp fronted the band, which also contained <b>youth</b> <b>worker</b> and drummer Stew Smith. Several different musicians filled the role of guitarist and bass player. The events became popular via word-of-mouth, leading the band to play at other 'Cutting Edge' events along the south coast of England – monthly events in Portsmouth and Southampton. The events in Portsmouth only lasted a year but the events in Central Hall, Southampton were to run for three years, the duration of the Cutting Edge events. The group remained as the house band for Cutting Edge for several years, and they began to record and release the 'Cutting Edge' cassette tapes. The turnout at the events grew so much that the regular venue (a local school hall) had to be replaced with the school's sports hall, whilst the organizers had to charge a small fee to control the numbers attending. Similar challenges took place at the Central Hall in Southampton where up to 1200 people would gather each month. In 1996, an event was held in the open air, on the green next to Littlehampton's beach. An estimated 4000 people attended, while Channel 4 filmed it for a documentary.|$|E
