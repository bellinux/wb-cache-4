60|$|This is St. Peter's day. It will be {{well worth}} our while to think a little over St. Peter, {{and what kind of}} man he was.

60|$|You {{all know}} that this Sunday is called the First Sunday in Advent. You all know, I hope, that Advent means coming, and that these four Sundays before Christmas, as I have often told you, are called Advent Sundays, because upon them {{we are called to}} {{consider}} the coming of our King and Saviour Jesus Christ. If you will look at the Collects, Epistles, and Gospels for these next four Sundays, you will see at once that they all bear upon our Lord's coming. The Gospels tell us of the prophecies about Christ which He fulfilled when He came. The Epistles tell us what sort of men we ought to be, both clergy and people, because He has come and will come again. The Collects pray that the Spirit of God would make us fit to live and die in a world into which Christ has come, and in which He is ruling now, and to which He will come again. The text which I have taken this morning, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> in this Sunday's Gospel. St. Matthew tells you that Jesus Christ fulfilled it by riding into Jerusalem in state upon an ass's colt; and St. Matthew surely speaks truth. Let us consider what the prophecy is, and how Jesus Christ fulfilled it. Then we shall see and believe from the Epistle what effect the knowledge of it ought to have upon our own souls, and hearts, and daily conduct.|$|E

Itâs not just Katrina that caused all these deaths in New Orleans here. Bureaucracy has committed murder here in the greater New Orleans area and bureaucracy has to stand trial before Congress now....Three quick examples. We had Wal-Mart deliver three trucks of water. FEMA turned them back. They said we didnât need them. This was a week ago. FEMA, we had 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel on a Coast Guard vessel docked in my parish. When we got there with our trucks, FEMA says donât give you the fuel. Yesterday â yesterday â FEMA comes in and cuts all of our emergency communication lines. They cut them without notice. Our sheriff, Harry Lee, goes back in, he reconnects the line. He posts armed guards and said no one is getting near these linesâ¦I want to give you one last story and Iâll shut up and let you tell me whatever you want to tell me.

40|$|Sounds of idling Diesel engines {{were rated}} {{according}} to their Dieselness with two different psychoacoustic methods. On the one hand, a yes/no procedure was used.

On the other hand, the method of paired comparison was used, applying a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) procedure. Both procedures yield rather similar results with an advantage of the yes/no-procedure in efficiency. Comparisons of psychoacoustic evaluations with predictions of Dieselness by four different algorithms show much room for improvement of the instrumental evaluations. ...|$|E
