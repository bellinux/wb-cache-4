6000|$|That {{night when}} Halleck {{had left the}} old man {{to the care of}} Marcia and Olive, for the time, a note was brought to him from Bartley's lawyer, begging the favor of a few moments' {{interview}} on very important business. It might be some offer of reparation or advance in Marcia's interest, and Halleck went with the bearer of the note. The lawyer met him hospitably at the door of his office. [...] "How do you do, sir?" [...] he said, shaking hands. Then he indicated a bulk withdrawn into a corner of the dimly-lighted room; the blinds were drawn, and he locked the door after Halleck's entrance. [...] "Mr. Hubbard, whom I think you know," [...] he added. [...] "I'll just step into the next room, gentlemen, and will be subject to <b>your</b> <b>call</b> <b>at</b> any moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{question}} you {{as to the}} reason for your getting it," [...] he answered. [...] "Very shortly afterwards you left your carriage in Pall Mall, and without even asking for <b>your</b> husband you <b>called</b> <b>at</b> his hotel--you stole up into his room." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bradley smiled, {{and glanced}} at her husband's indorsement--"All right. Wade in." [...] "It's nothing but Jim's slang," [...] she said, with a laugh and a {{slightly}} heightened color. [...] "He ought not to have sent you by that short cut; it's a bother, and even dangerous for a stranger. If you had come directly to US by the road, without making <b>your</b> first <b>call</b> <b>at</b> the mill," [...] she added, {{with a touch of}} coquetry, [...] "you would have had a pleasanter walk, and seen US sooner. I suppose, however, you got off the stage at the mill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing but sentry-go, your honour," [...] replied Joyce. [...] "I am {{as fresh}} as a {{regiment}} that is just marching out of barracks, and can easily stand the guard till daylight. Still, as it was orders to <b>call</b> <b>your</b> honour <b>at</b> two, I could do no less, you know, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Make {{sure of it}} however. A lawyer'll do {{that for}} you, with very little trouble. Then, take your name off the turf at once; it's worth your while to do it now. You may either do it by a bona fide sale of the horses, or by running them in some other person's name. Then, watch <b>your</b> opportunity, <b>call</b> <b>at</b> Grey Abbey, when the earl is not at home, and manage {{to see some of}} the ladies. If you can't do that, if you can't effect an entrée, write to Miss Wyndham; don't be too lachrymose, or supplicatory, in your style, but ask her to give you a plain answer personally, or in her own handwriting." ...|$|R
50|$|On July 12, 2006 as {{a result}} of the CTVglobemedia/CHUM Limited merger, CKALs local newscasts (with the {{exception}} of the noon newscast) were immediately discontinued; the local newscasts were replaced by a half-hour news magazine program <b>called</b> <b>Your</b> City <b>at</b> 6 and 11 p.m., along with CityNews International (produced at the CityNews studios in Toronto, Ontario).|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} her presently. She {{will be here}} to dinner, with Agnes and Harry. I sent her off, because I wanted to have you all to myself, for the first hour. The others came up to town, three days ago, on purpose to be here when you arrived. Of course, we heard when <b>your</b> ship <b>called</b> <b>at</b> Plymouth. We had been looking for her, for your last letter told us the name of the vessel that you were coming by; so I wrote to them, and they came up at once. They wanted us to go and dine with them, but I would not hear of it. I was sure that you would much rather dine quietly, here, than in state in Portman Square, with three or four footmen behind our chairs." ...|$|R
50|$|This treats of the farmer's {{year month}} by month and of rural economy in general; it is Ellis's best work, though such a {{sentence}} as 'Be yourself {{the first man}} up in a morning for sounding at your door your harvest horn to <b>call</b> <b>your</b> men <b>at</b> four o'clock,' contrasts amusingly with the writer's own practice according to those who went to visit him at Little Gaddesden.|$|R
6000|$|Nor in jokes at {{the expense}} of policemen is the fun entirely on your side. Maybe I did not proceed with judgment. It occurs to me now, looking back, that the neighbourhoods of Covent Garden and Great Marlborough Street were ill-chosen for sport of this nature. To bonnet a fat {{policeman}} is excellent fooling. While he is struggling with his helmet you can ask him comic questions, {{and by the time he}} has got his head free you are out of sight. But the game should be played in a district where there is not an average of three constables to every dozen square yards. When two other policemen, who have had their eye on you for the past ten minutes, are watching the proceedings from just round the next corner, you have little or no leisure for due enjoyment of the situation. By the time you have run the whole length of Great Titchfield Street and twice round Oxford Market, you are of opinion that a joke should never be prolonged beyond the point at which there is danger of its becoming wearisome; and that the time has now arrived for home and friends. The [...] "Law," [...] on the other hand, now raised by reinforcements to a strength of six or seven men, is just beginning to enjoy the chase. You picture to yourself, while doing Hanover Square, the scene in Court the next morning. You will be accused of being drunk and disorderly. It will be idle for you to explain to the magistrate (or to your relations afterwards) that you were only trying to live up to a man who did this sort of thing in a book and was admired for it. You will be fined the usual forty shillings; and on the next occasion of <b>your</b> <b>calling</b> <b>at</b> the Mayfields' the girls will be out, and Mrs. Mayfield, an excellent lady, who has always taken a motherly interest in you, will talk seriously to you and urge you to sign the pledge.|$|R
50|$|On July 12, 2006, the station's local newscasts (with the {{exception}} of CityNews at Noon) were immediately cancelled after years of ratings struggle in the Edmonton market. The local newscasts were replaced by a half-hour newsmagazine program <b>called</b> <b>Your</b> City <b>at</b> 6 and 11 p.m., along with a national and international newscast called CityNews International (produced at CITY-TV's studios in Toronto, Ontario). On January 19, 2010, CityNews at Noon, Your City and CityNews International were cancelled as part of Citytv's corporate restructuring and concurrent layoffs.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not?’ {{he said in}} Spanish. ‘Great, great, are {{the powers}} of Hoodoo! Her very mind is changed! But, O chief priestess, why have you {{suffered}} yourself to be shut into this cage? why did you not <b>call</b> <b>your</b> slaves <b>at</b> once to your defence? Do you not see that all has been prepared to murder you? at a spark, this flimsy house will go in flames; and alas! who shall then be the chief priestess? and what shall be the profit of the miracle?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was {{something}} of the sort. I heard Wolf growl and felt {{sure that it was}} not at me. I threw myself down and crept up to him and found him shot through the heart with an Indian arrow. I was crawling back to the house when I heard Harold's shot. Then I waited {{to see if it was}} followed by the war-whoop, which the redskins would have raised at once, on finding that they were discovered, had they been about to attack in force. Seeing that all was quiet, I conjectured that it was probably an attempt on the part of a spy to discover if we were upon the alert. Then I heard <b>your</b> <b>call</b> and <b>at</b> once came on. I do not expect any attack to-night now, as these fellows must have been alone; but we will all keep watch till the morning. You have done very well, Harold, and have shown yourself a keen watchman. It is fortunate that you had the presence of mind neither to stir nor to call out when you first heard them; for, had you done so, you would probably have got an arrow between your ribs, as poor Wolf has done." ...|$|R

30|$|Over {{the course}} of the experiments, each {{participant}} was presented with three sets of questions multiple times each week. The first set of question was generated based on participant’s own data. For example, a participant would receive a phone call question in the following format: “who did you <b>call</b> <b>at</b> 11 : 25 am on Wednesday?”. The second set of question was generated based on participant’s pair’s (e.g., close friend) data. In this case, the role of a strong adversary is played by the pair of each participant. For example, the participant would receive a phone call question about his/her partner in the following format: “who did <b>your</b> partner <b>call</b> <b>at</b> 4 : 20 pm on Friday?”. The third set of question was generated based on a randomly selected participant’s data whose identity was not revealed to the participant who answered the questions. In this case, participants played the role of a naive adversary. For example, the participant would receive a phone call question about a stranger in the following format: “who did a stranger <b>call</b> <b>at</b> 2 : 51 pm on Monday?”. In all cases, participants were not given any feedback regarding his/her performance throughout the study to avoid biasing them. Moreover, while participants were attempting to answer the challenge questions generated based on their close friend’s data or a random user’s data (i.e., playing the role of an adversary), the exact same questions and the exact same possible answer options (if a question has multiple answer choices such as app question—Fig.  1 c) that were presented to the legitimate user are presented to the adversarial users. Each participant was compensated with a $ 25 Amazon gift card for two weeks of participation. The study was approved by the University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).|$|R

500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{gave the}} song {{three and a}} half stars and commented, [...] "It does seem that Britney's bump-and-grind singing style that we first heard 8 years ago on '...Baby One More Time' is still intact, and the 'It's Britney, bitch' {{announcement}} that opens the song implies a significant amount of fire remains. The opening alone bumps the song's rating up by half a star". Roger Friedman of Fox News dubbed the line as [...] "cocky and fun". Eric R. Danton of The Hartford Courant wrote, [...] "The comedy starts right away, when she plays the role of <b>your</b> drunk friend <b>calling</b> <b>at</b> 3 a.m., slurring, 'It's Britney, bitch'". Mike Schiller of PopMatters called the opening line [...] "real value...kind of hilarious" [...] and added that the [...] "inserted “more” syllables in the chorus only add to the feel that this is a genetically engineered sort of dancefloor banger". Popjustice named [...] "Gimme More" [...] the tenth best song of 2007. The StarPhoenix listed it as the second most infectious song of the year.|$|R
