500|$|When Headley and a Danish {{film crew}} {{went to the}} Gold Base, Headley was confronted by several members of Gold staff, {{including}} base spokesperson Catherine Fraser, who said Headley's account of his escape was untrue."Marc lived in another place, {{not even on the}} property, another place altogether," [...] Fraser said in one of the [...] [...] "And that day when I explained that to the sheriff -- the sheriff looked at me and said, 'Oh, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> could have left at any time?' I said, 'Yes, he could have left at any time and he did.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{pulled her}} up for a moment. [...] "I don't know what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He</b> doesn't make speeches and professions at all--he isn't ridiculous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prevent it--yes, sir, I {{believe you}} he did; {{though not in}} the sense that <b>YOU</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He</b> would have given his eyes--ay, and ten {{thousand}} pounds more--if I would have accepted the girl, but I would not." ...|$|E
6000|$|It helped Milly for {{the moment}} to the {{convenience}} of a puzzled pause. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he's</b> an acquaintance of whom you disapprove for her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “For {{what he can}} get?” {{said the}} hostess {{with a touch of}} indignation in her voice; “what do <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>He’s</b> a very rich man. What should he want to get here?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like you! Oh, I suppose <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he's</b> {{something}} about your size. Well, I don't wonder at that, for you're an uncommonly big fellow, Dick; but I fancy his appearance is very different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father!" [...] he said thoughtfully. [...] "Yes, I {{see what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean!</b> <b>He</b> will {{think that we}} have been a little precipitate, eh? He will require a little time in order to learn to love me, you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Berkeley!' exclaimed {{the young}} girl, moving so {{suddenly}} toward her grandfather {{that all the}} sweet peas in her lap fell suddenly to the ground. 'Berkeley! Why, Arthur Berkeley comes from Queen Mary County! Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> is the grandson of Mr. Castine?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean, Master Clutterbuck?" [...] asked Ursula Quekett, for {{she knew}} the old man liked to explain his wise saws, and as she wanted to marry his son, she indulged him {{whenever}} she could. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>He</b> isn't what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As good as <b>he's</b> good-looking do <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>He's</b> very good-looking. How detestably fortunate!--to {{be a great}} English magnate, to be {{clever and}} {{handsome}} into the bargain, and, by way of finishing off, to enjoy your high favour! That's a man I could envy." ...|$|R
60|$|He is {{a self-made}} man, {{if that is}} what <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> and <b>he</b> {{certainly}} hasn't any money.|$|R
6000|$|... "Financial? Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>he</b> may {{possibly}} {{have to spend}} some of his spare doubloons in making Broster Street fit to live in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Pemberton {{wondered}} {{again if}} he might pretend not to understand; but everything good {{gave way to the}} intensity of Morgan’s understanding. “Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> may take me to live with him for ever and ever?” cried the boy. “May take me away, away, anywhere he likes?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not in {{the sense}} <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He</b> is dead, and I have no fear of his ghost, but the memory of him will torture her soul; and if she {{believes}} that he is able to come to her, the belief will be almost as tragic as the fact." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] The doctor stayed Matt's apologies. [...] "I {{understand}} {{just what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He</b> disliked their father very much. He was principled against {{him as a}} merely rich man, with mischievous influence on the imaginations of all the poor people about him {{who wanted to be}} like him--" ...|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. I guess <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he's</b> queer--but you're wrong--you're wrong! He's {{the only}} man in Foxon Falls who knows what kind of a world we're going to live in from now on. Why? Because he's a scientist, because he's trained himself to think straight, because he understands people like you and people like me. He don't blame us for what we do--he knows why we do it.|$|R
6000|$|Wilkinson made {{an abrupt}} movement. [...] "You can't stop your husband's cheque. <b>You</b> don't <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> hasn't the dollars to meet it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nanda thought an instant. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> 'again'? <b>He</b> just {{lives there}} {{as much as}} he ever did, and Tishy can't prevent him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> was inconsiderate [...] To rout us out {{to think}} for him at midnight [...] And then take our advice no more than nothing, [...] Why, I agree with you. But let's forgive him. [...] We've had a share in one night of his life. [...] What'll you bet he ever calls again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cecilia was on {{the point}} of saying: 'That will do, please; I want to hear no more.' But her curiosity and queer subtle fear forced her instead to repeat: [...] "I don't understand. Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> insinuates that Mr. Hilary has {{anything}} to do with--with this girl, or what?" [...] And she thought: 'I'll stop that, at any rate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish you {{to marry}} him? What do you mean?" [...] he said, not without irritation, and {{avoiding}} her gaze. [...] "It is no affair of mine. I don't like the man, if that's what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He</b> is acting like--well, like the cur that he is, in {{putting on the}} screw as he is doing; but, of course, {{that is the way}} out of it, and the only way, and there you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>he</b> {{takes the}} whole of his brother's fortune, and makes no {{provision}} whatever for his brother's children?" [...] asked Miss Garth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>he</b> will waylay me? I say he dare not. Still, {{to please}} you, {{we will take}} the longer path through the forest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would be}} touched by my fidelity? Is that what <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> If <b>he</b> is so easily touched, then why should you be afraid of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{what the}} deuce do <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>He</b> came here after Ayala, because I {{wanted to have}} all that {{nonsense}} settled about Tom. Ayala is not here, nor likely to be here; and I don't know why he should stay here philandering away his time. I hate men in a country-house who are thorough idlers. You had better take an opportunity of letting him {{know that he has}} been here long enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Call a spade a spade, Captain. <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> got red-mad and raked them all, {{fore and}} aft. They {{deserved}} it too--a pack of incapables. But {{what would you}} expect of a committee of men? That building committee held twenty-seven meetings, {{and at the end}} of the twenty-seventh weren't no nearer having a church than when they begun--not so near, for a fact, for in one fit of hurrying things along they'd gone to work and tore the old church down, so there we were, without a church, and no place but the hall to worship in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Herbert {{with a faint}} smile, 'that {{depends on}} your {{definition}} of the word. He wasn't a flunkey, a fool, or a prig, if that's what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He</b> wasn't perhaps on Mrs Grundy's visiting list. He wasn't exactly gregarious. And yet {{in a sense that}} kind of temperament is so rare that Sappho, Nelson, and Shelley shared it. To the stodgy, suety world of course it's little else than sheer moonshine, midsummer madness. Naturally, in its own charming and stodgy way the world kept flickering cold water in his direction. Naturally it hissed.... I shall find the book. You shall have the book; oh yes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'What do <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> Martha?' <b>'e</b> says. 'E's {{not one of}} what I {{call your}} smart sort. It takes a bit of sarcasm to get through 'is 'ead.|$|R
6000|$|ELLIE [coming to her]. Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>he</b> {{is really}} brave, and really has adventures, and yet tells lies {{about things that}} he never did and that never happened? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>he</b> will wantonly {{precipitate}} a {{great war}} I hardly think so," [...] said Mr. Meredith. [...] "The day has gone by for {{that sort of}} thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so--not {{in the way}} <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He</b> {{is bound}} up in her powers, and would do {{anything}} to keep her. But she must be taken away at once and Clarke's oration stopped. I would have interfered, but I had no authority to act. Your wife is satisfied to remain, and the 'chief control,' her father, insists upon their remaining, and Clarke told me last night that your daughter was his affianced wife. You can see how helpless I am, even though your daughter in her normal mood begged me to save her from madness. I regard her condition as very critical. To expose her to a public trial of her powers may unsettle her reason." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 1 December 2015, Colonel Dasuki {{was arrested}} by the Department of State Security Services and {{transferred}} to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for further interrogation.Prior to Dasuki's arrest, Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance {{in the office of}} the National Security Adviser, {{was arrested by}} the Department of the State Security Services and following interrogations he claimed to have acted on Colonel Dasuki's order which led to Dasuki's arrest. After Dasuki was transferred to the EFCC, he initially decided not to comment on the issue or write any statement, claiming that he had been subjected to media trial.The EFCC operatives then issued Dasuki a copy of the statement made by Shaibu Salisu, a statement that seemed rather implicating. Dasuki was shocked by Salisu's confessional statement. According to The Nation, Colonel Dasuki said, [...] "You mean Salisu wrote all these! <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> said these! Give me a pen and paper." [...] Dasuki gave a long list of people involved in the deal.He mentioned Chief Raymond Dopesi, the chair emeritus of DAAR Communications Plc, alongside Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Know {{where he}} is? What do <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> Isn't <b>he</b> in New York?" [...] The broker pretended to arrange some papers {{on his desk}} as he spoke and {{did not look at}} Dick.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is it, my dear?' said Mr. Underwood. 'You {{can explain}} it, I see. Tell Lady Price what <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> Geraldine,' <b>he</b> added gravely, to compose the child, who was sobbing with {{excitement}} and indignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>he</b> is not dead?" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>you</b> {{have not}} seen him yourself--within the last few months?" [...] she demanded fiercely. [...] "He left {{me to come to}} you {{on the first day of}} the New Year." ...|$|R
