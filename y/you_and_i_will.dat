2500|$|At the time, George II had to {{accompanied}} [...] "Trux" [...] to Hanover. Frederick then summoned him to Silesia. Here, soon afterwards, he {{drew the}} king's anger, for which {{there seemed to be}} more reason, when, in confidence, [...] "Trux" [...] sent an officer to Olmütz, to take charge of deserters. The king then wrote to him. [...] "I believe that you are only fifteen [...] in number, in view of the extraordinary conduct which you have taken from the officers at Olmütz to demand deserters, be wary, or after so many such cases of discontent, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> quarrel." [...] A few months later, however, [...] "Trux" [...] convinced the king of his own good intentions, at the Battle of Lösch, and was with the Prussian army sent to Brünn, where, on 14 [...] March [...] 1742, [...] "Trux" [...] received the order to take the Veveří Castle. He was attacked by an Austrian force {{three times the size of}} his; he withdrew into a castle, but the Austrians set it on fire, forcing him to withdraw.|$|E
2500|$|... "My Baby" [...] is a mid-tempo {{love song}} {{depicting}} a sonic valentine to Jackson's fiancé. The song features gentle acoustic guitars and shuffling percussion, and guest vocals from Kanye West, over [...] "breezy" [...] and [...] "laidback" [...] production. Jackson delivers the chorus in a reassuring manner; {{described as a}} [...] "sotto voce purr". [...] "The Islands" [...] is a spoken-word segment in which Jackson confesses her admiration for the island of Anguilla, the beach, and tropical humidity. The interlude segues into [...] "Spending time With You", a contemporary [...] "slow jam." [...] Lyrically, the song captures Jackson {{in a moment of}} love. Jackson speaks about evenings relaxing in prior said location in brief interlude, [...] "Magic Hour", which transitions to [...] "Island Life." [...] In [...] "Island Life", described as [...] "pure seduction", Jackson refers to herself and a companion in an exotic paradise in a lilting vocal: [...] "Island in the sun, just <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> go/Ride into the wave [...]" [...] Its instrumentation contains throbbing bass and light concoctions of Caribbean-influenced music and ragga pop.|$|E
2500|$|The matter {{became the}} object of student protest in 1922, when 6 banned black freshmen, led by a recent alumnus who was {{studying}} at the Business School, protested their exclusion. Lowell wrote this explanation to Roscoe Conkling Bruce, himself an African American Harvard alumnus {{and the father of}} an incoming freshman: [...] "We have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together." [...] Bruce’s lengthy reply underscored the irony of Lowell's position: [...] "The policy of compulsory residence in the Freshman Halls is costly indeed if it is the thing that constrains Harvard to enter open-eyed and brusque upon a policy of racial discrimination." [...] Lowell stood his ground: [...] "It is not a departure from the past to refuse to compel white and colored men to room in the same building. We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man; but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial." [...] He accused Bruce of insisting on a change of policy and employed an argument about minority presence provoking prejudice that he also used about the same time in the Jewish quota dispute. [...] "For the colored man to claim that he is entitled to have the white man compelled to live with him is a very unfortunate innovation which, far from doing him good, would increase a prejudice which, as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> thoroughly agree, is most unfortunate and probably growing." ...|$|E
