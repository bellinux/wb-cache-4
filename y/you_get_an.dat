500|$|An initial {{pilot of}} the show was ordered in 2003 by ITV, from {{production}} company FremantleMedia, and was commissioned by Claudia Rosencrantz, who was the controller of entertainment at ITV at the time. It was presented by Brian Conley, but was not broadcast; a series was not produced. Rosencrantz spoke of the pilot in 2011, [...] "I didn't believe {{people would like to}} see someone win a vast sum of money, with no skills at all involved. Second, gambling is not a spectator sport, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> adrenaline rush from participating in it." [...] Richard Holloway, who worked with FremantleMedia at the time of producing the pilot, said, [...] "It was a novel idea, you could win a million pounds eventually, I was surprised it didn't go to series." [...] Rosencrantz left ITV in 2006, {{and there has been a}} significant turnover in staff since the pilot was originally put together.|$|E

Onella of the physics department at Oxford University, Professor Michael Spagat of the economics department of Royal Holloway, University of London, and Professor Gesine Reinert of the statistics department at Oxford University, claimed {{the methodology of}} the study was fundamentally flawed by what they term [...] "main street bias". They claimed the sampling methods used [...] "will result in an over-estimation of the death toll in Iraq" [...] because [...] "by sampling only cross streets which are more accessible, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> over-estimation of deaths." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{since the}} band {{had not yet}} signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant paid for the {{sessions}} entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom: [...] "I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because I knew exactly what I {{wanted to do with}} these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic ... It wasn't your typical story where <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> advance to make an album – we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ... Atlantic's reaction was very positive – I mean they signed us, didn't they?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer’s Oliver Clare noted {{a few minor}} game design flaws, {{which he}} {{attributed}} to [...] "Impact Games' inexperience with interface design". According to him, [...] "the narrow theme" [...] limits the replay value and appeal of the game. He stressed that the game shows no bias, and holds an [...] "amazingly positive educational potential". Clare claimed he suffered viewing all the tragedies in the game, and {{that the first time}} he won the game, tears came to his eyes : [...] "For a few poignant moments <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> inkling of what peaceful co-existence in the Middle East might actually feel like, what it might mean". Judy Siegel-Itzkovich from The Jerusalem Post had a similar opinion, stating that the game is [...] "immersive" [...] and that [...] "learning the background of this endless dispute could be very educational". Her colleague Calev Ben-David was impressed by the graphics and texts. He also appreciated the winning condition: according to him, setting a time limit would have been unrealistic.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent {{evolutionary}} biologists such as Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne {{have proposed}} various [...] "controversies" [...] {{that are worth}} teaching, instead of intelligent design. Dawkins compares teaching intelligent design in schools to teaching flat earthism: perfectly fine in a history class but not in science. [...] "If you give {{the idea that there}} are two schools of thought within science, one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat, you are misleading children." [...] Tufts University Professor of Philosophy Daniel C. Dennett, author of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, describes how they generate a sense of controversy: [...] "The proponents of intelligent design use an ingenious ploy that works something like this: First you misuse or misdescribe some scientist's work. Then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a 'controversy' to teach." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jobs and Apple {{became more}} successful, and his {{relationship}} with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never wanted to ask that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it." ...|$|E
