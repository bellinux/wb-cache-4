He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly glad to have broken <b>your</b> <b>record.</b> Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great honor to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E

500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Reprise in 1997, L7 was {{interested}} in maintaining an independent, do it yourself approach. Sparks and Gardner explained that the band wanted to release an album in 1999, and if they opted for another major label opportunity, they would certainly {{have to wait until}} 2000 for a release slot. As a result, the band signed a deal with Bong Load Records and formed Wax Tadpole Records, an independent record label named after the first song of their self-titled debut album. Although the band had left the indie music scene before due to distribution problems, Sparks said that she would be watching the Bong Load deal to ensure the distribution of Slap-Happy, noting that [...] "there's nothing more painful to tour for a record and the fans not being able to find <b>your</b> <b>record</b> in stores." ...|$|E

[...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think <b>your</b> <b>record</b> is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E

2500|$|The group {{spent the}} first two weeks of the album's {{recording}} at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in November 2012, before moving back to their own Blueprint Studios in Salford to complete the album. Speaking about the decision to start the recording process at Real World, Garvey said, [...] "When you're there, you get six months work done in two weeks.

2500|$|However, {{recording}} did {{not begin}} until April 2010. Friend and Pretty. Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning. He encouraged them to love the work they do, and [...] "... Just {{get out of bed}} in the morning, don’t loathe the things that you actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is <b>your</b> <b>record,</b> I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is <b>your</b> <b>record,</b> it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the trial}} {{progresses}} {{it becomes clear}} that Hans is still in love with Ondine. [...] Ondine, in a vain attempt to get out of her pact with the Old One (Hans must die because he deceived Ondine with Bertha) continues to insist that she deceived Hans first with Bertram. [...] Bertram is summoned and supports Ondine's story. [...] But no-one believes them, least of all the second fisherman. [...] Ondine is accused of sorcery. [...] The Old One leaps to her defense saying, [...] "This woman could call upon the earth and the heavens to do her bidding. [...] But she gave up her power to be human. [...] Write this into <b>your</b> <b>record,</b> Judge—this Ondine was the most human being that ever lived. [...] She was human by choice." [...] In the end the judges decide that Ondine transgressed the boundaries of nature, but in so doing she brought only kindness and love. [...] So they are compassionate in merely sentencing her to death while sparing her a public execution.|$|E

2500|$|On September 26, 2016, {{the band}} {{released}} the second single from the album, [...] "Moth into Flame", {{along with a}} music video. The album's third single, [...] "Atlas, Rise!", was released on October 31, 2016, with a music video composed of footage from the album's recording process. Ulrich also told The Straits Times that same day that the band would be filming music videos for all twelve tracks on the album, using YouTube as their platform. [...] "Now that YouTube is the world's biggest television station, we figured we may as well knock a video out for every song... the practicality of shooting twelve music videos is kind of crazy, especially when you're trying to promote <b>your</b> <b>record,</b> and you're all over the place, {{and trying to make}} sure it doesn't leak. It's crazy but, at the same time, fun". On November 12, 2016, a local Walmart started selling the album in advance of the official release date of November 18.
