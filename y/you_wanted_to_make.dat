500|$|In early 1993, Roxette {{became the}} first non-native-English {{speaking}} artists to be featured on MTV's Unplugged series, though the songs from the performance were never released on an official Unplugged album. In the same year, Roxette recorded and released [...] "Almost Unreal", a song originally slated for the film Hocus Pocus starring Bette Midler. However, the song {{was moved to the}} soundtrack of the film based on the Nintendo video game Super Mario Bros. Supported by an expensive video and ultimately receiving respectable airplay, [...] "Almost Unreal" [...] managed to briefly reach {{the lower end of the}} Billboard Hot 100 but charted highest in the UK reaching the top 10, the group's first time there since [...] "Joyride" [...] two years before. Roxette themselves were dismissive about the song, with Fredriksson saying it was [...] "not one of our most inspired moments." [...] On the other hand, Gessle stated: [...] "I still like the song in a way... but if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a parody of Roxette, it would probably sound something like this." [...] To coincide with the UK television premiere of the film Pretty Woman, [...] "It Must Have Been Love" [...] was re-issued in September 1993 and entered the UK and Irish singles charts for the second time.|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jacques Pierre Louis Rivette {{was born}} in Rouen, Seine-Maritime, France to André Rivette and Andrée Amiard, into a family [...] "where {{everyone}} is a pharmacist". According to childhood friend André Ruellan, Rivette's father was a skilled painter who loved opera. His younger sister said that their home in Rouen was next to a movie theater, where she remembered watching Pathé Baby's Felix le Chat cartoons with Rivette and their grandparents. Rivette, educated at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille, said that he briefly studied literature at university [...] "just to keep myself occupied". Inspired by Jean Cocteau's book about the filming of La Belle et la Bête, Rivette decided to pursue filmmaking and began frequenting ciné-clubs. In 1948, he shot his first short film, Aux Quatre Coins, in Rouen's Côte Sainte-Catherine section. The following year, he moved to Paris with friend, Francis Bouchet, because [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> films {{it was the only}} way". On the day of his arrival, he met future collaborator Jean Gruault, who invited him to see Les dames du Bois de Boulogne at the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin. Éric Rohmer, whose film criticism Rivette admired, gave a talk at the screening.|$|E
5000|$|Shen Wei {{has stated}} that his number one goal when making art is [...] "inspire other human beings". He has proclaimed, [...] "When you're an artist and you're {{creating}} new works {{you have to have}} passion because <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it the best that <b>you</b> can. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it as clear as you can and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do things you've never done before. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> things that have never existed before, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> new things; <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> repeat yourself. At the same time <b>you</b> <b>want</b> people <b>to</b> feel these things are new, make them communicate, become part of the culture and to inspire other human beings - this is my number one goal when I make new work.

In fact, whatever other men did this little man was anxious to do also, and so it happened that when the hunting season came around, and all the men began to get their guns ready to hunt for snipe and duck, Mr. Jimson also had a little gun made, and determined to use it as well as any of them.|$|E
