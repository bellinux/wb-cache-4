60|$|The boy being now subdued, {{questions}} {{were put to}} him from all sides. But his powers of observation and description went no further. As he was anxious to propitiate his captors, he answered {{as often as possible}} in the affirmative. Mr. Jansenius asked him whether the young woman he had seen was a lady, and he <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> Was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> a laborer? Yes--after a moment's hesitation. How was she dressed? He hadn't taken notice. Had she red flowers in her hat? Yes. Had she a green dress? Yes. Were the flowers in her hat yellow? (Agatha's question.) Yes. Was her dress pink? Yes. Sure it wasn't black? No answer.|$|R

You are not helping, you don't know him," [...] referring to her uncle. Another witness published a video on YouTube where several security personnel are seen and Dina is heard screaming in the background from the airport in Manila.Dina told the airport workers {{that she was in}} danger the entire time. Several times she cried hysterically to them that she needed help. They ignored her. I saw myself they looked at her like she didn't exist. They were helpful when I asked questions about my own flights and when I asked about Dina, they gave me more information that they gave her. They told me that they didn't know more other than an important person called and told them to hold her documents and don't allow her to leave. They told me they would give her more information as they found out but they never did. Her uncles arrived while she was trying to eat a sandwich and I was trying to connect to the internet to send the video she had just recorded. I was looking in another direction and Dina noticed when they came in and I knew something was wrong. Her looked terrified and she whispered to me...they are here, send the video, send the video. I asked, those are your uncles and she <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>men</b> approached us, {{with a woman}}, they were smiling and looked friendly. They sat down with us and I said hi and Dina started to cry. She said...can I speak to you in private and I <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> and I took my phone and we both had the blue Philippine airline blankets wrapped around us and we went to the washroom. The woman followed us and I whispered and told Dina she's behind us, I am sending the video and I will take pictures, let's go back. So we went back and I sat not far away and took the photos that's online of <b>the</b> two <b>men</b> and Dina. Those are her uncles and across there's a woman, that the woman they came with. Dina told me after she was from the Kuwait Embassy.Calls to the police department at Manila International airport were not answered on Tuesday night. It is understood that the airport confirmed Lasloom’s detention with an Amnesty International representative. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte began a three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia on April 10, the same day Lasloom attempted to fly to Australia.|$|R
