25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath <b>you.</b> <b>Why</b> should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

It refers to God as [...] "Monarch" [...] instead of [...] "King" [...] and as [...] "Parent" [...] instead of [...] "Father", and replaces the familiar [...] "Four Sons" [...] with [...] "four different sorts of children".

He once offered {{to sell the}} control of NEMS to Stigwood, without telling any of his artists about the offer. McCartney was taking a more active interest in NEMS' finances, as it became known that some artists with more ruthless managers claimed to be benefiting from more commercially advantageous terms, such as the Rolling Stones under the management of Allen Klein. After Epstein's death, Clive Epstein assumed control of NEMS as the company's second largest shareholder.

500|$|Known as {{an outspoken}} player, Hull earned a {{reputation}} {{on and off the}} ice for speaking bluntly and without regard for whom it might offend.

Hull was a consistent critic of the NHL's defensive, [...] "clutch and grab" [...] era of the late 1990s, raising the ire of commissioner Gary Bettman in 1998 when he said [...] "I wouldn't pay to watch.

500|$|Herodotus recounts that Megabates made {{inspections}} {{of the ships}} (probably whilst beached for the night), and came across one ship from Myndus which had not posted any sentries. Megabates ordered his guard to find {{the captain of the}} ship, Scylax, and then had the captain thrust into one of the ship's oar holes with his head outside and his body inside the ship. News reached Aristagoras of the treatment of his friend and he went to Megabates and asked him to reconsider his decision. When Megabates refused to grant Aristagoras's wishes, Aristagoras simply cut the captain loose himself. Predictably, Megabates was furious with Aristagoras, who in turn retorted [...] "But you, what have you to do with these matters? Did not Artaphrenes send you to obey me and to sail wherever I bid <b>you?</b> <b>Why</b> are you so meddlesome?". According to Herodotus, Megabates was so enraged by this that he sent messengers to the Naxians to warn them of the approach of the Persian force.|$|E

[...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, the sound of a briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever happens next, they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell <b>you</b> <b>why</b> it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E

500|$|Frink is {{a popular}} {{character}} on The Simpsons and he has received acclaim from critics. Mark Hughes Cobb of The Tuscaloosa News named him his favorite secondary character from the show. Fort Worth Star-Telegrams Robert Philpot called the professor {{one of the five}} best supporting characters on The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Springfield's mad scientist is a triumph of style over substance, with Hank Azaria giving him a ripoff Jerry Lewis voice that reminds <b>you</b> <b>why</b> we once thought Lewis was funny." [...] On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral Simpsons characters, IGN's Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the Simpsons universe [...] "as the town's brilliant mad scientist." [...] They highlighted a scene from the episode [...] "The PTA Disbands", in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children's toys to himself because the children [...] "wouldn't enjoy it on as many levels" [...] as he did. Nick Griffiths of Radio Times named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has [...] "always loved Professor Frink", particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word [...] "the", and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly. The Sydney Morning Heralds David Hollingworth profiled Frink in his list of [...] "TV's great tech figures", writing that apart from being smart, the professor {{is best known for his}} [...] "rather idiosyncratic speech patterns— hmmguyvin-whey-hey." [...] Joe Rhodes of TV Guide listed the following as the professor's most memorable line: [...] "Sorry I'm late.

500|$|Musically, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is an electropop-influenced disco track. Minogue's breathy and whisper-y vocal {{delivery}} and the electronic {{production of the}} song make it similar to [...] "I Believe in You", a single from Minogue's greatest hits album Ultimate Kylie (2004). Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue invites her lover to dance with her, beginning with a line in which she softly sings [...] "Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance? I'm standing here with <b>you,</b> <b>why</b> won't you move?". During the anthemic chorus of the song, which is backed by a warbling synthesizer riff, Minogue asserts that her previous relationships do not [...] "compare" [...] to her present one, singing [...] "All the lovers that have gone before, they don't compare to you/ Don't be frightened, {{just give me a}} little bit more/ They don't compare, all the lovers." [...] UK-based music website Popjustice opined that the song is [...] "not really about relaxing while you dance, it's about relaxing into a relationship." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog felt the [...] "elegiac" [...] and sad-toned chorus [...] "makes the verses transform from a straightforward plea for dancefloor action into what sounds like a demand that everyone join Kylie for one last dance before things become spoiled forever." [...] The song features a bridge section in which Minogue again asks her lover to dance with her, after which an electronic breakdown takes place. According to the sheet music of the song published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is composed in the key of C major and follows a midtempo of 142 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the key of G3 to A4.|$|E
