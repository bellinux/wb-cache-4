[...] Despite this advocacy Bennett's application was unsuccessful.|$|E

Minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting {{large sums of money}} from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money. The owner of the paper, Maurive V. Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations. When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him answer the questions, Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As he was saying that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, [...] "This committee doesn't intend to permit <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this as a forum to air your Republican views." ...|$|E

2500|$|The reading {{section is}} a 35-minute, 40-question test that {{consists}} of [...] four sections, three of which contain one long prose passage and one which contains two shorter prose passages. The passages {{are representative of the}} levels and kinds of text commonly encountered in first-year college curricula. This reading test assesses skills in three general categories: key ideas and details, craft and structure, and integration of knowledge and ideas. Test questions will usually ask students to derive meaning from texts referring to what is explicitly stated or by reasoning to determine implicit meanings. Specifically, questions will ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> referring and reasoning skills to determine main ideas; locate and interpret significant details; understand sequences of events; make comparisons; comprehend cause-effect relationships; determine the meaning of context-dependent words, phrases, and statements; draw generalizations; and analyze the author’s or narrator’s voice and method.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this not very common scene was a reference to the defeat in 324 by the Emperor Constantine I of his co-emperor Licinius, who was killed in 325 after a period under close guard. [...] Another suggestion is that the colour change from green to red was understood as evoking the ripening of red grapes, so that there was a particular suitability in depicting a scene with the god of wine. [...] The cup may have been intended for use at Bacchic cult celebrations, still very much a feature of Roman religious life around 300. [...] A letter supposedly from the Emperor Hadrian (d. 138) to his brother-in-law Servianus, quoted in a biography in the Historia Augusta, records the gift of two dichroic cups, which the 4th century author had seen: [...] "I have sent you particoloured cups that change colour, presented to me by the priest of a temple.
