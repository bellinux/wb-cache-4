Stacks of novels and a cardboard box stuffed with rubber-stamp prints like afterthoughts, crowd a plinth. On the walls, woodcuttings jostle oils. Shelves carry poetry, mignon hand-painted hardbacks and seven-inch vinyl, little painted hessian squares and yet more rubber-stampings. It feels more like a grocer's shop than a gallery.

Switching scenes with events of eight years earlier, Nottage shows how events take individuals on divergent pathways, to a backdrop of job cuts, poverty, and downsizing, with none of the characters except the barman realising what is at stake. Variety quotes him as warning them that [...] "You could wake up tomorrow and all <b>your</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>are</b> in Mexico", <b>to</b> which the characters respond with lethargy and disbelief.

40|$|Denial {{of service}} attacks {{prevents}} legitimate users from using a service. One {{particular type of}} this attack is known as SYN flood, where external hosts attempt to overwhelm the server machine by sending {{a constant stream of}} TCP connection request. There are several approaches for dealing with this attack that firewall is one of them. In this paper we attempt to prevent this type of attacks with iptables firewalls. Any Firewall prevents unauthorized use and access <b>to</b> <b>your</b> device, its <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> carefully analyze data entering and exiting the device based onuser configurations and ignore information that comes from suspicious locations. The firewalls available in the market are general purpose and not suitable to the Embedded boards. Hence I developed and implemented a firewall for an ARM 9 processor which uses Linux as the operating system. The Firewall design used Net filters concept in Linux for an ARM 9 processor. After implementing the firewall, experimentation <b>was</b> done <b>to</b> study {{the extent to which the}} firewall can prevent the securing attacks especially SYN flood attack. Packet filtering concept <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> examine the header of a packet to determine the source and the destination. This information <b>is</b> compared <b>to</b> a set of predefined or user-created rules that determine whether the packet <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forwarded or dropped. Hence it is established in this paper by implementing the firewall based on Iptables rules one can avoid SYN flood attacks from ARM Board...|$|R
