40|$|Let me {{thank all}} of <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here,</b> Tony Starace, for having {{conceived}} this meeting, and Bob Wood and Matesh Varma, for over 20 years of support without which {{there would have been}} no track physics. There are many others to thank: the students, postdoctorates, and senior visitors who actually did all the work, and the many investigators around the world who made measurements that proved to be essential to developing and testing the notions of particle tracks. This enterprise began when I undertook to rewrite an introductory physics text by Henry Semat to adapt it to a calculus-based course. That became Physics, by Henry Semat and Robert Katz, published in 1958. In that writ-ing I became persuaded of the beauty of the magnetic monopole as a pedagogic device in the teaching of elec...|$|E

After losing to Pennington via unanimous decision, Tate announced her retirement from mixed martial arts. [...] "It's not my time right now, I've {{been doing this for}} over a decade.

She received a loud ovation from the crowd at Madison Square Garden amidst her departure.|$|R

Jon iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I give many {{thanks to my}} advisor, Dr. Gabor Karsai <b>for</b> <b>being</b> the Best All-Around Advisor™. Gabor, without your {{excellent}} teaching skills and motivational abilities, I {{would not be in}} the position I am today.

40|$|THE PRESIDENT: Ladies and gentlemen, on Sunday, Mr. Shaw will {{celebrate}} his 95 th birthday. (Applause.) I {{would like to}} recognize the other survivors who are here today and their families: Mr. Charlie Pollard is here. (Applause.) Mr. Carter Howard. (Applause.) Mr. Fred Simmons. (Applause.) Mr. Simmons just took his first airplane ride, and he reckons he's about 110 years old, so I think it's {{time for him to}} take a chance or two. (Laughter.) I'm glad he did. And Mr. Frederick Moss, thank you, sir. (Applause.) I would also like to ask three family representatives who are here [...] Sam Doner is represented by his daughter, Gwendolyn Cox. Thank you, Gwendolyn. (Applause.) Ernest Hendon, who is watching in Tuskegee, is represented by his brother, North Hendon. Thank <b>you,</b> sir, <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here.</b> (Applause.) And George Key is represented by his grandson, Christopher Monroe. Thank you, Chris. (Applause.) I also acknowledge the families, community leaders, teachers and students watching today by satellite from Tuskegee. The White House is the people's house; we are glad to have all of you here today. I thank Dr. David Satcher for his role in this. I thank Congresswoman Waters and Congressman Hilliard, Congressman Stokes, the entire Congressional Black Caucus. Dr. Satcher, members of the Cabinet who are here, Secretary Herman, Secretary Slater, members of the Cabinet who are here, Secretary Herman, Secretary Slater. A great friend of freedom, Fred Gray, thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> fighting this long battle all these long years. The eight men who are survivors of the syphilis study at Tuskegee are a living link to a time not so very long ago that many Americans would prefer not to remember, but we dare not forget. It was a time when our nation {{failed to live up to}} its ideals, when our nation broke the trust with our people that is the very foundation of our democracy. It is not only in remembering that shameful past that we can make amends and repair our nation, but it is in remembering that past that we can build a better present and a better future. And without remembering it, we cannot make amends and we cannot go forward...|$|R
