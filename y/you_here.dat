25|$|The album also {{provided}} another first in both Motown and R music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album {{in a song}} cycle, segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R albums that traditionally included filler tracks to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. Let's Get It On repeated the suite-form arrangement of What's Going On, as would Gaye's later albums such as I Want <b>You,</b> <b>Here,</b> My Dear and In Our Lifetime.|$|E

While Mir Mustafa Khan is alive, your government will have to protect the Khan his rights, by treating him personally and with due care; but once he will die his heirs will lose its independence and autonomy, turning in speechless and unfortunate slaves, the fault of the mad and visionary would degenerate Mir Mustafa Khan, the same who pursue only their personal goals in order to meet their lust for power, being a heartless and hardened egoist, as they're not thinking about the sad and desolate future of their offspring, who will betray him to anathema, because they will invite <b>you</b> <b>here</b> and handing the fate of their homeland to unfaithful strangers — rapists turning his people into meaningless plebeians. The groans and screams of the dead people involved in this network of selfish schemer — Mir Mustafa Khan will form an eternal curse upon it, as long as the Talysh Mountains stand firm, the bitter mourning the unfortunate fate of the Talysh people.|$|E

The camera follows Squires' gun to his desk drawer and we're kept aware of its presence thanks to Nina and Squires' [...] "If I’d shot <b>you,</b> <b>here</b> in the dark/With an empty gun?

Nina is shown drinking from the poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls Squires [...] "devious" [...] (a hint at her true feelings about him) and once again when she emphasises the word [...] "plan". While Squires is telling the story of the Sphinx and she seems to be gazing at the statue of it, she's actually looking at the photograph of her brother on display directly below.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] is a doo-wop style pop shuffle {{song and}} opened the second side of Like a Prayer. It begins {{with the sound of}} synths and {{keyboard}} and Madonna repeatedly singing the words [...] "cherish, cherish". This is followed by the sound from drum machine, as percussion and guitars accompany her voice. During the bridge, Madonna sings the line [...] "Cupid please take your aim at me", as the keyboard sound becomes pronounced. The drum changes its rhythm and Madonna moves into the chorus, [...] "Cherish the joy, of always having <b>you</b> <b>here</b> by my side", accompanied by background vocals and a bass guitar. The second verse continues in the same way, with Madonna singing the line [...] "Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet, So don't underestimate my point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] is a {{moderate}} R, soul and quiet storm ballad pacing in medium time. It {{was written in}} the key of F major, and moves at {{a moderate}} tempo set at 100 beats per minute. Vocal elements of the song range from E3 to D5. [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] is backed by piano and thumping drum instrumentation. Many music critics noted it to be musically similar to the original Destiny's child version. Lyrically, the song is about being romantically obsessed, as indicated in the chorus: [...] "I am in love with you / You set me free / I can't do this thing called life without <b>you</b> <b>here</b> with me". According to Lisa Verrico of The Times, [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] bears resemblance to Janet Jacksons work if viewed from a [...] "flirty" [...] perspective.|$|E

500|$|Two years later, Catherine faced a new {{crisis with}} the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were [...] "oh, my mother...". The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his {{coronation}} at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: [...] "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end... My only consolation is to see <b>you</b> <b>here</b> soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you." ...|$|E
500|$|Cleave {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in West Africa, which he credits for having partially inspired The Other Hand. Further inspiration came from Cleaves's temporary employment while studying experimental {{psychology at the}} University of Oxford. During the summer, Cleave painted underpasses, gardened and picked up litter, and hoped to use this experience to write a book. His final job was at Campsfield House in Oxfordshire, an immigration detention centre. Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia, Eritrea and the Balkans. He explained: [...] "I got talking {{with some of them}} and said why are <b>you</b> <b>here?</b> Why are you in prison? It's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places. It's a text-book definition of a concentration camp. The conditions are appalling. I was shocked enough for that {{to be the end of}} my light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer." [...] Cleave believes he would not have written the novel were he not a parent, as he does not wish for his children [...] "to grow up into a world that is callous and stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|Credit for {{the main}} sitar part on [...] "Love You To" [...] has {{traditionally}} {{been the subject of}} debate among commentators. While MacDonald says that, rather than Harrison, it was the sitarist from the AMC who played this part, Rodriguez writes that [...] "others point to [...] single-minded diligence in mastering the instrument, as well as his study through private lessons, proximity to accomplished musicians, and close listening to pertinent records." [...] In his official history of the Beatles' recording career, The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, Lewisohn states: [...] "George played the sitar but an outside musician, Anil Bhagwat, was recruited to play the tabla." [...] Musicologist Walter Everett also identifies Harrison as the main sitar player on the recording, as does Peter Lavezzoli, author of The Dawn of Indian Music in the West. Leng comments that, as on [...] "Norwegian Wood", Harrison [...] "is still playing the sitar like a guitar player , using blues and rock 'n' roll bends rather than the intensely intricate Indian equivalents". Speaking to author Steve Turner, Bhagwat has dismissed the idea that the sitarist was not Harrison, saying: [...] "I can tell <b>you</b> <b>here</b> and now – 100 percent it was George on sitar throughout." ...|$|E

500|$|Reese and Wernick were on set every day, which Reynolds {{personally}} {{paid for}} after Fox was unwilling to. The writers had scripted the action very specifically, [...] "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators {{were free to}} change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the stunt coordinators for the film; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage. The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors, with Skrein working [...] "nonstop" [...] to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds [...] "has a photographic memory; he'd do something {{three or four times}} and remember it very well." [...] A lot of the jokes in the film were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said that the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one written in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. Reese said, for example, Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic, but on set Reynolds improvised the line [...] "You know it’s funny how I only see the two of <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> It’s like the studio couldn’t afford any more X-Men." [...] This was based in truth, and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos’ favorite line.|$|E
500|$|In {{the palace}} at Ithaca, Penelope mourns the long absence of Ulysses: [...] "The awaited {{one does not}} return, and the years pass by." [...] Her grief is echoed by her nurse, Ericlea. As Penelope leaves, her {{attendant}} Melanto enters with Eurimaco, a servant to Penelope's importunate suitors. The two sing passionately of their {{love for each other}} ("You are my sweet life"). The scene changes to the Ithacan coast, where the sleeping Ulisse is brought ashore by the Phaecians (Faeci), whose action is in defiance of the wishes of gods Giove and Nettuno. The Phaecians are punished by the gods who turn them and their ship to stone. Ulysses awakes, cursing the Phaecians for abandoning him: [...] "To your sails, falsest Phaeacians, may Boreas be ever hostile!" [...] From the goddess Minerva, who appears disguised as a shepherd boy, Ulisse learns that he is in Ithaca, and is told of [...] "the unchanging constancy of the chaste Penelope", {{in the face of the}} persistent importunings of her evil suitors. Minerva promises to lead Ulisse back to the throne if he follows her advice; she tells him to disguise himself so that he can penetrate the court secretly. Ulisse goes to seek out his loyal servant Eumete, while Minerva departs to search for Telemaco, Ulisse's son who will help his father reclaim the kingdom. Back at the palace, Melanto tries vainly to persuade Penelope to choose one of the suitors: [...] "Why do you disdain the love of living suitors, expecting comfort from the ashes of the dead?" [...] In a wooded grove Eumete, banished from court by the suitors, revels in the pastoral life, despite the mockery of Iro, the suitors' parasitic follower, who sneers: [...] "I live among kings, <b>you</b> <b>here</b> among the herds." [...] After Iro is chased away, Ulisse enters disguised as a beggar, and assures Eumete that his master the king is alive, and will return. Eumete is overjoyed: [...] "My long sorrow will fall, vanquished by you." ...|$|E
