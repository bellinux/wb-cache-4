5|$|Does it {{surprise}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> busy man {{found time}} to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
25|$|I believe I wrote <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{picture was}} removed which {{depicted}} the Queen's departure from Paris and that, in its place, I did {{an entirely new}} one which shows the flowing of the Kingdom of France, with {{the revival of the}} sciences and the arts through the liberality and the splendour of Her Majesty, who sits upon a shining throne and holds a scale in her hands, keeping the world in equilibrium by her prudence and equity.|$|E
2500|$|Guillaume-Schack {{expressed}} {{this view}} {{when she opened}} a public talk in 1882 by saying, [...] "perhaps it will have surprised <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> matter so difficult to handle as the morality question should be discussed in public, and perhaps yet more that I, a woman, want to speak about it." ...|$|E

6000|$|EILEEN (convinced--with a happy laugh). And is <b>that</b> why <b>you</b> acted so strange--and cold? Aren't they {{silly to}} tell <b>you</b> <b>that!</b> <b>As</b> if being happy could hurt me! Why, it's just <b>that,</b> just <b>you</b> I've needed! ...|$|R

"It is us, the {{professional}} artists of flamenco, {{who have to}} make cante flamenco, and nobody else, Flamenco, like any other art, is an art of professionals, {{although there are many}} people who peer at us, with a look as if to say: What interesting little creatures! or maybe: Oh! What music the people are playing! and so on. And people often think that maybe you have to have fingers swollen from picking potatoes to be able to play the guitar with feeling. Look, picking potatoes is every bit as worthy as playing a guitar. But I can tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> man -with fine, sensitive fingers is not going to be able to make a go of picking potatoes: and I can also tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> man with fingers swollen from picking potatoes is not going to be able to play a guitar because he hasn't got the manual dexterity and he hasn't got the dedication. This is a profession like any other which you have to dedicate yourself to completely. It is an art of professionals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whatever {{the reasons}} for Hitler's decision, the Germans {{confidently}} believed the Allied troops were doomed. American journalist William Shirer reported on 25 May, [...] "German military circles here tonight put it flatly. They said {{the fate of the}} great Allied army bottled up in Flanders is sealed." [...] BEF commander Lord Gort agreed, writing to Anthony Eden, [...] "I must not conceal from <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> great part of the BEF and its equipment will inevitably be lost in the best of circumstances".|$|E
2500|$|Osborne {{was a great}} fan of Max Miller and saw {{parallels}} between them. 'I love him, (Max Miller) because he embodied a kind of theatre I admire most. 'Mary from the Dairy' was an overture to the danger that (Max) might go too far. Whenever anyone tells me that a scene or a line in a play of mine goes too far in some way then I know my instinct has been functioning as it should. When such people tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> particular passage makes the audience uneasy or restless, then they seem (to me) as cautious and absurd as landladies and girls-who-won't.' ...|$|E

[...] This is to advise <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> decision has been made to locate the project in Clark Township. It is desired to make it entirely clear, however, that in reaching this decision this office in no manner agrees that the numerous protests received from various persons and organizations in Union Township were based upon valid premises. [...] We feel certain that if you and the other protesters had been acquainted with all of the facts in the situation, you would not have filed your protest. [...] On the contrary, it is believed that you would have urged the Government to locate the project in your township. [...] Since the project will be undertaken in your immediate neighborhood, you will have ample opportunity to determine for yourselves whether or not the disadvantages to the community, as claimed by your Mayor, were based upon sound facts." ...|$|E
