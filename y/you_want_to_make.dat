500|$|Woodall and Constantine have {{revealed}} that they have dressed in excess of 5,000 women {{over the course of}} their career. They have adopted the attitude that dressing to compliment body shape is important, on which subject Woodall has commented [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the best of yourself you don't necessarily need to diet – you need to wear the right stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2000, {{the band}} signed with Richard Branson's V2 Records. Rich explained, [...] "The cool thing about V2, {{the reason that}} we chose them, is that they told us, 'You guys go make the record <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> Then give it to us and we'll sell it.' [...] That's what we needed to hear." [...] The freedom V2 afforded through its {{hands-off}} approach influenced not only the music, but the album title as well. According to Chris, [...] "Lions is a symbol that stands for the fierce feeling and freedom that music allows you." ...|$|E

500|$|The Peregrine, by J. A. Baker, {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the best nature books in English written in the twentieth century. Admirers of the book include Robert Macfarlane, Mark Cocker, who regards the book as [...] "one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century" [...] and Werner Herzog, who called it [...] "the one book I would ask you to read if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> films," [...] and said elsewhere [...] "... it has prose of the calibre that we have not seen since Joseph Conrad." [...] In the book, Baker recounts, in diary form, his detailed observations of peregrines (and their interaction with other birds) near his home in Chelmsford, Essex, over a single winter from October to April.|$|E
500|$|Halo 2s soundtrack was {{composed}} primarily by Martin O'Donnell and his musical partner Michael Salvatori, {{the team that}} had composed the critically acclaimed music of Halo. O'Donnell noted in composing the music for Halo 2 that [...] "Making a sequel is never a simple proposition. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> everything that was cool even better, and leave out {{all the stuff that}} was weak." [...] O'Donnell made sure that no part of the game would be completely silent, noting [...] "Ambient sound {{is one of the main}} ways to immerse people psychologically. A dark room is spooky, but add a creaking floorboard and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes really creepy." [...] Halo 2, unlike its predecessor, was mixed to take full advantage of Dolby 5.1 Digital surround sound.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the first conference {{prompted}} the announcement of a second ISMB conference {{at the end of}} the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in Seattle. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at Stanford University in August 1994 and was organised by Russ Altman, a research scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. ISCB Board member and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute Alfonso Valencia has stated that, in 1995, [...] "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> progress, there has to be more focus in biology." ...|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} John Lasseter {{explained that}} [...] "The challenge is that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Rapunzel {{feel like a}} smart, clever, educated, healthy, fun human being" [...] {{despite the fact that}} the character has not ventured outside of her tower in 18 years. To avoid creating a [...] "princessy and aloof" [...] heroine, the animators decided to base Rapunzel's personality on actresses Reese Witherspoon, Natalie Portman, and Amy Poehler, which ultimately resulted in the character having a variety of [...] "quirky qualities" [...] that were used to [...] "shake up expectations of what a princess should be." [...] According to The New York Times, Rapunzel's personality made her a significant departure from traditional Disney heroines. Mandy Moore believes that Rapunzel is an atypical Disney princess because she is an independent character who [...] "can take care of herself", in addition to being largely oblivious to the fact that she is a princess.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News, Beyoncé talked {{about the meaning of}} the song: [...] "It basically talks about how a guy inspires you... <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him happy and you want to cater to him. I know it's going to be surprising {{to a lot of people}} that the independent survivors are being submissive to their man, but it's important that people know that, you know, it's fine if your man deserves it and gives that back to you." [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from Destiny Fulfilled. It was first released in the US as an extended play (EP) consisting of the audio version of the song along with four remixes on June 14, 2005. On July 19 another EP was released containing the original version and six remixes. Six days later an extended play of the single was released in Italy. [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was included on two of Destiny's Child's compilation albums: the greatest hits album #1's (2005) and Love Songs (2013).|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{directed}} by Wim Wenders, produced by Debbie Mason, and edited by Jerry Chater. The video was filmed in Berlin {{over the course of}} three days, primarily in black-and-white but with some sequences in colour. It contains cameos of some of the actors who appeared in Faraway, So Close!, including Otto Sander, as well as Wenders' nephew. Several scenes are taken directly from Faraway, So Close! and Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, which also served as the principal inspiration for the video's premise. Wenders noted that [...] "making a video is really a very different ballgame. You have the script, so to speak, because you have the song, and everything you do is in order to help the song shine... <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that song look as good as possible and sound as good as possible and as interesting as possible." [...] Several shots depict the band members standing on the statue of Victoria, a monument {{at the top of the}} Berlin Victory Column; a model of the angel was created for those scenes. Leftover military equipment from the Cold War, including the Soviet MiG, were included in the background.|$|E

"And now {{you have}} had your say, Klara," [...] said Andor, {{breaking}} with a mighty effort the spell of silence which had held him all this while; [...] "you have made all the mischief that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> Suppose <b>you</b> leave us alone now [...] . . .

500|$|Described as [...] "Speed Racer meets Hello Kitty meets me and Cam'ron" [...] by Carey, {{the video}} was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, stars actor Will Yun Lee and incorporates elements of Japanese culture and features Carey's alter-ego Bianca. When asked about the music video, Kahn replied, [...] "To me, videos aren't movies, they're their own art form-like poetry. If you're a poet, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> poetry." [...] Carey also revealed that the music video {{marked the first time}} she worked with Kahn. The music video production and recording was shown in a MTV's Making the Video episode in 2003. The video was likened to a [...] "clear extension of Janet's [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] for its similar settings and theme of Japanese pop culture. Following the release of [...] "Through the Rain", Carey embarked on several stateside, European and Asian promotional tours in support of Charmbracelet, as well as its accompanying singles. Three days prior to the album's stateside release, a one-hour special titled Mariah Carey: Shining Through the Rain aired on MTV, in which Carey was interviewed and sang several songs from Charmbracelet and of her catalog. During the interview, Carey addressed rumors of her breakdown and its cause, {{as well as of the}} album and its inspiration, followed by a question and answer with fans. During the album's month of release, Carey appeared on several television talk shows, launching her promotional tour on Today, where she performed a four song set-list at Mall of America for a crowd of over 10,000. Carey also performed the song on Top of the Pops and on The Graham Norton Show.|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, at {{a conference}} co-organized by MIT and IBM, {{physicist}} Richard Feynman urged the world to build a quantum computer. He said [...] "Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it's a wonderful problem, because it doesn't look so easy." ...|$|E

5000|$|Martin Scorsese said: [...] "I guess I’d put it like this: if {{you were}} alive in the ’50s and the ’60s and of a certain age, a {{teenager}} {{on your way to}} becoming an adult, and <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> films, I don’t see how you couldn’t be influenced by Bergman. You would have had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a conscious effort, and even then, the influence would have snuck through." ...|$|R

2500|$|As the Nintendo 64 {{reached the}} end of its lifecycle, {{hardware}} development chief Genyo Takeda repeatedly referred to the programming challenges using the word hansei ( [...] "reflective regret"). Looking back, Takeda said [...] "When we made Nintendo 64, we thought it was logical that if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> advanced games, it becomes technically more difficult. We were wrong. We now understand it's the cruising speed that matters, not the momentary flash of peak power".|$|E
2500|$|Ullman, who {{had already}} {{made a name for}} herself as a comedian with her BBC comedy series Three of a Kind, had a chance {{encounter}} with the wife of the head of the punk music label Stiff Records, Dave Robinson. The meeting led to her recording her first album. “One day, I was at my hairdresser, and Dave Robinson’s wife Rosemary leant over and said, ‘Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a record?’ I was having some of those Boy George kind of dreadlock things put in and I went, ‘Yeah I want to make a record.’ I would have tried anything.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart aired archive {{footage of}} Cramer admitting to {{the ease of}} {{manipulating}} markets and commented that Cramer's on-air personality lacks honesty: [...] "I understand <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> finance entertaining, but it's not a fucking game. And when I watch that, I get, I can't tell you how angry that makes me. Because what it says to me is: you all know. You all know what's going on. You know, you can draw {{a straight line from}} those shenanigans to the stuff that was being pulled at Bear, and AIG, and all this derivative market stuff that is this weird Wall Street side bet." [...] Stewart said of Cramer in particular, [...] "I can't reconcile the brilliance and knowledge that you have of the intricacies of the market with the crazy bullshit I see you do every night." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hughes married Kate Murphy of San Antonio (d. 1980) in 1910. In 1981 Holocaust denier David Irving {{claimed that}} Hughes {{had a girlfriend}} whom he {{referred}} to as “JP” in his diary. Recent research has discovered that “JP” refers to Elizabeth Prismall, who was a British secretary on Hughes’ staff. The nature of their relationship was indeed close, but {{it is by no}} means certain that the two were having an affair. Hughes, of his own volition, informed Kate of Mrs. Prismall’s presence explaining in a letter dated March 8, 1943, [...] "I have taken Mrs. Prismall to the mess several times and during the past few days….So you’ll soon here [...] that Hughes has a girl friend [...] along with the rest.

2500|$|In 2010, Linehan {{discussed}} the dramatic effect this choice {{had on the}} tone of the series: [...] "'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [...] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and [...] "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

[...] "There are some practical, pragmatic decisions made. If you’re playing to a crowd who are not very familiar with you, there's no point of going too deep but we do always make sure we play a new song. Like on Guns N' Roses [...] we had fifty minutes which is ten songs all in. So, you know we just made sure that in those ten songs we played 'Deeply Ordered Chaos' which we’re proud of {{and it makes a}} certain statement. And it just alerts people to the fact that, yes, we have made a record in the last 30 years. You know and that’s a good thing. Psychologically, that's the blood transfusion that we need. And we're very mindful, we have a very loyal fan base. We don’t pander as you well know." ...|$|E
