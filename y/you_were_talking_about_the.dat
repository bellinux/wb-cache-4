6000|$|... "Well, I {{must say}} {{you take it}} rather cool," [...] {{declared}} Hannah, almost resentfully. [...] "You come in and tell us you're going to marry Mr. Ditmar just like <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> weather." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there have}} been some funny goings on. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> monotony of our lives, but I assure you that they are {{sometimes}} quite as exciting as we wish them to be. You'd better come back to the house now, for after sundown we begin to get the fever-fog up from the marshes. There, you can see it coming across the river." ...|$|E

[...] "I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> my family, but I could have guessed that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> some one's family. Does your tongue ever stop, Jenny?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Rice {{said in a}} CNN {{interview}} about Pelosi's leadership, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a company that was posting losing numbers, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out {{and there would be}} a new strategy put in place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And,' said Jane, 'I should {{guess that}} Miss Ada herself knew {{something}} about it, for when I {{could not find the}} puzzle in the right-hand cupboard, she was so very unwilling that I should look into that one; she said there was nothing there but the boys' old playthings and Esther's clothes. And I do not know whether you saw how she fidgeted when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> quinces, before you went up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had to {{say what}} I thought," [...] she {{continued}} earnestly; [...] "I stood {{it as long as}} I could. Perhaps you didn't realize it, but my father was striking at me when he referred to your sermon, and spiritual control--and in other things he said when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> settlement-house. He reserves for himself the right to do as he pleases, but insists that those who surround him shall adopt the subserviency which he thinks proper {{for the rest of the}} world. If he were a Christian himself, I shouldn't mind it so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{a stroke}} of luck, indeed, lad, and right glad am I that I took it into my head to fetch you out to see the fire. But more than that, you have to thank yourself, for, indeed, you behaved right gallantly. You nearly had the Prince for your helper, for just before I went up the ladder {{the last time he}} stepped forward and said to me, 'You must be well-nigh spent, man. I will go up this time.' However, I said that I would finish the work, and so, without more ado, I shook off the hand he had placed on my arm, and ran up after you. Well, it is {{a stroke of}} good fortune to you, lad, that you should have shown your courage under his eye--no one is more able to {{appreciate}} a gallant action. This may help you a long way towards bringing about the aim <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other night, and I may live to see you Sir Cyril Shenstone yet." ...|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{the release}} of Achtung Baby, many critics praised [...] "Until the End of the World". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe {{thought it was the}} best song on the album, calling it a [...] "raging rocker" [...] with [...] "fiery bass runs" [...] by Clayton. Morse {{interpreted}} some of the lyrics differently from the song's original intent, noting that the lines [...] "We ate the food / We drank the wine / Everybody having a good time / Except you / <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> end of the world" [...] were as if Bono was giving a [...] "terse kiss-off to a former lover at a party". Rolling Stone praised The Edge's guitar playing on the song, noting that [...] "he has always made inspired use of devices like echo and reverb" [...] and [...] "his shimmering washes of color" [...] in the song are instantly recognizable. The Austin Chronicle singled out [...] "Larry Mullen Jr.'s seismic turn" [...] on the song as one of three moments on the record where the band has never sounded better.|$|E
5000|$|Q: Sir, a {{question}} about the mood among European allies. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Islamic world a second ago. But now the European allies. If you look at, for example, France, Germany, also {{a lot of people in}} my own country -- Im from Dutch public TV, by the way -- it seems that a lot of Europeans rather give the benefit of the doubt to Saddam Hussein than President George Bush. These are U.S. allies. What do you make of that?Rumsfeld: Well, its -- what do I make of it?Q: They have no clerics. They have no Muslim clerics there.Rumsfeld: Are you helping me? (Laughter.) Do you think I need help? (Laughter.)What do I think about it? Well, there isnt anyone alive who wouldnt prefer unanimity. I mean, you just always would like everyone to stand up and say, Way to go! Thats the right thing to do, United States.Now, we rarely find unanimity in the world. I was ambassador to NATO, and I -- when we would go in and make a proposal, there wouldnt be unanimity. There wouldnt even be understanding. And wed have to be persuasive. Wed have to show reasons. Wed have to -- have to give rationales. Wed have to show facts. And, by golly, I found that Europe on any major issue is given -- if theres leadership and if youre right, and if your facts are persuasive, Europe responds. And they always have.Now, youre thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I dont. I think thats old Europe. If you look at the entire NATO Europe today, the center of gravity is shifting to the east. And there are a lot of new members. And if you just take the list of all the members of NATO and all of those who have been invited in recently -- what is it? Twenty-six, something like that? -- youre right. Germany has been a problem, and France has been a problem.Q: But opinion polls --Rumsfeld: But -- just a minute. Just a minute. But you look at vast numbers of other countries in Europe. Theyre not with France and Germany on this, theyre with the United States.|$|E
