If the patient has a low titer inhibitor, try to overwhelm it with high doses of the factor. If the patient has a high titer antibody against factor VIII, try porcine factor VIII or prothrombin complex concentrates to stop the bleeding. Prednisone will often lower the titer over time.

The intention of WebRTC is to close this gap by connecting users {{to each other in}} real-time simply by loading a web page. WebRTC is technology enabling peer-to-peer communication via browsers, plugin-free. It’s still a new technology and has not yet been finally standardized, nor does it come without new privacy- and security concerns. Some say that it will change the landscape of web applications while others say it’s overrated. This thesis aims to describe WebRTC, how and why it works and goes in-depth on some of the security and privacy concerns it faces.

40|$|Why is {{this topic}} important? Organization {{development}} (OD) is about planned change. As change {{has turned into}} the only constant, many managers and other people are pursuing change strategies with vigor. OD is a major strategy for leading and managing change at the individ-ual, group, intergroup, organizational, interorganizational, and large systems levels. This book is about {{what it takes to}} be an effective change manager, change leader, and OD consultant. What can you achieve with this book? Simply stated, this book provides everything <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> through on how to func-tion as a competent OD professional. How is this book organized? The book is organized into five parts. Part 1 consists of Chapters 1 through 7 and is entitled “Foundations. ” It includes information on key terms and definitions, models, origins of OD, and practitioner competencies. Part 2 consists of Chapters 8 through 13 and is entitled “Steps to Guide Planned Change. ” This section covers marketing, pre-launch, launch, implementation, evaluation, and separation. Part 3 consists of Chapters 14 through 19 and is entitled “Levels of Organizational Change. ” In it we dis-cuss the issue of organization culture and interventions across various levels: individ-ual, team, large systems, and interlevel. Part 4, the final part of the book, addresses some special issues in OD: global OD, values, appreciative inquiry, human systems dynamics, technology, consultant issues, and looking to the future. The book concludes with three appendices that offer a variety of supplementary information, including a self-assessment tool for OD competencies.

40|$|This entry {{discusses}} {{a statistical}} issue that arises {{when using the}} Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to compare models. Stata calculates BIC, assuming N = e(N) —we will explain—but sometimes {{it would be better}} if a different N were used. Commands that calculate BIC have an n() option, allowing you to specify the N to be used. In summary, 1. If you are comparing results estimated by the same estimation command, using the default BIC calculation is probably fine. There is an issue, but most researchers would ignore it. 2. If you are comparing results estimated by different estimation commands, you need to be on your guard. a. If the different estimation commands share the same definitions of observations, independence, and the like, you are back in case 1. b. If they differ in these regards, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the value of N that should be used. For example, logit and xtlogit differ in that the former assumes independent observations and the latter, independent panels. c. If estimation commands differ in the events being used over which the likelihood function is calculated, the information criteria may not be comparable at all. We say information criteria because this would apply equally to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), as well as to BIC. For instance, streg and stcox produce such incomparable results. The events used by streg are the actual survival times, whereas the events used by stcox are failures within risk pools, conditional on the times at which failures occurred.

40|$|Realistic {{mathematics}} education (RME) {{is a way}} of teaching, {{which has}} been developed in the Netherlands around 1960. It is {{based on the idea that}} children are solving mathematical problems, which are connected to their life experiences, with informal mathematical strategies and prior knowledge. With the help of models and illustrations they build their knowledge on their own and gradually pass from concrete stage of understanding mathematics to understanding mathematics in a symbolic way. A teacher is just a guide during the learning process and helps children to stay on the right track but he isn't a source of information. In master's thesis the RME approach is presented. We described basic characteristics of the approach and some new researches which are connected to RME approach. We also presented the model of teaching fractions with RME approach based on the book Fractions in Realistic Mathematics Education (Streefland, 1991) and our approach of teaching fractions in 4 th grade based on RME approach. The empirical part of the master's thesis shows the findings of the analysis of 6 interviews with primary teachers, who teach in 4 th grade. The purpose of the study was to find out how teachers teach fractions in 4 th grade and to determine teacher's attitude towards our approach of teaching fractions based on RME approach. The results showed that the most common way of teaching is still transmission approach using textbooks and workbooks. In our approach based on RME, teachers saw advantages and disadvantages. Teachers believe that our approach is good because it encourages the thinking process, cooperation, vindication, children's autonomy, argumentation, logical thinking and the idea that children are active and building their own knowledge. Teachers also think that our approach is excellent for gifted students. As disadvantages they see mostly the amount of work for preparation, because <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> a lot to design appropriate mathematical problems. They also think that our mathematical problems are difficult and not gradual enough. ...|$|E

Stating clear course objectives is important because: Objectives guide the content materials and the teaching methods. You can use objectives {{to make sure you}} reach your goals. Students will understand expectations. Assessment and grading is based on the objectives. Basic Information As you develop a course, a lesson or a learning activity, you have to determine what you want the students to learn and how you will know that they learned. Learning objectives, also called behavioral objectives and instructional objectives, are a requirements for highquality course development. What are Goals? Goals are broad, generalized statements about what is to be learned. Think of them as a target to be reached, or "hit.

D. method The ABCD method of writing objectives is an excellent starting point for writing objectives (Heinich, et al., 1996). In this system, "A " is for audience; "B " is for behavior, "C " for conditions and "D " for degree of mastery needed. 1. Audience – Who? Who are your learners? 2. Behavior – What? What do you expect {{them to be able to}} do? This should be an overt, observable behavior, even if the actualbehavior is covert or mental in nature.

What will the student be given or already be expected to know to accomplish the learning? 4. Degree – How much? How much will be accomplished, how well will the behavior need to be performed, and to what level?
