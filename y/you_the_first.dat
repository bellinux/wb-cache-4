2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} the {{prerogative}} to sanctify the New Moon at its sighting {{and to set}} a leap year to reconcile the calendar applied to the Sanhedrin in the Land of Israel.

When the Sanhedrin ended in the Land of Israel, Jews established the monthly calendar and instituted leap years solely according to the fixed calendar that is followed now. So the sighting of the moon is no longer of any consequence.|$|E
