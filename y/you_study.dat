2500|$|State-dependent {{retrieval}} {{is demonstrated}} when material learned under one State is best recalled {{in that same}} [...] state. A study by Carter and Cassady (1998) showed this effect with antihistamine. In other words, if <b>you</b> <b>study</b> while on hay fever tablets, then you will recall more of what you studied if you test yourself while on antihistamines in comparison to testing yourself while not on antihistamines after having studied on antihistamines.|$|E

[...] A story in the Analects recounts that Confucius' son Kong Li told the story: [...] "The Master once stood by himself, and I hurried to seek teaching from him. [...] He asked me, 'You've studied the Odes?' [...] I answered, 'Not yet.' [...] He replied, 'If <b>you</b> <b>study</b> the Odes not, then I have nothing to speak.'" ...|$|E

[...] Car and Driver road testers noted the Pacer's [...] "smooth and quiet ride can probably {{be attributed to a}} front subframe that isolates the passenger capsule from engine, suspension and steering loads" [...] making the car [...] "eminently stable and controllable, with its rack-and-pinion steering and wide track." ...|$|E
2500|$|The two songwriters of the Smiths {{cited the}} band; singer Morrissey said that [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent", and that [...] "they {{were one of}} the great groups of the late 70s, early 80s". He also said in 1994, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>study</b> modern groups, those who gain press {{coverage}} and chart action, none of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact". Guitarist Johnny Marr, mentioned his liking for Banshees guitarist John McGeoch and his contribution to the single [...] "Spellbound". Marr qualified it as [...] "clever" [...] with a [...] "really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll". U2 cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as a major influence and selected [...] "Christine" [...] for a Mojo compilation. The Edge was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at the Mojo ceremony in 2005. In December 1981, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode named the Banshees as one of his three favourite bands along with Sparks and Roxy Music. Gahan later hailed the single [...] "Candyman" [...] at its release, saying, [...] "This is a great Banshees record, I like their sound". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected [...] "Jigsaw Feeling" [...] from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited [...] "Hong Kong Garden" [...] in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, and Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine also mentioned them as being among his early influences. Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once noted a parallel between his band and the Banshees: [...] "There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees". Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, [...] "They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We’re not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we’re coming from".|$|E
