500|$|Adam Noah Levine {{was born}} in Los Angeles on March 18, 1979 to Fred Levine, the founder of retail chain M. Fredric, and Patsy (née Noah) Levine, an admissions counselor. He has a brother Michael, two half-siblings Sam and Liza Levine and step-sister Julia Bartolf Milne. Levine's father and {{maternal}} grandfather are both Jewish, while his maternal grandmother was a Protestant. Levine considers himself Jewish, though according to an interview with The Jewish Chronicle, he [...] "has rejected formal religious practice for a more generalized, spiritual way of life." [...] He chose {{not to have a}} Bar Mitzvah as a child, explaining: [...] "I felt as though a lot of kids were trying to cash in ... I just don't think it's the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs and <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> of cultural heritage." [...] Levine is a nephew of journalist and author Timothy Noah, television producer and writer Peter Noah, and economist Jordan Levine.|$|E
2500|$|Stroustrup {{campaigned for}} <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years,</b> way beyond {{any sort of}} {{technical}} contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said “no” to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn’t cleanly designed—it was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Bill Moyers {{reported}} that PBS had obtained {{a copy of}} the [...] "game plan" [...] that was adopted by the industry's trade association, America's Health Insurance Plans which spelled out the industry strategies to [...] "Highlight horror stories of government-run systems." [...] Potter explained, [...] "The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are {{the worst thing that could}} possibly happen to them, that even if you consider that, you're heading down on the slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics for <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years,</b> to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern." ...|$|E
30|$|This {{helped the}} {{planning}} process {{over the course of}} the program to continually keep all leaders involved in what each session would entail. The consistent communication via email also provided opportunities for any of the leaders to deliver feedback or suggestions. Furthermore, in addition to communicating for logistical reasons, leaders communicated with each other for guidance and advice. One leader indicated: “One of the other leaders, she’s been working with the BGC for <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> she has experience working with youth in camps and things like that, so she’s sort of the person that I turn to” (L- 1).|$|R

2500|$|Professor Abell {{is renowned}} for his pragmatic stance on his forecasting, {{evidenced}} by his signature phrase: [...] "I can't rule it out"; forthright with his listeners, Abell {{lays out the}} evidences he has for his forecast and the rationales for his conclusions. [...] In addition to computer-generated weather models, Abell draws upon [...] "years <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> of experience", <b>and</b> is more inclined to rely on his instinct {{as opposed to the}} computer when the two forecasts diverge.|$|R
2500|$|Screenwriter Boal {{described}} the pro-torture accusations as [...] "preposterous", stating that [...] "it's just misreading {{the film to}} say that it shows torture leading to the information about bin Laden", while director Bigelow added: [...] "Do I wish [...] was not part of that history? Yes. But it was." [...] In February 2013 in the Wall Street Journal, Boal responded to the Senate critics, being quoted as saying [...] "oes that mean they can use the movie as a political platform to talk about what they've been wanting to talk about for <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years?</b> Do I think that Feinstein used the movie as a publicity tool to get a conversation going about her report? I believe it, ..." [...] referring to the intelligence committee's report on enhanced interrogations. He also said the senators' letter showed they were still concerned about public opinion supporting the effectiveness of torture and didn't want the movie reinforcing that. Boal said, though, [...] "I don't think that [...] issue has really been resolved" [...] if there is a suspect with possible knowledge of imminent attack who will not talk.|$|E

40|$|The EU banana import {{regime has}} been {{controversial}} during <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> it {{deserves to be}} looked at. This article aims to analyse {{the results of the}} negotiation process which ended the latent conflict (known as ‘banana war’); it also compares the ex ante predictions and the ex post results. In order to better understand the significant differences, we look for the triple evolution: trade, prices and market structures. Since 2006, many stakeholders have gained power in the international market, in particular suppliers that quickly assimilated the necessity to adapt to market changes; the EU consumers took advantage of lower prices and the EU policy adaptation to WTO rules. This article is only a case study, but its conclusions can be helpful for analysing other trade conflicts or agreements...|$|R

She had been with Liverpool's {{forerunners}} Knowsley United, but was cup-tied for their appearance in the 1994 final. Easton said: [...] "I've been trying for <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> haven't {{been able to do}} it [...] before. It would obviously be great for the club, because we haven’t won it as 'Everton', but on a personal note it would just be absolutely fantastic." [...] Rachel Brown had played for Liverpool as a 15-year-old schoolgirl in the 1996 final, but was injured in 2005 and had not played in the final again since.

60|$|My Own Darling Maude,--How {{good you}} are--and your mother also--in falling {{in with my}} suggestions! Please, please don't bother your dear self about dresses. You only want the one travelling-dress to be married in, and the rest we can pick up as we go. I am sure that white dress with the black stripe--the one you were playing tennis with at the Arlingtons'--would do splendidly. You looked simply splendid that day. I am {{inclined}} {{to think that it}} is my favourite of all your dresses, {{with the exception of the}} dark one with the light- green front. That shows off your figure so splendidly. I am very fond also of the grey Quaker-like alpaca dress. What a little dove you do look in it! I think those dresses, and of course your satin evening-dress, are my favourites. On second thoughts, they are the only dresses I have ever seen you in. But I like the grey best, because you wore it the first time I ever--you remember! You must NEVER get rid of those dresses. They are too full of associations. I want to see you in them for <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

"Here's old Dan'l and old Jinny, {{that the}} sheriff sold south {{one of the}} times that we got bankrupted before the war--they came {{wandering}} back after the peace, worn out and used up on the cotton plantations, helpless, and not another lick of work left in their old hides {{for the rest of}} this earthly pilgrimage--and we so pinched, oh so pinched for the very crumbs to keep life in us, and he just flung the door wide, and the way he received them you'd have thought they had come straight down from heaven in answer to prayer. I took him one side and said, 'Mulberry we can't have them--we've nothing for ourselves--we can't feed them.' He looked at me kind of hurt, and said, 'Turn them out?--and they've come to me just as confident and trusting as--as--why Polly, I must have bought that confidence sometime or other a long time ago, and given my note, so to speak--you don't get such things as a gift--and how am I going to go back on a debt like that? And you see, they're so poor, and old, and friendless, and--' But I was ashamed by that time, and shut him off, and somehow felt a new courage in me, and so I said, softly, 'We'll keep them--the Lord will provide.' He was glad, and started to blurt out one of those over-confident speeches of his, but checked himself in time, and said humbly, 'I will, anyway.' It was <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> ago. Well, you see those old wrecks are here yet." ...|$|E

And for those of us were very saddened and touched by the loss of Christopher Reeve - to see footage you've never seen of him before, and a whole different take on the Superman II story, is really thrilling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MS) is {{a combination}} of medical disorders that increase one's risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Little information exists on the prevalence of MS in a general adult population in Taiwan. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in a representative sample of 2, 359 Chinese adults aged 40 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> over who lived in a metropolitan city, Taiwan in 2004 – 05. MS was defined by Adult Treatment Panel III criteria modified for Asians. Results The prevalence of MetS was 35. 32 % and 43. 23 % in men aged 40 – 64 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> over, respectively, and 24. 19 % and 51. 82 % in women aged 40 – 64 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> over. Older age, postmenopausal status, higher body mass index, current smoking, low education attainment, low household income, no alcohol consumption, lower level of occupation physical activity, and a family history of diabetes were associated with increased odds of MetS. Conclusion MetS was present in more than 30 % of the Taiwan adult population aged 40 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> over in a metropolitan area; there were substantial variations by age and body mass index groups. </p...|$|R

40|$|Collecting {{traditional}} tales in Lincolnshire {{towards the}} end of the nineteenth century, the folklorist M. C. Balfour had the good fortune to encounter “an old man from Lindsey, ” who alongside a rich fund of legends could also offer a historical account of the picturesque local lore and custom they reflected. For in earlier times, his grandfather had told him, people were much concerned about the forces in nature which could affect their well-being, and to control or placate the “bogles”, the vaguely conceived supernatural beings in which these forces were invested, they practised many ritual observances which were hardly in conformity with the doctrines and ceremonies of established religion: the folk had ideas of their own, and ways of their own, as they’d kept up <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> hundreds of <b>years,</b> since the time when there weren’t no church, leastwise no church of that sort [...] So there were, so to say, two churches; the one with priests and candles, and all that; the other just a lot of old ways, kept up all unbeknown and hidden-like, midst the folk themselves.

Four of the seven athletes who had transfusions won medals. The US federation banned blood-doping in January 1985. Although Borysewicz denied involvement, both he and Burke were fined a month's pay.

2500|$|After [...] "Normal" [...] aired, {{internet}} sources {{began to}} summarize the rules for True American, which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and Candy Land where the floor is lava; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents. The idea of True American came from a New Girl writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting [...] "JFK! FDR!" [...] and walking on chairs. As the cast {{did not understand the}} game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to [...] "have fun, dig in, jump in" [...] and play it as if [...] "they'd been playing this thing for <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years." [...] The high-energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming True American more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode.|$|R
