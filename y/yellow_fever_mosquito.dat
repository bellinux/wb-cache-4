25|$|Ae. albopictus can outcompete {{and even}} {{eradicate}} other species with similar breeding habitats {{from the very}} start of its dispersal to other regions and biotopes. In Kolkata, for example, it was observed in the 1960s that egg depositing containers were being settled by the Asian tiger mosquito in city districts where the malaria mosquito (genus Anopheles) and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito</b> (Aedes aegypti) had both been eliminated by the application of DDT. This may be because primarily the inner walls of the houses were treated with DDT to kill the mosquitoes resting there and fight the malaria mosquito. The <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito</b> also lingers particularly in the inside of buildings and would have been also affected. The Asian tiger mosquito rests in the vicinity of human dwellings would therefore have an advantage over the other two species. In other cases, where the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito</b> was repressed by the Asian tiger mosquito, for instance in Florida, this explanation does not fit. Other hypotheses include competition in the larval breeding waters, differences in metabolism and reproductive biology, or a major susceptibility to sporozoans (Apicomplexa).|$|E
25|$|Control of the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito</b> A. aegypti is {{of major}} importance, {{especially}} {{because the same}} mosquito can also transmit dengue fever and chikungunya disease. A. aegypti breeds preferentially in water, for example in installations by inhabitants of areas with precarious drinking water supply, or in domestic waste, especially tires, cans, and plastic bottles. These conditions are common in urban areas in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|The second {{strategy}} is to reduce populations of the adult <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito.</b> Lethal ovitraps can reduce Aedes populations, but with a decreased amount of pesticide because it targets the mosquitoes directly. Curtains and lids of water tanks can be sprayed with insecticides, but application inside houses is not recommended by the WHO. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets are effective, {{just as they are}} against the Anopheles mosquito that carries malaria.|$|E
50|$|Operation Magic Sword was U.S. {{military}} operation undertaken in 1965. It {{was designed to}} ascertain the effectiveness of releasing mosquito vectors for biological agents at sea. It took place off the southeastern coast of the United States and employed <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> {{with the hope of}} assessing their biting habits following an ocean-borne release.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1955 the U.S. {{utilized}} the E14 in field test, {{this time in}} the U.S. state of Georgia. The E14 was packed with [...] "aircomb waffles" [...] or loop tubes, instead of fleas these tests used uninfected <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> (Aedes aegypti). The successful Georgia trials were known as [...] "Operation Big Buzz".|$|R
50|$|Operation May Day {{involved}} {{a series of}} EW tests from April to November 1956. The tests were designed to reveal information about the dispersal of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> in an urban area. The mosquitoes were released from ground level in Savannah, Georgia and then recovered using traps baited with dry ice. The operation was detailed in partially declassified U.S. Army report in 1981.|$|R
25|$|In Asia, the Asian tiger {{mosquito}} can {{be mistaken for}} {{other members of the}} subgenus Stegomyia, particularly the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito</b> Aedes aegypti (the most prevalent species in the tropics and subtropics), because both species display a similar black and white pattern. It can be hard to distinguish Ae. albopictus from the closely related Aedes scutellaris (India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines), Aedes pseudoalbopictus (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) and Aedes seatoi (Thailand).|$|E
25|$|Yellow fever {{virus is}} mainly {{transmitted}} through {{the bite of}} the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito</b> Aedes aegypti, but other mostly Aedes mosquitoes such as the tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) can {{also serve as a}} vector for this virus. Like other arboviruses which are transmitted by mosquitoes, the yellow fever virus is taken up by a female mosquito when it ingests the blood of an infected human or other primate. Viruses reach the stomach of the mosquito, and if the virus concentration is high enough, the virions can infect epithelial cells and replicate there. From there, they reach the haemocoel (the blood system of mosquitoes) and from there the salivary glands. When the mosquito next sucks blood, it injects its saliva into the wound, and the virus reaches the bloodstream of the bitten person. Transovarial and transstadial transmission of the yellow fever virus within A. aegypti, that is, the transmission from a female mosquito to her eggs and then larvae, are indicated. This infection of vectors without a previous blood meal seems {{to play a role in}} single, sudden breakouts of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Three epidemiologically {{different}} infectious cycles occur, {{in which}} the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans or other primates. In the [...] "urban cycle", only the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito</b> A. aegypti is involved. It is well adapted to urban areas and can also transmit other diseases, including Zika fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya. The urban cycle {{is responsible for the}} major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa. Except in an outbreak in 1999 in Bolivia, this urban cycle no longer exists in South America.|$|E
50|$|In Taiwan, {{the native}} populations of paradise fish {{have been reduced}} to low levels by {{pollution}} in the rivers, and are now listed as a threatened species. The local population of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> (Aedes aegypti) has since increased in the absence of one of its main predators. The infection rate for dengue fever has subsequently increased in the human population, caused in part by to the lack of natural mosquito predators.|$|R
5|$|The use {{of insects}} for warfare {{may have been}} {{attempted}} in the Middle Ages or earlier, but was first systematically researched by several nations during the twentieth century. It was put into practice by the Japanese army's Unit 731 in attacks on China during the Second World War, killing almost 500,000 Chinese people with fleas infected with plague and flies infected with cholera. Also in the Second World War, the Germans explored the use of Colorado beetles to destroy enemy potato crops. During the Cold War, the US Army considered using <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> to attack Soviet cities.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito's</b> {{distribution}} {{has increased}} {{in the past two}} to three decades worldwide, and it is considered to be among the most widespread mosquito species. Signs of Zika virus-capable mosquito populations have been found adapting for persistence in warm temperate climates. Such a population has been identified to exist in parts of Washington, DC, and genetic evidence suggests they survived at least the last four winters in the region. One of the study researchers noted, [...] " ...some mosquito species are finding ways to survive in normally restrictive environments by taking advantage of underground refugia".|$|R
2500|$|Coevolution: Female cryptic choice {{may also}} act {{indirectly}} by choosing for [...] males with subtle secondary sexual traits that may cater to easier insemination and mating. [...] In these instances female cooperation during the mating process {{is crucial for}} male success. [...] For example, in the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito,</b> successful copulation requires a multistep process with a cooperative and receptive female. In the Caribbean fruit fly, males must display a specific calling song to induce female cooperation which [...] allows the male to penetrate the female deeply, increasing his chances of success.|$|E
2500|$|In 1894, a British-Australian entomologist, Frederick A. Askew Skuse, was {{the first}} to scientifically {{describe}} the Asian tiger mosquito, which he named Culex albopictus (lat. [...] "gnat", [...] "midge" [...] and [...] "white-painted"). Later, the species was assigned to the genus Aedes (gr. , [...] "unpleasant") and referred to as Aedes albopictus. Like the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquito,</b> it belongs to the subgenus Stegomyia (Gr. , [...] "covered, roofed", referring to the scales that completely cover the dorsal surface in this subgenus, and , [...] "fly") within the Aedes genus. In 2004, scientists explored higher-level relationships and proposed a new classification within the Aedes genus and Stegomyia was elevated to the genus level, making Aedes albopictus now Stegomyia albopicta. This is, however, a controversial matter, and the use of Stegomyia albopicta versus Aedes albopictus is continually debated.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1881, {{thanks to}} Cuban {{physician}} Carlos Finlay, {{it was known}} that the transmitting agent of <b>Yellow</b> <b>Fever</b> was <b>mosquito</b> Aedes aegypti. Before that discovery, doctors attributed the cause of many epidemics to what they called [...] "miasmas" [...] floating in the air.|$|R

40|$|The {{excision}} of specific DNA sequences from integrated transgenes in insects permits the dissection in situ of structural elements {{that may be}} important in controlling gene expression. Furthermore, manipulation of potential control elements {{in the context of}} a single integration site mitigates against insertion site influences of the surrounding genome. The cre–loxP site-specific recombination system has been used successfully to remove a marker gene from transgenic <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> Aedes aegypti. A total of 33. 3 % of all fertile families resulting from excision protocols showed evidence of cre–loxP-mediated site-specific excision. Excision frequencies were as high as 99. 4 % within individual families. The cre recombinase was shown to precisely recognize loxP sites in the mosquito genome and catalyze excision. Similar experiments with the FLP/FRT site-specific recombination system failed to demonstrate {{excision of}} the marker gene from the mosquito chromosomes...|$|R
50|$|Zika {{virus is}} a mosquito-borne flavivirus {{closely related to}} the dengue and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> viruses. While <b>mosquitoes</b> are the vector, the main {{reservoir}} species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents.|$|R
40|$|Some plant {{essential}} and edible oils repel mosquitoes but often quantitatively minor repellent constituents therein remain unknown. In gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analyses of catnip, cinnamon, citronella, cumin, eucalyptus, geranium, ginger, melissa, peppermint, rosemary, and thyme essential oils, 43 constituents elicited responses from antennae of female <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes,</b> Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae). GC-EAD analyses of soybean oil (active ingredient of BiteBlocker™) were inconclusive. In GC-EAD analyses of garlic oil, 10 constituents and 4 thermal degradation components stimulated antennae. Dual-port olfactometer and screened-cage experiments failed to reveal any repellent effect associated with soybean oil. Diallyl trisulfide and diallyl tetrasulfide as EAD-active constituents of garlic oil {{were significantly more}} repellent to female Ae. aegypti than control stimuli. I conclude that GC-EAD screening of plant essential oils and other sources is a viable technology to detect new quantitatively minor constituents that could be potent repellents when tested at an appropriate dose...|$|R

50|$|The United States seriously {{researched}} {{the potential of}} entomological warfare (EW) during the Cold War. EW is {{a specific type of}} biological warfare which aims to use insects as weapon, either directly or through their potential to act as vectors. During the 1950s the United States conducted a series of field tests using entomological weapons. Operation Big Itch, in 1954, was designed to test munitions loaded with uninfected fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis). In May 1955 over 300,000 <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> (Aedes aegypti) were dropped over parts of the U.S. state of Georgia to determine if the air-dropped mosquitoes could survive to take meals from humans. The mosquito tests were known as Operation Big Buzz. The U.S. engaged in at least two other EW testing programs, Operation Drop Kick and Operation May Day. A 1981 Army report outlined these tests as well as multiple cost-associated issues that occurred with EW.|$|R

The main disinfectant used was sulfur dioxide.|$|R
40|$|Horizontally {{transmitted}} parasites are broadly {{predicted to}} be more virulent, or costly to host fitness, than those with vertical transmission. This is mainly because vertical transmission, from host parent to offspring, explicitly links the reproductive interests of both parties. Underlying this prediction is a general assumption that parasite transmission success is positively correlated with its virulence. We report results where infection of larval <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> Aedes aeg�pti with the microsporidian Edha�ardia aedis was experimentally manipulated. The parasite’s complex life cycle allowed comparisons between estimates of horizontal and vertical transmission on host fitness. Our measure of virulence was the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of adult female wings. Hosts harbouring spores showed higher FAs than controls. Horizontally transmitting spores were associated with higher FAs than vertically transmitting spores. Furthermore, within hosts FA correlated positively {{with the number of}} horizontally transmitting spores, while no relation was seen with the number of vertically transmitting spores. A developmental mechanism uncoupling the relationship between vertical transmission and virulence is proposed. 1...|$|R
