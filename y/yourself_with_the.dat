500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do you think these guys are here to do? I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E
