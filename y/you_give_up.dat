2500|$|This metric of {{the square}} flat torus can also be {{realised}} by specific embeddings of the familiar 2-torus into Euclidean 4-space or higher dimensions. Its surface has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. Its surface is [...] "flat" [...] {{in the same sense}} that the surface of a cylinder is [...] "flat". In 3 dimensions one can bend a flat sheet of paper into a cylinder without stretching the paper, but you cannot then bend this cylinder into a torus without stretching the paper (unless <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> some regularity and differentiability conditions, see below).|$|E
2500|$|God condemns usury, and blesses charities. God dislikes every disbeliever, guilty. Those {{who believe}} and do good works and {{establish}} worship {{and pay the}} poor-due, their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. O you who believe, you shall observe God and refrain {{from all kinds of}} usury, if you are believers. If you do not, then expect a war from God and His messenger. But if you repent, you may keep your capitals, without inflicting injustice, or incurring injustice. If the debtor is unable to pay, wait for a better time. If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the loan as a charity, {{it would be better for}} you, if you only knew. (Al-Baqarah 2:276-280) ...|$|E

2500|$|The protest arose {{controversy}} in political circles. Tsyganko reported a private {{interview with the}} Romanian envoy Artur Văitoianu. He quoted the latter as offering a deal: [...] "You must renounce [...] if only for this sole reason—that you no good Roumanian officials in Bessarabia—that is to say, none who are good nationalists. If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> autonomy, you {{will not have a}} Commissioner-General, but you will have a Bessarabian Chargé d'Affaires, a man of your own character, who will be nominated by the Central Power. The new [...] Directorate will remain in office until the meeting of the Pan-Roumanian Constitutional Assembly. Does this appeal to you as attractive?" [...] Also according to Tsyganko, Văitoianu informed the group that they needed to coalesce with Romanian nationalists in front of Great Russian revivalism, and that [...] "the national idea takes precedence over everything", implicitly threatening Sfatul dignitaries.|$|E
2500|$|Brennan {{turned down}} the {{internship}} and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" [...] and [...] "I am never going to help you." [...] Now alone, Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money. She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused. Brennan hid her pregnancy {{for as long as}} she could, living in a variety of homes and continuing her work with Zen meditation. At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs [...] "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child." [...] A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm and she accepted the offer. When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him) Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Weizmann {{became a}} {{chemistry}} lecturer at the University of Manchester and {{soon became a}} leader among British Zionists. [...] At that time, Arthur Balfour was a Conservative MP representing one of the districts of Manchester, and was also Prime Minister; the two met during one of Balfour's electoral campaigns in 1905-1906. [...] Balfour supported {{the concept of a}} Jewish homeland, but felt that there would be more support among politicians for the then-current offer in Uganda, called the British Uganda Programme. Following mainstream Zionist rejection of that proposal, Weizmann was credited later with persuading Balfour, by then the Foreign Secretary, for British support to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, the original Zionist aspiration. The story goes that Weizmann asked Balfour, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> London to live in Saskatchewan?" [...] When Balfour replied that the British had always lived in London, Weizmann responded, [...] "Yes, and we lived in Jerusalem when London was still a marsh." [...] Nevertheless, this did not prevent naturalization as a British subject in 1910 with the help of haham Moses Gaster, who asked for papers from Herbert Samuel, the minister.|$|E

2500|$|The film review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes reports 71% positive reviews {{based on}} 52 surveyed critics {{and an average}} score of 7.4/10. [...] The site's consensus reads: [...] "The ending {{could use a little}} work but this is otherwise another sterling example of David Fincher's iron grip on atmosphere and storytelling." [...] Metacritic rated it 61/100 based on 19 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising Douglas as [...] "the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Mr. Fincher, like Michael Douglas in the film's leading role, does show real finesse in playing to the paranoia of these times". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Fincher's style is so handsomely oppressive, and Douglas' befuddlement is so cagey, that for a while the film recalls smarter excursions into heroic paranoia (The Parallax View, Total Recall)". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, [...] "It’s formulaic, yet edgy. It’s predictable, yet full of surprises. How far you get through this tall tale of a thriller before <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> and howl is a matter of personal taste. But there’s much pleasure in Fincher’s intricate color schemes, his rich sense of decor, his ability to sustain suspense {{over long periods of time}} and his sense of humor". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Emotionally, there's not much at stake in The Game — can Nicholas Van Orton be saved?! — but Douglas is the perfect actor to occupy the center of a crazed Rube Goldberg thriller. The movie has the wit to be playful about its own manipulations, even as it exploits them for maximum pulp impact". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, [...] "At times The Game is frustrating to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes". However, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers felt that [...] "Fincher's effort to cover up the plot holes is all the more noticeable for being strained ... The Game has a sunny, redemptive side that ill suits Fincher and ill serves audiences that share his former affinity for loose ends hauntingly left untied".|$|E
