500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do <b>your</b> <b>club</b> much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E

50|$|All players {{start with}} a basic set of golf clubs. New clubs can be earned as rewards for {{completing}} certain missions, or purchased from club vendors on the island. As you play, <b>your</b> golf <b>clubs</b> will accrue wear and tear, which can be repaired by visiting the repair shop at the resort, or in extreme circumstances, on the golf course. However, be warned, repairing on the course is more expensive than at the shop. Failing to keep <b>your</b> <b>clubs</b> in good working order can result in more difficult gameplay.|$|R
