5|$|Though {{behind in}} the rushing game, Tech's passing offense {{finished}} ahead of Nebraska's. Hokie quarterback Jim Druckenmiller completed 16 of his 33 pass attempts, earning 214 passing yards and three touchdowns. On {{the opposite side of}} the ball, Nebraska quarterback Scott Frost earned just 136 passing <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> 11 completed passes and 22 attempts. Combining the rushing and passing totals results in a similar total offensive performance from both teams. Virginia Tech finished the game with 407 net <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> 72 offensive plays, while Nebraska eked 415 net <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> 71 offensive plays. The Hokies had a slight advantage in the time of possession, 31:02 to 28:58. The real statistical difference comes in penalties—Tech committed five for 89 yards, while Nebraska had just three for 16 yards—and turnovers. The sole turnover in the game was a Virginia Tech fumble returned for a touchdown. Neither quarterback threw an interception.|$|E
5|$|Barber led the Giants with 1,662 {{yards rushing}} and over 2,000 <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> scrimmage, Manning threw for 3,244 yards and 24 touchdowns, and Jeremy Shockey {{led the team}} in receptions. Defensively, the team {{struggled}} against the pass (28th in the league) and gaining a consistent pass rush (tied for 23rd {{in the league in}} sacks).|$|E
5|$|Local {{farm workers}} were first on scene. Eric Webb was {{stacking}} hay. When he realised that the aircraft {{was about to}} crash he ran to help. He was joined by P Richards, {{who had been working}} on a tractor in a farmyard less than 100 <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> the crash site.|$|E

5|$|A {{few hundred}} <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> the airfield, his plane crashed nose {{first into the}} ground. He was quickly freed from the {{aircraft}} by his men, but died in an ambulance minutes later; his orders to return home were found in his jacket pocket. Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{then made}} their second substitution, {{bringing}} on Van Persie {{in place of}} Cesc Fàbregas. As the match entered injury time {{at the end of}} the second half, Ronaldo made yet another run down the left wing, outpacing Lauren to Rooney's through-ball. The ball broke back to Rooney 30 <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> goal, but his shot went over the bar. The second half finished with a Wes Brown cross from the right wing that made its way across the penalty area to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese could only head the ball straight at Lehmann.|$|E

5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few hundred <b>yards.</b> <b>From</b> the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|Bama scored {{first with}} field goals of 49 and 34 <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> Leigh Tiffin {{to take an}} early 6–0 lead. The Hokies responded with a 98-yard Dyrell Roberts kickoff return for a {{touchdown}} to give Tech a 7–6 lead. Following the recovery of a Ryan Williams fumble by Brian Selman deep in Hokie territory, the Tide retook the lead 9–7 on a 32-yard Tiffin field goal. Early in the second quarter, Antoine Hopkins intercepted a Greg McElroy pass. On the ensuing possession, Tech led 10–9 after a successful 28-yard Matt Waldron field goal. Alabama responded by driving 76 {{yards for a touchdown}} and a 16–10 lead, with the big plays coming on a 14-yard run by Mark Ingram, passes of 16 and 10 <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> McElroy to Julio Jones and the score coming on a 19-yard Roy Upchurch run. On the next Virginia Tech possession, three personal fouls and a pass interference penalty carried the Hokies downfield with Williams scoring on a one-yard touchdown run. The score remained 17–16 at the half after Tiffin missed a 36-yard field goal {{at the end of the}} second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Goodison Park {{is unique}} {{in the sense that}} a church, St Luke's, {{protrudes}} into the site between the Goodison Road Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand only <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> the corner flag. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church. The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.|$|E

5|$|Hemingway posted {{his first}} 100-yard {{reception}} game, first two-touchdown performance and a career-high five-reception {{effort in the}} September 5 season opener for the 2009 team against Western Michigan, during his third career start. He missed the following week's rivalry game against Notre Dame due to an ankle sprain. In November, he played through back problems. As a redshirt sophomore, he totaled 16 receptions and 268 total <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> scrimmage as a receiver. He {{also served as a}} punt returner making 10 returns for 86 yards.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} {{operating}} year, a stable {{was built for}} the lodge, at the lodge's south driveway about 100 <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> Scarborough Road. In 1909 an addition was built (of 62 by 126 feet) and the entire structure became used for an automobile garage. The interior of the old stable was replaced. The east end held a commercial kitchen, dining room, and a billiard and smoking room. The west end held a repair shop. The {{front of the building}} held supply rooms, closets, and an office. The upstairs held bedrooms and bathrooms for the chauffeurs.|$|E
5|$|Protesters {{began to}} gather outside Tottenham police station, {{a few hundred}} <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> Broadwater Farm, around 1:30am on Sunday morning, 6 October. Four of the station's windows were smashed, but the Jarrett family asked the crowd to disperse. Later that day, two police {{officers}} were attacked with bricks and paving stones at the Farm, and a police inspector was attacked in his car.|$|E

5|$|The reserve has free admission. It is {{maintained}} by London Wildlife Trust staff {{with the help}} of volunteers. There is a varied programme of activities including wildlife walks, fungus forays, open days and talks. The reserve is used regularly by school and community groups, and for team-building work days by corporate groups. Its entrance, with a wooden five-bar gate flanked by hedges, is on the south of Bollo Lane, a few <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> Chiswick Park tube station.|$|E
5|$|The winning goal {{came in the}} 107th minute. A {{clearance}} by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence found Dortmund midfielder Reinhard Libuda. Libuda shot 35 <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> goal on {{the right}} hand side of the pitch. The shot went over Lawrence and Liverpool defender Ron Yeats hit the post and rebounded off Yeats into the Liverpool goal to give Dortmund a 2–1 lead. The score remained the same throughout the remainder of extra-time and Dortmund became the first German team to win the Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E
5|$|A British Transport Police {{police station}} was based at Waterloo by the Victory Arch, with a custody suite of three cells. Although {{relatively}} cramped, {{until the late}} 1990s it served over 40 police officers. Following {{the closure of the}} Eurostar Terminal at Waterloo, the police station shut in February 2009, and the railway station is now policed from a new Inner London Police Station a few <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> Waterloo at Holmes Terrace. Until July 2010, the Neighbourhood Policing Team for Waterloo consisted of an inspector, a sergeant, two constables, special constables, and 13 police community support officers.|$|E

5|$|Alavés {{kicked off}} {{the second half of}} extra-time and within seconds, Babbel was booked for {{bringing}} down Alavés defender Delfí Geli 30 <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> goal. The resulting free-kick was put wide by Hermes Desio. Three minutes later, Liverpool had a chance to score, but Fowler could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross and the ball was subsequently cleared from the Alavés penalty area. In the 115th minute of the match, Alavés were reduced to nine men, when Antonio Karmona received a second yellow card for fouling Smicer. McAllister took the resulting free-kick, which was headed into his own goal by Geli. As a result of the golden goal, Liverpool had won the match 5–4 to win their third UEFA Cup and complete a Treble.|$|E
5|$|As he was {{preparing}} to begin post-graduate studies in orthodontics at Loyola University in Chicago, Cannon {{received a call from}} Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram. Stram signed Cannon to a one-year contract and he played in six games for the Chiefs in 1970, catching two touchdowns before a season-ending injury convinced him to retire. He ended his eleven-year professional career with 2,455 yards rushing, 3,656 receiving yards, and 64 touchdowns on offense. He also threw one touchdown pass and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon holds the NFL record for the most <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> scrimmage in a non-overtime game (330 against the New York Titans in 1961) and is tied with four other players for the most touchdown receptions by a running back in a season (nine in 1961).|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Van Buren led the NFL {{in rushing}} yards {{for the first}} time, and also {{led the league in}} scoring, <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> scrimmage, and kickoff return yards. He set an Eagles single-season record with fifteen rushing touchdowns, a mark that stood until 2011. His {{eighteen}} total touchdowns broke Don Hutson's league record by one, set three seasons earlier. He again had the longest kickoff return of the season, this time with a 98-yard return touchdown against the Giants. In that game he also rushed for 100 yards and two more touchdowns as he scored all of the Eagles' touchdowns in the 28–21 loss. At least six major publications named him a first-team All-Pro for the season, including the Associated Press and United Press.|$|E
