5|$|William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who was prime {{minister}} when Victoria {{came to the}} throne and a political mentor to the young queen, was forty years her senior, but is portrayed as a much <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> in the film. As for King Leopold, he was her favourite uncle whose advice she constantly sought; her interest in Albert was due not to the latter's success in wooing her, but simply to please Leopold.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when it was determined that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E

We compare <b>young</b> <b>men</b> from divorced families both with <b>young</b> <b>men</b> from intact families and with young women. Compared to <b>young</b> <b>men</b> from intact families, <b>young</b> <b>men</b> from divorced families {{tend to have more}} externalizing problems, including risky habits. Male children of divorced families enter into relations at an early age and usually are more sexually experienced compared with male children from intact families. However, <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in general and also <b>young</b> <b>men</b> after parental divorce postpone marriage and fatherhood compared with young women...|$|R

5|$|Following No Reservations, Zeta-Jones {{significantly}} decreased her workload in {{the next}} five years. She instead chose to focus on her family and health, having been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, and her infrequent acting appearances were in smaller-scale and less successful productions. She took on the role of a 40-year-old mother attracted to a <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> (Justin Bartha) in the romantic comedy The Rebound. The production was released theatrically in markets outside of the United States in 2009–10, but due to financial troubles of its distributor, The Film Development, the film failed to release theatrically in America.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{accession}} Chamberlain considered {{calling a}} general election, but with {{three and a}} half years remaining of the then current Parliament's term he decided to wait. At age 68, he was the second-eldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) to become Prime Minister for the first time, and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election, and then step down in favour of a <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.|$|E
5|$|Charles August was {{no great}} admirer of Joseph's. As a <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> he had sought {{the hand of}} Joseph's sister, Archduchess Maria Amalia. She had been quite content to take him, but Joseph and their mother insisted she marry instead the better-connected Duke of Parma. After this disappointment, Charles II August married Maria Amalia of Saxony in 1774; she was the {{daughter}} of the Elector Christian (d. 1765) and his wife Maria Antonia, Max Joseph's sister. In 1769, the reigning Saxon elector, Frederick Augustus III, had married Charles August's sister. Charles August, sometimes called duc de Deux-Ponts (a French translation of Zweibrücken, or two bridges), was a French client and could theoretically draw on French support for his claim. However, he had especially good relations with the Saxon Electors: both his mother- and brother-in-law wanted to ensure that Maria Amalia's husband received his rightful inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker was the {{favourite}} {{throughout the}} leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of a <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E

Shelly finds herself attracted to a <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> and J.T. becomes jealous realizing that he is in love with her. In the season finale, both men propose to Shelly. At the same time, Donovan's application for residency is rejected and the friends prepare for his return to England.|$|E
50|$|The prototypical {{story of}} the Holy Fool {{is that of the}} <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who asks to {{accompany}} the prophet Elijah.

40|$|Teenage {{pregnancy}} prevention programmes {{targeted at}} young women have received considerable attention from researchers and programme developers. However, to date, relatively limited {{information is available}} on preventing teenage fatherhood or improving outcomes for young fathers. A notable gap is concerned with understanding the forms of sexual health programmes that are most effective {{from the perspective of}} <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> We conducted a systematic mapping to identify studies involving <b>young</b> <b>men</b> aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy, improving outcomes for teenage fathers or exploring the perspectives of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> around pregnancy and fatherhood. We searched a wide range of electronic databases from January 1996 to August 2008. Three quantitative and 15 qualitative studies were identified, of which nine were UK based. Key themes related to the inappropriateness of current sexual health promotion to respond to the needs of <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> While <b>young</b> <b>men</b> often possessed very similar ideals to young women, existing programmes were problematic when they negatively stereotyped <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and ineffectively addressed models of masculinity or the difficulties <b>young</b> <b>men</b> may have forming meaningful relationships. Further investigations are required on programme development for <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> particularly on sexual health promotion interventions for 'looked-after' <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and those from unstable childhoods...|$|R
2500|$|Levin {{describes}} {{the stages of}} the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and his dissociation from the love triangle. As the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> departs,the poet {{will have a chance}} to rekindle his love with the Dark Lady:"the fair <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is fulfilled in his marriage, creating the possibility, however remote, that the speaker, in the absence of his young rival, will be granted restorative sexual relations with the mistress". The question of who is being loved by whom within the love triangle is quite controversial. Levin states that the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and the poet are competing for the Dark Lady's affection. Sauer, on the other hand, claims that there is a connection between the love of the Dark lady for the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and the love of the poet for the Dark Lady and the <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> Sonnet 154 addresses the love that the poet has for this <b>young</b> <b>man</b> in which the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> becomes the Dark Lady's fixture of desire. Sauer states that the Dark Lady may have stolen this <b>young</b> <b>man</b> away from the poet as the [...] " [...] <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> or Lovely boy becomes the subject of desire for the Dark Lady, too, and the poet feels increasingly alienated as the Dark Lady 'steals' the Fair <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> from him". Levin on the other hands states that the poet feels that the Dark lady may have run off with the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and left him with his desire for her that is unfulfilled [...] "for the poet, the Dark Lady becomes the occasion for fiction making: she becomes the emblem of unchecked desire, passion, and frustration, but also a symbol of mystery".|$|R
5|$|Weyland is {{the billionaire}} founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Lindelof {{described}} him as having a massive ego and suffering from a god complex. Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and an hour to remove it. Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement {{the most difficult part}} of the role. Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a <b>younger</b> <b>man.</b> After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness {{towards the end of the}} play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E
