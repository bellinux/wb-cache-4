500|$|Yorke has {{described}} Hail to the Thief variously as expressing [...] "a general {{fear of the}} future, that it's being jeopardised, that it's difficult to do very much about, because things have been set in motion that seem unstoppable"; [...] "frustration and powerlessness and anger, and the huge gap between the people that put themselves in control {{and the people that}} allegedly voted for them"; and [...] "the conflict between being incredibly angry and being so tired <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to give up." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually {{supposed to be a}} way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain. A bit exaggerated but that's what it feels like when you're so into someone".|$|E

500|$|In the episode, Homer and his {{children}} {{want to see the}} unveiling of a new Funtendo console called Zii Zu, which is a reference to Nintendo's Wii U console. As he and the children make their way through the crowded convention to get to the unveiling, the screen turns into a first-person shooter game through the eyes of Homer. He uses Frisbees and a fire extinguisher as weapons to get forward. According to Selman, the inspiration for this came from the fact that [...] "if you've been to E3, you know it's insane, it's super-crowded, it's super-loud, and walking through it feels like a video game, like a nightmarish first-person video game of bloggers and nerds. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to get the thing that you want to get to." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers can, you know, relate to it. And it's basically because <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to go out and have fun with your friends and sometimes, you know, go out dancing and let loose once in a while." ...|$|E
500|$|David Jeffries of Allmusic {{noted the}} song as a {{standout}} track from Ready.

Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice said, [...] "The calm, yearning song is a bona fide hit, and also {{the best example of}} where r lives today." [...] DJBooth said that there was [...] "no reason to doubt that this track will become a mainstream smash." [...] Shaheem Reid of MTV News said, [...] "It's not a record that will kill the clubs, but when <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to listen to superb lyricism and enthralling harmony, it's a must have." [...] Rolling Stone ranked the song seventeen on their list of [...] "Best 25 Songs of 2009" [...] list, and Spin ranked it the tenth best song of 2009 on their [...] "The 20 Best Songs of 2009" [...] list.|$|E

The actresses shared insight: [...] "Ruby {{just wants}} to get some {{security}} back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air"; whilst Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap" [...] The events impact Ruby's self-identity, leaving her feeling confused and her backstory succumb the distortion Charlie causes. Ruby starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now with everything?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?". Breeds {{said it was a}} [...] "big exploration" [...] and [...] "a journey" [...] for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from."

500|$|Wes Archer {{directed}} [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington", {{which was}} one of the first episodes to feature the Simpson family traveling to a real-life location. Because much of the episode takes place outside of Springfield, new background and character designs had to be animated. The Simpson family visits several real-life landmarks in Washington, which the animators were able to draw with the help of photographs from the animation studio's library. The Simpsons director David Silverman grew up in the Washington area so he was able to help out with the designs. Marge's voice actor, Julie Kavner, said she loved the charm of the family [...] "just being on a trip and experiencing the hotel room they're staying at, and the integrity of Bart's character. You know, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to kill him for doing all those tricks and pranks." [...] Jean believes this is one of the secrets of the show's success, the fact that it is about a family and the writers can use experiences from their own or their family's life as an inspiration in their writing. He thought [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] was a perfectly constructed episode in that sense.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} {{watching}} it left him [...] "reeling with turmoil and confusion, {{with feelings of}} sadness and despair," [...] and called it a [...] "thoroughly painful and depressing experience - but, it must be said, {{one that has been}} powerfully written, directed and acted." [...] He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that this [...] "slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely death," [...] is [...] "both quaint and devastating." [...] However, Desson Thomson of The Washington Post felt disappointed with the film that is [...] "ultimately flat on its surrealistic face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jacob's Ladder is so 'dark' it sucks Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it's hard to care whether the Orwellian image is a hallucination or not. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> out."

500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound.

[...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> it so bad for the kid.

500|$|IGN's Craig Harris {{awarded the}} game an Editor's Choice award, stating, [...] "This is an {{incredibly}} challenging, old-school throwback that might not set the genre afire with innovation, but in my book, it's better than the awesome game that inspired it. [...] Rare should be proud that its design is in the right hands. Or just insanely jealous. Either works." [...] Video game talk show Good Games two presenters gave the game a 9 and 8.5 out of 10, praising how true the music kept to {{the style of the}} original tracks, and that it managed to keep from becoming too complex while still avoiding being over-simplified, saying [...] "If you're a fan of the old Donkeys, or <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> a great platforming experience, this is worth {{at least as much as}} Kong's golden banana hoard." [...] X-Play praised the similarity of Returns to previous games in the series, the game's replay value, and its graphics, but the review criticized the motion controls [...] "that force you to react quickly at bad times, a button press would suffice" [...] and the co-op game play, saying, [...] "If your partner has a penchant for dying, look forward to some short games as he or she will most likely drain the number of lives you both share." [...] GamesRadar complimented the title for its standout levels and fan service, while criticizing it for levels that are [...] "frustrating, unclear and often misleading way that is unlike any prior Donkey Kong adventure", and motion controls that make them [...] "question the controls in a platformer". GameTrailers praised the game's gameplay and the diversity of the levels, while Giant Bomb claimed, [...] "Retro recaptures most of Donkey Kong's venerated platforming roots in this fine Wii sequel." ...|$|E
