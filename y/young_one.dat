5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it {{is still in the}} egg, because the young start {{communicating}} with each other before they are hatched. It has been shown that a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the <b>young,</b> <b>one</b> after another. Such early communication may help them to hatch simultaneously. Once it has broken out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.|$|E
5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and <b>young.</b> <b>One</b> member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E

5|$|Running {{parallel}} {{development with}} Fuse, and beginning began {{soon after the}} completion of Resistance 3, Insomniac Games began development of Sunset Overdrive. The game was inspired by Hyena Men of Kenya, Tank Girl, I Am Legend, The <b>Young</b> <b>One,</b> Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. Sunset Overdrive was created by Marcus Smith and Drew Murray; their first pitch to Insomniac's head was rejected as being too confusing. They were given one week to re-pitch the title, and they persuaded studio heads to begin the game's development. The game was later pitched to various publishers, which rejected them because Insomniac demanded to retain ownership of the IP. The project was later pitched to Microsoft Studios, which was eager to work with Insomniac. Microsoft allowed Insomniac to own the rights to the game. Sunset Overdrive was made exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox One console; it was released on the 20th anniversary of Insomniac, in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own <b>young.</b> <b>One</b> hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E

25|$|Hetton Lyon {{was built}} around 1851/52 {{for use in}} the Hetton {{colliery}} railway, but being of an old fashioned design it was initially assumed it to have been built earlier. It is thought to have been designed by someone named <b>Young,</b> <b>one</b> of whose descendants, David, is a Beamish volunteer working on steam restorations. Having survived into the 20th Century by virtue of being used as a static engine for the colliery sawmill, the locomotive was put back into service by the London and North Eastern Railway for the Stockton and Darlington Railway's centenary celebrations in 1925, before passing into the National Collection at the National Railway Museum as a static exhibit. The NRM loaned it to Beamish in 1974, where it stayed until 2006, initially in the Colliery but later in the Waggonway, before being moved to the NRM's satellite facility, National Railway Museum Shildon (Locomotion). The NRM later agreed a second loan period, so in May 2011 the locomotive returned to its last display location, in the SW corner of the Great Shed.|$|E
25|$|The {{unemployment}} benefit should be increased and {{limited to one}} year. In this period, people would {{have to look for}} a job or education. If {{at the end of the}} year one should not succeed in finding a job, the government will offer one a job for the minimum wage. In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working <b>young,</b> <b>one</b> is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members.

500|$|Prey is {{most often}} caught on the ground, though {{occasionally}} they take birds in flight. [...] Before striking, the kestrel characteristically bobs its head and tail, then makes a direct flight toward the prey to grab it in its talons. Much like the red-tailed hawk, American kestrels conserve energy in a hunt and pick their attacks with care as to position and odds of success. During the breeding season, the bird will carry large prey back to its mate or <b>young.</b> <b>One</b> study found that an American kestrel pair [...] "foraged in ways that minimized the costs of energy acquisition in its particular situation". For example, if the success rate for catching prey decreases significantly in a particular area, the bird will move to a different area.|$|E
500|$|... 2006 marked Young's {{breakout}} season. His ERA {{continued its}} downward trend, falling to 3.46 over 31 starts, {{good enough for}} sixth best in the National League, and he recorded a career-high 169 strikeouts. He finished with an 11–5 record, led all major league pitchers with a 2.41 road ERA, allowed a league-leading 6.72 hits per 9 innings pitched, and a [...]206 opponent batting average. During 2006 he led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 41. During the season, Young won a National League Pitcher of the Month award, took a no-hitter into the sixth inning or beyond three times, and extended his undefeated road start streak to 24 games. This streak made <b>Young</b> <b>one</b> of only three pitchers in major league history to have gone at least 23 straight road starts without a loss; Allie Reynolds set the record at 25 straight road starts spanning the 1948 and 1949 seasons, with Russ Meyer falling one short, going undefeated in 24 straight road contests spanning the 1953 and 1954 seasons.|$|E
500|$|His {{failure to}} enter {{primaries}} did not greatly disadvantage Willkie because most were [...] "beauty contests" [...] serving only to show voter preferences {{and not to}} elect delegates. [...] The primaries were governed by {{a complex set of}} unwritten rules about who would enter which primary and Taft ran only in his native Ohio, where Dewey did not enter his name. Most delegates pledged to support a candidate were not strongly committed: what was important to most Republicans was to field a nominee who could beat Roosevelt. [...] The run-up to the June convention in Philadelphia coincided with Hitler's advance in Western Europe, and delegates had second thoughts about running an isolationist, let alone a <b>young</b> <b>one</b> without national experience such as Dewey. Willkie, who had spoken out against isolationism, and who was a successful executive, was an attractive possibility. [...] Willkie made speeches widely, including in a tour of New England that paid off with promises of support, though delegates might first support a favorite son candidate for a ballot or two. Important converts to Willkie's cause included Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen and Massachusetts Governor Leverett Saltonstall. The move to Willkie was reflected in polls; he went from 3 to 29 percent in the seven weeks before the convention, while Dewey, the frontrunner, fell from 67 to 47 percent.|$|E

500|$|Bastard was Somerset's leading wicket-taker {{again in}} 1885, {{claiming}} 25 wickets. In his first {{match for the}} county that summer, he recorded his second ten-wicket match. Facing Hampshire in Taunton, Bastard claimed eight wickets in the first innings, and a further three in the second as Somerset recorded their only win of the year. His next match for the county was also against Hampshire, this time in Southampton. Somerset could only field nine men in the fixture, and after batting first reached 117. In the Hampshire response, a contemporary match report recorded that Bastard [...] "did a capital performance in the first innings of Hants, taking eight of the ten wickets {{at a cost of}} only 59 runs". Despite his performance, Hampshire passed Somerset's total and had a first innings lead of 45 runs. Somerset scored 166 in their second innings, leaving Hampshire requiring 122 to win. Bastard bowled 27 overs in the second innings, but failed to add to his wicket tally, and Hampshire won the match by eight wickets. Bastard's performances during 1885 saw him selected in two games for the Gentlemen during the Scarborough Festival. The team was a <b>young</b> <b>one,</b> as well as three of his Oxford team-mates from that season, Page, Kingsmill Key and Tim O'Brien, {{there were a number of}} players from the Cambridge team chosen.

[...] Although the film won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival for its treatment of racial discrimination, the US critics were so hostile upon its release that Buñuel was later to say that, [...] "a Harlem newspaper even wrote that I should be hung upside down from a lamppost on Fifth Avenue….I made this film with love, but it never had a chance."
