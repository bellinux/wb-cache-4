5|$|If <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> {{to people}} who perform a Burrakatha, {{you will see a}} huge {{difference}} in the way the older generation performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it... This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E
5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Valdobrev was {{approached}} by director Stefan Komandarev to compose the music for his feature directorial debut, Dog's Home. Valdobrev composed both the film score and the words and music for six songs, performed {{by some of the}} most prominent contemporary alternative rock bands. The released Original Soundtrack was actually the first ever released Bulgarian movie soundtrack. It {{turned out to be a}} great success. The pilot single Is it me, or is it not? performed by Stefan Valdobrev and featuring his friend and colleague Arabel Karajan became one of the film songs classics. The film’s score earned Valdobrev the Golden Rose for a film debut at the 2000 National Film Awards ceremony. Two years later Komandarev and Valdobrev teamed up again in Komandarev’s second documentary film Alphabet of Hope. Their collaboration resumed with the director’s 2009 hit The World Is Big and Salvation Lurks Around the Corner, based on the best-selling novel by the German author Ilija Trojanow and featuring Miki Manojlovic in the lead role. Both the film and the soundtrack were very successful. The film received numerous international awards and nominations, reaching the Oscars' Foreign Language Films' Shortlist. During the same period Valdobrev started to span his work on mainly European projects. Since 2008 he has provided the music for fiction and documentaries like the Czech films Kulicky (2008), Killing the Czech Way (2010) and Love in the Grave (2012), the Norwegian Can <b>You</b> <b>Talk?</b> (2011) and the Slovenian State of Shock (2011). In 2013 he started to create the score for the Bulgarian National Television series The Ungiven, a somber drama that tells the story of the saving of 48,000 Bulgarian Jews in the years of the Second World War.|$|E

500|$|The {{race was}} close, and Milk lost by fewer than 4,000votes.

You shouldn't leave your audience on a down."

Sobre-Denton and Simonis discussed the documentary's use for communication studies students studying university-level intercultural relations. Their research incorporated interviews with Steve Anderson, students and data from graduate-level classes in language and culture. Sobre-Denton and Simonis' conclusions correlated taboo words with social forms of power, rebelliousness, professionalism and gender roles.|$|E

During halftime, the team honored the 1963 Bears, two days following the death of running back Rick Casares, who was the team's leading rusher until Walter Payton surpassed him. When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, [...] "Oh my God, I think when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to my fellow teammates over here, what was all right, true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares. Nobody loved the game more than him." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, because everyone involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and they all want to push the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one.

500|$|Several of Rivera's colleagues credit {{him with}} popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers. Fellow closer Jason Isringhausen, who adopted the pitch {{later in his}} career, said, [...] "I think he's been an {{influence}} on everybody that throws it. Everybody saw what [...] could do, basically with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, but now, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about {{the evolution of the}} cutter—just ask hitters about it and they tell you everybody's throwing one. And they hate it." [...] Al Leiter, whose signature pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen's sentiments: [...] "Now, everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled at what he did with one pitch." ...|$|E
500|$|An on- and {{off-road}} {{version of}} the Super Cub, what today would be classed as a dual-sport motorcycle but called a trail bike at the time, the CA100T Trail 50, came out in 1961. Jack McCormack, the first national sales manager of American Honda Motor Company, said the Trail 50, {{and even more so}} the later Honda CB77, was the result of Honda's willingness to listen to and respond customer demand. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about Japanese manufacturers, their strength (besides the quality of their equipment) was that they listened to the marketplace. People always suggest that it was about Japanese management, but, to be frank, I was never impressed with Japanese management. They did what no other motorcycle make did—they listened." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} her {{perspective on}} her music, Chana identified it as [...] "trop-electro-hip-pop". She followed this up by explaining: [...] "The definition of pop has become looser, more inclusive.

[...] She said {{that she wanted to}} make the material both easily accessible, as well as artistic, clarifying that she never set out to make music as experimental as that of Björk. She experimented with Caribbean music after developing an interest in it while studying African-American dance and music in the Dominican Republic. When asked about how her music is received, Chana responded that various Latin communities responded to it differently as they had different definitions of mainstream and underground music.|$|E

500|$|Breyfogle's {{characterization}} of Anarky has shifted on occasion, {{with him at}} times referring to Anarky as a villain, {{and at other times}} as a hero. In his 1998 introductory essay composed for , Breyfogle characterized Anarky as not being a villain, but rather a [...] "misunderstood hero", and continued [...] "he's a philosophical action hero, an Aristotle in tights, rising above mere 'crime-fighter' status into the realm of incisive social commentary." [...] A year later, Breyfogle conceded that Anarky was [...] "technically" [...] a villain, but insisted [...] "I don't consider him a villain..." [...] Breyfogle later reconsidered the character in more ambiguous terms for a 2005 interview: [...] "Anarky isn't a villain, he's his own character. He's definitely not a superhero, although it depends on who <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to." ...|$|E
500|$|Leto {{personally}} {{interviewed the}} band's fans, termed as the Echelon, who shared {{stories about the}} importance of music in their lives, some personal struggles and their own dreams. In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and if you ask the right questions, you get interesting answers." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 season, {{political}} {{discussions were}} {{common in the}} Maryland locker room because of the presidential election. Turner and fellow quarterback Jordan Steffy, a conservative and supporter of presidential candidate Senator John McCain, were the most frequent debaters, while defensive tackle Dean Muhtadi was described as the primary instigator. During the summer of 2009, Turner held an internship on Capitol Hill working for Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer, the House Majority Leader and Maryland's fifth district congressman. Turner had previously considered volunteering for the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, which he said probably annoyed his conservative father, John Turner. Describing his experience during the internship, Turner said, [...] "It's funny to compare how serious politics is and how serious football is.
