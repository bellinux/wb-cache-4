50|$|Modern large wind {{turbines}} are typically actively controlled {{to face the}} wind direction measured by a wind vane situated {{on the back of}} the nacelle. By minimizing the <b>yaw</b> <b>angle</b> (the misalignment between wind and turbine pointing direction), the power output is maximized and non-symmetrical loads minimized. However, since the wind direction varies quickly the turbine will not strictly follow the direction and will have a small <b>yaw</b> <b>angle</b> on average.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{mechanism}} of Dutch roll occurrence {{is a moment}} of yawing motion which can be caused by any number of factors. As a swept-wing aircraft yaws (to the right, for instance), the left wing becomes less-swept than the right wing in reference to the relative wind. Because of this, the left wing develops more lift than the right wing causing the aircraft to roll to the right. This motion continues until the <b>yaw</b> <b>angle</b> of the aircraft reaches the point where the vertical stabilizer effectively becomes a wind vane and reverses the yawing motion. As the aircraft yaws back to the left, the right wing then becomes less swept than the left resulting in the right wing developing more lift than the left. The aircraft then rolls to the left as the <b>yaw</b> <b>angle</b> again reaches the point where the aircraft wind-vanes back the other direction and the whole process repeats itself. The average duration of a Dutch roll half-cycle is 2 to 3 seconds.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{numerical}} simulations {{are conducted}} {{to investigate the}} effects of bowed outlet guide vanes (OGVs) on endwall heat transfer and aerodynamic performance. Both on- and off-design conditions are studied. For bowed vanes, the bowed angle varies from 10 degrees to 40 degrees and the normalized bowed height ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 3. Results are included for Nusselt number distributions on the endwall, the energy losses, the <b>yaw</b> <b>angles,</b> and near-wall flow structures.

Results showed the Delayed DES (DDES) approach produced the highest correlation to experimental results. Ballast heights of 0 m, 0. 3 m and 0. 75 m were simulated and compared to existing experimental results.

Generally, crosswinds increased pressures upon the windward side of the train and decreased them upon the leeward side.

Thus, the face pose estimation problem is cast as a two-view rotation estimation problem.
