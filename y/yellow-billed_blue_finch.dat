50|$|The blue finch or <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>blue</b> <b>finch</b> (Porphyrospiza caerulescens) is {{a species}} of small bird. Although it was long {{classified}} in the bunting and American sparrow family Emberizidae, or the cardinal family Cardinalidae, more recent molecular studies have shown it fits comfortably in the Thraupini tribe within the family Thraupidae. It is assigned to the monotypic genus Porphyrospiza.|$|E

50|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>blue</b> magpie or gold-billed magpie (Urocissa flavirostris) is a {{passerine}} bird in {{the crow}} and jay family, Corvidae. It forms a superspecies with the Taiwan blue magpie and the red-billed blue magpie. The species ranges across the northern parts of the Indian Subcontinent including the lower Himalayas, with a disjunct population in Vietnam.|$|R
5000|$|The Taiwan blue magpie was {{collected}} by Robert Swinhoe and described by John Gould. Swinhoe {{called it the}} [...] "Long-tailed Mountain-Nymph". The Taiwan blue magpie is sometimes placed in the genus Cissa. It forms a superspecies with the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>blue</b> magpie (Urocissa flavirostris) and the red-billed blue magpie (Urocissa erythroryncha). The species is monotypic.|$|R

50|$|The Baleia State Park holds diverse {{natural environments}} {{due to its}} rugged topography, and its varied rocks and soils.It holds alpine meadows, cerrado and a small area of gallery forest.The park {{provides}} a refuge for several endangered species of birds and animals.188 species of birds have been catalogued, of which 11 are endangered and three are endemic to the Baleia Forest.The three endemic birds species, considered endangered in other regions, are white-rumped tanager (Cypsnagra hirundinacea), <b>blue</b> <b>finch</b> (Porphyrospiza caerulescens) and swallow-tailed cotinga (Phibalura flavirostris).There are small mammals such as possums, armadillos, monkeys, coatis and ferrets.|$|R

50|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>blue</b> magpie {{is found}} {{throughout}} the Himalayas from Hazara to the Brahmaputra. It {{is divided into two}} races. Of these, U. f. cucullata is the better known and is found from the Western boundary of the range to Western Nepal, being a common species about most of the hill stations of the Western Himalayas, breeding in a zone from 1500 to 3000 m. The typical form is found from Eastern Nepal eastwards and differs in that the under parts have a darker lilac tinge; its zone is slightly higher than that of the Western form, as it seldom occurs as low as 1830 m. A resident species, but during the winter months it usually deserts the higher parts of its summer zone. From Simla eastwards, the closely allied red-billed blue magpie (Urocissa erythroryncha) is often found in the same areas as the yellow-billed species; it is particularly common about Mussoorie, Tehri-Garhwal, -Kumaon, and in Nepal, and may be easily distinguished by its red beak and the greater extent of the white nape-patch.|$|R

5|$|Native trumpeter (Cygnus buccinator) and tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and {{non-native}} mute swans (Cygnus olor) may all {{be found}} on the lake in winter. Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest, however, the non-native, Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non-migrating trumpeter swan population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes. Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, <b>blue</b> jays, <b>finches,</b> orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory Canada geese, and an occasional bald eagle.|$|R
50|$|Bernard is the {{terminus}} {{and division}} {{point for the}} 98 Yonge and 99 Yonge routes and on weekday and Sunday, additional Viva <b>Blue</b> service to <b>Finch</b> Bus Terminal also originates here. Regular Viva service, operating between Newmarket Bus Terminal and Finch Bus Terminal, stops on Yonge Street beside the terminal. Similarly the 83 Trench route has its stop {{on the south side}} of Bernard Avenue, north of the terminal.|$|R
5000|$|The Tittifers are CGI {{enhanced}} tropical {{birds with}} their own unique songs. There are four small <b>blue</b> tittifers (long-tailed <b>finches),</b> three larger pink ones (hoopoes), two big green ones (white-cheeked turacos) and one Channel-billed toucan with a huge purple beak. They usually sing between segments, and when they sing together, near the end, {{it is time to}} sleep. They, along with Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy, Makka Pakka, the Tombliboos and the Pontipines were first featured in the episode [...] "Makka Pakka Washes Faces".|$|R
50|$|In 2006, former Queensland great Mal Meninga {{took the}} helm of coach {{and he took a}} big risk in Game One to have 7 debutantes against a {{formidable}} New South Wales side. This showed in the opening 30 minutes where mistakes were made and New South Wales dominated on the scoreboard. A comeback in the second half wasn't enough to win, New South Wales getting home 17-16 {{on the back of a}} field goal in the final moments by halfback and last minute <b>Blues</b> replacement Brett <b>Finch.</b> This put coach Meninga and captain Darren Lockyer under intense criticism by New South Wales media. The second game however saw the fired up Queensland team defeat New South Wales easily 30-6. In the third and deciding game, Queensland found themselves down 14-4 with 9 minutes to go after some controversial refereeing decisions. However a miraculous comeback started by Johnathan Thurston and Brent Tate and an intercept try by Lockyer saw them steal the win and the series.|$|R
