She plotted to kidnap Allegra from the convent and asked Shelley to forge a letter of {{permission}} from Byron. Shelley refused her request. Byron's seemingly callous treatment of the child was further vilified when Allegra died there at age five from a fever some scholars identify as typhus and others speculate was a malarial-type fever. Clairmont held Byron entirely responsible {{for the loss of}} their daughter and hated him {{for the rest of her}} life. Shelley's death followed only two months later.|$|E

The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovčarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan monks. Andrić soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perčinlić and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andrić lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andrić's mother soon came to see her son, and offered to serve as a housekeeper for the parish priest. [...] "Mother is very happy," [...] Andrić wrote. [...] "It has been three whole <b>years</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> saw me. And she can't grasp all that has happened to me in that time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2010, Robyn {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with Swedish magazine [...] that she would release three albums during 2010. She noted that it had been five <b>years</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> released her last effort, Robyn (2005), and that she had not been in the studio [...] "properly" [...] since then. She explained that {{she did not want to}} wait until all the songs had been recorded; she rather wanted to split up the songs in three different releases. She chose to name the trilogy Body Talk after a gay club in London that a friend of hers owns, commenting that the title [...] "tickles [...] imagination". In June 2010, the first in the trilogy, Body Talk Pt. 1, was released, and was quickly followed by the announcement of Body Talk Pt. 2. The album's lead single, [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and the track [...] "Indestructible", were among the first songs to be recorded for the trilogy. Robyn said that [...] "we saved them for later because I knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and I wanted them to get that chance." [...] "Hang with Me" [...] was originally recorded in 2002, by Klas Åhlund's then-wife, Paola Bruna, for her album Stockcity Girl.|$|E
500|$|Now two <b>years</b> <b>since</b> <b>she</b> {{signed the}} deal, Lavigne, {{who was then}} unknown, came to the {{attention}} of the three-piece production team The Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: [...] "Why don't you put her together with The Matrix for a couple of days?" [...] According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained [...] "a Faith Hill kind of vibe". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, The Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, [...] "we cottoned on that she wasn't happy but couldn't quite figure out where to go". The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because it was those kind of songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. Lavigne played The Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds in the likes of the rock band System of a Down. Fortunately, prior to forming The Matrix, its members' early projects were in the pop-rock type, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew exactly what to do with her. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into [...] "Complicated" [...] and another song called [...] "Falling Down" [...] (Falling Down appears on the Sweet Home Alabama Soundtrack). They played it to Lavigne when she came back the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.|$|E

Her last few films were mostly comedies: Les Novices (1970), Boulevard du Rhum (1971) (with Lino Ventura). The Legend of Frenchie King (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with Claudia Cardinale. She made one more with Vadim, Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked [...] "Underneath what people call [...] "the Bardot myth" [...] was something interesting, {{even though she}} was never considered the most professional actress in the world.

She was left out of Australia's fourth match, against England, but returned for the last two qualifying matches. She took 2/18 against India before making six not out as the winning runs were scored against the hosts. In the final, she made 21 as Australia scored 214 and defeated the hosts by 109 runs.
