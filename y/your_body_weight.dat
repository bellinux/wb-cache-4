On the command ‘get set,’ assume the front-leaning rest position by placing your hands {{where they are}} comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. When viewed from the side, your body should form a generally straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. On the command ‘go,’ begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering your entire body as a single unit until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, {{return to the starting}} position by raising your entire body until your arms are fully extended. Your body must remain rigid in a generally straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of repetitions you have completed correctly. If you fail to keep your body generally straight, to lower your whole body until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count, and the scorer will repeat the number of the last correctly performed repetition. If you fail to perform the first ten push-ups correctly, the scorer will tell you to go to your knees and will explain to you what your mistakes are. You will then be sent to the end of the line to be retested. After the first 10 push-ups have been performed and counted, however, no restarts are allowed. The test will continue, and any incorrectly performed push-ups will not be counted. An altered, front-leaning rest position is the only authorized rest position. That is, you may sag in the middle or flex your back. When flexing your back, you may bend your knees, but not to such an extent that you are supporting most of <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> with your legs.

5000|$|A {{need was}} {{experienced}} by avid 4x4 enthusiasts and overland travelers {{for a simple}} tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of a wheel, in cases where a tire requires repairs to the inside. On ATV's, as well as motorcycles, passenger vehicles, trucks, many industrial and offroad vehicles, as well as light aircraft have an additional feature on the rim called the Bead Retainer. The bead retainer is a bump like feature that prevents the tire bead from slipping inward on the rim and losing the air seal. On ATV's (and UTV's/side-by-sides) this bead retainer is substantially large because these tires are often run at very low air pressures (~5 psi) and experience severe side loading forces from typical trail riding. The large bead retainer is necessary to prevent unintentional dislocation of the tire bead from the bead seat. Further, if a ATV tire does lose pressure from a puncture, the large bead retainer will keep the Tire in place for low speed riding allowing the operator to navigate to the trail head without the tire coming completely off of the rim. The large bead retainers of ATV's do {{such a good job}} keeping the tire in place during operating conditions, it also prevents the tire from being easily changed with normal tools even in a shop setting.There are three categories of tire bead breaker designs: 1) [...] "Shoe and Lever mechanism", 2) [...] "Plier-type mechanism", 3) [...] "Clamp and Ram mechanism". The Shoe and Lever mechanism performs well on many motorcycle tires, passenger vehicle tires and trailers, however with more difficult-to-change tires it often fails {{because of the nature of}} the design. The shoe pushes down on the tire sidewall next to the tire bead, and if the bead is stuck, the shoe will simply slide down the sidewall. [...] Further the Shoe and Lever mechanism is quite large, and is not a good portable solution for on-the-trail tire changes. Advantages are typically low cost, often less than $50, and can be found manufactured by many companies. The Plier-Type tool has a spike that pushes in between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and can actually put a separating force on the bead bundle. However the pivot point results in a arc that quickly transitions to pushing on the sidewall. The Plier-type mechanism is more effective than the Shoe and Lever, however it has some disadvantages. It must be adjusted for different diameter wheels, it makes metal on metal contact with the rim, and can easily scratch and mar the surface of aluminum or painted wheels, it takes a bit of coordination and balance to use as you have to stand on the tire and use <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> to operate the tool, and it is also fairly large, but ultimately is portable and is often used at race tracks for pit-stop tire changes. Ultimately, this type of bead breaker also struggles to work reliably on very stubborn ATV tires, 4x4 trucks, and tractors. The cost of the Plier-type is variable, form $75 to $200, and is manufactured by multiple companies. Lastly, the Clamp-and-Ram mechanism tool [...] is by far the most effective and compact tool for breaking beads on ATV's and other difficult-to-change tires. The only company who makes a this style of ATV Bead Breaker is BeadBuster. This style of tool has a pointed foot that enters the space between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and it uses a padded clamp that is driven with a wrench to get pulled in all the way with very little user effort. The Ram foot then gets actuated by another bolt, with little effort by the user, and it completely breaks the bead loose in one motion. Because the tool is clamped in place, it cannot slide down the sidewall and damage the tire. The ram foot pushes directly on the steel bead bundle of the tire, and therefore works well on old and deteriorated tires. The Clamp and Ram tool (aka. [...] "BeadBuster") is extremely portable and easily fits in a tool box or glove compartment, and is priced at $99 up to $200 for a professional model.|$|E

40|$|The {{first step}} in {{relieving}} your back and neck pain is to understand the mechanics of your spine (or backbone). If you can determine where the pain is coming from, you are {{on your way to}} taking control and finding relief. Your spine extends from the base of your skull to the top of your sacrum (or tailbone) that connects to the top of your pelvis (to which your hips join). The 44 bones of your spine are called vertebrae (7 in neck or cervical, 12 in chest or thoracic, and 5 in lower back or lumbar). Between each hard vertebra are soft discs which are jelly-filled shock-absorbers that allow the spine to stay flexible and mobile, while also supporting <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> and the weight of anything you lift. Another important component of your back are the two facet joints behind that link each vertebra to the one above and the one below. Therefore your spine can be imagined as a long stack of bones (vertebrae) joined together at each level by 3 moveable joints (one disc in front and two facets behind) enabling the whole spine to bend forward, backward and side-to-side (see Figure 1). Because of the rigid rib cage, the thoracic spine moves relatively less than the lumbar and cervical spine, and therefore rarely has any mechanical problem compared to the lower back and neck. Your spinal cord lies within a continuous bony tunnel known as the spinal canal in the centre (betwee...|$|E

40|$|Introduction-Why Nutrition Matters Nutrition is {{important}} for everyone to maintain good health. After a spinal cord injury, nutrition can be even more important to improve overall wellness, achieve and maintain a healthy weight and help regulate bowel and bladder function. Eating a well balanced diet can help prevent the long term complications associated with SCI such as weight gain, deconditioning and skin breakdown. A well-balanced diet can provide all of the nutrients that <b>your</b> <b>body</b> needs. Foods high in fiber, along with plenty of water, help regulate bowel function. However, if you eat more than you need, you can gain weight. The goal of a balanced diet is to consume adequate calories to maintain a healthy weight while getting all the nutrients that <b>your</b> <b>body</b> needs. If <b>weight</b> control is a problem, {{you can learn to}} decrease your calorie intake without giving up important nutrients, such as protein. There are several nutrition classes offered at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital to SCI inpatients and their caregivers that review general nutritional needs in SCI. In addition, a registered dietitian is available at Magee to discuss individual nutritional needs. As an inpatient, you can ask your nurse or doctor to see the dietitian.

The use of electricity is such {{an integral part of}} our lives that we usually take it for granted, but if we don 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 t understand or choose to ignore the hazards associated with electricity, the results can be deadly. Why is electrical shock so dangerous? If the voltage (of a shock) is sufficient to drive electrical current through your body, just 10 milliamps of cur 2 (1000 milliamps = 1 amp) can cause muscles to contract and prevent you from releasing an energized wire or tool in your grip. As little as 30 milliamps of current can paralyze your breathing, and 75 milli 2 can cause your heart to stop pumping blood (ventricular fibrillation). As a comparison, a small bedroom night-light draws about 30 to 60 milliamps.

The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recently released recommendations for the development of Dietary Guidelines that convey these nine major messages: • Consume a variety of foods within and among the basic food groups while staying within energy needs. • Control calorie intake to manage body weight. • Be physically active every day. • Increase daily intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nonfat or low-fat milk and milk products. • Choose fats wisely for good health. • Choose carbohydrates wisely for good health. • Choose and prepare foods with little salt. • Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation if you do choose to drink. • Keep food safe to eat. What Is the Importance of Calcium? One to two percent of <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> is calcium. It is the most abundant mineral in the body. Ninety-nine percent of this calcium is in teeth and bones. The other 1 percent is found in blood, extra cellular fluids, and within cells of all tissues where it regulates key metabolic functions. Calcium is needed for growth and bone density, plus it keeps the heart pumping, muscles moving, and nerves communicating. Why the Concern with Calcium in the Diet? Low intake over a lifetime may lead to less dense bones or bone loss and increased risk of osteoporosis. The body stores calcium in bones till age 20, then through ages 20 to the early 30 s, the body reaches its peak bone mass. The USDA 1994 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) showed a 25 percent higher intake of calcium in males than females ages nine and over. Males consumed 925 milligrams to the women’s weak 657 milligram intake. The adequate intake (AI) for males and females is 1, 000 milligrams of calcium per day. Both groups are below the adequate recommendation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Obesity {{has become}} the most {{prevalent}} nutritional problem {{in the world and the}} United States has one of the highest rates. Research indicates that a quarter of children and more than half of adults classify as overweight with rates expected to soar. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of many diseases and health conditions and has been shown to reduce life expectancy particularly in younger ages. Some underlying causes include individual behaviors, environmental factors, and genetics. Overweight and obesity are a result of energy imbalance over a long period of time. Research has shown that eating a variety of foods, including plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products is crucial to maintaining a healthy weight. Body mass index (BMI) is an approximate measure of body fat based on height and weight. Many people are concerned about their overall weight, but what matters most is how much of <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> is fat. Knowing what a healthy BMI is can help an individual set a realistic and appropriate weight goal. BMI is an inexpensive and easy-to perform method of screening for weight categories that may lead to health problems. Hypothesis: The researchers 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis was that the more knowledge a person has of nutrition and exercise, the more likely they are to have a healthy body mass index. Methods: The main instrument used for this study was a questionnaire created by the primary investigators. The questions did· not come from a previously published questionnaire. The questions addressed basic knowledge of nutrition and exercise. The questions were multiple choice with only one right answer. Participants (N= 88) spent an average often minutes completing the survey and having their height and weight measured.

40|$|<b>Body</b> <b>weight</b> {{stability}} may imply active regulation {{towards a}} certain physiological condition, a <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> setpoint.

Until now, a <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> setpoint has remained elusive and the setpoint theory did not provide practical clues for <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> reduction interventions. For this an alternative theoretical model is necessary, which is available as the settling point model. The settling point model postulates that there is little active regulation towards a predefined <b>body</b> <b>weight,</b> but that <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> settles based on the resultant of a number of contributors, represented by the individual’s genetic predisposition, in interaction with environmental and socioeconomic factors, such as diet and lifestyle.
