In the British market, The Times Literary Supplement also characterised McNeile as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.|$|E

500|$|According to critic Stephen Holden, art pop often {{refers to}} any pop style which {{deliberately}} aspires {{to the formal}} values of classical music and poetry, though these works are often marketed by commercial interests rather than respected cultural institutions. Writers for The Independent and the Financial Times have noted the attempts of art pop music to distance its audiences from the public at large. The Independents Nick Coleman wrote: [...] "Art-pop is partly about attitude and style; but it's essentially about art. It is, if <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> <b>a</b> way of making pure formalism socially acceptable in a pop context.|$|E

500|$|... "Mother's Day" [...] {{has been}} the subject of several {{retrospective}} reviews of the series. Philip Lewis of Arts.Mic praised the episode as an example of Nickelodeon's potential to cover a serious subject, noting its treatment of [...] "the loss of a parent" [...] as one of the series' most memorable moments. Moviepilot's Kristy Anderson wrote that the development of Chuckie's backstory was a surprise as [...] "ew would have expected to be confronted by the topic of death while watching a cartoon about babies". In their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim, authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin echoed Anderson's sentiment, commenting that the episode could [...] "hit <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> truck if you let it".|$|E
500|$|David L.G. Arnold {{comments}} in the book Leaving Springfield that the episode is a satire on [...] "society's lazy, uninformed attitude about the electoral process", as well as [...] "a comment on the role in society of a cadre of elites (the Republican party) who see themselves as naturally suited to lead". The episode also portrays Republicans as willing {{to break the law}} in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob's line: [...] "Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> king. That's why I did this: to protect you from yourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|... "No Better" [...] is an electropop and trip hop ballad with hip hop elements. The song has {{a similar}} {{sonority}} {{to that of other}} songs from Pure Heroine, featuring Lorde's [...] "feathery" [...] vocals and minimal production. It incorporates [...] "woozy" [...] basslines, and [...] "pulsing" [...] synthesisers in its instrumentation, making the song's melody [...] "dreamy", according to Whitney Phaneuf of HitFix. Lyrically, the song features Lorde [...] " [...] an infatuation that deepens as the seasons change". At the first verse, she sings [...] "We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers / And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lover". During the chorus the bass beat becomes more intense as Lorde sings [...] "Go all the way / Have your fun, have it all".|$|E

[...] "Today Has Been OK" [...] played while Shepherd (Dempsey) was consoling Bailey (Wilson) about O'Malley (Knight)'s death, in the elevator. This song was originally played in the season two episode [...] "Into <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Train", when Bailey was consoling Shepherd. This {{is the only time}} the series has reused a song. [...] "Goodbye" [...] is the second hour of the season six premiere. It was the first premiere not to feature Knight's character, O'Malley. Knight was released from his contract at the conclusion of season five, following a disagreement with series creator Shonda Rhimes over lack of screen time for his character. When asked to make a 'flashback' appearance in season six, Knight declined.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Harlan {{claimed that}} no other {{director}} would touch the project and that he himself had tried to decline the role of director. The filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, in her 1987 memoir, confirmed that Harlan had told her of Goebbels's insistence that he direct the film and of his ardent desire {{to get out of}} the project. Harlan had even written to Goebbels volunteering for military service in order to avoid making the film. Goebbels' responded to this by informing Harlan that, if he enlisted, he would do his military service at the front. According to Harlan, Goebbels screamed at him, [...] "I can crush <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bug on the wall!" [...] When Harlan asked Riefenstahl to intercede for him with Goebbels, she demurred citing her own conflicts with the propaganda minister. Instead of intervening on his behalf, Riefenstahl advised Harlan to move to Switzerland; however, Harlan expressed fear for his life and the impact it would have on his wife.|$|E

500|$|The reviews {{have stood}} the test of time and the season still remains a huge {{critical}} favorite.

500|$|In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown {{described}} Gilmour's guitar {{style as}} [...] "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures." [...] According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on [...] "Money", [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] "cut through the mix like {{a laser beam}} through fog." [...] Brown described the [...] "Time" [...] solo as [...] "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." [...] Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: [...] "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting... singing sustain... you need to play loud — {{at or near the}} feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play... when bent notes slice right through <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> razor blade." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics.

[...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lightning bolt." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] is a {{complimentary}} love song that contains [...] "curse" [...] words and a repetitive chorus. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song has a simple message evident in the lyrics, [...] "At {{the end of the}} day you are who you are and I love you that way." [...] Maz Halima of Flavour Magazine described the track as a [...] "serene song". [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] contains the line [...] "And you my lover / But I love <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> brother" [...] which, according to Popdust's Exton, is reminiscent of actress Angelina Jolie and her brother James Haven at the Oscars. Exton further explained that the song is full with vague descriptions of Rihanna's feelings, which result as [...] "hollow" [...] declaration that she is never going away. While singing the lines [...] "Middle of the Day / Give Me What I want / It feels so special / It feels so good" [...] she admits [...] "liking afternoon delights".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for Billboard, Jason Lipshutz {{described}} [...] "Artpop" [...] as Gaga's manifesto about her creativity, {{calling it a}} [...] "lurching electro-jazz beast" [...] who's beats became louder and complex as it reached climax. Consisting of strings, the techno song has a beat similar to Selena Gomez's 2011 single [...] "Love <b>You</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Love Song" [...] with its electronic composition, and a groove comparable to singer Kylie Minogue's 2001 hit single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head". Interspersed between are computerized musical sounds and the chorus, which has a coo-ing accompanied with the main vocals, like Michael Jackson, and was described by Kevin Harley from The Independent as [...] "sleek Eurodisco". [...] "Artpop"s lyrics have been deduced to be a statement about [...] "the subjectivity of art". It begins with the singer uttering the lines [...] "Come to me with all your subtext of fantasy", the line being an indicative of enigma around her, according to The Huffington Post. Gaga explained the lyrics were a metaphor about love with the chorus line [...] "We could belong together, Artpop". She believed that if her fans and herself could be together, that would probably mean a bonding for art and pop too. On the contrary, Jim Farber from New York Daily News believed that the love relationship was sidelined for that between art and pop with the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|... "Glassheart" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a dubstep, dance, house and grime song that runs for 3:56 (three minutes, 56 seconds). According to Jenna Hally Rubenstein for MTV Buzzworthy, the song consists of a [...] "grimy, hazy beat", which she compared to [...] "Too Close" [...] (The Lateness of the Hour, 2011), a song performed by Alex Clare. Lyrically, the song is about Lewis' fear that her lover will break her heart. According to Lewis, the song is about protecting yourself, your heart, as well as your emotions. She continued to describe the song as [...] "poignant". The singer went on to reveal that she decided to name the album after the song. Lewis' [...] "crisp" [...] vocals can be heard above the instrumentation as she [...] "croons about the fragility of her heart" [...] as she performs the chorus lines [...] "So baby if you love me/ Let me know/ 'Cause everything hurts just like before/ You're about to tear this heart apart/ I love <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> glass heart." [...] The chorus is built on a [...] "transcendent house beat" [...] as Lewis delicately sings the lines [...] "Promise that we'll never fall apart/ And I'll love you with my Glassheart". The chorus is then followed by a [...] "euphoric instrumentation [...] collapses into a grimy dubstep break." [...] Rubenstein likened the lyrics to those performed by Blondie on her song [...] "Heart of Glass" [...] (Parallel Lines, 1978).|$|E
