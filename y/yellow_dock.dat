5000|$|In the 1914 season, on {{the morning}} of Saturday, August 29, between 500 and 600 pickers {{departed}} from O.C.T.C’s Taylor Street dock for the hops fields in the Willamette Valley. [...] The day before, Grahamona had carried 300 pickers, and both vessels had been “thronged” during that week. [...] According to a newspaper report: The <b>Yellow</b> Stack <b>dock</b> resembled a big storage warehouse for household goods yesterday, as every sort of camp equipment, all sizes and shapes of baggage rolls and many kinds of personal belongings were piled there to be trucked aboard steamers last night to accompany the pickers.|$|R

Here we report the complete genome of B 5 T and genes associated with alkane degradation. Alcanivorax dieseloleiB 5 T(MCCC 1 A 00001 TDSM 16502 T CGMCC 1. 3690 T) was first isolated from oil-contaminated surface water of the Bohai Sea at the <b>Yellow</b> River <b>dock</b> {{at the side of}} the Shengli oilfield in November 2001 (5).

The area is colonised with common reed, reed sweet-grass and the more open areas support marsh-marigold, <b>yellow</b> water-lily, water <b>dock</b> and gipsywort. Meadowsweet and great willowherb flourish. There is also common valerian, purple-loosestrife, common marsh-bedstraw, yellow iris, ragged robin and marsh woundwort. Woodland flowers such as primrose, bluebell, yellow {{archangel}} and bugle thrive in a small wood near the tunnel entrance and under the towpath hedgerows.

50|$|In Western herbalism, {{the root}} {{is often used}} for {{treating}} anemia, due to its high level of iron. It can be powdered and given in capsules, often in combination with stinging nettle - Urtica dioica. This is a classic combination with the plant. Both the leaves and root may be laxative in some individuals, though not in all, and generally it is mild. This {{is due to the}} presence of anthroquinone glycosides, and is not an action that should be relied upon, but seen as a possible effect of the plant when taken. The plant may also cause intestinal discomfort to some people. The plant will help with skin conditions if taken internally or applied externally to things like itching, scrofula, and sores. Some studies show that certain anthroquinones can help stop or slow cancer growth, but this may or may not apply to the ones in <b>yellow</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{emphasize}} {{the effect of}} R. crispus and L. barbarum 6 % aqueous extract on blood sugar level in Alloxan induced diabetes in rats. The rats were divided in five groups: one non-diabetic control and four experimental groups with induced diabetes mellitus after 40 mg/kg b. w. intravenous administration of 2 % Alloxan. One group was kept as diabetic control {{and in the other}} three groups was administered 6 % aqueous extracts of R. crispus, L. barbarum or a combination of the extracts during seven weeks. The better results were obtained in case of L. barbatum (goji) extract administration followed by the R. crispus (<b>yellow</b> <b>dock)</b> extract.

5000|$|Peltz ordered {{another attack}} for the 23/24 February, after the {{perceived}} concentrated (and successful) attack the previous night. I./KG 6 sent to 10 crews of the 130 (German sources say 161) and were {{to begin their}} attack at 22:00. I./KG 66 were ordered to mark the target area with white flares which were set to burst at 10,000 ft above the cloud layer. All the formations except III./KG 6, which was flying from Belgium, were routed via Evreux and Le Havre, north to High Wycombe where four red flares would mark a turn to the south east across London. This time the target codename [...] "Hamburg", which placed {{the centre of the}} attack {{in the vicinity of the}} Isle of Dogs. The target area suggests that the intention was to inflict economic losses by striking at London's <b>docks.</b> <b>Yellow</b> flares marked the bombing run at 11,000 ft, and the run-in would be conducting at an altitude of 13,000 ft; reduced down to 3,500 ft once the city was cleared.|$|R
