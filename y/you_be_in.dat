500|$|Frank Arthur [...] "Bones" [...] Jenner (surname often misspelled Genor; 2 November 1903– 8 May 1977) was an Australian evangelist. His {{signature}} {{approach to}} evangelism {{was to ask}} people on George Street, Sydney, [...] "If you died within 24 hours, where would <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] Born and raised in England, he contracted African trypanosomiasis {{at the age of}} twelve and suffered from narcolepsy {{for the rest of his}} life. After some time, he joined the Royal Navy, but deserted in New York and joined the United States Navy. When he was 24, he deserted again while in Australia. He subsequently worked for the Royal Australian Navy until he bought his way out in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Out of {{gratitude}} to God for giving him salvation, Jenner committed to consistently engaging in personal evangelism, and aimed {{to talk with}} ten different people every day thenceforward. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson's disease, Jenner engaged in this form of evangelism. He probably spoke with more than 100,000 people in total, hundreds of whom made initial professions of commitment to Christianity. He kept religious tracts in his shirt pocket where he had previously kept his rabbit's foot, and he often gave these tracts to people he met. He also kept a card in his pocket with Philippians 4:13 on {{it in order to}} give himself courage in evangelising. This verse reads, [...] "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." [...] While engaging in these activities, Jenner would normally wear a white shirt, black shoes, and trousers, and sometimes a navy greatcoat. Usually evangelising on George Street, Sydney, Jenner asked many people the same question: [...] "If you died within 24 hours, where would <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] If they were willing to engage in conversation with him, he would invite them either to his home or to a local church. The question became known as [...] "the Frank Jenner question". Jenner was most active in evangelism during World War II. On Saturday nights during the war, Jenner would invite groups of sailors to his home for a service consisting of some hymns and a short sermon.|$|E

2500|$|Rav's disciples told Rabbi Abba that Rav {{interpreted}} {{the words of}} [...] "Blessed shall <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the city," [...] to mean that your house would be near a synagogue. Rav {{interpreted the}} words, [...] "and blessed shall <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the field," [...] to mean that your property would be near the city. Rav interpreted the words of [...] "Blessed shall you be when you come in," [...] to mean {{that you would not}} find your wife in doubt of being a niddah upon returning home from travels. And Rav interpreted the words, [...] "and blessed shall you be when you go out," [...] to mean that your children would be like you. Rabbi Abba replied that Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words of [...] "Blessed shall <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the city," [...] to mean that the privy, not the synagogue, would be near at hand. Rabbi Johanan's interpretation was in accordance with his opinion that one receives reward for walking (some distance) to a synagogue. Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words, [...] "And blessed shall <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the field," [...] to mean that your estate would be divided into three equal portions of cereals, olives, and vines.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Isaac {{interpreted}} {{the words of}} [...] "Blessed shall <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the city," [...] to mean that God will reward people for the commandments that they fulfil in the city — the dough offering ( [...] , challah), the fringes ( [...] , tzitzit), the sukkah, and the kindling of Shabbat candles. And the continuation of [...] “And blessed shall <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the field,” means that God will reward for the precepts people fulfil in the field — the gleanings in the field that belong to the poor (leket), the forgotten sheaf in the field that belongs to the poor (shikhah), and {{the corner of the}} field left unreaped for the poor ( [...] , peah), And the Rabbis interpreted [...] to mean that people will feel blessed in the city because they have been blessed through the field, the earth having yielded its fruits.|$|E
