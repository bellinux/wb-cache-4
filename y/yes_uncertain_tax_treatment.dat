50|$|The only tax {{circular}} specifically {{addressing the}} PRC income <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of income derived by QFIIs from the holding and trading of Chinese securities is Guo Shui Han (2009) No.47 ("Circular 47") {{issued by the}} State Administration of Taxation ("SAT") on 23 January 2009. The circular addresses the withholding <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of dividends and interest received by QFIIs from PRC resident companies, however, circular 47 is silent on the treatment of capital gains derived by QFIIs on the trading of A-shares. It is generally accepted that Circular 47 is intentionally silent on capital gains and possible indication that SAT is considering but still undecided on whether to grant tax exemption or other concessionary treatment to capital gains derived by QFIIs. Nevertheless, {{it is noted that}} there have been cases where QFIIs withdraw capital from China after paying 10% withholding tax on gains derived through share trading over years on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This uncertainty has caused significant problems for those investment managers investing in A-Shares. Guo Shui Han (2009) No. 698 ("Circular 698") was issued on 10 December 2009 addressing the PRC corporate income <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> on the transfer of PRC equity interest by non-PRC tax resident enterprises directly or indirectly, however has not resolved the <b>uncertain</b> <b>tax</b> position with regards A-Shares. With respect to Circular 698 itself, there are views that it is not consistent with the Enterprise Income Tax Law as well as double taxation treaties signed by the Chinese government. The validity of the Circular is controversial, especially in light of recent developments in the international arena, such as the TPG case in Australia and Vodafone case in India.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This {{dissertation}} provides {{insights into}} the impact of differential taxation of financial assets on household portfolio decisions. To address endogeneity of household marginal tax rates, it exploits the structural tax rate changes created by the Bush-era tax acts in 2001 and 2003. In the first chapter, Taxation and Household Asset Location and Allocation: Evidence from the Bush Tax Acts, examines the effects of different <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> across different financial assets on household asset location and allocation decisions in taxable and tax-deferred accounts. The empirical results, based on the Survey of Consumer Finances data, indicate that households with greater tax rate differentials between interest and capital gains hold significantly lower shares of bonds in taxable accounts and greater shares of bonds in tax-deferred accounts by "risk-preserving" portfolio changes. These households also hold significantly more shares of stocks in their taxable portfolio. The second chapter, Dividend Taxation and Households' Dividend Portfolio Decisions: Evidence from the 2003 Bush Tax Act, examines how the different <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> across different types of financial income affect households' portfolio decisions. The empirical results, based on the Public Use Tax File, suggest that households in the upper tax bracket hold significantly greater shares of qualified dividends in their dividend income, whereas the preferential <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> and 60 -day holding period required of qualified dividends significantly hamper households' capital gains realization in the short run. However, the significant effect of the preferential <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of long-term capital gains over dividends on households' income composition disappears after the 2003 tax act. The third chapter, Effects of <b>Uncertain</b> <b>Tax</b> Rates on Households' Financial Decisions: Evidence from the Bush Tax Acts, investigates how tax rate uncertainty affects households' demand for dividend yields. During 2008 − 2010, persistent political debates and the late enactment of the tax cut extension creates great uncertainty for high-income households regarding their future tax rates. Empirical results indicate that high-income households significantly lower their dividend yields {{during the period of}} uncertainty because they face the potential of increased tax disadvantages for dividends relative to capital gains...|$|R

However, we document a significant negative market reaction to subsequent news of a Senate inquiry into these disclosures consistent with investors revising their beliefs over the potential for additional tax costs.

40|$|Uncertainty {{about tax}} results is an ever-present {{obstacle}} to business transactions despite the extensive number of Internal Revenue Code sections and Treasury Regulations. Some insurance companies now provide an insurance product to protect taxpayers against adverse tax consequences from proposed transactions. Ironically, this new insurance product, labeled “tax insurance,” poses <b>uncertain</b> <b>tax</b> consequences itself This Article argues {{that if the}} adverse tax consequences arise (that is, the taxpayer has additional tax liability) and the insurance company is contractually required to cover that liability, the tax insurance proceeds are not includable in the insured’s gross income. As part of the reasoning that underlies this conclusion concerning tax insurance, the Article examines and develops a novel approach that provides a tax policy justification for excluding general liability insurance proceeds from the insured’s income. The Article concludes that the same justification also applies to exclude tax insurance proceeds from the insured’s gross income. The Article also examines whether the premiums paid for tax insurance coverage are deductible business expenses. Finally, the Article examines the appropriate <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> {{of other types of}} tax indemnity arrangements...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of IRA/ 401 (k) s on U. S. {{personal}} saving is examined using household survey data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. The {{results suggest that the}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of IRA/ 401 (k) s encouraged households to increase the share of assets held in the form of pension savings, at the expense of saving in the form of housing equity. Some evidence also was found to suggest that the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of pension savings similarly affected the flow of saving. In particular, the data appeared to reject the hypothesis that the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of IRA/ 401 (k) s increased total personal saving. ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{concessional}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> {{of long-term}} capital gains creates {{an incentive for}} long-term shareholders to sell rights rather than participate in rights issues of shares by Australian companies. To achieve consistent <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of rights issues, we derive adjustments {{that can be made}} to the cost base of shares in companies which have made rights issues. * Inconsistencies exist in the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of investors participating in rights issues of shares by Australian companies and this <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> contains an error of logic, whereas, these issues do not exist when rights are sold. The efficiency consequences of this inconsistent treatment arise because of the concessional <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of long-term capital gains. We derive an appropriate adjustment to the deemed purchase price of shares for capital gains tax calculations associated with rights issues, which prevents a rights issue from adversely affecting existing shareholder tax obligations.

40|$|In Europe, the {{preferential}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> {{of company}} cars implies that many employees receive a company car {{as part of}} their compensation package. In this paper, we consider a model in which wages and the decision whether or not to provide a company car are the result of direct negotiation between employer and employee. Using this framework, we theoretically and numerically study first- and second-best optimal tax policies on labour and transport markets, focusing {{on the role of the}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars. We show that higher labour taxes and a more favourable <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars raise the fraction employees that receives a company car; congestion and congestion tolls reduce it. More importantly, we find that earlier models that ignored the preferential <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars may have substantially underestimated optimal congestion tolls in Europe. The numerical illustration, calibrated using Belgian data, suggests that about one third of the optimal congestion toll is due to the current <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars. We further find that eliminating the preferential <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars is an imperfect [...] but easy to implement [...] substitute for currently unavailable congestion tolls: it yields about half the welfare gain attainable through optimal congestion taxes. Finally, the favourable <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of company cars justifies large public transport subsidies; the numerical results are consistent with zero public transport fares. ...|$|R

40|$|Frequent {{shifts in}} tax policy can {{increase}} uncertainty about future net-of-tax wages and interest income. This paper measures {{the impact of}} <b>uncertain</b> <b>tax</b> policy on savings, labor supply, and welfare in the United States. A vector autoregression model with six variables was estimated which found the standard error of the one-year-ahead forecast for the wage tax to be 1. 8 percentage points, and for the interest income tax 3. 3 percentage points. Furthermore, the negative correlation between unanticipated shifts in the real interest rate {{and changes in the}} interest income tax amplifies the variability in the real after-tax return. A two-period model of consumption and labor supply is developed that measures the effect of <b>uncertain</b> <b>taxes</b> on savings, work hours, and taxpayer welfare. Using plausible empirical parameters, it is shown that removing all uncertainty about future tax policy can lead to a welfare gain of 0. 4 percent of national income, or about 12 billion dollars in 1985. ...|$|R
