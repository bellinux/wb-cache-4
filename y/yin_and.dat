5|$|Taoism draws its cosmological {{foundations}} {{from the}} School of Naturalists (in {{the form of}} its main elements – <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang and the Five Phases), which developed during the Warring States period (4th to 3rd centuries BC).|$|E
5|$|Chinese astrology has a close {{relation}} with Chinese philosophy (theory {{of the three}} harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang, the Five phases, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, and shichen (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to political astrology, the observation of unusual phenomena, identification of portents and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.|$|E
5|$|Taoist temples in {{southern}} China and Taiwan may often {{be identified by}} their roofs, which feature dragons and phoenixes made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also stand for the harmony of <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang (with the phoenix representing yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, {{as well as on}} the hairpin of a Celestial Master. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.|$|E

More recently as recorded in the 18th century, the Taoist master Liu Yiming continued to advocate this usage.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Chen {{returned to}} Shanghai. He joined the China Film No. 2 Studio that was newly {{established by the}} Nationalist government. He wrote and directed the film Far Away Love, whose premiere in Shanghai's Huanghou Theatre on 18 January 1947 was considered a landmark event in postwar Chinese cinema. The film starred prominent actors and actresses such as Zhao Dan, Qin Yi, and Wu <b>Yin,</b> <b>and</b> the Ministry of Defence put uniformed soldiers under Chen's command for the filming. It {{was the first in}} a series of controversial epics on the social turmoil caused by the war. In late 1947, he made another film Rhapsody of Happiness, written by Chen Baichen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness. The amalgamation of these ideas into a theological system involving earlier cosmological theories of <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang {{as well as the}} five phases (i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man) was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE). Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three of his original memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to Heaven, the main deities known as the Five Powers, and the spirits (shen 神) of mountains and rivers. It was believed that the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were linked by natural cycles of <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang and the five phases. If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts.|$|E
5|$|In ancient China, {{biological}} topics can {{be found}} dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and philosophers. The Taoist tradition of Chinese alchemy, for example, can be {{considered part of the}} life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the elixir of life). The system of classical Chinese medicine usually revolved around the theory of <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang, and the five phases. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to evolution, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.|$|E

5|$|Neo and Rebecca Leow co-wrote the script, {{which was}} {{completed}} in May 2005. I Not Stupid Too was produced by MediaCorp Raintree Pictures on a budget of S$1.5 million. Shanghai Film Studio had agreed to co-produce I Not Stupid Too with Raintree Pictures, but backed out because they found the film too liberal. The production crew included Daniel Yun as executive producer, Chan Pui <b>Yin</b> <b>and</b> Seah Saw Yan as producers, Ardy Lam as cinematographer and Mo Ju Li as sound editor. Besides writing and directing, Neo starred as Mr. Yeo and composed the theme song, which was sung by Hong Junyang.|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty was an age {{of great}} economic, technological, cultural, and social {{progress}} in China. Its society was governed by an emperor who shared power with an official bureaucracy and semi-feudal nobility. Its laws, customs, literature, and education were largely guided by the philosophy and ethical system of Confucianism, yet the influence of Legalism and Daoism (from the previous Zhou dynasty) could still be seen. Members of the scholarly-gentry class who aspired to hold public office were required to receive a Confucian-based education. A new synthetic ideology of Han Confucianism was created when the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE) united the Confucian canon allegedly edited by Kongzi, or Confucius (551479 BCE), with cosmological cycles of <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang and the Chinese five elements.|$|E
5|$|The I Ching uses {{a type of}} divination called cleromancy, which {{produces}} apparently random numbers. Six numbers between 6 and 9 are turned into a hexagram, which can then be looked up in the I Ching book, arranged in an order known as the King Wen sequence. The interpretation of the readings found in the I Ching {{is a matter of}} centuries of debate, and many commentators have used the book symbolically, often to provide guidance for moral decision making as informed by Taoism and Confucianism. The hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance and paralleled with many other traditional names for the processes of change such as <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang and Wu Xing.|$|E

In addition to writing and directing, Neo also penned {{the lyrics to}} the theme song, which was sung by Koh Mei Xian and composed by Li Yi. Filming {{took place in the}} rural outskirts of Kuala Lumpur during November and December 2002. The cast endured a rigorous schedule, including extensive travel times to the filming location and many running scenes. The child actors' school commitments made the planning of reshoots difficult; moreover, the production team decided to delay post-production work in Thailand due to the SARS outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese {{believed}} that three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were inextricably linked {{and subject to}} natural cycles; if man could understand these cycles, they could understand the hidden secrets of the three realms. One cycle was <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang, which corresponded to yielding and hard, shade and sunlight, feminine and masculine, and the Moon and Sun, respectively, while it was thought to govern the three realms and changing of seasons. The five phases was another important cycle where the elements of wood (mu 木), fire (huo 火), earth (tu 土), metal (jin 金), and water (shui 水) succeeded each other in rotation and each corresponded with certain traits of the three realms. For example, the five phases corresponded with other sets of five like the five organs (i.e. liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys) and five tastes (i.e. sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty), or even things like feelings, musical notes, colors, planets, calendars and time periods.|$|E
5|$|When {{dramatic}} plot developments made Sasuke {{one of the}} series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared him and Naruto to the <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang due {{to their}} notable differences and complementary natures. He has mentioned that when one progresses, he makes sure the other does as well. In 2013, as the series approached its climax, Kishimoto encouraged readers {{to look forward to}} Sasuke and Naruto's final fight. Since it started serialization, Kishimoto had planned that the series' ending would feature the final fight between the two characters, although he was not sure whether the characters would end the duel as friends or enemies. While the two use ninja techniques in the beginning, in the climax the author wanted both fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat. In the end, Kishimoto decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato, another former enemy. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E

5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang of the Tao.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of <b>yin</b> <b>and</b> yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E
