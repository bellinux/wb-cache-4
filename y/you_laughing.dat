500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the character}} from both professionals and fans has been positive. In his DVD review for DVD Verdict, Bill Treadway called Patrick [...] "the village idiot, who sometimes gives SpongeBob some really bad advice, {{but he is a}} loyal friend and that's something we don't see much of these days." [...] He said, [...] "Patrick is the definition of stupid and his antics will have <b>you</b> <b>laughing</b> out loud." [...] In a review published in 2007, Peter Keepnews of The New York Times said, [...] "Patrick is a popular character, and the new episodes illustrate why: He is unfailingly enthusiastic, touchingly loyal and absolutely undeterred by his intellectual limitations. Hilariously voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, he is not just an endearing comic creation but a role model for idiots everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{awarded the}} film a [...] "B+" [...] rating, praising it as a [...] "crazily funny and {{exciting}} {{tribute to the}} grimy glory days of 1970s exploitation films" [...] that [...] "will leave <b>you</b> <b>laughing,</b> gasping, thrilled at a movie that knows, at long last, how to put the bad back in badass." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a positive review, commenting that [...] "by stooping low without selling out, this babes-and-bullets tour de force gets you high on movies again." [...] Critic James Berardinelli also enjoyed the film but was not as positive as other critics. Awarding the film three stars (out of four), Berardinelli found the film to be [...] "cinema {{as an expression of}} pulp with attitude... are speaking from the hearts... but that doesn't mean everyone sitting in the theater will get it." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{wrote that}} [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is [...] "the most old-school work" [...] on Femme Fatale, with Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{considering}} the album's production [...] "polished, intriguing and – {{best of all}} – fun", exemplifying the piano breakdown in the song. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said he could [...] "completely hear this track blasting in a club, with Spears cooing 'I can be your treble' while the crowd screams back 'you can be my bass!'." [...] The Daily Collegians stated that the song is [...] "catchy", yet different from [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] and [...] "Hold It Against Me", and added that [...] "the combined star power of Spears and Will.i.am would have surely made it a radio hit." [...] The Independent journalist Andy Gill noted that the album sounds more programmed than natural, but said that the song [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound thought that the song [...] "might {{as well be a}} B-side to 'The Time (Dirty Bit)' (otherwise known as the most annoying Black Eyed Peas song ever created)." [...] Both Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic and About.com reviewer Bill Lamb selected it as a top song on Femme Fatale. Lamb further added that the song [...] "will leave <b>you</b> <b>laughing</b> as you sing along on the dance floor." ...|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film three-and-a-half stars (of four), and said: [...] "The movie is as funny, {{let it be}} said, as any comedy {{released}} this year ... <b>You</b> <b>laugh,</b> and then <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> at yourself for laughing." ...|$|R

500|$|Lagaan was {{met with}} high {{critical}} acclaim. The film currently scores a 95% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, [...] "Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals." [...] Derek Elley of Variety suggested that it [...] "could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets". Somni Sengupta of The New York Times, described it as [...] "a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines" [...] Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, [...] "Lagaan is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. Lagaan is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as [...] "a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling." [...] Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that [...] "Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have <b>you</b> <b>laughing</b> and crying, but leaving with a smile." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is [...] "an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it {{to the level of}} an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view." [...] Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that [...] "the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be." [...] The Times of India wrote, [...] "Lagaan has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping." [...] Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent, who wrote [...] "a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn a bit about India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Los Angeles Times {{film critic}} Michael Wilmington felt that Darkman {{was the only}} film at the time [...] "that {{successfully}} captures the graphic look, rhythm and style of the superhero books." [...] Terrence Rafferty of The New Yorker said, [...] "Raimi works from inside the cheerfully violent adolescent-male sensibility of superhero comics, {{as if there were}} no higher style for a filmmaker to aspire to, and the absence of condescension is refreshing." [...] USA Today gave the film three out of four stars. However, Richard Corliss in Time said that Raimi was not [...] "effective with actors" [...] and Peoples Ralph Novak called Darkman, a [...] "loud, sadistic, stupidly written, wretchedly acted film." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie is full of jaunty, Grand Guignol touches (the main gangster enjoys snapping and collecting fingers), but Raimi's images also have a spectral, kinetic beauty." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Joe Brown wrote, [...] "Though Raimi seems to be trying to restrain himself, his giddily sick sense of humor still pops out all over the place – Darkman is a frenetic funhouse ride that has <b>you</b> <b>laughing</b> and screaming at the same time." ...|$|E
