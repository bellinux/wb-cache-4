40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of exposure to everyday experiences of inequality. It finds that stigma and social inequality can increase stress and reduce well-being for LGB people,  even in the absence of major traumatic events such as hate crimes and discrimination. The study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, used qualitative analysis with 57 sexual minority men and women to identify aspects of stigma that are difficult to identify.  Subjects reported estrangement from families, failure to complete schooling, and isolation in the workplace. “Imagine living life anticipating exclusion from <b>your</b> <b>friends,</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> professional circles simply because of who you are and who you love – that resulting stress takes a toll on one’s life and health,” says co-author Dr. Ilan Meyer.  The research also found that, paradoxically, sexual minorities sometimes view stigma as having enhanced their lives and as having a defining impact on their identity. For example, LGB individuals who were forced to leave their hometowns found a more accepting community and new professional and personal opportunities in big cities that might not otherwise have been available to them...|$|R

That's fair and honourable!' Is that logic?" [...] demanded the captain, vehemently, [...] "It is not! In the first place it is mean to want, not to speak of accepting, another man's money without working for it, and it is a false pretence to say that you risk your own money because it is not your own, it is your wife's and your children's money, who are brought to poverty, mayhap, because of your betting tendencies, and it is your baker's and butcher's money, whose bread and meat you devour (as long as they'll let you) without paying for it, because of your betting tendencies, and a proportion of it belongs to your church, which you rob, and to the poor, whom you defraud, because of your betting tendencies; and if you say that when you win the case is altered, I reply, yes, it is altered for the worse, because, instead of bringing all this evil down on your own head you hurl it, not angrily, not desperately, but, worse, with fiendish indifference on the head of <b>your</b> <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> his innocent <b>family.</b> Yes, madam, although many men do not think it so, betting is a dishonourable thing, and I'm ashamed of having done it.
