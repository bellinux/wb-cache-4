25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when <b>you</b> <b>become</b> friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E
25|$|This {{has some}} {{interesting}} implications. For starters, Everett {{suggested that the}} universe is actually indeterminate as a whole. To see this, consider an observer measuring the spin of some particle, which previously is in an undetermined state (a superposition of possible spins). When you measure the spin, you may determine it to be up or down. But in fact, there has been a “splitting” of the universe into two states, one where you measure up, and the other where you measure down. Thus, the indeterminacy of the system simply grows and <b>you</b> <b>become</b> a part of it.|$|E

Production of the song was handled by new producer An Expresso, while the song was penned by Banks alone. The song contains an uncredited sample of The Notorious B.I.G.'s voice.

500|$|In 1870 he was {{appointed}} a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and retired from his government post. Crease was suspicious of both Confederation and responsible government, largely because they threatened greater government control over judges and central Canadian domination of patronage. Like many British Columbians, he was disappointed that London seemed to {{have given up on}} BC as an independent colony, abandoning either it to annexation to the United States or confederation with Canada. [...] "I believe that England is sick of her Colonies," [...] he wrote, [...] "and to be a Colonist, whatever your POSITION & CHARACTER when at Home – is to lose Caste the moment <b>you</b> <b>become</b> a bona fide settler." [...] Regardless of his opposition to Confederation, Crease was chosen to prepare for it as the chair of the Royal Commission for the Revision of Laws of BC.|$|E
500|$|Britten's fellow-composers had divided {{views about}} him. To Tippett he was [...] "simply the most musical person I have ever met", with an [...] "incredible" [...] {{technical}} mastery; some contemporaries, however, were less effusive. In Tippett's view Walton {{and others were}} convinced that Britten and Pears were leaders of a homosexual conspiracy in music, a belief Tippett dismisses as ridiculous, inspired by jealousy at Britten's postwar successes. Leonard Bernstein considered Britten [...] "a man {{at odds with the}} world", and said of his music: [...] "f you hear it, not just listen to it superficially, <b>you</b> <b>become</b> aware of something very dark". The tenor Robert Tear, who was closely associated with Britten {{in the latter part of}} the composer's career, made a similar point: [...] "There was a great, huge abyss in his soul... He got into the valley of the shadow of death and couldn't get out".|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things.

500|$|In {{the light}} of the {{physical}} demands of performing in theatre Paige has said [...] "Musical theatre is the hardest thing any actor will ever do. [...] <b>You</b> <b>become</b> obsessive about sleeping, eating the right food, not speaking and giving yourself vocal rest and keeping exercised". Regarding the pressure of having to be in a fit condition to perform in theatre each night, she remarked [...] "you wouldn't want to read the letters people write when you're off and they're disappointed – it's so awful, the guilt one feels for not being there". As part of a rigorous routine before musical roles to look after her voice, Paige stops eating dairy products and drinking alcohol and works hard on her fitness. After about three months into the production when her voice is tiring from performing, she withdraws from her normal social life, sometimes only communicating by notepad and fax. She never reads her reviews, finding that it is not helpful to hear too many opinions of her work.|$|E
500|$|... "Quick Sand" [...] is a {{shuffling}} rock {{song that}} addresses the plight of illegal immigrants to Arizona. It depicts six migrants travelling through extreme climates in the Sonoran Desert to reach Devil's Highway {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mexico – United States border. They journey from Tamaulipas and through the mountains along Devil's Highway. Partway into the journey, the migrants are abandoned by their coyote guide and subsequently lose one another one by one. They experience thirst, hunger, injury, and fear, culminating with the only two surviving migrants being turned away by a vigilante at the border. Cooder said of the route's background and the narrative in an interview, [...] "t's been a migrant trail for 200 years. People go out there and try to do it on foot, but if you make one mistake and go five minutes out of your way, <b>you</b> <b>become</b> disorientated and dehydrated. And they find these mummified bodies out there. The heat has just baked them through. And the people who live through it often refer to having a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe flying overhead. This is a very common vision when the dehydration sets in." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then <b>you</b> <b>become</b> what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} {{before he was}} executed, Bundy granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist {{and founder of the}} Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once <b>you</b> <b>become</b> addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry {{describes}} herself as a [...] "singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star" [...] and maintains that honest songwriting {{is very important to}} her. She told Marie Claire: [...] "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think <b>you</b> <b>become</b> more relatable when you're vulnerable." [...] Kristen Wiig commented that [...] "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [...] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [...] The New York Times labeled her [...] "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent [...] "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly <b>you</b> <b>become</b> institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E
