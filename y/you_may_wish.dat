Pauline Kael called the film [...] "one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies ever made – and {{when you leave the}} theatre <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> you could forget the whole horrible experience.... The film's grainy, banal {{seriousness}} works for it – gives it a crude realism". A Film Daily critic commented, [...] "This is a pearl of a horror picture that exhibits all the earmarks of a sleeper." [...] While Roger Ebert criticized the matinée screening, he admitted that he [...] "admires the movie itself". Critic Rex Reed wrote, [...] "If you want to see what turns a B movie into a classic [...] don't miss Night of the Living Dead. It is unthinkable for anyone seriously interested in horror movies not to see it." ...|$|E
