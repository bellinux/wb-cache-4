25|$|Twenty {{acres of}} fields around {{the centre of}} the hamlet of Little Langdale were {{designated}} a SSSI in 1989 as one of the only four remaining meadows of SSSI quality in South Cumbria. The habitat varies from floodplain near the Brathay to higher, dryer haymeadow with both being home {{to a wide variety of}} herb, grass and flower species. Grasses found in these meadows include sweet vernal-grass, wood-crane's-bill, common bent, crested dog's tail, red fescue, meadow fescue, <b>Yorkshire-fog,</b> smooth meadow-grass, rough meadow-grass, cock's-foot, soft brome and perennial rye-grass. Perhaps the rarest species found there is the globe-flower.|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the cliffs}} exhibits {{a complex of}} maritime and sub-maritime communities. The cliff slopes and tops are characterised by maritime grassland, heath and scrub communities with frequent species rich flushes, particularly on the north coast. The cliff faces support a maritime rock-crevice community with thrift Armeria maritima, rock samphire Crithmum maritimum, sea aster Aster tripolium and sea spleenwort Asplenium marinum as common components. On the shallow soils of rock ledges and outcrops, a maritime therophyte community occurs where typical species include:English stonecrop Sedum anglicum, thrift, buck's-horn plantain Plantago coronopus and kidney vetch Anthyllis vulneraria. The grassland communities of the cliff slopes are dominated by red fescue Festuca rubra which often forms a matressy sward, and <b>Yorkshire-fog</b> Holcus lanatus. Thrift, wild carrot Daucus carota, sea campion Silene maritima, sea plantain Plantago maritima and ox-eye daisy Leucanthemum vulgare are common. Where trampling occurs, or on thin soils, the grassland is characterised by buck's-horn plantain, ribwort plantain Plantago lanceolata, kidney vetch and spring squill Scilla verna. bluebell Hyacinthoides non-scripta is found in more sheltered areas and on upper slopes where it is typically associated with coarse grasses, mainly cock's-foot Dactylis glomerata and scrub communities.|$|E
5000|$|The site {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} example of a Thames valley hay meadow in Surrey. It contains a range of lime-loving (calcicole) plants which are characteristic of this type of meadow. The grassland is dominated by rough-stalked meadow grass Poa trivialis, crested dog’s-tail grass Cynosurus cristatus, and lesser knapweed Centaurea nigra. Yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, meadow-fescue grass Festuca pratensis, meadow barley Hordeum secalinum, smooth hawk’s-beard Crepis capillaris and common reed Phragmites australis are locally abundant, the last species being unusual in such dry situations. Other frequent species include meadow brome Bromus commutatus, a grass only recorded from one other Surrey location in recent years, meadow foxtail grass Alopecurus pratensis, <b>Yorkshire-fog</b> grass Holcus lanatus, pepper saxifrage Silaum silaus and meadow-sweet Filipendula ulmaria. Associated calcicole species include meadow cranesbill Geranium pratense, clustered bell-flower Campanula glomerata, cowslip Primula veris, hoary plantain Plantago media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor and lady’s bedstraw Galium verum.The meadow is surrounded by old hedgerows with a variety of species such as ash Fraxinus excelsior, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, field maple Acer campestre, spindle Euonymus europaeus, dogwood Cornus sanguinea, and buckthorn Rhamnus catharticus. A drainage ditch along two sides of the site supports five species of willow including purple willow Salix purpurea and almond willow Salix triandra. Common comfrey Symphytum officinale, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, cyperus sedge Carex pseudocyperus and the uncommon aquatic liverwort Riccia fluitans...along this ditch.
