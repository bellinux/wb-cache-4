Teitur continued to tour extensively in over 20 countries, building a firm following and respect amongst media and the musician community, {{despite the lack of}} commercial marketing by Universal Records.|$|E
25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E

Wednesday 13 admitted, [...] "First off, let me say this is a live recording. This is not a live recording where we went back into the studio and overdubbed guitar parts or vocals. This is us ...

500|$|Negative reviews {{revolved}} around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps {{they would have done}} better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek." [...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You know what this sounds like before <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?" [...] In its review of Absolute Garbage, Pitchfork called the song a [...] "predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Ronson, Mars wanted [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] to be {{the lead}} single, which he {{considered}} a [...] "brave" [...] choice. Aaron Bay-Schuck, Mars' A representative at the time, found the track's production to be cutting edge, although admitting {{that it was not}} an instant favorite. However, he perceived that [...] "it was something special" [...] but {{had no idea how to}} classify it. Bay-Schuck felt the song needed time to grow as [...] "the more <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it,</b> the more of an earworm it becomes", leading the promotional department to make sure that program directors weren't afraid of playing a track that [...] "sounded different from what was on the radio".|$|E

500|$|Despite being {{based on}} a New Orleans funk sample, the song belies a strong go-go influence. [...] Harrison likened the two based on their heavy use of {{percussion}} and chant. Amerie stated, [...] "You don't hear go-go outside of D.C. ... I was like, 'We {{have to do it}} in an up-tempo way because when <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> on the radio in D.C., it's fast.' ... So it's a fresh sound for everybody but people in the D.C./Maryland/Virginia area. They [...] know what it is." [...] The song is composed in the key of D # minor, moving at a tempo of 100 beats per minute in common time. [...] It uses four-measure phrases with a VIb-I-VIIb-VIb-IV chord progression. [...] The first four chords are played on the measure's downbeat, and off-beat syncopation is used for the fifth chord.|$|E
500|$|Britten's fellow-composers had divided {{views about}} him. To Tippett he was [...] "simply the most musical person I have ever met", with an [...] "incredible" [...] {{technical}} mastery; some contemporaries, however, were less effusive. In Tippett's view Walton {{and others were}} convinced that Britten and Pears were leaders of a homosexual conspiracy in music, a belief Tippett dismisses as ridiculous, inspired by jealousy at Britten's postwar successes. Leonard Bernstein considered Britten [...] "a man {{at odds with the}} world", and said of his music: [...] "f <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it,</b> not just listen to it superficially, you become aware of something very dark". The tenor Robert Tear, who was closely associated with Britten {{in the latter part of}} the composer's career, made a similar point: [...] "There was a great, huge abyss in his soul... He got into the valley of the shadow of death and couldn't get out".|$|E

500|$|Jay-Z {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that after he first heard the track's piano loops (which are sampled from [...] "Love on a Two-Way Street" [...] by The Moments), he immediately thought of Keys and wanted her to be featured on the song. Jay-Z said that Mary J. Blige was initially considered for Keys' part on [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] and admitted that he was [...] "two seconds away" [...] from asking Blige to appear on the record's chorus. His second choice for the track's vocals was Keys and that using Blige on the song would have been a safe move, but said that the combination of Keys' sound and piano talent had struck a chord with him. In December 2009 Hunte, who would not reveal many details, said the original version of [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] will one day be released, adding that [...] "The original is so powerful it's {{only a matter of time}} till <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> down the line".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Looking Glass' {{previous}} first-person games—Ultima Underworld, Ultima Underworld II and System Shock—Terra Nova {{takes place}} in outdoor environments. The game's engine, named TED, supports weather conditions, day and night environments, real-time water reflections and moving clouds, among other effects. Most of {{the work on the}} outdoor renderer was done by programmer Eric Twietmeyer; however, contemporary computers were not powerful enough to display fully three-dimensional (3D) outdoor environments. The problem was solved by programmer James Fleming: the game's engine renders and applies textures to foreground objects in full 3D graphics, but—according to PC Gamer US—it displays a [...] "bitmapped background in the distance" [...] to provide the [...] "illusion of detail". As with Flight Unlimited and the CD-ROM release of System Shock, Terra Nova was designed to support head-mounted displays. The game features QSound technology. Describing QSound's effect before the game's release, Suzanne Kantra Kirschner of Popular Science wrote that [...] "you'll hear the rustle of leaves from the right speaker a split second before <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> in the left signaling you that the enemy is approaching from the right".|$|E
500|$|DiCaprio's {{next film}} was The Great Gatsby, again with Baz Luhrmann (who {{directed}} him in Romeo + Juliet in 1996), {{an adaptation of}} F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, also starring Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire; the film was released on May 10, 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, however DiCaprio's portrayal as Jay Gatsby was praised. Critic Rafer Guzman of Newsday praised DiCaprio by stating, [...] "As for Leonardo DiCaprio, {{he is now the}} Gatsby to beat. Despite a borderline comedic entrance – haloed by fireworks and accompanied by Gershwin's [...] "Rhapsody in Blue"—DiCaprio nails this maddeningly enigmatic character. He's as tough as Alan Ladd in '49, as suave as Redford in '74, but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. <b>You</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> all in Gatsby's favorite phrase, [...] "old sport," [...] a verbal tic that stumped other actors. It's a tremendous, hard-won performance." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of Roger Ebert.com described his performance as Gatsby as [...] "The movie's greatest and simplest special effect," [...] and states [...] "This is an iconic performance — maybe his career best." [...] The film grossed $348 million worldwide and became Luhrmann's highest-grossing film.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Lawrence had met Hillenburg {{previously}} on Rocko's Modern Life. When {{working on}} the pilot episode of SpongeBob, Hillenburg invited him to audition {{for all of the}} characters. Since other voices had been found for the main cast already, Lawrence started out by voicing a variety of minor characters. This included Plankton, who was initially only set to appear in one episode. Mr. Lawrence recalls that Nickelodeon executives told Hillenburg, [...] "'we could stunt-cast this. You know, we could have Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve was just like, 'it's Doug , don't <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it?</b> This is the character! This is the guy!'" [...] Jill Talley, Tom Kenny's wife, voices Karen Plankton. Being a Chicago native, she uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Electronic sound effects are underlaid by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound whenever she speaks. Talley and Mr. Lawrence often improvise Plankton and Karen's dialogue. Lawrence called improvisation his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, [...] "I always enjoy the back-and-forth.

500|$|Rolling Stone {{listed the}} album as No.34 {{on their list}} of 50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time, saying it evoked [...] "a Middle Earth sunset, with the music {{wavering}} between medieval folk melodies and jazz-savvy musos". According to AllMusic reviewer Dave Thompson, the album is [...] "one of the most beloved, and eccentric prog albums of them all" [...] and [...] "probably Caravan's finest hour". He also said that [...] "Nine Feet Underground" [...] was [...] "the most for the dynamic chemistry that blended the band together" [...] and that [...] "Golf Girl" [...] "emerges {{as the kind of}} song that remains stuck in your head for days after <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it,</b> no matter how many more records you play immediately after". Progressive rock author Stephen Lambe has said that [...] "Nine Feet Underground" [...] is [...] "not just the archetypal Caravan piece but a symbol of a whole movement." [...] Marco Rossi, writing in Record Collector said [...] "Canterbury Scene initiates are strongly advised to start here." [...] In the Q and Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album came No. 19 in its list of [...] "40 Cosmic Rock Albums". Mojo also said In the Land of Grey and Pink was [...] "the quintessential Canterbury album".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} version of [...] "Grenade" [...] had an [...] "uptempo 1960's surf-style sound with jangle pop" [...] and before a live show in New York, Mars [...] "slowed and stripped it down". The reworked song {{was the last}} track added to the album. In an interview with Sound on Sound, engineer Ari Levine from The Smeezingtons, who carried out the recording and instrumentation on [...] "Grenade", explained that the song was original recorded with [...] "a more guitar‑based arrangement", 15bpm faster. According to Mars, the record was much happier. Mars ended up by playing the song live in showcase for the label and to several booking agents in a slower tempo. The singer and his bandmates rehearsed a lot to that show, yet [...] "Grenade" [...] "sounded terrible". Mars decided to do a [...] "stripped down" [...] version by playing the guitar, while Brody Brown played the piano. The single received praise from the label. The song was reproduced in the way <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> To do so, [...] The Smeezingtons completely rearranged and re‑recorded t, including the vocals, [...] "two days before the album {{was supposed to be}} handed in". Levine, added [...] "There was quite a bit of deadline stress involved in that." [...] Despite the time that Grenade took to produce, the writing was among the most difficult songs in album since it took several months to complete. Later, on April 21, 2012, the team said that the last line of the song was the conflict, since it took two months for them to come up with [...] "but you won't do the same".
