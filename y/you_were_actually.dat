You are responsible for the violence that has been done, whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have done so much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think they {{going to like it}} because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it." [...] He expressed.|$|E
2500|$|Harding {{is first}} {{recorded}} in May 1751 {{when he played}} for All-England v Kent at the Artillery Ground. [...] All-England won by 9 runs and Harding made a significant contribution. [...] Although he had been picked as a bowler, he and [...] "A N Other" [...] (an unnamed Chertsey player) opened All-England's second innings and scored 51 for the first wicket, which is like a double century partnership nowadays. [...] Harding apparently made 50 of these himself and had one hit {{out of the ground}} and against a house on Bunhill Row opposite. [...] He was given four for this mighty effort. [...] You could only score six if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> able to run that many and to do that you would need the help of overthrows.|$|E

'A {{singular}} world, I would say, sir,' pursued Mrs. Sparsit; after {{acknowledging the}} compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows, not altogether so mild in its expression as {{her voice was}} in its dulcet tones; 'as regards the intimacies we form at one time, with individuals we were quite ignorant of, at another.

6000|$|Circuses, Fourth of Julys, County Fairs, {{all took}} place in Osage, and to own a [...] "covered rig" [...] and to take your {{sweetheart}} to the show were the highest forms of affluence and joy--unless <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> able to live in town, as Burton and I now did for five days in each week, {{in which case you}} saw everything that was free and denied yourself everything but the circus.

'This is a thing I never learnt before; this person is really Sennacherib, sitting on his throne; and these with fluted beards and hair like plough- furrows, and fingers with no bones in them, are his warriors--really carved at the time, you know. Only just think that this is not {{imagined}} of Assyria, but done in Assyrian times by Assyrian hands.

You've no more idea what's {{going on in the}} world to-day than if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> dead. I never was bright like Mel Iden, but I'm no fool. I see and hear and I read. Girls aren't pieces of furniture to be handed out to some rich men. Girls are waking up. They can do things. They can be independent. And being independent doesn't mean a girl's not going to marry. For she can wait--wait for the right man--for love.... You say I dream. Well, why didn't you wake me up long ago--with the truth? I had my dreams about love and marriage. And I've learned that love and marriage are vastly different from what most mothers make them out to be, or let a girl think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "As you know, I was {{a believer}} then, {{and so was}} the Doctor. I need not say that I believe still more now that these men do wholly unaccountable feats. He put the sentry outside the walls of your prison and five out of your eight warders so sound asleep that they did not wake during the {{struggle}} I had with the others. That, of course, was mesmerism. His messages to <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> sent by means of his daughter. She was put in a sort of trance, in which she saw you and told us what you were doing, and communicated the message her father gave her to you. He could not send you a message nor tell me about you when you were first at Bithoor, because he said Rabda was not in sympathy with you, but after she had seen you and touched you and you had kissed her, she was able to do so. There does not appear to me to be anything beyond the powers of nature in that, though doubtless powers were called into play of which at present we know nothing. But we do know that minds act upon each other. Possibly certain persons in sympathy with each other may be able to act upon each other from a distance, especially when thrown into the sort of trance which is known as the clairvoyant state. I always used to look upon that as humbug, but I need hardly say I shall in future be ready to believe almost anything. He professes to have other and even greater powers than what we have seen. At any rate, he can have no motive in deceiving me when he has risked his life to help me. Do you know, Rabda offered to go into the prison--her father could have got her an order to pass in--and then to let you go out in her dress while she remained in your stead. I could not accept the sacrifice even to save you, and I was sure had I done so you yourself would have refused to leave." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a November 2006 {{interview}} for an Italian broadcast, Noel {{said that he}} wrote the song in 2001 while in Thailand. It was written whilst Liam Gallagher was recording vocals for [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out", during recording sessions for Heathen Chemistry, sometime in 2001, and was first mentioned in interviews by Noel in the Autumn of 2002. Noel told Tokyo's J-Wave radio station that it's about, [...] "A dream I had one night. It's wondering about if you were dead, {{how would you know}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> dead, how would you know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> alive. When you go to bed and you dream dreams... if you never woke up, how would you know? Maybe we're all just dreaming now." [...] In March 2003, he told Austrian TV show 'Arena' that, [...] "it doesn't sound like anything we've done before or anything I've ever written... in its lyrical content it's quite near to The Masterplan".|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, {{the band}} Barenaked Ladies {{released}} {{a number of}} tracks online in 2000 {{that appeared to be}} legitimate copies of tracks from the band's latest album.

5000|$|SaFranko notes one job in particular: “I {{worked the}} {{overnight}} shift in a brewery. It {{was a completely}} bizarre job.

The people who worked there were all insane. When the shift was over we'd {{go out to the}} bars and drink—at seven in the morning.”SaFranko blue-collar work ethic is reflected in his huge output of work.: “A hundred short stories, over fifty of them in print. A box full of poetry and essays. And ten complete novels, eight of them yet to hit the book shelves. A dozen plays, some produced in New York and others staged in Ireland.” In response, SaFranko claims: “Any sane person would have stopped. Highsmith once said: [...] "Art is an addiction. That's why there are so many bad artists." [...] I think there's a lot of truth in that….And as someone else said, what else is there to do?” ...|$|E

In the same interview Ludin said that Afghans would accept an end to Canada's combat mission but leaving entirely would baffle them. [...] "We would like to believe that you are really serious about success in Afghanistan, that this wasn't just an exercise for your military to get some experience on the battlefield. We would like to believe <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> there for us, which I believe is the case," [...] he said.
