It is why I come to you this day, an old man whose labour of strength is not worth a shilling a week, and ask of you twelve dollars to buy a jackass and a second-hand saddle and bridle. It is why twice ten fool men of us, under these monkey-pods half an hour ago, asked of you a dollar or two, or four or five, or ten or twelve. We are the careless ones of the careless days who will not plant the yam in season if our alii does not compel us, who will not think one day for ourselves, and who, when we age to worthlessness, know that our alii will think kow-kow into our bellies and a grass thatch over our heads.|$|E

'Old Mr. Weller,' {{returned}} Mr. Pickwick, 'is in {{no respect}} more altered than Sam, unless {{it be that}} he is a little more opinionated than he was formerly, and perhaps at times more talkative.
