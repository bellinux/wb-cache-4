25|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in Egypt, {{especially in the}} Nile Valley and the Delta region. Birds of prey include vultures, eagles, hawks, falcons and owls. Other large birds include storks, flamingoes, herons, egrets, pelicans, quail, sunbirds and golden orioles. About four hundred and eighty species of bird have been recorded, the globally endangered ones being the red-breasted goose, white-headed duck, Balearic shearwater, Egyptian vulture, Rüppell's vulture, sociable lapwing, slender-billed curlew, saker falcon and <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>bunting.</b> Egypt is on a major bird migratory route between Eurasia and East Africa and around two hundred species of migrants pass through twice a year.|$|E
2500|$|Each year, Beijing hosts 200-300 {{species of}} migratory birds {{including}} the common crane, black-headed gull, swan, mallard, common cuckoo and the endangered <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>bunting.</b> [...] In May 2016, Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu (Haidian), Hanshiqiao (Shunyi), Yeyahu (Yanqing) were tagged {{and have been}} traced to far as India, Kenya and Mozambique. [...] In the fall of 2016, the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month-long campaign {{to crack down on}} illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets. [...] Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia, Eurasian siskin, crested myna, coal tit and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>bunting</b> breeds in open scrubby {{areas that}} consist of dry water rice fields for {{foraging}} and reedbeds for roosting, often near water, and {{is present in}} Siberia. It lays four to six eggs in a nest on the ground. Its food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} show the {{population}} trend of forest and wetland summer visitors to Japan, field observations, literature surveys, and questionnaire surveys were conducted in 1995 - 1997. Field observations and literature surveys showed {{that the number of}} seven species of summer visitors drastically declined in some areas of Japan: Black Paradise Flycatchers Terpsiphone atricaudata, Ashy Minivets Pericrocotus divaricatus, <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Buntings</b> Emberiza aureola, Ruddy Kingfishers Halcyon coromanda, Brown Hawk Owls Ninox scutulata, Jungle Nightjars Caprimulgus indicus, and Porzana Crakes Porzana fusca. These seven species were the focus of questionnaires sent {{to the members of the}} Wild Bird Society of Japan. It was shown that all these species declined in many areas of Japan during the past 25 years, although the pattern of decline varied somewhat by species. Serious habitat destruction and deterioration did not occur in half of the study areas of six forest and grassland species. Longterm observation records showed that in many areas the number of species decreased in summer visitors but did not change or increased in residents. It seems that the population decline of summer visitors is mostly associated with habitat destruction in their wintering areas of Southeast Asia...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza aureola) is an Eurasian {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} bunting family (Emberizidae). The genus name Emberiza is from Old German Embritz, a bunting. The specific aureola is Latin for [...] "golden". The birds presents in {{the home}} {{is thought to be}} linked to [...] "happiness". The bird also has a call that's a distinctive zick, and the song is a clear tru-tru, tri-tri.|$|E
50|$|Until 2004, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature {{considered}} the <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>bunting</b> to be {{a species of}} least concern. In 2004, its status was changed to near threatened, and four years later it was uplisted again — to vulnerable — after new research has shown it to be rarer than had been believed. It is subject to heavy hunting pressure in China, through which most specimens pass during migration. In 2013, its assessment changed to endangered, and continues to decline.|$|E

50|$|About 740 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Laos. The only known endemic species is the bare-faced bulbul (Pycnonotus hualon). Globally endangered species {{that occur in the}} country include the white-winged duck (Cairina scutulata), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius), white-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni), giant ibis (Pseudibis gigantea), masked finfoot (Heliopais personatus), Nordmann's greenshank (Tringa guttifer), black-bellied tern (Sterna acuticauda), collared laughingthrush (Trochalopteron yersini) and <b>yellow-breasted</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza aureola), as well as four species of vulture; the red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis), Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and slender-billed vulture (Gyps tenuirostris).|$|E
5000|$|The {{decline of}} the <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>bunting</b> {{is likely to be}} from {{repeatedly}} trapping at migration, and most specifically winter sites. The birds habitat is disturbed, then caught in mist-nets. They are then cooked and sold as [...] "sparrows" [...] or [...] "rice birds". Even though the actions have been restricted to a small area in southern China, it has became more widespread and popular to increasing wealth, and hunters now travel long distances to find sufficient birds. The irrigation of rice production shift has reduced {{the quality and quantity of}} wintering habitats, including the loss of water stubble. And the loss of reedbeds has reduced the available roost site numbers.|$|E

40|$|With the {{involvement}} of the World Bank, Zoological Society of London, Dutch Government and National University of Mongolia, the volumes of Mongolian Red Lists of Fish, Amphibians and Reptiles, Birds and Mammals were completed, and Mongolia is now among the few nations that have up-to-date conservation assessments for all vertebrates. Of the 476 assessed native bird species of Mongolia, 10 % were categorized as regionally threatened including Near Threatened. A further 0. 6 % were categorized as Critically Endangered (CR), 1. 7 % as Endangered (EN), 3. 3 % as Vulnerable (VU), and 4. 4 % as Near Threatened (NT). Almost 90 % of Mongolian birds are categorized as Least Concern (LC) (excluding DD and NA). Just 30 species were categorized as Data Deficient (DD). A further 87 species were categorized as Not Applicable, as they did not meet the requirements for regional assessment. This result highlights the need for research on raptors in Mongolia. Of all passerines found in Mongolia, 82. 1 % are categorized as Least Concern. This shows that most of the passerines have not reached threat categories. The Tree Pipit, Reed Parrotbill, Saxaul Sparrow, White-throated Bushchat, Japanese Reed Bunting and <b>Yellow-breasted</b> <b>Bunting,</b> however, all fall within threat categories. A total of 36 species of bird are regionally threatened or Near Threatened in Mongolia. Of these, 2 species are categorized as Critically Endangered, 6 species as Endangered and 12 species as Vulnerable. Sixteen species are categorized as Near Threatened. High species richness of birds in Mongolia was recorded in the regions with forest steppe and river valleys. The species richness map shows a decreasing trend in the richness from north to south. High species richness for Mongolian birds was documented in the subdivisions of Mongol Daguur, Eastern Mongolian Plain (particularly Buir lake and the northeast), Ih Kyangan and Khangai mountain ranges, Great Lakes Depression and Huvsgul mountain range (Darkhad Depression). High species richness of birds also occurred in the protected areas of Numrug, Altan Els and Mongol Daguur Strictly Protected Areas, Onon-Balj, Khustai, Hugnukhaan, Otgontenger, Uvs, Khar-Us lake and Tsambagarav National Parks, and Toson Khulstai, Khar Yamaat, Ugtam, Bulgan, and Ikh Nart Nature Reserves. Data Deficient species’ richness was high in the regions of Khalkh river-Buir lake and Great Khyangan Mountain, Huvsgul Mountain Range, Great Lakes Depression including Uvs lake Depression, Baruunkhurai or Dzungaryn Gobi and basins of Ulz, Herlen, Orkhon and Selenge rivers. High species richness areas have contained high number of Data Deficient species. The areas with high species richness and a high number of Data Deficient species within Mongolia need field surveys conducting on population size and density, breeding ecology, and population threats. Using the IUCN Red List categories of dominant threats, we have compared the threats and potential threats to all species of birds in Mongolia. 38. 1 % of species are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, 13. 6 % by human disturbance, 11 % by pollution and 10. 7 % by changes in native species. All species of crane and pheasant are under significant threat of regional extinction. Bird conservation strategies and plans should focus on these threats. It is now imperative that the Red Lists for each vertebrate group, including the bird, be updated every five years so that trends in extinction risk can be measured through time...|$|E
