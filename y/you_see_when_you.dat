(What do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are not looking?) or {{subjects}} more episodical: Memories of a Train Journey, Thelonious Monk Architect, Afternoon in the Louvre or The Carpenters’ Design, Albert’s painting are {{not limited}} to a particular style. He likes to cite Chinese masters of the classical period, mentioned by Matisse who taught the student to identify with his subject: to paint the tree in its expansion, the rock in its rugged massiveness and mentions that the precept can be also found in General semantics by Alfred Korzybski: [...] "To be efficient, a language should be similar in its structure to the structure of the event it is supposed to represent". This idea that an artwork should be autonomous — epoch and even author's identity, taking second place — has provoked vigorous discussions with artists friends, notably with painter Joan Mitchell.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the camera}} moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, {{revealed}} to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been [...] "absorbed" [...] into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right {{at the center of the}} central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.|$|E

6000|$|... "I saw the man," [...] he said,--"the prisoner. I {{was outside}} the Duomo with Lorenzo Tornabuoni when he ran in. He had escaped from a French soldier. Did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am sorry, for we {{have made}} friends, haven't we? It won't matter to you who will find plenty of people down there at the Cape, but <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are gone I shall have no friend left in this wilderness, shall I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> got {{to talking}} about the funeral, I just got all full {{of the idea of}} our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Bob; but <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{get to be}} rich you needn't live in {{the same}} way, at all. You could live as some traders do, in the country at Hampstead, Dulwich, or Chelsea, and ride in to business; and you can, of course, marry and enjoy life. One needn't live like a hermit, all alone, because one is a trader in the city." ...|$|E

I've been talking to such a {{delightful}} person--just the type <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go into the City--thousands of them, all in such good black coats.

"I wouldn't {{do it if}} you didn't like it, dear John; but {{you know}} that chapter that Master Williams read us, the other day, about the ravens that fed {{somebody}} in a cave, and we have been wishing the ravens would feed us; and so <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> sent us the milk last night, I thought you ought to be called the Raven.

60|$|The Euganean Hills, on one {{of which}} the poet's house is built, are those mellow heights which <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> look {{southwest}} across the lagoon at Venice. In misty weather they are blue, and in clear weather silver, and the October sunset loves them. They rise in tender azure before you as you issue from the southern gate of Padua, and grow in loveliness as you draw nearer to them from the rich plain that washes their feet with endless harvests of oil and wine.|$|E
60|$|His reductio ad absurdum allowed Wanhope {{to resume}} with a laugh, {{and say that}} Alford waited at the station in the singleness to which the tactful {{dispersion}} of the others had left him, and watched the train rapidly dwindle in the perspective, till an abrupt turn of the road carried it out of sight. Then he lifted his eyes with a long sigh, and looked round. Everywhere he saw Mrs. Yarrow's smiling face with that inner pathos. It swarmed upon him from all points; and wherever he turned it repeated itself in the distances like that succession of faces <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> stand between two mirrors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] replied Gust, {{scratching}} his head. He {{was wondering if}} the Maori were really so ignorant as to believe the preposterous lie {{he was about to}} unload upon him. [...] "Oh yes! You see every warship is equipped with what they call a wireless apparatus. It lets them talk to other ships hundreds of miles away, and it lets them listen to all that is said on these other ships. Now, <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> fellows were shooting up the Cowrie you did a whole lot of loud talking, and there isn't any doubt but that that warship was a-lyin' off south of us listenin' to it all. Of course they might not have learned the name of the ship, but they heard enough to know that the crew of some ship was mutinying and killin' her officers. So you see they'll be waiting to search every ship they sight {{for a long time to}} come, and they may not be far away now." ...|$|E
