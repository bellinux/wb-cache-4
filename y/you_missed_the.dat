Instead, Harrison [...] "flays his detractors" [...] in the song's subsequent verses. These final verses contain the rhyming couplets [...] "Thought by now you knew the score / <b>You</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> point just like before" [...] and [...] "While you attack, create offence / I'll put it down to your ignorance".

6000|$|... “Oh!” exclaimed Richard, with {{something}} of a waggish leer, “thou owest the lad for the venison, I suppose that thou killed, Cousin ‘Duke! Marmaduke! Marmaduke! That was a marvellous tale of thine about the buck! Here, young man, are two dollars for the deer, and Judge Temple can do no less than pay the doctor. I shall charge you nothing for my services, but you shall not fare the worst for that. Come, come, ‘Duke, don’t he down hearted about it; if <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> buck, you contrived to shoot this poor fellow through a pine-tree. Now I own that you have beat me; I never did such a thing in all my life.” ...|$|E

Me he bade keep five steps ahead, five and not more, that he might see me; for it was very dark. Not far from the Lordship Casserey, {{where there is a}} Water-mill, the King asked me, 'Have n't <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> Bridge here?' (a King that does not forget roads and topographies which may come to concern him!)--and bade us ride with the utmost silence, and make no jingle. As day broke, we were in sight of Strehlen, near by the Farm of Treppendorf. 'And do you know where the Kallenberg lies?' said the King: 'It must be to left of the Town, near the Hills; bring us thither!' ...|$|E
60|$|But had {{the system}} {{at which he}} was so enraged {{combined}} almost any amount of human wisdom, spiritual insight, and imaginative beauty, I question whether Hollingsworth's mind was in a fit condition to receive it. I began to discern {{that he had come}} among us actuated by no real sympathy with our feelings and our hopes, but chiefly because we were estranging ourselves from the world, with which his lonely and exclusive object in life had already put him at odds. Hollingsworth must have been originally endowed with a great spirit of benevolence, deep enough and warm enough to be the source of as much disinterested good as Providence often allows a human being the privilege of conferring upon his fellows. This native instinct yet lived within him. I myself had profited by it, in my necessity. It was seen, too, in his treatment of Priscilla. Such casual circumstances as were here involved would quicken his divine power of sympathy, and make him seem, while their influence lasted, the tenderest man and the truest friend on earth. But by and by <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> tenderness of yesterday, and grew drearily conscious that Hollingsworth had a closer friend than ever you could be; and this friend was the cold, spectral monster which he had himself conjured up, and on which he was wasting all the warmth of his heart, and of which, at last,--as these men of a mighty purpose so invariably do,--he had grown to be the bond-slave. It was his philanthropic theory.|$|E

5000|$|... "TRAIN GO SORRY" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used idioms and is similar to the English idiom <b>You</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> boat (Cohen, 1995). Another {{variation}} of this idiom is [...] "CIGARETTE-GONE" [...] (Vicars, 2005).|$|E
5000|$|Dana Schwartz on Teenreads.com is also full of praise: [...] "There are secrets {{hidden in}} every {{sentence}} of this haunting {{and at times}} horrifying book --- secrets that you aren't aware of until you reach the final pages. It's an ending that makes you pause, and then flip back through to see what <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> first time around. The tautly told story with its tropical backdrop of sterile humidity is in great contrast to the young women's budding fecundity." ...|$|E
50|$|The Navatkadu Water Tank. Navatkadu is a hamlet in the {{interior}} that until the summer of 2007 was {{under the control of}} the LTTE Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam (LTTE), the rebel group fighting against the Sri Lankan Government. Having no source of drinking water, the villagers were reliant on a government water truck which drove through the village once a day. If <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> truck, your family had no water. ABDF.org, in co-operation with the local District Secretary, built a 5,000 liter water tank. Now the water truck fills the tank and the villagers have access to clean water all day. This project has proven so popular and effective that two nearby villages have requested tanks of their own.|$|E

5000|$|One critic said, [...] "Dumpstaphunk’s groove is {{a unique}} monster. It's not the minimalist funk of The Meters and it’s not the {{relentless}} funk of James Brown, although it has that rhythmic drive. It's not the psychedelic, over-the-top circus of Parliament Funkadelic, but it often has that political slant. It's not the party funk of the Ohio Players, but it shares the high vocals that take the pressure off the bottom. Dumpstaphunk is a whole other school of funk. If you're under 35, you think you've seen funk, but you haven't. <b>You</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> original Meters, James Brown when he wasn't a parody, Parliament Funkadelic's landing of the Mothership, Sly and the Family Stone before he went M.I.A and Booker T. and the M.G.s before the demise of Stax. Dumpstaphunk {{is as good as}} all that, and they're in their prime now." ...|$|E

She then gave me the [...] "Reader's Digest" [...] {{condensed}} version so I could decide whether to do it or not. As she explained it to me, I realized that this really was... MY story. It was about people who had extreme jobs... like chasing tornadoes, or being in a rock band. Anyway... I really handcrafted this song for the movie. Unfortunately, if you saw the movie, <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> song... and you certainly missed my message. So I decided {{to give you the}} original demo, recorded March 10, 1996 on a 4-track Tascam by my assistant extraordinaire, Karen Johnston. I was living in a beach house overlooking Sunset Boulevard and the Pacific Coast Highway, and beyond that, always... the ocean. When I decided to put this in the [...] "box set," [...] I called Jesse Valenzuela and he put some [...] "vibe" [...] mandolin on it. I love this song. I hope this time... you will understand it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The two {{men began}} {{training}} together. When Virenque retired Jalabert {{wrote in an}} open letter:"We {{used to go out}} every day at 10am, because you're not much of a morning person. There was a time in our career, you know like me, Richard, when were a bit cold to each other. We were rivals, we were chasing the same objectives and the press set us up against each other. When we trained together was when I found out who you were, someone who's good deep down. Close to people, with a good heart as well. You told me <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> sun of the south, and your friends. It seemed to you that everybody had abandoned you. You had the air of suffering, of needing to confide in someone. That hurt me to see you like that, you with your fame, to have fallen so far. A sort of complicity began between us. Afterwards, in 2002, we had a good battle for the polkadot jersey. That embarrassed me, to fight against you, but it was the same for you." ...|$|E
5000|$|The A.V. Club {{gave the}} entire series a A−. Daily Variety wrote that [...] "this series could {{potentially}} work on {{any number of}} networks, and it's almost too smart for the room at ABC Family; nevertheless, this sprightly summer arrival should fit nicely into the evolving niche the channel established with Kyle XY." [...] TV Guide had it as its [...] "Mega Rave" [...] for the week of June 15, 2008, and wrote that [...] "It's loaded with clever banterlike Men in Black if Will Smith's character was a geeky girl." [...] UGO gave it an A− overall and an A for story, calling it [...] "fun to watch." [...] The Boston Herald gave it a B− and wrote that [...] "all that's missing are some onscreen blurbs like 'BAM!' and 'POW!'" [...] Newsarama wrote that [...] "stylistically, the current show this most resembles is Pushing Daisies, with its colorful sets and rapid-fire screwball dialogue" [...] and that [...] "it's about goofy ideas {{and having a good}} time, the kind of show you'll want to watch repeatedly to catch a line <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> first time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Billboard ranked [...] "Needed Me" [...] {{at number}} 9 on their [...] "100 Best Pop Songs of 2016" [...] list: [...] "We {{already knew that}} Rihanna was a savage -- her supreme {{self-confidence}} and total lack of f---s to give have made that abundantly clear over the years. But in case <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> memo, [...] "Needed Me" [...] is the perfect reminder, pairing nihilistic razor-sharp lyrical barbs with a bass-heavy down-tempo beat that could almost be confused with a pained love song—but only if you werent paying attention. The way she eviscerates a former lover ("Dont get it twisted / You was just another n---a on the hit list") is delivered so casually and with so much barely-concealed contempt that it cant even be called cocky; shes just stating the truth, and if you havent caught on by now theres no hope left for catching up." [...] Pitchfork would later list [...] "Needed Me" [...] on their ranking of the 100 best songs of 2016 at number 88. In the annual Village Voices Pazz & Jop mass critics poll of the years best in music in 2016, [...] "Needed Me" [...] was ranked at number 21, tied with Ariana Grandes [...] "Into You" [...] and Miranda Lamberts [...] "Vice".|$|E
