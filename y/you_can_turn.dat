In the DVD commentary for the episode, Ward revealed that with [...] "Princess Monster Wife" [...] he was hoping to craft a story that was both [...] "super sad and intense, [...] tickles your funny bone at the same time." [...] Ward further explained that the eponymous character was analogous to himself, noting, [...] "I'm made out of broken parts … but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> [...] into something worth displaying." [...] To voice Princess Monster Wife, Ward, Walch, and Little had to record each of their lines in tandem, mimicking the tones of one another.|$|E
500|$|An ode to oral sex, [...] "Blow" [...] {{stands in}} line with the {{explicit}} theme of the album about frank female sexuality and eroticism. Lyrically, it refers to cunnilingus through heavy innuendos omitting subtlety; the lines [...] "Can you lick my Skittles, it's the sweetest in the middle/ Pink is the flavor, solve the riddle" [...] are sung [...] "flirtatiously" [...] by Beyoncé. It opens with a breathy atmosphere and Beyoncé singing the lines, [...] "I kiss you and you lick your lips/ You like it wet and so do I/ I know you never waste a drip/ I wonder how it feels sometimes". The chorus lines are [...] "pleaded" [...] by the singer as stated by Fallon: [...] "Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me humming, keep me moaning". The second half of the song contains a tempo change with a funkier beat and the singer singing verse-chorus-verse trajectories. Chris Richards of The Washington Post compared this type of songcraft with Maxwell, Erykah Badu and Frank Ocean's work. It starts with Beyoncé declaring [...] "I'm about to get into this girls. This for all my grown women out there". During this part, Timbaland's vocals can be heard in the background as part of a call and response. It follows with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "I can't wait 'til I get home so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> that cherry out" [...] to her man; according to Caitlin White of the website The 405, these line [...] "exhibit deep assurance of her usual freedom". During the second part, the lines [...] "turn that cherry out" [...] are repeatedly sung followed by the lyrics [...] "I'm-a let you be the boss of me". She finishes the second part by delivering, [...] "Don't slip off when it drip off on top of you... Gimme that daddy-long stroke". The second part was further described as a [...] "masterful recreation of mid-'80s First Avenue funk". At the end [...] "Blow" [...] features a French-language interlude.|$|E

2500|$|Terpening’s second thriller, League of Shadows (2005), was a {{contemporary}} novel of intrigue with an extensive back story {{that takes place}} in Italy during the Fascist Era. The historical scenes depict the efforts of three spies in 1943 to infiltrate Italian leader Benito Mussolini’s secret police, the OVRA. Decades after that intrigue went horribly wrong, an unknown enemy begins to hunt down the former secret agents, and their one hope for survival is an ex-cop obsessed with his mission. The Midwest Book Review called the novel “an addictive read, weaving together human drive, determination, and betrayal into a gripping whole”, while Lucille Cormier, in The Historical Novels Review, said that “You can race through this suspense thriller riding the whirlwind of drug busts, jungle guerrilla attacks, gun fights, assassinations, and love affairs right into the breathtaking climax. Or, if you are disciplined enough, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> each page slowly and savor the extraordinary visual and historical detail Ron Terpening has painted into his complex story. Either way, you are in for a treat. This is a book to add to every collection of historical fiction.” Joel Tscherne (Cleveland Public Library) noted in Library Journal that this is a novel that “fans of Jack Higgins’s thrillers will enjoy.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Ruslan Obiang, {{a son of}} the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports {{minister}} and president of a top soccer club, the [...] "Panthers". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms {{to do business in}} his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since [...] "he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> to." [...] After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: [...] "You sign a contract with the son of the president and you believe it is worth something. You have no idea {{what is going to happen}} to you. We had to flee the country. We were afraid for our lives." ...|$|E

And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E
