"Calico Skies", which Paul McCartney {{had written}} when Hurricane Bob had hit while McCartney was staying on Long Island in 1991, and [...] "Great Day", which {{features}} backing vocal {{from his wife}} Linda McCartney, hailed from a 1992 session, recorded even before Off the Ground had come out. Starting from the mid-1990s for four years, McCartney was involved in The Beatles Anthology, a documentary {{on the history of}} The Beatles. The documentary was originally titled The Long and Winding Road, named after the Beatle song of the same name. During 1995, as the Anthology albums were starting to be released over a two-year period, EMI did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime. McCartney said that he [...] "was almost insulted at first" [...] before then realising that [...] "it would be silly to go out against <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of The Beatles.

Williams equated Stefani's tone {{to that of a}} [...] "child whisperer" [...] due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it [...] "a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an {{identity}} crisis". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including [...] "When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror / That's your way home". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing [...] "Shine!" [...] and Williams screaming [...] "Hey!". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, [...] "So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation" [...] and [...] "that bear with the red hat", as obvious references to Paddington.

After Brosnan left school, he pursued {{a career in}} art and began working as an illustrator. “I {{always wanted to be}} an artist, a painter. I started as a Trainee Artist in a small studio in South London.” A colleague suggested that Pierce attend a theatre workshop, and eventually he abandoned his artwork to pursue a career in acting. Brosnan took up painting again in the late 1980s during his first wife’s illness as he found it therapeutic. “Sometimes dramatic moments affect the way you see <b>yourself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world…from a very hard time in my life, I started painting again and out came every color I could imagine.” Citing his influences as Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Kandinsky, Brosnan spends much of his free time between film shoots in front of his easel. “I am self taught, an enthusiastic painter as a friend of mine likes to say.” [...] He has continued painting since then, using spare time on set and at home. Profits from sales of giclée prints of his works are given to a trust to benefit [...] "environmental, children's and women's health charities." [...] Since Harris' death, Brosnan has been an advocate for cancer awareness and, in 2006, he served as spokesperson for Lee National Denim Day, a breast cancer fundraiser which raises millions of dollars and raises more money in a single day than any other breast cancer fundraiser.|$|E

500|$|Season four began {{expanding}} on {{the series}} long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You have to ask <b>yourself,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always [...] "go for the prize".|$|E
500|$|To {{design the}} missions, the {{designers}} {{began with a}} cohesive area, which they filled with activities for the player. They defined paths to the target areas, and developed and expanded them. They then populated the areas with NPCs, which they assigned to patrol routes and functions. The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level, using their abilities and powers to test whether the area provided a suitable challenge for the available powers, and then redesigned the level as needed. At first, the levels featured little directional information to emphasize the player's ability to traverse them as they choose, but in testing, players became lost or obeyed NPC commands to not enter an area, leaving them unable to proceed. In response, the developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players. Some features and ideas were removed during the design process, including a mental institution where Corvo would have faced sound-sensitive patients. Discussing {{the use of violence}} and the consequences of in-game freedom, developer Joe Houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball; Houston determined that not killing the NPCs opened up more objectives and interactions, but the tester systematically killed every NPC in the level, which Houston found disconcerting. The team came under pressure to excise a scene {{from the end of the}} game where Samuel, in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout the game, can betray Corvo by alerting enemies to his presence. Smith explained [...] "Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you’re great, no matter what you do. If you slaughter everybody – you killed the maids, you killed the old people, you killed the beggars – you’re great, here’s a medal, you’re a hero... We decided that sounds psychotic.
