500|$|Grey Anatomy {{has been}} {{considered}} an impact on culture by Entertainment Weekly executive editor, Lori Majewski, with her writing: [...] "Grey's Anatomy isn't just a show, it's a phenomenon. When [...] final shows air, every place in New York City is empty. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> table at the best restaurants." [...] The Daily Beast Jace Lacob also considered the show an impact, comparing its success to that of Friends, and calling it a [...] "cultural phenomenon". Steve Sternberg, a media analyst with Magna Global USA explained that the show appeals to a broad audience, writing: [...] "Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members." [...] Grey's Anatomy introduced a [...] "mc-labeling" [...] surge, ever since it dubbed Dempsey's character [...] "McDreamy". Canadian newspaper the National Post considers this trend a [...] "phenomenon".|$|E
500|$|As Pei, {{neared the}} end of his {{secondary}} education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. [...] "College life in the U.S. {{seemed to me to be}} mostly fun and games", he said in 2000. [...] "Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it... <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me." ...|$|E

[...] "The Charger didn't begin with the performance/ muscle car image, though <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> Hemi with it." [...] The Charger evolved into possibly the top Chrysler-made muscle car.|$|E

2500|$|Bono and {{his friend}} Gavin Friday {{continued}} {{to work on the}} song after Lanois and Eno declined to do so. Bono credits Friday with rescuing the song and rearranging it, believing it could be a hit. Eno added a keyboard arpeggio, similar to the one from [...] "Bad". The song's fate was still in doubt when the Edge was sent a prototype of the Infinite Guitar by Canadian musician Michael Brook, with whom he had collaborated for the Captive soundtrack. The instrument allowed sustained notes to be played, producing [...] "a similar effect to the E-Bow", but with the ability to provide all the [...] "mid-points between no sustain and infinite sustain" [...] that the E-Bow cannot provide. The prototype included elaborate assembly instructions and as the Edge recollects, [...] "one wrongly placed wire and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> nasty belt of electricity. This piece of gear would have failed even the most basic of safety regulations." [...] On subsequent tours, his guitar technician occasionally received electric shocks from the instrument when preparing it for performances.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{existence}} of Obama's Hawaii certification of live birth, Terry Lakin's attorney, among others, have claimed that anyone, including foreign-born children, could acquire a Hawaiian certification of live birth, and so Obama's possession of such a certificate does not prove that {{he was born in}} Hawaii. However, the suggestion that this could have applied to Obama was rejected by Janice Okubo, director of communications for the Hawaii Department of Health: [...] "If you were born in Bali, for example, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> certificate from the state of Hawaii saying you were born in Bali. You could not get a certificate saying you were born in Honolulu. The state has to verify a fact like that for it to appear on the certificate". Another fact that refutes this specific claim is that the law allowing foreign-born children to obtain Hawaiian birth certificates did not exist until 20 years after Obama was born, while Obama’s published birth certificate says his birth information was recorded four days after his birth in 1961, and explicitly states that he was born in Honolulu.|$|E

Then I got much more sophisticated—I got the guy who did the gumball machines at the drugstore to sell me all the coins. Now we started {{to get this thing}} organized! I could sort through large quantities. I was 12.” He soon branched out into the area of American colonial coinage and political memorabilia, and later wrote several reference works in this field.|$|R
