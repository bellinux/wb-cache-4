500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to be doing is to be off on her own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. And she {{might not even be}} killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some of those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

2500|$|On Nancy's personality, Fox {{described}} her {{as different from}} other Hollyoaks girls, dubbing her the [...] "anti-Hollyoaks girl". She said that Nancy has [...] "always got some kind of bitchy comeback for everyone". She explained that Nancy [...] "says that you don’t {{have to be the}} skinny blonde or the skinny brunette, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one who does whatever the hell she likes". After the character had gone through certain transformations, the actress spoke about these changes saying: [...] "Nancy's gone full circle and she's had the chance to become a whole character, rather than just one who has no end of tragedy and no end of silly affairs". Fox has said that her character is [...] "a control freak. Nancy has very definite ideas of what she wants and what she doesn't". She added that Nancy is [...] "a bit posh and stiff" [...] and [...] "uptight" [...] but that she can get [...] "really wild" [...] when she has [...] "had a few drinks". Fox has described Nancy as [...] "a bit of a moral compass for the show. She knows what's right and she's often the voice of that. I think that's a really good role for her, and it's quite an important one. I think it's quite good to have a strong, intelligent woman in the show". She added that Nancy [...] "has a very short fuse and loses her temper quickly".|$|E

In these days, however, the distinctions of master and servant are less broad than before, and in the field we shall be companions rather than master and follower. So, if you like to cast in your fortunes with mine, here is my hand on it. You have already proved your friendship to me as well as your quickness and courage, and believe me, you will not find me or my father ungrateful. But for you, I should now be in the cells, and your old master in no slight danger of finding himself in prison, {{to say nothing of the}} upset of the negotiations for which I came to London. Therefore, you have deserved well, not only of me, but of the king, and the adventure may not turn out so badly as it has begun. We had best strike south, and go round by Tunbridge, and thence keeping west, into Berkshire, and so to Oxford. In this way we shall miss the Parliament men lying round London, and those facing the Royalists between Reading and Oxford." ...|$|E

The night after the Indians recaptured your brother, Betty and I stood out in the {{moonlight}} and she looked so bewitching and I felt so sorry for her and so carried away by my love for her that I yielded to a momentary impulse and kissed her. I simply could not help it. There is no excuse for me. She struck me across the face and ran into the house. I had intended that night to tell her of my love and place my fate in her hands, but, of course, the unfortunate occurrence made that impossible. As I was to leave at dawn next day, I remained up all night, thinking what I ought to do. Finally I decided to write. I wrote her a letter, telling her all and begging her to become my wife. I gave the letter to your slave, Sam, and told him it was a matter of life and death, and not to lose the letter nor fail to give it to Betty. I have had no answer to that letter. Today she coldly ignored me. That is my story, Col. Zane." ...|$|E
