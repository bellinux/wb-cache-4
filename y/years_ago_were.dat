5|$|Clovis sites dated at 13,500 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} in western North America during the 1930s. Clovis peoples {{were regarded as}} the first widespread Paleo-Indian inhabitants of the New World and ancestors to all indigenous peoples in the Americas. Archaeological discoveries in {{the past thirty years}} have brought forward other distinctive knapping cultures who occupied the Americas from the lower Great Plains to the shores of Chile.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period. At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10-25 degrees south of the equator. The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone, laid down from 408 to 370 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>were</b> created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then were deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite), {{but there is also a}} Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks. There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation.|$|E
5|$|As the Bonneville Floods rushed {{down the}} Snake River, the Missoula Floods {{occurred}} in the same period, but farther north. The Missoula Floods, which took place more than 40 times in the time span from 15,000 to 13,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>were</b> caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through, with the lake's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood. These floods pooled behind the Cascade Range into enormous lakes and spilled over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed, carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills. The Palouse River canyon was {{the largest of the}} many gorges cut through the Palouse Hills, and could not have become as large as it now is {{if it were not for}} the Missoula Floods. The Lake Bonneville Floods and the Missoula Floods helped widen and deepen the Columbia River Gorge, a giant water gap which allows water from the Columbia and Snake rivers to take a direct route through the Cascade Range to the Pacific.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest problem}} with prosecuting Mengistu for {{genocide}} {{is that his}} actions did not necessarily target a particular group. They were directed against anybody who was opposing his government, and they were generally much more political than based on any ethnic targeting. In contrast, the irony is the Ethiopian government itself {{has been accused of}} genocide based on atrocities committed in Gambella. I'm not sure that they qualify as genocide either. But in Gambella, the incidents, which were well documented in a human rights report of about 2 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>were</b> clearly directed at a particular group, the tribal group, the Anuak.|$|E
25|$|Sculptures, cave {{paintings}}, rock {{paintings and}} petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so {{little is known}} about the cultures that produced them. The oldest art objects in the world—a series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave. Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years.

25|$|The Chinese of 3000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>were</b> {{perhaps the}} {{earliest}} people to formalize odds and chance. The Greek philosophers discussed randomness at length, {{but only in}} non-quantitative forms.

The invention of the calculus had a positive impact on the formal study of randomness. In the 1888 edition of his book The Logic of Chance John Venn wrote a chapter on The conception of randomness that included his view of the randomness of the digits of the number pi by using them to construct a random walk in two dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal life}} {{in these areas}} is also {{relatively}} rich. The zone is particularly important to the brown bear, which likes to hibernate the winter away in dens along the mountainside. In spring, the brown bears descent to the plains, and only return to the mountain when the berries do. These terrains are also favored stomping grounds of the Eurasian lynx. Both species, brown bear and Eurasian lynx, are protected in Sweden. Besides the red fox, the other predators, which are the wolverine, the gray wolf and the Arctic fox, are much rarer {{and do not have}} a fixed location in the park. The park shelters an important population of moose that pass the summer on the mountain, but prefer to spend the winter in areas less snowy. There are no more wild reindeerin the park, which is part of those few Swedish mountains not included in the area of pasture of domestic reindeer. Muskox, which left the area almost 4000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>were</b> reintroduced in Norway and sometimes wander near the park. Among the smaller animals, one can cite the red squirrel, the European pine marten, and the mountain hare. Like other Swedish mountains, the Norway lemming is present in Fulufjället, but in a patchy fashion, extremely numerous some years and almost absent others. This phenomenon is still not entirely understood.|$|E

500|$|A gap {{of about}} 500,000 years {{separates}} Ciomadul from {{the activity of}} other volcanoes in the area. The two oldest dates of 1,020,000 and 850,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>were</b> obtained on peripheral lava domes. Activity reached a peak between [...] 650,000 – 500,000 years ago, when the principal lava domes were formed. This effusive phase {{is also known as}} [...] "old Ciomadul". The youngest lava dome was dated at 42,900 ± 1,500 years ago by uranium-thorium dating. The dates obtained by potassium-argon dating are much older; there is substantial disagreement between dates obtained by potassium-argon dating or argon-argon dating {{on the one hand and}} uranium-thorium dating on the other hand at Ciomadul. These dates indicate the formation of the central lava domes between 590,000 and 140,000 years ago.|$|E
