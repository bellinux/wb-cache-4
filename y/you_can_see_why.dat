The National reviewer Kaleem Aftab, in his 4 star review, noted [...] "Throwing together road trip, romcom and buddy-buddy action in a single picture may sound like an ill-conceived masala mash-up, but like any good dish, the ingredients are blended together with affection to create one of the best feel-good movies of the year." ...|$|E

His emotional life has been pulled in so many different directions. He's so incredibly confused." [...] Actor James Faulkner was cast in the role of Randyll, with Samantha Spiro portraying Samwell's mother and Freddie Stroma and Rebecca Benson portraying Samwell's brother Dickon and sister Talla.|$|E
