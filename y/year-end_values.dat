The assumptions, plans and Special Nuclear Material (SNM) inventory summaries contained in this document were prepared for Department of Energy (DOE) use for interim and long- range planning. In accordance with Richland DOE field office (DOE-RL) direction, <b>year-end</b> inventory <b>values</b> were not projected over an 11 year period, as historically done in previous MMP documents. This decision was made since significant SNM movements to or from Hanford are not projected in the foreseeable future.

In addition, $ 214. 9 billion {{were reported as}} rollovers into IRAs for 2004, usually from employer-sponsored plans (such as 401 (k) plans). 1 At year-end, approximately 50. 9 million taxpayers held $ 3. 3 trillion in IRAs based on the fair market value. Almost 90 percent of the <b>year-end</b> fair market <b>value,</b> 89. 6 percent, ($ 3. 0 trillion), was invested in traditional IRA plans (Figure A and Table 1). Simpli-fied Employee Pension (SEP) plans accounted for 5. 1 percent ($ 169 billion), Roth IRA plans accounted for 4. 2 percent ($ 140 billion), and Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE) plans ac-counted for 1. 0 percent ($ 34 billion). Even though traditional IRAs accounted {{for most of the}} <b>year-end</b> fair market <b>value,</b> Roth IRA contributions accounted for almost one-third of contributions for the year, 30. 2 percent ($ 14. 7 billion). SEP plans accounted for 28. 2 percent ($ 13. 8 billion) of contributions, tra-ditional IRA plans accounted for 25. 9 percent ($ 12. 6 billion), and SIMPLE plans accounted for 15. 6 per-cent ($ 7. 6 billion). For Tax Year 2004, while $ 48. 7 billion were con-tributed by 14. 7 million taxpayers, 12. 3 million tax-payers withdrew $ 140 billion, of which $ 133 billion were from traditional IRA plans, $ 4. 5 billion were from SEP plans, $ 1. 9 billion were from Roth plans, and $ 0. 2 billion were from SIMPLE plans. types of Plans traditional IRAs IRAs were created by the Employee Retirement In...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the value}} {{relevance}} of accounting number in capital market research {{are consistent with the}} simple view that, in equilibrium, book values are equal to or have some long-term relationship with market values, and that market returns are related to book returns. This dissertation examines the value relevance of annually-reported book values of net assets, earnings and dividends to the <b>year-end</b> market <b>values</b> of five Japanese firms between 1950 and 2004 (a period of 54 years). Econometric techniques are used to develop dynamic models of the relationship between markets, book values and a number of macro-economic variables. In constructing the models, the focus is to provide an accurate statistical description of the underlying relationships between market and book value. It is expected that such research will add to the body of knowledge on factors that are influential to Japanese stock prices. The significant findings of the study are as follows: 1) well-specified models of the data generating process for market value based on the information set used to derive the models are log-linear in form. Additive, linear models in untransformed variables are not well-specified and forecast badly out of sample; 2) the book value of net assets has relevance for market value in the five Japanese firms examined, in the long run...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{data from}} several sources, we build a {{database}} of home values, the cost of housing structures, and residential land values for 46 large U. S. metropolitan areas from 1984 to 2004. Our analysis of these new data reveal that since the mid- 1980 s residential land values have appreciated over a much wider range of cities than is commonly believed. And, since 1998, almost all large U. S. cities have seen significant increases in real residential land prices. Averaging across the cities in our sample, by <b>year-end</b> 2004, the <b>value</b> of residential land accounted for about 50 {{percent of the total}} market value of housing, up from 32 percent in 1984. An implication of our results is that housing is much more land intensive than it used to be, meaning that the future course of home prices — the average rate of appreciation and volatility — is likely to be determined even more by demand factors than was the case even ten or twenty years ago...|$|R
40|$|In this working paper, Neil H. Buchanan {{statistically}} tests six alternative {{definitions of}} the federal budget deficit to determine if these definitions improve the results of econometric studies that use the deficit as an exogenous variable. Buchanan wishes to (1) evaluate how well Robert Eisner's conclusion that a price-adjusted deficit definition improves econometric results and (2) compare alternative measures of the deficit. Buchanan's analysis begins with two {{definitions of the}} structural deficit published by the government: the Bureau of Economic Analysis's high-employment deficit, which is based on a constant standard of unemployment, and the Congressional Budget Office's standardized employment deficit, which is based on a varying standard of unemployment, namely, the NAIRU. He then compares two sets of price- adjusted structural deficit measures to the set of original definitions. Each original definition is adjusted by using two different calculations of a price effect intended to gauge the change in the value of outstanding government debt. One set of price-adjusted measures is obtained by subtracting the product of the <b>year-end</b> par <b>value</b> of outstanding debt and the annual rate of inflation from each of the original measures of structural deficits. The second price-adjusted set third set is obtained by subtracting a more complex derivation of a price effect, namely one that accounts for the timing of inflation's effect on prior debt. The results of initial regression analysis indicate that the method of adjusting for price effects {{is more important than the}} method of adjusting for cyclical effects. Using a variety of specifications, time periods, and data definitions, Buchanan's findings did not support the case that deficit spending stimulates GDP growth. However, a relationship was found between unemployment and the deficit, even when the non–price-adjusted measures of the deficit were used. The results of regressions using shorter, 15 - year periods show a decline in the importance of price adjusting and a further weakening of the growth-deficit relationship compared to what was found in the initial regressions. The unemployment-deficit relationship, however, was stronger than in the full-period regressions. ...|$|R
