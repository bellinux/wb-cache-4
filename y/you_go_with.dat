500|$|As {{with the}} soundtrack for Watchmen, {{director}} Zack Snyder {{decided to go}} with covers instead of original songs, saying [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the original song, you just get the moment. But if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> covers you also {{get all of the}} baggage you bring to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment." [...] The soundtrack was produced by composer Tyler Bates and musical producer Marius de Vries. While Bates' job was initially only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as [...] "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" [...] - the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of [...] "Army of Me".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "The Brothers Grimm looks terrific, yet it remains {{essentially}} inert. You keep {{waiting for something}} to happen, and after a while your mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "despite an appealing actor in each role, the entire cast comes across as repellent. Will and Jake Grimm are two guys in the woods, surrounded by computerized animals, putting audiences to sleep all over America." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, largely enjoyed The Brothers Grimm. He explained that [...] "if you're a Gilliam junkie, as I am, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it, even when the script loses its shaky hold on coherence." [...] Travers added, [...] "even when Gilliam flies off the rails, his images stick with you." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday called the film [...] "a great compound of rip-snorting Gothic fantasy and Python-esque dark comedy".|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that he run for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E

500|$|Interpretations of the song's meaning {{vary from}} one {{listener}} to the next; some people {{view it as}} a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium. In this interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, [...] "I've asked you without end / When will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name" [...] ("") are taken to express the [...] "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom", the [...] "sense of loss and disorientation" [...] among China's youth in the 1980s. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as [...] "recast the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole." [...] The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī wú suŏ yŏu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means [...] "to have nothing" [...] and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning [...] "I have nothing" [...] (implying that it is a song about two people), or [...] "we have nothing" [...] (understanding it as social commentary).|$|E
2500|$|... "Would <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> <b>with</b> Me" [...] was {{the second}} single {{released}} from Your Man. Like the album's title track, [...] "Would <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> <b>with</b> Me" [...] also {{reached the top of}} the country singles charts, holding that position for two weeks; it also reached No.48 on the Billboard Hot 100. Turner also performed it on the CMA Awards in November 2006.|$|E
2500|$|By end of 1954 Elvis asked D.J. Fontana, {{who was the}} underutilized drummer for the Louisiana Hayride, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> us if we got {{any more}} dates?" [...] Presley was now using drums, as did many other rockabilly performers; drums were then {{uncommon}} in country music. In the 1955 sessions shortly after Presley's move from Sun Records to RCA, Presley was backed by a band that included Moore, Black, Fontana, and pianist Floyd Cramer. In 1956 Elvis acquired vocal backup via the Jordanaires.|$|E

2500|$|Joshua Otis Turner (born November 20, 1977) [...] is an American {{country singer}} and actor. In 2003, he signed to MCA Nashville Records. That same year, his debut album's title track, [...] "Long Black Train", was his {{breakthrough}} single release. His second album, Your Man (2006) accounted {{for his first}} two number-one hits: [...] "Your Man" [...] and [...] "Would <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> <b>with</b> Me", while 2007's Everything Is Fine included a No.2 in [...] "Firecracker". Haywire, released in 2010, produced his biggest hit, the No.1 on the country charts [...] "Why Don't We Just Dance" [...] and another number one in [...] "All Over Me". It was followed by Punching Bag (2012), whose lead-off single [...] "Time Is Love" [...] was the biggest country hit of 2012 according to Billboard Year-End.|$|E
2500|$|... "Alive" [...] {{has been}} {{revealed}} by Vedder {{to be part}} autobiographical and part fiction. When Vedder was a teenager, his mother revealed {{to him that the}} man he thought was his father was actually his stepfather, and that his biological father was dead. The first and last verses detail those actual events, but the second verse is storytelling on Vedder's part. The lyrics of the second verse read, [...] "Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room/She said I'm ready...for you/I can't remember anything to this very day/'Cept the look, the look.../Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare...," [...] and Vedder revealed that [...] "she" [...] was the mother, and [...] "the look" [...] referred to was not the look on her face, but [...] "the look is between her legs. Where do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> that? That's where you came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the failure}} of the mud brick {{buildings}} and lack of compliance with the 1989 Iranian seismic code, the reconstruction in Bam paid special attention to using earthquake durable materials. Dr. Hamid Eskander, in charge of the Bam reconstruction effort, said [...] "There will be no more mud brick in Bam. The new design will {{have to take into account}} proper seismic design techniques and parameters. When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the old-style buildings and old-style engineering you're looking for trouble so we're going to change it now." [...] Horst Indorf, a representative for permanent shelter issues from ASB, a German non-government organization, frowned on the use of iron structures in the city given its movement during an earthquake, saying [...] "The best architecture for this area is clay brick (with nets) but this means 80 to 90cm thick walls and a very good insulated roof".|$|E

2500|$|A {{non-traditional}} view is {{that the}} betrothal was effected simply by purchasing the girl from her father (or guardian). The price paid for her (bride price) is known by the Hebrew term mohar (מוהר). The girl's consent is not explicitly required by any statement in the Bible, neither is there explicit permission to ignore it. Yet, as the servant of Abraham was seeking a Bride for Isaac, and discovered Rebekah living in Haran, {{it should be noted that}} her father Bethuel, and her brother Laban, said, [...] "Let us call the young woman and ask her." [...] And they called Rebekah and said to her, [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> this man?" [...] She said, [...] "I will go."(Genesis 24:57, 58) It was customary in biblical times for the bride to be given part of the mohar. Gradually it lost its original meaning, and the custom arose of giving the mohar entirely to the bride, rather than to her father.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock {{them in a way}} that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I think we have a pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E
