You are fixing to make 300,000 enemies." [...] Then, Fuentes reminded Cárdenas how the U.S. launched a massive manhunt and investigation after the kidnap, torture, and assassination of the DEA agent Enrique Camarena in 1985 in Mexico. All of the killers and accomplices were captured in that U.S. operation.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You don't think I {{would do}} {{anything}} of that sort? But I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> know. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> remember their first settling here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> differently,” said Mrs. Dolphin, very pale, to her brother. “But {{of course}} {{everything}} {{will come out}} now.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{might not}} know, oonless you haf hiret his landt, und agree't {{to pay him}} rent; in which case <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> as you agree't." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Master {{took this}} {{considerably}} in, but made little of it. [...] "You're a gentleman {{and a man}} of genius. I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> something." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "You didn't {{expect me}} to say <b>you</b> <b>might,</b> <b>did</b> <b>you?</b> Oh, how cruel!" [...] She whirls out of the room, and Campbell stands in a daze, {{in which he is}} finally aware of Mr. Arthur Welling, seen through the open window, on the veranda without. Mr. Welling, with a terrified and furtive air, seems to be fixed to the spot where he stands.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{they will}} be; you couldn't look on and see it. Do {{come to my}} rescue this once. <b>You</b> really <b>might</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} for them." ...|$|R
60|$|The way Nature and Heaven {{waste the}} gifts and souls they give and make, passes all wonder. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> {{anything}} <b>you</b> chose, only {{you were too}} modest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> worse," [...] responded Tom, coolly. [...] "Now, for a {{first-class}} journal, {{they ought to}} pay you at least a dollar a foot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> something. Find {{out how he}} did it. He's a crafty beggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask Cook if she's missed any." ...|$|E
6000|$|I.--Well, but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> {{this in your}} lost hours, {{when the}} [...] anguish of your empty stomach, or the weariness of your stomach [...] overloaded, banishes slumber.|$|E

But his verdict was mild. After sitting up all night over the work; and diligently taking notes:--"Lombardo, my friend! here, take your sheets. I have run through them loosely. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> better; but then <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> worse. Take them, my friend; I have put in some good things for you:" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you were}} young, very young, and your folly was condoned. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> have begun life again, for {{to the world}} at least you were a man of honour. You had not deceived the world, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> to others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{in such a}} case as that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> so; {{and then}} there would be no {{necessity}} for him to talk to another person on the matter." ...|$|E

6000|$|She eyed Elspeth suspiciously. [...] "But {{of course}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> {{it just a}} little," [...] she said, pleadingly--"just to make them go on loving you, don't you think? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have been}} there ever since you went away. It was Mrs. Sam who sent me after you: who said that she thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be <b>doing</b> {{something}} stupid--something like yourself, Huxter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> ha' <b>done</b> {{it without}} killing him, clumsy," [...] said his mother. She {{had had a}} large {{experience}} of such scenes, and knew {{the difference between a}} stunning blow and a fatal one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Kate, {{after all}} he has done for us, of course I {{have nothing to say}} against it; and I don't suppose you would mind, if I had. Still, I <b>do</b> think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gradually <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> so,--at {{any rate}} {{so as to}} make life possible. You will be all alone. Think what it will be to have to live all alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I see," [...] remarked Mrs. Keith, who was {{sometimes}} blunt. [...] "Well, I daresay you were wise; though I'm told he'll be captain shortly, {{and he has}} his good points, Jimmy is no catch. <b>You</b> certainly <b>might</b> <b>do</b> better." ...|$|R
