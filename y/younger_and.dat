5|$|Discontent {{against the}} king grew, however, and {{eventually}} affected also Edmund.

40|$|In {{asthmatic}} subjects {{an imbalance}} between elastase and alpha 1 -antitrypsin (alpha 1 -PI) exists. This study aims {{to evaluate whether}} ageing per se affects the levels of elastase. Both <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly asthmatics with comparable severity and duration of disease, as well as <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly healthy subjects, underwent an induced sputum procedure to measure levels of elastase and alpha 1 -PI. The percentage of sputum neutrophils and eosinophils was higher in <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly asthmatics than in <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly controls. The levels of both total and active elastase were significantly higher in <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly asthmatics than in <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly controls, and directly correlated with the percentage of neutrophils. In addition, in both <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly asthmatics the levels of total and active elastase were negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in one second values, but positively correlated with {{the duration of the}} disease. This study indicates that ageing per se does not necessarily lead to a progressive elastase/alpha 1 -antitrypsin imbalance in asthma, and suggests that an important variable in the development of airway remodelling in both <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly asthmatics is represented by the duration of the disease...|$|R

5|$|Niobium was {{identified}} by English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801.

5|$|The League Cup {{was clearly}} not one of Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> less-known players.

5|$|After {{qualifying}} as a barrister, {{he moved}} to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the chambers of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of World War I; many of the <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> fitter barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty {{when he joined the}} bar, avoided conscription as he was declared medically unfit.

5|$|As the {{political}} conflict escalated into full-scale rebellion in 1321–22, Edmund {{played an important}} role in its suppression. The opposition stemmed from resentment against the king's new favourites, Hugh Despenser the <b>Younger</b> <b>and</b> Hugh Despenser the Elder. When Bartholomew Badlesmere, steward of the royal household, defected to the opposition, Edward made his youngest brother Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in place of Badlesmere on 16 June. In the parliament of July 1321, Edmund briefly sided with the opposition when he agreed to exile the Despensers, but later claimed this had been done under duress, and in November sat on the council that annulled the exile.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiment was to evaluate byproducts yield of non-castrated Nellore males slaughtered at different weights. Forty Nellore males with average weight of 350 kg {{at the beginning of}} the feedlot were used. In a completely randomized design, the animals were divided into four groups: 0 to 2 -teeth animals with carcass weight up to 238. 0 kg (<b>young</b> <b>and</b> light carcasses); 2 -teeth animal with carcass weights ranging from 238. 1 to 258. 0 kg (<b>young</b> <b>and</b> middle weight carcasses); 2 -teeth animal with carcass weight over 258. 0 kg (<b>young</b> <b>and</b> heavy carcasses) and animals with four or six teeth, regardless of carcass weight (adults). Animals were fed during 84 days with diet calculated to reach average weight gain of 1. 2 kg/day. Hide weight was higher for <b>young</b> <b>and</b> heavy animals in relation to <b>young</b> <b>and</b> light and adult animals.
