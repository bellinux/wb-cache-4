A commercial was later officially released in February and was shot by Jake Nava with whom Beyoncé had collaborated frequently.

500|$|Bundy also {{confided in}} Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. Hagmaier {{was struck by}} the [...] "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" [...] that Bundy took in murder. [...] "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. [...] "It becomes possession. They are part of you ... becomes a part of you, and you [...] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to you, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> be drawn back to them." [...] Bundy told Hagmaier that he {{considered}} himself to be an [...] "amateur", an [...] "impulsive" [...] killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his [...] "prime" [...] or [...] "predator" [...] phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—though he never explicitly admitted doing so.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{is portrayed as}} having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game [...] bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] and often gives the farewell, [...] "This is the day <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> remember as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!" [...] which is sometimes humorously cut off. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, [...] "But you have heard of me." [...] In a deleted scene from The Curse of the Black Pearl Sparrow ponders being [...] "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow", and during At World's End he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns {{it can be a}} terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being [...] "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," [...] as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.|$|E

[...] "Preserve a quiet conscience and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy." [...] The anonymous medieval author of the Christian mystical work The Cloud of Unknowing similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged contemplation a soul dries up the [...] "root and ground" [...] of the sin that is always there, even after one's confession and however busy one is in holy things: [...] "therefore, whoever would work at becoming a contemplative must first cleanse his [...] conscience." [...] The medieval Flemish mystic John of Ruysbroeck likewise held that true conscience has four aspects {{that are necessary to}} render a man just in the active and contemplative life: [...] "a free spirit, attracting itself through love"; [...] "an intellect enlightened by grace", [...] "a delight yielding propension or inclination" [...] and [...] "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Fearless" [...] {{was written}} by Swift in {{collaboration}} with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many times you get hurt, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that {{you have a lot of}} fears, but you jump anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Jesus' {{response}} to the anointing in Luke is completely different from that recorded in the other gospels to the anointing in their accounts. Rather than Jesus' above-mentioned comments on the [...] "poor <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> have with you", in Luke he tells his host the Parable of the Two Debtors. As one commentator notes, [...] "Luke {{is the only one}} to record the parable of the two debtors, and he chooses to preserve it in this setting... If one considers the other gospel accounts as a variation of the same event, {{it is likely that the}} parable is not authentically set. Otherwise, the powerful message from the parable located in this setting would likely be preserved elsewhere, too. However, if one considers the story historically accurate, happening in Jesus' life apart from the similar incidents recorded in the other gospels, the question of the authenticity of the parable receives a different answer... John Nolland, following Wilckens' ideas, writes: 'There can hardly be a prior form of the episode not containing the present parable, since this would leave the Pharisee's concerns of v 39 with no adequate response'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{award was}} criticised by some American and European Jewish groups, while other groups offered {{support for the}} award.

Bolton, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that those in the administration who recommended her either ignored her anti-Israel history, or missed it entirely. On the other hand, a group of Israeli human rights organizations including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, B'Tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, Physicians for Human Rights and Yesh Din, stated [...] "as leaders of a sector within Israeli civil society that monitors and often criticizes government and military policy for violating human rights, {{we do not see}} such actions as plausible reason for denying Mrs. Robinson the award." [...] In response to the protests by some Jewish groups and commentators, Robinson said she was “surprised and dismayed” and that [...] "this is old, recycled, untrue stuff,” “I have been very critical of the Palestinian side. My conduct continues to be on the side of tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination,” Robinson said. [...] "There's a lot of bullying by certain elements of the Jewish community. They bully people who try to address the severe situation in Gaza and the West Bank. Archbishop Desmond Tutu gets the same criticism," [...] Robinson also said. In an open letter to Robinson, Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, rejected Robinson's claim at being misunderstood or bullied by those who criticize her role in Durban. He said that she failed to confront purveyors of anti-Israel rhetoric. [...] "You {{may not have been the}} chief culprit of the Durban debacle, but <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> be its preeminent symbol", he added.
