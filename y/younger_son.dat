Generally, {{the eldest son}} of the eldest son of a peer comes {{immediately}} before his uncles, while the <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of the eldest son of a peer come after them. Therefore, eldest sons of eldest sons of dukes come before <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of dukes, and <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of eldest sons of dukes come after them, and so forth for all the ranks. Below the <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of barons are baronets, knights, circuit judges and companions of the various orders of Chivalry, followed by the eldest <b>sons</b> of <b>younger</b> <b>sons</b> of peers.|$|R

5|$|Following Temple's marriage, {{his father}} had {{invested}} in a farming venture by Edward Whalley who was the brother-in-law of Temple's stepsister - Mary Penistone. Sir Alexander apparently intended this to provide an inheritance for his grandchildren (the children of James Temple). As a <b>younger</b> <b>son</b> himself, Sir Alexander wanted to ensure suitable provision for his own <b>younger</b> <b>son.</b> This investment made by Temple's father {{for the benefit of}} his children had apparently become valueless when Edward Whalley fled to Scotland in the late 1630s. However, in the 1650s, Whalley had become a prominent and successful member of the Puritan establishment and there was a possibility of recovering some money. In the late 1650s, Temple and Whalley went to the Court of Chancery to determine what was due to Temple and his children. However, with the death of Oliver Cromwell and the subsequent restoration of Charles II, both regicides were faced with the possibility of execution and the case appears to have been unresolved.|$|E

He did not announce his decision in public {{because he wanted to}} prevent Alice and RogerII of Sicily from intervening.|$|E
