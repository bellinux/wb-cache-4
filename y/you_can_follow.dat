25|$|To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), {{linking the}} towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After {{traveling}} nearly 40km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters you reach the far north of the region, more precisely {{at the foot of}} the massif 'Los Gigantes'. From there <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> the same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing {{the towns of}} San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Raúl Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, and yet they can not access certain areas.|$|E

Its route takes you alongside rivers and canals and through some of the most historic towns and cities in the North of England. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> historic railways and canals and {{follow in the footsteps of}} packhorse traders on ancient salt routes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrasting}} reviews, Film Threats Chris Gore {{said of the}} film, [...] " [...] delivers everything great foreign films should—action, sex, compelling characters, clever filmmaking, it's unpretentious (a {{requirement for}} me) {{and it has a}} story <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> without having to read those annoying subtitles. I can't rave about this film enough—this is passionate filmmaking at its best. One of the best foreign films, heck, one of the best films I have seen", while Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader stated, [...] "About as entertaining as a no-brainer can be—a lot more fun, for my money, than a cornball theme-park ride like Speed, and every bit as fast moving. But don't expect much of an aftertaste." ...|$|E
