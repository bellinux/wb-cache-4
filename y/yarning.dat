40|$|A {{calculation}} {{equation of}} the fibre {{number on the}} cross-section of ring-spun <b>yarn</b> was de-duced theoretically and verified with test data of 20 representative pure cotton ring spun <b>yarns.</b> The equation is practical and convenient to use by substituting the <b>yarn</b> count, <b>yarn</b> twist, and fibre decitex.

The Hanji combination <b>yarn</b> has been improved the weaving ability by complementing the tensile strength of Hanji paper <b>yarn.</b> In the surface structure of the <b>yarn,</b> the rope-dyed cotton <b>yarn</b> showed a rather bulky structure while the cheese-dyed cotton <b>yarn</b> showed a compact structure. The structure of Hanji combination <b>yarns</b> showed that the Hanji single <b>yarn</b> and core spun <b>yarn</b> were tightly combined resulting in a stable form. The optimal weft inserting speed for the Hanji paper <b>yarn</b> was approximately 90 % of the cotton <b>yarn</b> with the same <b>yarn</b> count. Also, the appearance of most Hanji denim fabrics produced showed no significant difference from the existing stretchable denim fabrics indicating commercialization of Hanji denim fabrics as highly possible.|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, for the denim fabrics, the Hanji paper single <b>yarn,</b> core spun <b>yarn,</b> and Hanji {{combination}} <b>yarn</b> {{were used as}} the weft. As shown in Fig.  3, the twisted shape of Hanji paper <b>yarn</b> showed a stable structure with little fluff on the surface unlike that of cotton <b>yarn.</b> The core spun <b>yarn</b> had a slightly bulky structure because the cotton <b>yarn</b> enveloped a spandex filament (core <b>yarn).</b> In the existing denim fabrics, the use of core spun <b>yarn</b> as the weft began {{with the development of}} skinny denim products in recent years, and core spun <b>yarns</b> were commonly used to improve the surface properties of core <b>yarns</b> and to produce stretch fabrics.

40|$|<b>Yarn</b> {{tension is}} a key factor that affects the {{efficiency}} of a ring spinning system. In this paper, a specially constructed rig, which can rotate a <b>yarn</b> at a high speed without inserting any real twist into the <b>yarn,</b> was used to simulate a ring spinning process. <b>Yarn</b> tension was measured at the guide-eye during the simulated spinning of different <b>yarns</b> at various balloon heights and with varying <b>yarn</b> length in the balloon. The effect of balloon shape, <b>yarn</b> hairiness and thickness, and <b>yarn</b> rotating speed, on the measured <b>yarn</b> tension, was examined. The {{results indicate that the}} collapse of balloon shape from single loop to double loop, or from double loop to triple etc, lead to sudden reduction in <b>yarn</b> tension. Under otherwise identical conditions, a longer length of <b>yarn</b> in the balloon gives a lower <b>yarn</b> tension at the guide-eye. In addition, thicker <b>yarns</b> and/or more hairy <b>yarns</b> generate a higher tension in the <b>yarn,</b> due to the increased air drag acting on the thicker or more hairy <b>yarns...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} twist in a <b>yarn</b> helps {{to define the}} style of yarn- a <b>yarn</b> {{with a lot of}} air such as a woollen <b>yarn</b> will have much less twist than a <b>yarn</b> with little air, like a worsted <b>yarn.</b> It also affects the stretchiness of the <b>yarn,</b> {{strength}}, the halo of the <b>yarn,</b> and many other attributes. Filling or weft <b>yarns</b> usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with warp <b>yarns,</b> and highly twisted <b>yarns</b> are, in general, stronger. Warp <b>yarns</b> have to be stronger so that they can withstand the tension of the loom. Filament fibers, such as silk, or many synthetics, need only to be twisted slightly to create a <b>yarn.</b>|$|R
