500|$|The film largely {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. It is [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] on Rotten Tomatoes, having an aggregated score of 81% (based on 62 critics' reviews), {{and an average}} rating of 7.7/10. The site's consensus reads [...] "Matthew Broderick charms in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a light and irrepressibly fun movie about being young and having fun." [...] Roger Ebert gave it {{three out of four}} stars, calling it [...] "one of the most innocent movies in a long time,” and “a sweet, warm-hearted comedy." [...] Richard Roeper called the film [...] "one of my favorite movies of all time. It {{has one of the highest}} 'repeatability' factors of any film I've ever seen ... I can watch it again and again. There's also this, and I say it in all sincerity: Ferris Bueller's Day Off is something of a suicide prevention film, or at the very least a story about a young man trying to help his friend gain some measure of self-worth ... Ferris has made it his mission to show Cameron that the whole world in front of him is passing him by, and that life can be pretty sweet if <b>you</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> and embrace it. That's the lasting message of Ferris Bueller's Day Off." [...] Roeper pays homage to the film with a license plate that reads [...] "SVFRRIS". Conservative columnist George Will hailed Ferris as [...] "the moviest movie," [...] a film [...] "most true to the general spirit of the movies, the spirit of effortless escapism." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{began to}} film the music video for [...] "Diamonds" [...] on October 21, 2012, at the Mojave Desert in Lancaster, California. It was {{directed}} by her regular collaborator Anthony Mandler, who previously directed her videos for [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] (2009) and [...] "Man Down" [...] (2011). Photographs of the production leaked to the press the same day and showed Rihanna in a white and black dress {{in front of a}} fire. Ethan Sacks of the New York Daily News remarked that she [...] "looked like a gem on the set of her video shoot." [...] Rihanna said that she wanted the video's abstract scenes to capture the appropriate emotion for the audience. Mandler sought to create a [...] "wider landscape" [...] by suggesting and transfiguring ideas for viewers through the video: [...] "hey needed to feel like dream vignettes, like, when <b>you</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> from a dream, you realize what you were dreaming about is not really what it was about, it was about something else." [...] He also tried to relate the video's concept to Rihanna's personal life: [...] "What's truth or fiction? You know 'Is she drowning, or is she in complete ecstasy? Are those hands coming apart, or are they finding each other?' ... we tried to bring up these deeper questions that relate to song and her life and finding beauty in chaos and finding beauty in pain and finding pain in beauty." [...] On November 7, a behind-the-scenes video was posted on MTV's official website. It featured Rihanna in a [...] "leopard-print" [...] robe as she emerged from a trailer and headed to the shooting set. The scenes were intercut with police officers who chase armed fighters. Rihanna stands in a deserted landscape in the video's other scenes. The music video for [...] "Diamonds" [...] premiered November 8 on MTV. The video was also made available for streaming at Rihanna.MTV.com. It was digitally released on November 14 via the iTunes Store.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that <b>you</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
