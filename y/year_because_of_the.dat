5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per <b>year</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help {{to find out the}} sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was {{the most}} {{important}} feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, but it also pushed for equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the organization. In the same <b>year,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E
5|$|Little Gidding is {{the fourth}} and final poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets, a series of poems that discuss time, perspective, humanity, and salvation. It was first {{published}} in September 1942 after being delayed for over a <b>year</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air-raids on Great Britain during World War II and Eliot's declining health. The title refers to a small Anglican community in Huntingdonshire, established by Nicholas Ferrar in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Since the opening, {{the venue}} has hosted Gjøvik Hockey, {{which started in}} 1993 in the Fourth Division. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall hosted 16 ice hockey matches between 12 and 26 February, {{including}} two quarter-finals and one semi-final. The remaining matches were played at the larger Håkons Hall in Lillehammer. In March 1995, the operator announced that the ice would remain throughout the <b>year.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural cooling of the mountain, the operator saved 1,000 kilowatts in heating costs by reusing the cooling system to heat {{the rest of the}} cavern hall. On 4 April 1995, the venue was used to host an international match between Norway and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|When Best Champion was {{introduced}} at Crufts in 1905, {{it was seen}} by Charles Cruft {{as an extension of}} the other titles already available at the show. The class was one of several classes reserved for Crufts subscribers at the cost of a guinea per <b>year.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restriction in entry, there were years when the winner of Best Champion was defeated in other classes which were not restricted to subscribers. Crufts was not the first dog show in the UK to introduce this type of title, the first event to do so was at the Cambridge Canine Society Show in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an {{unfavourable}} settlement {{by which}} Wulfred gained {{control over the}} debated monasteries {{in exchange for a}} large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king. Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop. In September 822, Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king, which had been delayed about a <b>year</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dispute with the archbishop. After Ceolwuf's deposition in 823 Wulfred's situation improved. The new Mercian king, Beornwulf, presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down. Coenwulf's daughter Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent. Later in 825 (or possibly the following year), however, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold, and coinage in Wulfred's name appears to have ceased for a time, though it had been restored before Wulfred's death in 832. Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston, shortly before Egbert's death.|$|E

25|$|This myth {{became very}} {{important}} during the Greco-Roman period. For example, {{it was believed}} that the Nile River flooded every <b>year</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tears of sorrow which Isis wept for Osiris. Osiris's death and rebirth was relived each year through rituals. The worship of Isis eventually spread throughout the Greco-Roman world, continuing until the suppression of paganism in the Christian era. The popular motif of Isis suckling her son Horus, however, lived on in a Christianized context as the popular image of Mary suckling her infant son Jesus from the fifth century onward.|$|E
