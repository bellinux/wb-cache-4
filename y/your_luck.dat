5|$|On March 16, 2003, GSN {{was allowed}} to air the episodes, {{including}} a few previously edited-out portions, {{as part of a}} two-hour documentary called Big Bucks: The Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> Scandal, hosted and narrated by Tomarken. The documentary was produced by and aired on GSN (in association with Lionsgate and FremantleMedia, the latter of which now owns the rights to Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck),</b> and broke all previous viewership records for the network. The Big Bucks documentary included additional footage, directly from the original master tapes, that had been edited out of the episodes for their initial broadcast. The original telecast was dedicated to the memory of Bill Carruthers, producer/creator of Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> who had died before the airing.|$|E
5|$|A biopic {{was planned}} in 2000 with Bill Murray to portray Larson, but fell through. Larson's {{performance}} on Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> {{was featured in}} a July 2010 broadcast of This American Life.|$|E
5|$|After Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> Larson {{became an}} {{assistant}} manager at local Walmart stores in Dayton, Lebanon, Xenia and Bellbrook, Ohio. He also ran a promotions and marketing company, Group Dynamics Downline, {{out of his}} Lebanon home.|$|E

6000|$|Shillito said nothing, and Cartwright went on: [...] "My antagonists are old card-players {{who know}} the game; but when you broke Forman he was drunk {{and the other two}} were not quite sober. You play against young fools and <b>your</b> <b>luck's</b> too good. If you force me to tell all I think and {{something}} that I know. I imagine you'll get a straight hint to quit." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, never clean on New Year's Day, as it signifies {{sweeping}} all of <b>your</b> good <b>luck</b> {{out of the}} house.|$|R
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> was thirty minutes {{in length and}} prior to Larson's appearance, the series had never needed to {{straddle}} games or stop during play as a match would always be completed within the allotted time frame.|$|E
5|$|After the {{broadcast}} of Larson's two episodes, CBS suppressed the episodes for 19 years, {{as both the}} network and Carruthers at that time considered the incident {{to be one of}} their biggest embarrassments. When USA Network (and later, GSN) bought the rights to rerun Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> CBS and Carruthers insisted that the Larson episodes must not be aired.|$|E
5|$|GSN {{produced}} 65 episodes for {{the first}} season, which began airing April 15, 2002. The series was eventually renewed for a second season, which consisted of 65 additional episodes that premiered March 17, 2003. Following {{the conclusion of the}} Tournament of Champions, which completed its run on July 25, a combination of first-run new episodes and reruns continued to air until December 5. Additionally, a short-lived Filipino version of the show aired on GMA Network in 2007–08. The series, entitled Whammy! Push <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> was hosted by Paolo Bediones and Rufa Mae Quinto.|$|E
5000|$|The rival paper, The Bicycle wrote: [...] "Goodbye, Holland. Do not be {{discouraged}} by <b>your</b> bad <b>luck.</b> You are {{the man of}} the Tour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take her, Edgar. 'Tis {{not often}} {{that a young}} knight gains castle, and land, and bride in twenty-four hours. May <b>your</b> good <b>luck</b> {{continue}} all <b>your</b> life." ...|$|R

5|$|In May 1984, Larson {{used most}} of his savings to fly to Los Angeles to {{audition}} for Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck.</b> Contestant supervisor Bobby Edwards was suspicious of Larson's motives when he interviewed Larson on May 19, and was unwilling to allow him on the show, but executive producer Bill Carruthers overruled him, a move he said he later regretted. Larson was added as a contestant on the fourth episode of the taping session, intended to air Friday, June 8, 1984.|$|E
5|$|Originally from southwestern Ohio, Larson {{used his}} cash {{winnings}} for taxes {{and real estate}} investments. However, he also had problems with the law and was involved in illegal schemes. As a result, Larson lost all of his winnings within {{two years of the}} show's taping and moved to Florida, where he later died of throat cancer at the age of 49. Since his death in 1999, Larson's game has re-aired on TV at various times and inspired the 2003 Game Show Network documentary Big Bucks: The Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> Scandal.|$|E
5|$|When Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> {{returned}} after the weekend break, the episode {{started with the}} same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers {{up to speed on}} what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead {{into and out of the}} first two commercial breaks, with voice overs by Tomarken leading into and out of them.|$|E

5|$|In his eighties, Nielsen {{performed}} serious roles {{on screen}} and stage (such as his one-man theatre show Darrow, {{in which he}} played Clarence Darrow), {{as well as providing}} voice-overs and appearances for commercials; cartoons like Zeroman where he had the leading role/voice; children's shows, such as Pumper Pups, which he narrated, in addition to comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, the Honourable Erik Nielsen, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, served as the premise of an HBO mockumentary entitled The Canadian Conspiracy in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS's Gameshow Marathon, where he played The Price Is Right, Let's Make a Deal, Beat the Clock, and Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> for charity.|$|E
5|$|Spins {{earned in}} this round could be {{passed to the}} {{opponent}} with the higher total (if they were tied, the contestant passing the spins could choose the recipient). Contestants were required to use all spins passed until they used their spins or hit a Whammy; in the latter case, any remaining passed spins were transferred to their earned spin total. If a contestant using passed spins hit a space that awarded a spin (e.g., $3,000 + One Spin), that spin {{was added to the}} earned total. The contestant in the lead {{at the end of the}} game kept any cash and/or prizes in their bank at that time. Unlike Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> three new contestants appeared on each episode.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> with contestants accumulating cash and prizes {{and attempting to}} avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At {{the start of the}} game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in round one reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to her work in big-budget productions, Baker also appeared in small, independent films, such as Just <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> (1996) and Nowhere to Go (1997). The '90s also had Baker more frequently appearing on television series, including episodes of Grand (1990), Tales from the Crypt (1991, opposite Teri Garr in a segment directed by Michael J. Fox), Murder, She Wrote and L.A. Law (both 1993); Chicago Hope (1995), and Roswell (1999). In 2000, she appeared in the Lifetime film Another Woman's Husband. In 2002, Baker appeared in the documentary Cinerama Adventure, and guest-starred on an episode of The Lyon's Den, playing Rob Lowe's mother. Her role on The Lyon's Den was Baker's last screen appearance before she formally retired from acting in 2003. Her acting career spanned 50 years, and more than 80 roles in film, television, and theater.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{a massive}} change in both {{leadership}} and programming {{at the network}} took place. Liberty Media acquired a 50% stake in the network and changed its leadership. President Michael Fleming and vice president Jake Tauber were both fired and former Fox Family Channel president Rich Cronin were hired to head the network. He and incoming vice president Bob Boden began the biggest original programming venture since the network's inception, launching Whammy! The All-New Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> Friend or Foe?, Russian Roulette, Lingo, WinTuition and Cram. In addition, {{in the fall of}} 2001, the network acquired the rights to air the classic Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> (excluding the Michael Larson episodes, due to pressure from CBS; this angered many fans, resulting in CBS eventually giving Game Show Network the rights to the Larson episodes, airing them in a separate package, as well as in conjunction with the documentary Big Bucks: The Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> Scandal).|$|E
25|$|To date, The Edge of Night is {{the last}} regularly-scheduled ABC network program to have aired in the 4:00-4:30p.m. (Eastern Time) time slot; ABC {{returned}} the half-hour slot to its affiliates after The Edge of Night finished its run. NBC had done this in 1979, while CBS, which programmed the 4:00p.m. time slot with Body Language at the time The Edge of Night left the air, followed suit in September 1986 after cancelling Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck</b> a month prior.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{game show}} offerings since 2000 have {{included}} Hollywood Showdown, Inquizition, All New 3's a Crowd, Mall Masters, Whammy! The All-New Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> Friend or Foe? (a game {{based on the}} Prisoner's Dilemma), Russian Roulette, WinTuition, Cram, National Lampoon's Funny Money and Lingo (a Chuck Woolery-hosted revival of the 1987–88 Canadian format in which teams guess five-letter words in a combination of Jotto/Mastermind and bingo). The network produced six seasons of the show from 2002 to 2007.|$|E
25|$|From Fremantle, {{the network}} {{licenses}} Match Game (Rayburn), Family Feud (Karn, O'Hurley, and Harvey), Card Sharks (Perry and Eubanks), Press <b>Your</b> <b>Luck,</b> and Sale of the Century. GSN had licensed the entire Mark Goodson-Bill Todman library {{from its inception}} until March 2009 and has, in the past, also licensed Let's Make a Deal (another Fremantle property) for air on the network. Older versions of these shows are now aired on rival channel Buzzr, which is a sub-channel on many broadcast television stations in major cities.|$|E
25|$|For local single player, {{the game}} offers Story mode, a plot-driven mode with cutscenes between fights; and Living Towers, an evolved form of Mortal Kombats Challenge Tower where the play {{conditions}} change. Also locally, player vs. player mode is available. Playing online, the play modes include 1 vs. 1 (ranked or random), King of the Hill, Survivor, and Test <b>Your</b> <b>Luck.</b> Another new mode is Faction Wars, where the players choose {{one from the}} five factions to align with, and join a persistent online cross-platform competition with others, winning points for their faction, contributing in the conflict between them, ranking up personally, and earning special rewards such as faction-specific finishing moves (one of which is unlocked to the player if their faction wins {{at the end of}} any given week).|$|E
