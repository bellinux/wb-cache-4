5000|$|Writer Nat Segaloff called Milius:The best {{writer of}} the {{so-called}} USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated - some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s ... Raised on Ford, Hawks, Lean and Kurosawa, shaped by filmmakers as disparate as Fellini and Delmer Daves, Milius favours history books over comic books, character over special effects, and heroes with roots in reality, time, place and customs. Milius' stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends ... Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.Milius himself once said:Never compromise excellence. To write for someone else is the biggest mistake that any writer makes. You should be your biggest competitor, your biggest critic, your biggest fan, because <b>you</b> don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> anybody <b>else</b> thinks. How arrogant it is to assume that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the market, that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what’s</b> popular today - only Steven Spielberg <b>knows</b> <b>what’s</b> popular today. Only Steven Spielberg will ever <b>know</b> <b>what’s</b> popular. So leave it to him. He’s {{the only one in}} the history of man who has ever figured that out. Write what you want to see. Because if you don’t, you’re not going to have any true passion in it, and it’s not going to be done with any true artistry.|$|R

The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'What elements of your writing performances would you identify as strong or successful, and why? What defines success for you? What do you think determines success for this instructor?'Brief excerpt from interview: I think having to write the journal articles after you did the work was successful, because {{you were able to}} remember what you had done and give an accurate description. We did not have much collaboration, but when we met in class we would sit in a circle and everyone would share what they had been doing, to see where everybody else was at. Otherwise, {{it would have been a}} little daunting, given an assignment but <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> everybody <b>else</b> is doing. It helped to keep you on track [...] . It was different [from traditional papers], but in the end it was easier to write and I felt more comfortable with the end product because basically, I am the textbook. I'm the one writing it [...] . I think [success for the course was] having us feel like whatever placement we did was really gonna supplement our future, reflecting that through the writing, because what [the instructor was] hoping to get out of it is that we all feel comfortable going into whatever our professional future may be, having had this experience and feeling more prepared for it. So I think for her, a reflection that shows that you felt it was valuable towards your future was what she would define as success [...] . My major is so specified [...] . that other coursework was part of it [...] . I had attended programs, become an educator, and got to put that on my resume [...] . I wrote my resume before we went through it in class [...] . I had already written a resume [...] . Someone from Career Services came into our class several times [...] . resume [...] . cover letters [...] . how to interview [...] . I did edit my resume, we were supposed to supply and edit a draft [...] . It did really help me to write a resume, because it was the first time I had written a formal one...|$|R
