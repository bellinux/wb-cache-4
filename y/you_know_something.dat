500|$|Regarding the 1939 New York World's Fair {{itself and}} its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: [...] "...obviously the title refers to the World Expo {{and the spirit of}} that was looking at the future with a sense of {{optimism}} and a sense of the whimsical, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>something</b> that we've lost a lot in our fantasies. We're more cynical, more practical, ... I think what this film attempts to do is to take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we're fixated upon today." ...|$|E
500|$|Film {{scholars}} and historians view Citizen Kane as Welles's {{attempt to create}} a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of film making, and combining them all into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started the work on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, [...] "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{score is}} mostly low-key, with the {{exception}} of the suspense and death scenes. It was performed by a union orchestra, obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score. Walker described her score as [...] "very theme-driven, conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well-defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling". The [...] "Main Title" [...] piece, used for the opening credits, was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time. [...] "What a treat for me to get to write a piece that calls you into the movie and lets <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> bad is going to happen from the get go", Walker said. According to Walker, [...] "Main Title" [...] consumed most of her time, due to its [...] "dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout the score".|$|E

2500|$|On his blog, Hilton is {{open about}} his {{homosexuality}} {{and about his}} desire to out those who he claims are closeted gay celebrities. When former 'N Sync member Lance Bass came out as gay on July 26, 2006, Hilton received criticism for having been partially responsible in the outing. [...] "It upsets me that people think what I'm doing is a bad thing", Hilton told Access Hollywood. [...] "I don't think it's a bad thing.
