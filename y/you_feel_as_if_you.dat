500|$|Amy Taubin of Film Comment {{described}} The Hurt Locker as [...] "a structuralist war movie" [...] and [...] "a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety {{experience from}} beginning to end." [...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you,</b> like the characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E
500|$|At Game Revolution, Devin Charles wrote a very {{positive}} review, awarding the game a 4.5/5 score. He felt that the game was very replayable, praising the amount of content that the game delivered {{as well as its}} online play. [...] "The game's overall presentation is solid, with the commentary and action cutscenes always making <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{are a part of the}} heated battles and help keep the game flowing and relevant," [...] Charles stated in his review. His only criticism was the HUT mode and how little it was altered from the previous year.|$|E
2500|$|Kris Graft for Gamasutra {{commented that}} many players and journalists had both high {{expectations}} for the game as well as wide expectations, with some believing that it would be, among other aspects, the [...] "best space sim", the [...] "best multiplayer action shooter", and the [...] "best pure exploration game". Ars Technicas Kyle Orland found that unlike Spore or Fable which had [...] "saturation PR campaigns that promised revolutionary and industry-changing gameplay features" [...] which failed {{to be present in}} the final releases, Hello Games' statements about No Man's Sky were [...] "relatively restrained and realistic about what they were promising". Orland surmises that many players and journalists [...] "layer their own expectations onto the game's gaps" [...] from what Hello Games actually claimed. Vlambeer's founder Rami Ismail considered the strength of the marketing campaign by Hello Games and Sony to generate interest in the game, calling the pitch using the concept of magnitudes and scale rather than absolutes as [...] "a little masterclass in explaining an abstract concept to the largest possible audience"; Polygons Ben Kuchera agreed on this point, but considered that the marketing may have gotten away from Sony and Hello Games since players did not have a concrete understanding of the game's limitations prior to launch. Murray himself was aware of the [...] "unrealistic, intangible level of excitement" [...] that fans had of the game and given that they had been waiting three years to play it, would be expecting it to be perfect. He countered that he felt he and Hello Games tried to be [...] "reasonably open and honest about what the game is" [...] all throughout the marketing cycle to set expectations. On the day before the official release, Murray cautioned players that No Man's Sky may not have been [...] "the game you imagined from those trailers" [...] and instead that the title was meant as a [...] "very very chill game", giving players a universe-sized sandbox that makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> [...] "stepped into a sci-fi book cover"; Murray believed the game would have a [...] "super divisive" [...] response from players due to some of these expectations.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because I've such illuminations? Why they're all {{for your}} help! It's what I told you," [...] she added, [...] "just now. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> this were wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll tell you. When you've landed {{and crossed}} up from Liverpool, and struck London, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you'd gone to sea again. It's an ocean--a whole Atlantic of houses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{in reading}} it <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were {{far away from}} England--really in Italy--under another sort of sky--that blue sky of the south which {{travellers}} describe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little did {{we think}} {{where we should}} meet again, and why, Mr. Ogilvie. Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had got into 'Tales of the Alhambra,' or into the 'Tempest'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Margaret, [...] "it's so very nice, every way; {{it makes}} <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{did have a}} country, after all. It's as chic--that detestable little word!--as those new French books." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw him on}} {{the street}} in Ripton the other day, and he came right up and spoke to me. He hadn't {{forgotten}} my name. Now, he'd be my notion of a candidate. He makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> your presence in the world meant something to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I can't explain, precisely; but it's {{something}} {{that all the}} critics say of a book that is very strong, don't you know; and masterful; and relentless; and makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> somebody had taken you by the throat; and shakes you up awfully; and seems to throw you into the air, and trample you under foot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We were charmed. It's {{a quaint}} old {{place and the}} country round is so green and quiet. Everything's smooth and well-kept; the trees look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{somebody}} had taught them how they ought to grow. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all the rough work had been done long since and folks have only {{to take care of}} things. I like it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And isn't it jolly {{when you}} discard furs and winter {{garments}} {{for the first}} time and sally forth, like this, in spring attire?" [...] laughed Priscilla. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had been made over new?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Jenny. 'But it's so high. And you see {{the clouds}} rushing on above the narrow streets, not minding them, and {{you see the}} golden arrows {{pointing}} at the mountains in the sky from which the wind comes, and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were dead.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you satisfied? Does it {{seem like}} home, and do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should be happy here?" [...] asked Mrs. March, as she and her {{daughter}} went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.|$|E
6000|$|Bernard {{was by far}} {{the most}} altered. The others were {{slightly}} changed, but still their [...] "old selves," [...] while he was a grave responsible man, looking older than Lancelot, partly from the effects of climate; but Angela saw enough to make her exclaim, [...] "Here we are! Don't <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were had down to Felix to be blown up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{she does}} it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind much. She {{is the sort of}} woman who knows how to rule well. In fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was doing you a favor all the while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if {{you love}} me," [...] said she, {{speaking}} quickly, with an altered voice; [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> to use your own words, you could 'grow to my heart,' it will be neither shock nor pain for {{you to know that}} that heart is the source whence yours was filled; that from my veins issued the tide which flows in yours; that you are mine--my daughter--my own child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{might be}} a sort of {{protection}} for me, if you remained in it,' said Mr Boffin; 'you might stand betwixt him and me, and take the edge off him. Don't <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could make a show of remaining in it, Venus, till I had time to turn myself round?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will go at an easy canter now, Annie. If <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{could not}} keep on, call out, and we will stop directly; but first come up between Surajah and myself, and we will take the leading reins, so {{that you will have}} nothing to attend to but holding on." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{consequence}} of this remark was another 'Pshaw!' But Mrs. Peck went on--'When you've lived opposite to people {{like that for a}} long time <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were acquainted. But she didn't take it up to-day; she didn't speak to me. She knows who I am as well as she knows her own mother.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{just the}} sort of day <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> things might happen," [...] said Faith, {{responsive}} to the lure of crystal air and blue hills. She hugged herself with delight and danced a hornpipe on old Hezekiah Pollock's bench tombstone, much to the horror of two ancient maidens who happened to be driving past just as Faith hopped on one foot around the stone, waving the other and her arms in the air.|$|R
500|$|Idol {{hoped to}} advance the way stagecraft and {{lighting}} were used at rock concerts. [...] "Part of {{the idea is to}} create an element of visible language," [...] Idol explained during an interview with the New York Times, [...] "so that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you're being talked to through images. I think you have to start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking to Rolling Stone, Shinedown {{front man}} Brent Smith {{discussed}} {{the lyrics of}} the song as [...] "about not feeling like you can't stand up for yourself and take back your self respect <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> someone is belittling you or trying to push you around. The song is not condoning violence. What it is condoning is survival. I don't think that anyone should ever have their self-respect or their dignity taken from them." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{consequence}} of this remark was another [...] "Pshaw!" [...] But Mrs. Peck went on: [...] "When you've lived opposite to people {{like that for a}} long time <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had some rights in them--tit for tat! But she didn't take it up today; she didn't speak to me. She knows who I am as well as she knows her own mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{wife did}} not regard him. [...] "I don't know what Miss Anderson's {{principles}} are, but her practices are perfect. I never knew her do an unkind or shabby thing. She seems {{very good and}} very wise. And that deep voice of hers has such a charm. It's so restful. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could repose upon it for a thousand years. Well! You will get down before we leave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, only ten, {{but that}} was pretty well for a fourteen-year-old dressmaker. You ought to have seen the little witch laugh in her sleeve when any one admired the dress, for she wore it all summer and looked as pretty as a pink in it. Such things are great fun when {{you get used to}} them; besides, contriving sharpens your wits, and makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had more hands than most people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it {{was kind}} of meechin', our takin' up with his offer, after what's--" [...] Whitwell delicately forbore to fill out his sentence.|$|R
5000|$|In J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye {{this novel}} is {{mentioned}} by Holden Caulfield. Caulfield singles out the character, Eustacia Vye, a wild-spirited and confident woman, who {{is portrayed as}} an outsider in the community. Holden indicates that he likes a book that makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the author is a friend that you could call. He adds that he’d like to call Thomas Hardy, and also that he likes “that Eustacia Vye.” Later he wonders what a nun would think of her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} met with {{moderate}} commercial success and favorable reviews. The single [...] "Sick of Myself" [...] reached #2 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and appeared on the top 100 pop song charts of the day. Critic David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, who included 100% Fun on his year's-best list, wrote in his review that it [...] "makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a good pop hook can solve any crisis." [...] The title of the album was derived from Kurt Cobain's 1994 suicide note.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very much," [...] {{said the}} expert. [...] "Chaps are {{generally}} too done {{up at the}} end of the day to want to do anything except sleep. Still, I've known cases. You sometimes get one tent mobbing another. They loose the ropes, you know. Low trick, I think. It isn't often done, and it gets dropped on like bricks when it's found out. But why? Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wanted to do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, my dear, I {{dare say}} {{it may be}} better to keep to your proper name at once. We won't take liberties with it, till <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could call this home,' said Lady Merrifield, looking as if she would have kissed her niece on the {{slightest}} encouragement, {{but no one ever}} looked less kissable than Dolores Mohun at that moment. Was it not cruel and hypocritical to talk of this tiresome multitude as ever making home? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Goodby, my boy," [...] said Ben as he {{took the}} boy's hand in his. [...] "Don't forget this {{experience}} you've had in runnin' away; an if ever the time comes that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wanted to know that you had a friend, think of Old Ben, an' remember that his heart beats just as warm for you as if he was your father. Goodby, my boy, goodby, an' may the good God bless you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Kingsbury {{leaned forward}} and asked Charles Bellingham if he had read Tears, Idle Tears, the novel that was making such a sensation; and when he said no, she said she {{wondered}} at him. [...] "It's perfectly heart-breaking, as you'll imagine from the name; but there's such a dear old-fashioned hero and heroine in it, who keep dying for {{each other all the}} way through, and making the most wildly satisfactory and unnecessary sacrifices for each other. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you'd done them yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I must go; but I don't {{know how}} to tear myself from the sight of <b>you.</b> I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I was driven from {{the only place where}} I ever might be good.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Evans' 2014 release, The Raid 2: Berandal, cast Yayan as Prakoso, {{an assassin}} and confidante of mafia kingpin Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo). Recognising that Yayan {{had already been}} {{identified}} with Mad Dog, Evans emphasized that Prakoso was a new character: a failed father and husband, aged sixty, who is nevertheless a faithful employee. As with the earlier film, Yayan worked with Iko on choreography. Charlotte O'Sullivan of the London Evening Standard found Yayan's portrayal of Prakoso [...] "sublime", writing that [...] "when his body starts flying through the air, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you’re reading his life story".|$|R
