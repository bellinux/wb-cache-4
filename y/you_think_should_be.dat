I have {{carefully}} read your several schemes and proposals, which <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> offered to the Parliament. In answer, I will assure you, that, in another place, I have known very good proposals rejected with contempt by public assemblies, merely because they were offered from without doors; and yours, perhaps, might have the same fate, especially if handed into the public by me, who am not acquainted with three members, nor have the least interest with one. My printers have been twice prosecuted, to my great expense, on account of discourses I writ for the public service, without the least reflection on parties or persons; and the success I had in those of the Drapier, was not owing to my abilities, but to a lucky juncture, when the fuel was ready for the first hand that would be at the pains of kindling it. It is true, both those envenomed prosecutions were the workmanship of a judge, who is now gone to his own place.[95] But, let that be as it will, I am determined, henceforth, never to be the instrument of leaving an innocent man at the mercy of that bench.|$|E

[...] Smith said that [...] "a home-owned newspaper has a responsibility to try to improve the community, not for business reasons alone, but also for the welfare of the citizens." [...] Central Newspapers, originally held by Eugene S. Pulliam, the uncle of former Vice President Dan Quayle, held The Town Talk for only four years; the company itself was sold in 2000 to the Virginia-based Gannett Company.|$|E

In his note, Luk Van Langenhove suggests that the EU – a world leader in scientific research and innovation – could enhance its effectiveness in the multilateral arena by making better use of its science diplomacy in the realm of foreign policy. The article argues that science diplomacy would add value to EU action on the global stage, particularly with regard to its role as a regional security actor, commercial power and frontrunner in addressing global challenges such as climate change, energy and food security, and societal issues. It concludes that the ongoing EU Global Strategy process should be seized to raise the profile of science diplomacy in EU foreign policy thinking...|$|E

40|$|Note {{from the}} {{coordinator}} This issue gives me particular pleasure, for which I thank the authors. For {{the first time}} since launching this InfoBull all contributions were unsolicited! Better yet, we were able to pick and choose among manuscripts offered. So perhaps we are over one daunting hill that faces all new serials.

It might encour-age those in academic institutions to know that all arti-cles in this issue have been peer reviewed. This is anoth-er first. I intend to continue that, so your time and efforts will not be wasted. However, it remains a constant problem to catch rele-vant items of new literature.
