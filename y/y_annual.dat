40|$|Background Obesity is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality and is associated with high medical expenditures. It has been suggested that obesity prevention could result in cost savings. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the annual and lifetime medical costs attributable to obesity, to compare those to similar costs attributable to smoking, and to discuss the implications for prevention. Methods and Findings With a simulation model, lifetime health-care costs were estimated for a cohort of obese people aged 20 y at baseline. To assess the impact of obesity, comparisons were made with similar cohorts of smokers and ''healthy-living'' persons (defined as nonsmokers with a body mass index between 18. 5 and 25). Except for relative risk values, all input parameters of the simulation model were based on data from The Netherlands. In sensitivity analyses the effects of epidemiologic parameters and cost definitions were assessed. Until age 56 <b>y,</b> <b>annual</b> health expenditure was highest for obese people. At older ages, smokers incurred higher costs. Because of differences in life expectancy, however, lifetime health expenditure was highest among healthy-living people and lowest for smokers. Obese individuals held an intermediate position. Alternative values of epidemiologic parameters and cost definitions did not alter these conclusions. Conclusions Although effective obesity prevention leads to a decrease in costs of obesity-related diseases, this decrease is offset by cost increases due to diseases unrelated to obesity in life-years gained. Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...|$|E

The power function of discounted cash flows was used in calculations. It is shown that the joint analysis of the entire set of investment efficiency criteria (not only LCOE as it is often done) can help avoid contradictions in assessing the NPP project profitability and formulate optimal requirements on the reactor engineering and economic parameters. The obtained analytical expressions provide solutions not only of the traditional «direct problem» (assessing efficiency criteria according to the forecasted capital and operating costs and profit stream) but, which is of equal importance, the solution of the «inverse problem»: assessing restrictions on capital and operating costs, i. e. identifying «investment corridors», based on the desired values of efficiency criteria. The investment risk assessment results obtained by Monte-Carlo method are presented in order to account for the inherent uncertainties in the forecasts of long-term cash flow during the NPP construction and operation required for assessing the efficiency of investments. The calculation results of probability distributions of the investment efficiency (profitability) criteria are presented for the specified ranges of uncertainties the forecasted cash flow. It is shown that the risk of project unprofitability can be quite high. In order to reduce investment risks, it is necessary to justify the changes in basic reactor parameters (decrease in K, Y, TC and increase in R and TE) and uncertainty ranges in the initial data...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increasing}} periods under sugarcane monoculture on soil quality on a Glenrosa soil {{on the south}} coast and on a Hutton soil in the midlands was investigated. The organic C content at both sites under undisturbed vegetation was 46 g/kg This declined exponentially with increasing years under sugarcane and reached a new equilibrium level of about 34 g/kg for the Hutton soil and 13 g/kg for the Glenrosa soil. The higher organic matter content maintained at the Hutton site was attributed to clay protection of organic matter since the clay content of the Hutton soil was 62 % compared with 18 % for the Glenrosa one. The loss of soil organic matter resulted in a concomitant decline in soil microbial biomass C, basal respiration and aggregate stability. Changes in the soil organic matter status in the soil profile to 40 cm depth under various cropping histories were compared at one site in the midlands on a Hutton soil. The known cropping histories were> 50 y kikuyu pasture,> 50 <b>y</b> <b>annual</b> ryegrass pasture,> 30 y continuous maize,> 30 y continuous sugarcane and undisturbed veld. Compared to veld, kikuyu pasture resulted in a large accumulation of soil organic matter in the surface 10 cm. Soil organic matter was similar under annual pasture and veld but both sugarcane and maize production resulted in a substantial decline in organic matter in the surface 10 cm. Trends in microbial biomass C and basal respiration with treatment and depth {{were similar to those}} for organic C except values for sugarcane were less than those for maize. This was attributed to the fallow nature of the sugarcane interrow soil. It was concluded that long-term sugarcane (and maize) causes a marked decline in soil organic matter content and related soil microbial and physical properties. Practices such as retention of crop residues, zero tillage and the use of green crops in rotation should be considered as methods of arresting soil degradation under continuous arable cropping...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} the temporal and spatial variability of the erosional system in two adjacent cultivated catchments located in the Belgian Loam belt. Annual catchment erosion rates, calculated for the whole catchment area, range between 1 and 15 m(3) /ha. <b>y.</b> Mean <b>annual</b> catchment erosion rates calculated for a three year period, were 5. 4 m(3) /ha. y and 8. 2 m(3) /ha. y despite relatively low slope gradients. About 60 to 70 % of the total soil loss due to rill and ephemeral gully erosion occurred in late spring and early summer. This is attributed to the higher frequency of high-intensity low-frequency storms falling on a very dry soil surface in late spring and early summer. The relative importance of ephemeral gully erosion is strongly influenced by the season: mean ratio of ephemeral gully erosion rates to rill erosion rates equals ca. 1. 7 in winter and ca. 1. 0 in summer. Ephemeral gully erosion in topographically defined now paths is the dominant sediment source and represents 41 % of the total soil loss. During the survey period, about 90 % of the material eroded upstream was transported outside the catchment. As a result, villages situated downstream were severily damaged by flooding and major sedimentation events. status: publishe...|$|R

The sites were on matorral vegetation affected to varying intensities by grazing and fire.

Rainfall simulation experiments were made on circular 55 -cm diameter target area plots using the Calvo simulator at an intensities between 35 and 59 mm hy 1. On limestone, it was found that on bare surfaces, the coarse soil aggregation increases with depth at the highest sites and decreases at the lower sites. The Benidorm surface soil has the highest erodibility. The least stable soils are at the lower intermediate sites. On marls, the aggregate stability is generally high in contrast to those under cultivation. Simulated runoff from the wetter limestone sites is very low. The driest areas have the highest runoff and sediment yields. Trends with climate suggest that the erosional responses of the soils indeed increase with aridity and temperature but local factors have a large effect, particularly at intermediate altitudes.

This paper compares the response of a lowland dipterocarp forest at Danum, Sabah, {{in a period of}} low (LDI) and a period of high (HDI) drought intensity (1986 - 96, 9. 98 y; 1996 - 99, 2. 62 <b>y).</b> Mean <b>annual</b> drought intensity was two-fold higher in the HDI than LDI period (1997 v. 976 mm), and each period had one moderately strong main drought (viz. 1992, 1998). Mortality of `all' trees {{greater than or equal to}} 10 cm gbh (girth at breast height) and stem growth rates of `small' trees 10 less than or equal to 50 cm gbh were measured in sixteen 0. 16 -ha subplots (half on ridge, half on lower slope sites) within two 4 -ha plots. These 10 - 50 -cm trees were composed largely of true understorey species. A new procedure was developed to correct for the effect of differences in length of census interval when comparing tree mortality rates. Mortality rates of small trees declined slightly but not significantly between the LDI and HDI periods (1. 53 to 1. 48 % y(- 1)) : mortality of all trees showed a similar pattern. Relative growth rates declined significantly by 23 % from LDI to HDI periods (11. 1 to 8. 6 mm m(- 1) y(- 1)) : for absolute growth rates the decrease was 28 % (2. 45 to 1. 77 mm y(- 1)). Neither mortality nor growth rates were significantly influenced by topography. For small trees, across subplots, absolute growth rate was positively correlated in the LDI period, but negatively correlated in the HDI period, with mortality rate. There was no consistent pattern in the responses among the 19 most abundant species (n greater than or equal to 50 trees) which included a proposed drought-tolerant guild.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{lifetime and}} population energy budgets {{of the extraordinary}} long-lived ocean quahog Arctica islandica from 6 different sites - the Norwegian coast, Kattegat, Kiel Bay, White Sea, German Bight, and off northeast Iceland - covering a temperature and salinity gradient of 4 - 10 °C (annual mean) and 25 - 34, respectively. Based on von Bertalanffy growth models and size-mass relationships, we computed organic matter production of body (PSB) and of shell (PSS), whereas gonad production (PG) was estimated from the seasonal cycle in mass. Respiration (R) was computed by a model driven by body mass, temperature, and site. A. islandica populations differed distinctly in maximum life span (40 y in Kiel Bay to 197 y in Iceland), but less in growth performance (phi' ranged from 2. 41 in the White Sea to 2. 65 in Kattegat). Individual lifetime energy throughput, as approximated by assimilation, was highest in Iceland (43, 730 kJ) and lowest in the White Sea (313 kJ). Net growth efficiency ranged between 0. 251 and 0. 348, whereas lifetime energy investment distinctly shifted from somatic to gonad production with increasing life span; PS/PG decreased from 0. 362 (Kiel Bay, 40 y) to 0. 031 (Iceland, 197 <b>y).</b> Population <b>annual</b> energy budgets were derived from individual budgets and estimates of population mortality rate (0. 035 /y in Iceland to 0. 173 /y in Kiel Bay).

40|$|The {{mechanisation}} of {{the agriculture}} {{and the increased}} production lead {{to a change in}} land use in Norway during the 1950 ies and 1960 ies. The government decided to sup-port grain production in south-eastern Norway and reduced the subsidies for milk pro-duction in this area compared with other parts of Norway. This caused more monocul-ture grain production in south-eastern Norway, but also land levelling and cultivation of new land. This was partly also happening in middle part of Norway however not to the same extent as in south-eastern Norway. The levelling of steep land was allowing mechanisation of areas which has been used for grazing before. Especially the land levelling led to very visible erosion by heavy rilling and gullying. It thus became clear that parts of the agricultural area in Norway had erosion problems and this led to the start of erosion research during the late 1970 <b>ies.</b> The <b>annual</b> precipitation in south-eastern Norway varying from 700 – 800 and increases from May to November and so it declines. The monthly variation is high and can some years be 2 – 3 times higher than the average. Especially when high pre-cipitation is occurring in late autumn the agricultural areas are very susceptible to erosion. Intense showers in the growing season happen but are rare. The tempera-ture during winter (December to March) is in average below zero. However, even if some winters can be very cold, other can be very mild and the precipitation will be in the form of rain. Even in mild winters there will be cold periods and the sur-face layer will be frozen. These events can have a dramatic effect on soil erosion and surface runoff.

We analyze a {{long-term}} contracting problem involving common uncertainty about a parameter capturing {{the productivity of}} the relationship, and featuring a hidden action for the agent. We develop an approach that works for any utility function when the parameter and noise are normally distributed and when the effort and noise affect output additively. We then analytically solve for the optimal contract when the agent has exponential utility. We find that the Pareto frontier shifts out as information about the agent’s quality improves. In the standard spot-market setup, by contrast, when the parameter measures the agent’s “quality”, the Pareto frontier shifts inwards with better information. Commitment is therefore more valuable when quality is known more precisely. Incentives then are easier to provide because the agent has less room to manipulate the beliefs of the principal.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of kale (Brassica oleracea acephala) juice supplementa-tion on serum lipid levels and phospholipid (PL) fatty acid compositions in hypercholesterolemic men. Thirty-two men with hypercholesterolemia (> 200 mg/dl) were recruited among the faculty and staff at <b>Y</b> University after <b>annual</b> health examinations. The subjects consumed 150 ml of kale juice per day for a 12 -week intervention period. Dietary and anthropometric assessments were performed before and after supplementation, respectively, to ensure that the subjects maintained their usual diet and lifestyle throughout the intervention. Serum concentrations of HDL-cholesterol and the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to LDL-cholesterol were significantly increased (p< 0. 001) after intervention. Serum LDL-cholesterol concentration and atherogenic index were significantly reduced (p< 0. 001). Levels of 12 : 0, 14 : 0, 18 : 1 ω 9, 18 : 3 ω 6, and sum of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in serum pholspholipid (PL) were significantly increased, while 22 : 4 ω 6 level was significantly reduced (p< 0. 05). It can be speculated that kale juice, containing large amounts of antioxidant nutrients, contributes to changes of serum-PL-fatty acid compositions and the improvements of serum lipid profiles. This study demon-strates the supplementation of regular meals with kale juice may favorably affect serum lipid profiles and serum-PL fatty acid compositions and, hence, could lower the risks of coronary artery disease in men with hypercholesterolemia...|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1920s the {{influence}} of the recently established National Museum of Wales starts to make its mark on the association. Mortimer Wheeler was appointed keeper of archaeology in 1922, and in 1924 he became director of the museum. He immediately started on notable excavations on the Roman sites of Segontium on the outskirts of Caernarvon and Brecon Gaer. These volumes were published in <b>Y</b> Cymmrodor, an <b>annual</b> journal of the Society of Cymmrodorion rather than in Archaeologia Cambrensis, presumably because the Cambrians would not devote a single volume to each excavation. Archaeologia Cambrensis was still being published quarterly in a quarto format, which could not be adapted for the publication of excavation reports with large plans. As a result, Archaeologia Cambrensis was changed to the larger quarto format in 1928. 'Mortimer Wheeler encouraged non-professional archaeologists, such as the Bangor Architect Harold Hughes and Dr Willoughby Gardner in their research on Hillforts of Northern Wales. This research had started in 1909 and in his presidential address to the Cambrians in 1924, Willougby Gardner gives an extensive review of this research, illustrated with plans. They were later to survey Ffridd Faldwyn, Montgomery near Montgomery. This work was to form the basis for the excavations that followed at Ffridd Faldwyn by St John O'Neill, the Office of Works Inspector in Wales. Also Sir Cyril Fox, who succeeded Wheeler as the Director of the National Museum of Wales, published his survey of Offa's Dyke in parts in Archaeologia Cambrensis. It was afterwards republished as one volume by the British Academy in 1955.|$|R
