5|$|In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they would contribute to a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in <b>Your</b> <b>Eye</b> which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E

500|$|Daniel Martin, {{reviewing}} the episode for The Guardian, {{described it as}} [...] "at least partially successful". He praised Karen Gillan's performance, saying that she [...] "is capable of more than one-liners and physical comedy– and brings something to <b>your</b> <b>eye,</b> too". However, {{he thought that the}} episode lacked ideas and storylines usually found in the show, and criticised the sitcom-style dialogue. Patrick Mulkern, writing for the Radio Times, was [...] "distinctly underwhelmed", comparing it to [...] "one of the more disappointing episodes of The Sarah Jane Adventures". He [...] "particularly disliked the demonising of elderly people". Upon rewatching, however, although [...] "previous gripes" [...] remained, he did appreciate some the [...] "more subdued" [...] background music from Murray Gold, the script's [...] "tight structure and several amusing lines", and [...] "the realisation that, for the first time, the Doctor is travelling with a couple in love".|$|E

Bryan Club" [...] and [...] "Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Eye</b> on Nebraska." [...] Bryan's strategy was simple: maintain a low profile as a candidate until the last possible moment, then give a speech that rallied the silver forces behind him and bring about his nomination. [...] He was utterly confident that he would succeed, believing [...] "the logic of the situation," [...] as he later put it, dictated his selection. [...] He explained to Champ Clark, the future Speaker of the House, that Bland and others from southern states would fall because of prejudice towards the old Confederacy, that Boies could not be nominated {{because he was too}} little-known, and all others would fail due to lack of support—leaving only himself.|$|E
500|$|Bates {{adhered to}} a {{different}} explanation of accommodation {{that had already been}} generally disregarded by the medical community of his time. Bates' model had the muscles surrounding the eyeball controlling its focus. In addition to their known function of turning the eye, Bates maintained, they also affect its shape, elongating the eyeball to focus at the near-point or shortening it to focus at a distance. Commenting on this hypothesis in an interview with WebMD, ophthalmologist Richard E. Bensinger stated [...] "When we put drops in the eye to dilate the pupil, they paralyze the focusing muscles. The evidence of the anatomical fallacy is that you can't focus, but <b>your</b> <b>eye</b> can move up and down, left and right. The notion that external muscles affect focusing is totally wrong." [...] Science author John Grant writes that many animals, such as fishes, accommodate by elongation of the eyeball, [...] "it's just that humans aren't one of those animals." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert L. Surtees, who {{had already}} filmed several of the most {{successful}} epics of the 1950s, was hired as cinematographer for the film. Early on in the film's production, Zimbalist and other MGM executives made the decision to film the picture in a widescreen format. Wyler strongly disliked the widescreen format, commenting that [...] "Nothing is out of the picture, and you can't fill it. You either have a lot of empty space, or you have two people talking and a flock of others surrounding them who {{have nothing to do with}} the scene. <b>Your</b> <b>eye</b> just wanders out of curiosity." [...] The cameras were also quite large, heavy, and difficult and time-consuming to move. To overcome these difficulties, Surtees and Wyler collaborated on using the widescreen lenses, film stocks, and projection technologies to create highly detailed images for the film. Wyler was best known for composition in depth, a visual technique in which people, props, and architecture are not merely composed horizontally but in depth of field as well. He also had a strong preference for long takes, during which his actors could move within this highly detailed space.|$|E
500|$|Walton {{was born}} into a musical family in Oldham, Lancashire, the second son in a family of three boys and a girl. His father, Charles Alexander Walton, was a {{musician}} who had trained at the Royal Manchester College of Music under Charles Hallé, and made a living as a singing teacher and church organist. Charles's wife, Louisa Maria (née Turner), had been a singer before their marriage. William Walton's musical talents were spotted when he was still a young boy, and he took piano and violin lessons, though he never mastered either instrument. He was more successful as a singer: he and his elder brother sang in their father's choir, taking part in performances of large-scale works by Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn and others. Walton was sent to a local school, but in 1912 his father saw a newspaper advertisement for probationer choristers at Christ Church Cathedral School in Oxford and applied for William to be admitted. The boy and his mother missed their intended train from Manchester to Oxford because Walton's father had spent the money for the fare in a local public house. Louisa Walton had to borrow the fares from a greengrocer. Although they arrived in Oxford after the entrance trials were over, Mrs Walton successfully pleaded for her son to be heard, and he was accepted. He remained at the choir school for the next six years. The Dean of Christ Church, Dr Thomas Strong, noted the young Walton's musical potential and was encouraged in this view by Sir Hubert Parry, who saw the manuscripts of some of Walton's early compositions and said to Strong, [...] "There's a lot in this chap; you must keep <b>your</b> <b>eye</b> on him." ...|$|E
