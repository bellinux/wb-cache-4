I can assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means with which you could overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Italy and Switzerland participated for {{the first}} time. The Italian team, at the time ranked 17th in the world, had {{qualified}} because Italy was the host nation. They were outscored 32–1 in three games and IIHF president René Fasel declared his intention to make future tournaments more competitive and not allow host nations to automatically qualify. The Canadian team started the tournament by outscoring opponents 36–1 over three games. American defenceman Angela Ruggiero accused the team of running up the score and warned that the event's Olympic status could be called into question due to a perceived lack of competitive teams. In response, René Fasel stated that other women's teams were improving {{and that there was}} similar dominance {{in the early years of}} the men's tournament but the sport continued to grow. He added, [...] "I promise <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> won't take the [...] women 64 years to win"—in reference to the Swedish men's team inability to defeat Canada in Olympic play until 1984 (the Swedish women's team defeated Canada {{for the first}} time at the 2008 4 Nations Cup).|$|E
500|$|While {{making his}} way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite {{pressing}} on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin {{asked him if he}} had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that [...] "...I must tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is now un guerre à mort and if I had been the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom." [...] At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French hurried into Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

500|$|Even by the {{standards}} of the British Army, the Regiment (and the 1st Battalion in particular) seems to have gained a reputation during the First World War for profane language. When the 1st Battalion was relieved in the front line following its defence of Delville Wood in September 1916, one of the advanced posts was missed out by mistake. The Lance-Corporal in command, suspecting something was amiss, sent a man back to the front-line trench to investigate. The soldier realised he was at some risk of being shot by his own side, and so [...] "when he had crawled within shouting distance he enquired politely but firmly what —— bastards were holding that —— trench. The 9th East Surreys, who were the troops thus addressed, recognised the North Stafford idiom and let him in unhurt". Bernard Martin, who served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, records another incident which probably took place in 1917, when (very unusually) the battalion was addressed at a church parade by a general, who railed against [...] "the disgusting word many of you utter every time you speak. ... I tell you again this indecent word is not to be used any longer. It is so common amongst <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has become the shameful nickname by which your battalion is known throughout my Division". As the parade ended, one soldier was heard to ask, [...] "What was that bugger gassing about?"; to which another replied, [...] "Buggered if I know, I was having a kip. Where's the old bugger gone now?".|$|E
500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E

In the film, she played the character of Joan, a Glasgow housewife, who secretly enrolls in bus-driving classes after her husband's dismissal.

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under.

2500|$|As soon as {{the victory}} of the Popular Front in the {{elections}} became known I, already an elect member of Parliament, showed up at the prison of Oviedo the next morning, went {{to the office of the}} Director, who had fled in a mad panic because he had behaved like a genuine criminal toward the Asturian prisoners interned after the revolution of October 1934, and there I found the Administrator to whom I said, [...] "Give me the keys because the prisoners must be released this very day."

2500|$|But Nearing's {{aggressive}} social {{activism in}} the classroom and through the printed word brought him into conflict with his employers at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, resulting in his dismissal and his emergence as a cause célèbre of the American radical movement during the next decade. On the morning of June 16, 1915, Nearing's secretary telephoned him to report that a letter from the provost had arrived, saying that [...] "as the term of your appointment as assistant professor of economics for 1914–1915 is about to expire, I am directed by the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania to inform <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will not be renewed." [...] Penn's board of trustees was heavily stacked with bankers, corporation lawyers, financiers, and corporation executives, and Nearing's writing had not gone unnoticed. His tenuous situation had been exacerbated by an open letter to The North American in which he challenged the right wing evangelist Billy Sunday to apply the Gospel to the conditions of industrial capitalism, including [...] "the railroad interests ... the traction company ... the manufacturers ... the vested interests." [...] Reaction to Nearing's dismissal from the academy was swift, with department head Patten and others issuing statements condemning the decision. Progressives in the Wharton School quickly compiled a summary of {{the facts of the case}} and sent it to 1500 newspapers, journals, and academics around the country. Even conservatives in the faculty were deeply troubled since, as one Wharton professor observed, [...] "the moment Nearing went, any conservative statement became but the spoken word of a 'kept' professor." [...] Conversely, some radicals felt vindicated in their belief in the conservative nature of the American academy. Socialist writer Upton Sinclair told Nearing in an open letter that [...] "You do not belong in a university. You belong with us Socialists and free lances .... Instead of addressing small numbers of college boys, you will be able to address large audiences of men." [...] Nearing's dismissal was retrospectively called by one historian [...] "the most famous breach of academic freedom" [...] of the era.|$|E
