5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope <b>you</b> <b>love</b> it.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 Franco-Caribbean writer Aimé Césaire {{published}} Une Tempête, {{a radical}} {{adaptation of the}} play based on its colonial and postcolonial interpretations, in which Caliban is a black rebel and Ariel is mixed-race. The figure of Caliban influenced numerous works of African literature in the 1970s, including pieces by Taban Lo Liyong in Uganda, Lemuel Johnson in Sierra Leone, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o in Kenya, and David Wallace of Zambia's Do <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> Me, Master?. A similar phenomenon occurred in late 20th-century Canada, where several writers produced works inspired by Miranda, including The Diviners by Margaret Laurence, Prospero's Daughter by Constance Beresford-Howe and The Measure of Miranda by Sarah Murphy. Other writers have feminised Ariel (as in Marina Warner's novel Indigo) or Caliban (as in Suniti Namjoshi's sequence of poems Snapshots of Caliban).|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that <b>you</b> <b>love</b> for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Suzy and Doc are {{attracted}} to each other; she has in fact been quietly tidying his rooms while he is down at the tide pool catching specimens ("The Man I Used to Be"). Fauna tries to persuade Doc, who is very successful with the ladies, to woo Suzy. When Doc is dismissive, Fauna explains {{that she wants to}} get Suzy out of the Bear Flag when it is taken over for the night by a private party. Doc agrees to take Suzy out and treat her like a lady. Fauna goes back to the Bear Flag ("Sweet Thursday"), and works to give Suzy confidence ("Suzy is a Good Thing"). Doc and Suzy's date is the source of great interest to the people of Cannery Row. Both are nervous; Doc wears an unaccustomed necktie, while Suzy tries to act like a lady, but her polish wears thin at times. ("All At Once <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> Her"). At the end of the meal, they decide to continue the evening on a secluded sand dune.|$|E
5|$|Returning home, JJ {{sees his}} mother, Cecilia (Juliet Cowan), {{overwhelmed}} {{by all of}} his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook {{to tell him how}} he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not caring about how he feels. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship. Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie, not Cook. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) lets them into the club where British electronica duo <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> Her Coz She's Dead are playing, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dancefloor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely.

If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
