5000|$|Example of {{averaged}} cross-imp scoring: Assume {{that you}} are one of five pairs who play Board 2 as N/S (you are vulnerable). On this board you bid and make 4 Spades, scoring +620, while the other four N/S pairs score −100, −100, −300, and +650. To figure out <b>your</b> <b>averaged</b> cross-imp score, you would create a table like the Cross-IMP example table below: after writing in the scores of you and your opponents in the bolded areas, you would then fill in the Score Delta row by subtracting each of the opponent's scores from yours. Then, you would fill in the IMPS Gained row by converting each of the score deltas into IMPS via the standard IMP table (e.g. 720 equates to 12 IMPs, because it falls in the range of 600 to 740 in the IMP table). You then add up those numbers and get 36 IMPS. To turn the 36 IMPS into a averaged cross-IMP score, you simply divide that number by the number of competitors (36 IMPs divided by 4 competitors) to arrive at 9 as <b>your</b> <b>averaged</b> cross-IMP score.|$|R

40|$|Social {{networks}} have many counter-intuitive properties, including the "friendship paradox" that states, on <b>average,</b> <b>your</b> friends have more friends than you do. Recently, {{a variety of}} other paradoxes were demonstrated in online social networks. This paper explores the origins of these network paradoxes. Specifically, we ask whether they arise from mathematical properties of the networks or whether they have a behavioral origin. We show that sampling from heavy-tailed distributions always gives rise to a paradox in the mean, but not the median. We propose a strong form of network paradoxes, based on utilizing the median, and validate it empirically using data from two online social networks. Specifically, we show that for any user the majority of user's friends and followers have more friends, followers, etc. than the user, and that this cannot be explained by statistical properties of sampling. Next, we explore the behavioral origins of the paradoxes by using the shuffle test to remove correlations between node degrees and attributes. We find that paradoxes for the mean persist in the shuffled network, but not for the median. We demonstrate that strong paradoxes arise due to the assortativity of user attributes, including degree, and correlation between degree and attribute. Comment: Accepted to ICWSM 201...|$|R
