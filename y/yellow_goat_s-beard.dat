60|$|Then the man {{released}} him, and, withdrawing a {{space of}} two or three yards, sat down on his haunches, and, planting his bony elbows on his knees, thrust his great brown fingers in his tangled hair, and stared at Martin with his big <b>yellow</b> <b>goat's</b> eyes for a long time.|$|R
40|$|Fragment of {{woven fabric}} using brown/black and <b>yellow</b> <b>goat</b> hair fibers blended together. There is a coarse linen yarn along one edge.; Somewhat dirty and very worn. There is some plant {{material}} that has {{adhered to the}} surface. The yarns are very loose along two edges (including the edge with the coarse linen yarn). One edge is very frayed...|$|R
50|$|Because western salsify is a {{widespread}} plant, it has {{a large number of}} alternative common names. They include western goat's beard, wild oysterplant, <b>yellow</b> salsify, <b>yellow</b> <b>goat's</b> beard, meadow goat's beard, goat's beard, goatsbeard, common salsify, or salsify. Some of these are also, or more commonly, used for other species, and are better avoided. A synonym, Tragopogon major, may also be encountered.|$|R
40|$|Fragment of brown/black woven {{goat hair}} fabric with very large area of <b>yellow</b> <b>goat</b> hair darning (re-weaving) repair. Very {{little of the}} {{original}} brown/black fabric remains and warp and weft directions are difficult to discern.; Fairly clean. Very little remains of the original brown/black fabric. Edges are very frayed. The darning yarn shows little wear. A long tack pierces the fragment near one edge...|$|R
50|$|Tragopogon dubius (yellow salsify, western salsify, western goat's-beard, wild oysterplant, <b>yellow</b> <b>goat's</b> beard, goat's beard, goatsbeard, common salsify, salsify) is {{a species}} of salsify native to {{southern}} and central Europe and western Asia and found as far north and west as northern France. Although {{it has been reported}} from Kashmir and India, recent evidence suggests that specimens from these areas may be a different species. Western salsify has been introduced into North America where it has become widespread, being reported from all the continental United States except for a few in the far south-east, and all provinces of Canada except Newfoundland and the northern territories.|$|R
50|$|It covers {{an area of}} 12497 km2 and has a {{population}} of some 9,657 people (2010 Census). Its capital and county seat is in Jirang which is located only 20 km from Nepalese territory but some 450 km north-west of Kathmandu. It is an important Chinese customs point between Tibet, Nepal and India. Much of the county consists of river valleys of mountains and lakes such as the Holy Mountain Kangrinboqê (Mount Kailash), The Naimonany Peak Gunrla and Lake Maponen Yamco Lake Manasarowar. The Karnali River is also a prominent geographical feature of the landscape. Wildlife commonly seen in the far south-western Tibetan county are wild donkeys, wild yaks, <b>yellow</b> <b>goats,</b> antelope, rock goat, lynxes, foxes, leopards and marmots.|$|R
40|$|Large {{fragment}} of brown/black woven goat hair fabric with two weft bands. Each band {{consists of two}} picks of red goat hair and four picks of <b>yellow</b> <b>goat</b> hair. One band is 0. 6 cm wide, the other is 0. 7 cm wide. They are approximately 1 cm apart. This fragment was folded and sewn near the weft bands. A smaller piece of the same fabric was sewn to one side. There is a very thick cord, possibly made from palm fiber, piercing the smaller fabric in two places.; Very dirty and worn. There are several edge tears {{as well as an}} “L” shaped interior tear. The fabric is stiff and brittle. There is a large quantity of plant material on the surface and inside the seam. There are also several small bits of wool yarn that have adhered to the surface. Edges are frayed...|$|R
50|$|Brushes are classed as soft (軟毫), mixed (兼毫) or hard (硬毫). Hair is laboriously sorted by softness, hardness, thickness, & length, then bundled for {{specific}} uses. The {{most famous and}} highly prized brushes are a mix of <b>yellow</b> weasel, <b>goat</b> and rabbit hair, known as Húbǐ (湖筆); highly prized since the Ming dynasty (late 14th century) they are currently made in Shanlian (善琏), a town in the Wuxing District (吴兴) of Zhejiang province (浙江).|$|R
50|$|Grazing by goats, cattle, or sheep can be {{effective}} in controlling <b>Yellow</b> star-thistle. <b>Goats</b> will eat star-thistle even in its spiny stage.Because Yellow starthistle growth is particularly difficult to inhibit in canyon rangelands since its remoteness limits control options, goats and other herbivores have become an excellent option to curb the plant's spread. According to one study, grazing has decreased yellow starthistle presence by 58% {{when compared to the}} study's controls. Subplots also showed a 94% decrease in seed heads after only three years of experimentation.|$|R
60|$|This is {{the meat}} and poultry and bread market. There are stalls of new, various-shaped bread, brown and bright: there are tiny stalls of marvellous native cakes, which I want to taste, {{there is a great}} deal of meat and kid: and there are stalls of cheese, all cheeses, all shapes, all whitenesses, all the cream-colours, on into {{daffodil}} <b>yellow.</b> <b>Goat</b> cheese, sheeps cheese, Swiss cheese, Parmegiano, stracchino, caciocavallo, torolone, how many cheeses I don't know the names of! But they cost about the same as in Sicily, eighteen francs, twenty francs, twenty-five francs the kilo. And there is lovely ham--thirty and thirty-five francs the kilo. There is a little fresh butter too--thirty or thirty-two francs the kilo. Most of the butter, however, is tinned in Milan. It costs the same as the fresh. There are splendid piles of salted black olives, and huge bowls of green salted olives. There are chickens and ducks and wild-fowl: at eleven and twelve and fourteen francs a kilo. There is mortadella, the enormous Bologna sausage, thick as a church pillar: 16 francs: and there are various sorts of smaller sausage, salami, to be eaten in slices. A wonderful abundance of food, glowing and shining. We are rather late for fish, especially on Friday. But a barefooted man offers us two weird objects from the Mediterranean, which teems with marine monsters.|$|R
40|$|From a {{group of}} mature males goats of Boer and native Zambian goats, eight goats from each breed were {{selected}} and semen obtained {{by means of an}} electro-ejaculator. Two ejaculates were obtained each week at 24 -hour intervals, for a total of six weeks. Ejaculate colours were strikingly variable between goats both within and among breeds, and also within ejaculates of the same goats collected on different days. Semen colour ranged from creamy-white to bright <b>yellow.</b> Boer <b>goats</b> yielded ejaculate volumes twice as large as those of native goats, although sperm motility were not different (P> 0. 5) between breeds, weeks or ejaculates. Approximately 65 per cent of all spermatozoa in the ejaculates of both breeds were of normal morphology and about 87 per cent were live. Sperm concentration was higher (...|$|R
5000|$|Limited {{information}} is available indicating significant toxicological effects of TPhP. Although it was initially expected to have an overall low impact, {{a growing body of}} evidence suggests that the effects may not be so harmless. Triphenyl phosphate exhibits low acute toxicity by dermal or oral contact. However, an increasing number of studies have linked exposure to TPhP with reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, metabolic disruption, endocrine effects, and genotoxicity. TPhP has also been found to induce significant estrogenic activity. One study found that concentrations above the lowest observable effect level have been observed in a variety of other studies in coral grouper, <b>yellow</b> striped <b>goat</b> fish, and freshwater perch. This indicates that TPhP may be present in the environment at high enough concentrations to have harmful ecological effects. The European Chemicals agency considers TPhP to be [...] "very toxic" [...] to aquatic life, with potentially long-lasting effects.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out for {{microbiological}} analysis to assess the quality of raw fish sold in the Fishing harbour of Visakhapatnam. The study was performed {{during the period of}} April 2013 to March 2014. Three commonly edible fishes were selected for the microbial analysis to evaluate the quality of fish samples in terms of microbial content, the samples were inoculated and counted using Agar plate method. The microbial count was done by Total Bacterial Count (TBC), Total coliform counts (TCC) Total faecal coli form counts (TFCC). In the fishes of Upeneus vittatus (Forsskal 1775) <b>yellow</b> banded <b>goat</b> fish, Nemipterus japonicus (Bloch, 1791) Japanese thread fin bream, Priacanthus hamrur (Forsskal 1775) crescent tail big eye fish. 10 gms of fresh muscle is swabbed from the dorsal fin region was chosen as the target sample for the estimation of the microbial load. The TBC ranged from 2. 39 x 104 cfu/g to 4. 96 x 104 cfu/g while the total coliform count was noticed to greater than 160 MPN / g in Nemipterus japonicus, whereas the lowest count of 75 MPN/g in Upenus vittatus. The pathogenic bacteria Salmonella sps, Vibrio sps were mostly present in the collected samples. The findings of this study infer that the fish obtained from these sources contain potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore the edible fishes should be properly cleaned and cooked before consumption to avoid health risks...|$|R
50|$|The female {{equivalent}} of the Haferbock is the Habergeiß ("oat goat")., also known as Korngeiß ("corn goat"), Weizengeiß ("wheat goat") Roggengeiß ("rye goat")., Hobagoaß ("oat goat") or Heugeiß ("hay goat"). The Habergeiß is sometimes said to have only three legs. It is sometimes also described as a three-footed bird, as a <b>yellow</b> bird with <b>goat</b> voice, as half a goat and half a bird, as a goat with horse feet and a mouth like a half-opened scutcher or as a young chamois with wings. The cry of the Habergeiß pronounces springtime as well as bad luck. Someone who imitates the cry of the Habergeiß will get punishment. The Habergeiß hunts, scratches or even eats the meddlesome one. If not, it wil hang itself as a bloody coat at the crier's door. This corn demon also slaps people looking {{out of the window}} at night or takes part in the wild hunt, is also the mount of the devil. In heavy thunderstorm the Habergeiß bring cut grain from one field to another foreign field. The appearance of the Habergeiß causes bad luck. The corn will spoil, the cows will lose weight, give no milk and felt. When the cry of the Habergeiß is heard in autumn this means a long winter and lack of hay.|$|R
