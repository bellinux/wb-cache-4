500|$|Mike Higgins of The Independent {{deemed the}} episode [...] "a {{technical}} triumph", praising the [...] "smooth, almost flawless" [...] and [...] "fluent" [...] production. Shane Donaghey of The Belfast Telegraph {{also called the}} episode a [...] "triumph", opining {{that it could not}} possibly have lived up to the hype surrounding the storyline, but that transmitting live gave EastEnders [...] "an energy it normally lacks, with great violence, excellent direction". He summarised: [...] "the story gripped so well <b>you</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>to</b> look for the cock-ups, before a genuinely shocking denouement that you never saw coming amid all of the hype." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable", calling the episode [...] "a triumph of logistics over logic". However, Stacey wrote that aside from the [...] "damp-squib" [...] ending, [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] was [...] "surprisingly enjoyable [...] even for a committed 'Endersphobe like self." [...] She felt that transmitting live [...] "added a tangible layer of tension" [...] to proceedings, lamenting: [...] "If only EastEnders was this exciting all the time." [...] The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith similarly felt that transmitting live made for [...] "tension, not clarity", commenting that bookmakers would be [...] "absolutely delighted" [...] with the outcome, but that viewers would be [...] "incredulous". [...] Cate Devine of The Herald was similarly critical, describing the episode as [...] "30 minutes of cheesy dramatic counterpoint", and highlighting the [...] "ropey lighting and poor sound effects." ...|$|E
