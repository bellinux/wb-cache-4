6000|$|... "Quick, lads!" [...] he said; [...] "stamp <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> swing your arms, and get {{the blood}} in motion. I will keep these fellows at bay a few minutes longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s ’cos it’s goin’ dead," [...] {{said the}} damsel; [...] "then it’ll go black all up <b>your</b> <b>leg,</b> <b>and</b> then you’ll ’ave to ’ave it orf." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, uncommonly so. You will {{hardly believe}} it, but she {{actually}} {{asked me to}} dine. She always does, you know, when she wants to show her good humour. If you'd broken <b>your</b> <b>leg,</b> <b>and</b> she wished to commiserate you, she'd ask you to dinner." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “If you {{undertake}} {{to spoil}} my locks in this manner, Mr. Pump,” said the jailer, “I shall put a stopper, {{as you call}} it, on <b>your</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> tie you down to your bed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do, Stowel?" [...] {{called out}} Sir Gervaise, cordially. [...] "I am {{delighted to see}} you on <b>your</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> hope the old Roman is not much the worse for this day's treatment" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like the work!" [...] cried Miss Tippet, in amazement; [...] "like to {{be almost}} smoked to death, and burned alive, and tumbled off roofs, and get upset off what's-its-names, and fall down fire--fire--things, and break all <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> arms!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo, Johnny!" [...] said Pasiance. [...] "Hold <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> out <b>and</b> {{show this}} man your bad place!" [...] The small boy undid a bandage round his bare <b>and</b> dirty little <b>leg,</b> <b>and</b> proudly {{revealed}} a sore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{as far as}} {{the bite}} goes, Mr. Parkhurst, the shark is the worst. He will take <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> off, or a big 'un will bite a man in two halves. The {{alligator}} don't go to work that way: he gets hold of <b>your</b> <b>leg,</b> <b>and</b> no doubt he mangles it a bit; but he don't bite right through the bone; he just takes hold of you and drags you {{down to the bottom of}} the river, and keeps you there until you are drowned; then he polishes you off at his leisure." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the 19th {{century the}} Penbryn area was {{predominantly}} Nonconformist in religious persuasion, and in June 1843 during the Rebecca Riots, the vicar {{of the parish}} {{received a letter from}} [...] "Rebecca" [...] threatening to [...] "cut off <b>your</b> arm <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> ....burn all that you have" [...] should he refuse to return a family bible taken from a poor parishioner who was unable to pay his tithes.|$|R

6000|$|... "And if {{they think}} you try to stand on <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> walk with the feet of manhood, why, there isn't a {{blooming}} father and lover among them but will do his best to get you down and suffocate you--either with a baby's napkin or a woman's petticoat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do it, then. Let {{them see}} how you can use <b>your</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> give them a shout as you draw near; but have a care: do them no hurt, and see that they do no injury to you. Take no arms; your legs must suffice on this occasion." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "A little, perhaps, baas. At least, I should be if I {{thought about the}} morrow, which I don't, since to-day is enough for me, and {{thinking}} about what one can't know makes the head ache. Dingaan is not a nice man, baas; we saw that, didn't we? He is a hunter {{who knows how to}} set a trap. Also he has the Baas Pereira up there to help him. So perhaps you might be more comfortable here kissing Missie Marie. Why do you not say that you have hurt <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> cannot run? It would not be much trouble to walk about on a crutch for a day or two, and when the commandant was well gone, <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> might heal <b>and</b> you could throw the stick away." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] {{returned}} Mr. Traveller, quite undisturbed. [...] "This is {{a little}} too much. You are not going to call yourself clean? Look at <b>your</b> <b>legs.</b> <b>And</b> as to these being your premises:--they are in far too disgraceful a condition to claim any privilege of ownership, or anything else." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{said people}} in ships always wetted the sails before they put them up. So I wetted it; {{but that only}} made matters worse than they were before. A dry sail {{clinging}} to <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> wrapping itself round your head is not pleasant, but, when the sail is sopping wet, it becomes quite vexing.|$|E
60|$|They took no heed {{except to}} draw closer {{together}} and laugh insolently. Again {{you made your}} request and again they laughed. Then I saw you lift <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> deliberately stamp upon the foot {{of one of the}} Boers. He drew back with an exclamation, and for a moment I believed that he or his fellow was going to do something violent. Perhaps they thought better of it, or perhaps they saw us two Englishmen behind and noticed Anscombe's pistol. At any rate you marched into the office triumphant and delivered your document.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we shall}} feed you up {{as long as}} you are here, Harry; and I hope, in a fortnight, to see you pretty firm on <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> again; <b>and</b> then, if there is nothing to prevent it, we will carry you off triumphantly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Missed it, old bean; he's pulling <b>your</b> <b>leg.</b> When Jove <b>and</b> Juno created he them, he was saying: 'I'll see {{how much}} these fools will swallow.' And they've lapped up the lot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you see?" [...] asked Diksey, who {{had laughed}} even {{harder than the}} others. [...] "That's a joke. It's by odds the best joke I ever made. You walk with <b>your</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> so that's the way you walk, and your legs are the ways. See? So, when you mend your legs, you mend your ways. Ho, ho, ho! hee, hee! I'd no idea I could make such a fine joke!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's not so {{difficult}} {{as you might}} think," [...] continued Pedro, with a meditative gaze at the fire, [...] "especially if you're very tired, hard pressed for time, and in some danger. Under these circumstances it's wonderful what a fellow {{can do to make}} the best of his opportunities. You find out, somehow, the securest way to twine <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> arms in among the branches, and twist your feet and fingers into the forks and twigs--don't you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{one thing}} he did not understand. Standing erect on the log, and {{looking up at him}} as he swept over me, I kept thinking, [...] "I did it, I did it, Cheplahgan, old Cloud Wings. And I had grabbed <b>your</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> pinned you down, and tied you in a bag, and brought you to camp, but that I chose to let you go free. And that is better than {{shooting}} you. Now I shall find your little ones and touch them too." ...|$|E

60|$|His hips were thin; <b>and</b> the <b>legs,</b> lean <b>and</b> hairy, were crooked and stringy-muscled. In fact, my father's {{legs were}} more like arms. They were twisted and gnarly, and with {{scarcely}} the semblance of the full meaty calf such as graces <b>your</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> mine. I remember he could not walk on the flat of his foot. This was {{because it was a}} prehensile foot, more like a hand than a foot. The great toe, instead of being in line with the other toes, opposed them, like a thumb, and its opposition to the other toes was what enabled him to get a grip with his foot. This was why he could not walk on the flat of his foot.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{news came}} through my second-sighted man,' said Cercyon, 'there he is, in the corner,' and Cercyon threw the leg bone of an ox at his prophet, who just managed to leap {{out of the}} way. 'He seems to have {{foreseen}} that the bone was coming at him,' said Cercyon, and all his friends laughed loud. 'He told us this morning that a stranger was coming, he who had killed the three watchers of the way. From <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> shoulders, and the iron club that you carry, methinks you are that stranger?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now brace yourself! Spread <b>your</b> <b>legs.</b> <b>And</b> {{straighten}} out." [...] With {{his hands}} he manipulated {{her arms and}} shoulders into position. [...] "Remember, you've got to meet {{the first of the}} strain with your arms straight out. After the strain is on, you couldn't bend 'em if you wanted to. But if the strain catches them bent, the wire'll rip the hide off of you. Remember, straight out, extended, so that they form a straight line {{with each other and with}} the flat of your back and shoulders. That's it. Ready now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, men," [...] he said, [...] "there is {{one thing}} that you should remember--these Welshmen are not to be despised. Doubtless {{you will be able to}} ride over them, but do not think that, when you have done so, you have {{defeated}} them. They will throw themselves down on the ground, leap up as you pass over them, stab your horses from below, seize <b>your</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> try to drag you from your saddles, leap up on to the crupper behind you, and stab you to the heart. This is what makes them so dangerous a foe to horsemen, and at Crecy they did terrible execution among the French chivalry.|$|E

Or stand up on <b>your</b> hind <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> wink like a good fellow at God?" ...|$|R
