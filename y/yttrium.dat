5|$|Water-soluble {{compounds}} of <b>yttrium</b> {{are considered}} mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, <b>yttrium</b> {{and its compounds}} caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different <b>yttrium</b> compounds. In rats, inhalation of <b>yttrium</b> citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of <b>yttrium</b> chloride caused liver edema, pleural effusions, and pulmonary hyperemia.|$|E
5|$|Annual world {{production}} of <b>yttrium</b> oxide had reached 600tonnes by 2001; by 2014 it had increased to 7,000 tons. Global reserves of <b>yttrium</b> oxide were estimated in 2014 {{to be more}} than 500,000 tons. The leading countries for these reserves included Australia, Brazil, China, India, and the United States. Only a few tonnes of <b>yttrium</b> metal are produced each year by reducing <b>yttrium</b> fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy. The temperature of an arc furnace of greater than 1,600°C is sufficient to melt the <b>yttrium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Exposure to <b>yttrium</b> {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne <b>yttrium</b> europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritation—though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the <b>yttrium.</b> Acute exposure to <b>yttrium</b> compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to <b>yttrium</b> in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, <b>yttrium</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health. <b>Yttrium</b> dust is flammable.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} <b>yttrium</b> (0.1 to 0.2%) {{have been used}} to reduce the grain sizes of chromium, molybdenum, titanium, and zirconium. <b>Yttrium</b> is used to {{increase}} the strength of aluminium and magnesium alloys. The addition of <b>yttrium</b> to alloys generally improves workability, adds resistance to high-temperature recrystallization, and significantly enhances resistance to high-temperature oxidation (see graphite nodule discussion below).|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> {{compounds}} {{are used}} {{as a catalyst for}} ethylene polymerization. As a metal, <b>yttrium</b> is used on the electrodes of some high-performance spark plugs. <b>Yttrium</b> is used in gas mantles for propane lanterns as a replacement for thorium, which is radioactive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> has {{no known}} {{biological}} role. Exposure to <b>yttrium</b> compounds can cause lung disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> {{is found}} in most rare-earth minerals, it {{is found in}} some uranium ores, but is never found in the Earth's crust as a free element. About 31ppm of the Earth's crust is <b>yttrium,</b> making it the 28th most {{abundant}} element, 400 times more common than silver. <b>Yttrium</b> is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150ppm (dry weight average of 23ppm) and in sea water at 9ppt. Lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project have a relatively high content of <b>yttrium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ion {{absorption}} clays or Lognan clays are the weathering {{products of}} granite and contain only 1% of REEs. The final ore concentrate can contain {{as much as}} 8% <b>yttrium.</b> Ion absorption clays are mostly in southern China. <b>Yttrium</b> {{is also found in}} samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} notable {{differences}} between the chemistry of <b>yttrium</b> {{and that of the}} lanthanides is that <b>yttrium</b> is almost exclusively trivalent, whereas about half the lanthanides can have valences other than three; nevertheless, only for four of the fifteen lanthanides are these other valences important in aqueous solution (CeIV, SmII, EuII, and YbII).|$|E
5|$|Some tables, {{including}} the one published by IUPAC refer to all lanthanides and actinides as being in group 3: 30 lanthanide and actinide elements together with scandium and <b>yttrium.</b> Lanthanides, as electropositive trivalent metals, all have a closely related chemistry, and all show many similarities to scandium and <b>yttrium,</b> but they also show additional properties characteristic of their partially filled f-orbitals which are not common to scandium and <b>yttrium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{available}} {{element in}} group 3 is <b>yttrium,</b> with annual production of 8,900tonnes in 2010. <b>Yttrium</b> is mostly produced as oxide, {{by a single}} country, China (99%). Lutetium and scandium are also mostly obtained as oxides, and their annual production by 2001 was about 10 and 2tonnes, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} uses of <b>yttrium</b> are LEDs and phosphors, particularly the red phosphors in television set {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) displays. <b>Yttrium</b> is also used {{in the production of}} electrodes, electrolytes, electronic filters, lasers, superconductors, various medical applications, and tracing various materials to enhance their properties.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} 1940s, {{lanthanum}} {{has been placed}} under scandium and <b>yttrium</b> in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element goes into a d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: 3d14s2; Y: 4d15s2; La: 5d16s2). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, {{on the grounds that}} <b>yttrium</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} scandium are closer in their chemical properties to lutetium than lanthanum. Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on the distinction between the early lanthanides in the cerium group (whose sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as <b>yttrium)</b> in the <b>yttrium</b> group (whose sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some researchers in the 1920s and 1930s to place lutetium under <b>yttrium</b> instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and lutetium also goes into a d-orbital, both lutetium and lanthanum appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.|$|E
5|$|Xenotime, a REE phosphate, is {{the main}} HREE ore {{containing}} as much as 60% <b>yttrium</b> as <b>yttrium</b> phosphate (YPO4). The largest mine is the Bayan Obo deposit in China, making China the largest exporter for HREE since {{the closure of the}} Mountain Pass mine in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|A few authors {{position}} all thirty lanthanides and actinides {{in the two}} positions below <b>yttrium</b> (usually via footnote markers).|$|E
5|$|As an {{alloying}} agent with magnesium to create high-strength metals {{that are used}} in aircraft engines; <b>yttrium</b> and neodymium are also viable substitutes.|$|E
5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. <b>Yttrium</b> is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than <b>yttrium,</b> the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group; chemical properties of both actinium and especially lawrencium are not well-characterized. The remaining elements of the group (scandium, <b>yttrium,</b> lutetium) are reactive metals with high melting points (1541°C, 1526°C, 1652°C respectively). They are usually oxidized to the +3 oxidation state, even through scandium, <b>yttrium</b> and lanthanum can form lower oxidation states. The reactivity of the elements, especially <b>yttrium,</b> is not always obvious due to the formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. Scandium(III) oxide, yttrium(III) oxide, lanthanum(III) oxide and lutetium(III) oxide are white high-temperature-melting solids. Yttrium(III) oxide and lutetium(III) oxide exhibit weak basic character, but scandium(III) oxide is amphoteric. Lanthanum(III) oxide is strongly basic.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>yttrium</b> is {{chemically}} {{so similar}} to the lanthanides, it occurs in the same ores (rare-earth minerals) and is extracted by the same refinement processes. A slight distinction is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), but the distinction is not perfect. <b>Yttrium</b> is concentrated in the HREE group because of its ion size, though it has a lower atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioactive}} isotope yttrium-90 {{is used in}} drugs such as <b>Yttrium</b> Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide and <b>Yttrium</b> Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan {{for the treatment of}} various cancers, including lymphoma, leukemia, liver, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic and bone cancers. It works by adhering to monoclonal antibodies, which in turn bind to cancer cells and kill them via intense β-radiation from the yttrium-90 (see Monoclonal antibody therapy).|$|E
5|$|The {{similarities}} of <b>yttrium</b> to the lanthanides are {{so strong}} that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare-earth element, and is always found in nature together with them in rare-earth minerals. Chemically, <b>yttrium</b> resembles those elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, scandium, and if physical properties were plotted against atomic number, it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides gadolinium and erbium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> {{can be used}} to deoxidize {{vanadium}} {{and other}} non-ferrous metals. Yttria stabilizes the cubic form of zirconia in jewelry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> {{currently}} has no biological role, {{and it can}} be highly toxic to humans and other animals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> {{has been}} studied as a nodulizer in ductile cast iron, forming the {{graphite}} into compact nodules instead of flakes to increase ductility and fatigue resistance. Having a high melting point, <b>yttrium</b> oxide is used in some ceramic and glass to impart shock resistance and low thermal expansion properties. Those same properties make such glass useful in camera lenses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> has {{no known}} {{biological}} role, {{though it is}} found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans. Normally, as little as 0.5milligrams {{is found in the}} entire human body; human breast milk contains 4ppm. <b>Yttrium</b> can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20ppm and 100ppm (fresh weight), with cabbage having the largest amount. With as much as to 700ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> {{is a key}} {{ingredient}} in the <b>yttrium</b> barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') superconductor developed at the University of Alabama and the University of Houston in 1987. This superconductor is notable because the operating superconductivity temperature is above liquid nitrogen's boiling point (77.1K). Since liquid nitrogen is less expensive than the liquid helium required for metallic superconductors, the operating costs for applications would be less.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous {{and highly}} {{crystalline}} transition metal in group 3. As expected by periodic trends, {{it is less}} electronegative than its predecessor in the group, scandium, and less electronegative than the next member of period 5, zirconium; additionally, it is more electronegative to its successor in its group, lanthanum, being closer in electronegativity to the later lanthanides due to the lanthanide contraction. <b>Yttrium</b> is the first d-block element in the fifth period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> {{isotopes}} {{are among}} the most common products of the nuclear fission of uranium in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In the context of nuclear waste management, the most important isotopes of <b>yttrium</b> are 91Y and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51days and 64hours, respectively. Though 90Y has a short half-life, it exists in secular equilibrium with its long-lived parent isotope, strontium-90 (90Sr) with a half-life of 29years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> {{isotopes}} {{with mass}} numbers {{at or below}} 88 decay primarily by positron emission (proton → neutron) to form strontium (Z = 38) isotopes. <b>Yttrium</b> isotopes with mass numbers at or above 90 decay primarily by electron emission (neutron → proton) to form zirconium (Z = 40) isotopes. Isotopes with mass numbers at or above 97 are also known to have minor decay paths of β− delayed neutron emission.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and <b>yttrium</b> (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and <b>yttrium.</b> When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Scandium, <b>yttrium,</b> lanthanum, and {{lutetium}} tend {{to occur}} {{together with the}} other lanthanides (except promethium) tend to occur together in the Earth's crust, and are often harder to extract from their ores. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust for group 3 is quite low — all the elements in the group are uncommon, the most abundant being <b>yttrium</b> with abundance of approximately 30parts per million (ppm); the abundance of scandium is 16ppm, while that of lutetium is about 0.5ppm. The abundance of lanthanum is greater, being about 35ppm. For comparison, the abundance of copper is 50ppm, that of chromium is 160ppm, and that of molybdenum is 1.5ppm.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of {{zirconium}} is 1855°C (3371°F), and {{the boiling point}} is 4371°C (7900°F). Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within the d-block with known electronegativities, zirconium has the fifth lowest electronegativity after hafnium, <b>yttrium,</b> lanthanum, and actinium.|$|E
5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, <b>yttrium,</b> {{and either}} lanthanum or lutetium. Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to <b>yttrium.</b> While {{the choice of}} lutetium would be {{in accordance with the}} trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. Actinium, which occurs only in trace amounts, continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and <b>yttrium.</b> So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, oganesson.|$|E
5|$|Yttria {{is used as}} a {{sintering}} additive in {{the production}} of porous silicon nitride. It {{is used as a}} common starting material for material science and for producing other compounds of <b>yttrium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Yttrium</b> forms a water-insoluble fluoride, hydroxide, and oxalate, but its bromide, chloride, iodide, nitrate and sulfate are all soluble in water. The Y3+ ion is colorless in {{solution}} {{because of}} the absence of electrons in the d and f electron shells.|$|E
