In Rolling Stone magazine's ranking {{of the top}} 50 albums of 2006, The Black Parade was voted the 20th best album of the <b>year.</b> <b>My</b> Chemical Romance {{went on to win}} the award for Best International Band at the 2007 NME Awards, and Gerard Way also won the Hero of the Year award.

25|$|In early 2005, My Name is Rachel Corrie, a play {{composed}} from Corrie's {{journals and}} emails from Gaza and compiled by actor Alan Rickman and journalist Katharine Viner, in a production directed by Rickman, {{was presented in}} London and later revived in October 2005. The play was {{to be transferred to}} the New York Theatre Workshop, but when it was postponed indefinitely, the British producers denounced the decision as censorship and withdrew the show. It finally opened Off-Broadway on October 15, 2006, for an initial run of 48 performances. In the same <b>year,</b> <b>My</b> Name is Rachel Corrie was shown at the Pleasance theatre as part of the Edinburgh (Fringe) Festival.

500|$|Beginning in 1994, Kevin Spacey first {{offered his}} {{services}} to portray Bobby Darin, but the filmmakers believed the actor was too old. Around this time, Spacey coincidentally performed the cover version of Darin's [...] "That Old Black Magic" [...] for the soundtrack of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The actor explained that after 1994, [...] "at {{least three times}} a <b>year,</b> <b>my</b> manager would call over to Warner Bros. and say, 'Hey, what's happening with that Bobby Darin movie?

500|$|Originally it wasn't {{going to}} have {{anything}} to do with that, but people were looking through my photo albums this <b>year.</b> <b>My</b> father and I had made some photo albums together of his relatives and different people in the family. A couple people saw [...] and they were like, 'This is amazing that you have this.' I guess everybody was like, 'How would you feel about this type of concept ?' So I guess I thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E
500|$|Closing out the <b>year,</b> <b>My</b> Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this is what a post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E

BMW expected to achieve an EPA rated electricity consumption of 27 kWh/100mi (16.9 kWh/ 100km). The improved battery pack capacity was {{increased by more than}} 50% without any changes in exterior dimensions. BMW and Samsung SDI optimized the cell-internal packages with more electrolyte and adapted the active material, resulting in higher energy density of the lithium ion cells that increased battery capacity to 94 A·h and overall battery energy to 33 kWh of which 27.2 kWh can be effectively used. The previous battery capacity was 60 Ah and produced 22 kWh (gross) with a net capacity of 19 kWh. The improved battery has an upgraded electronics package that features new software mapping for the battery cooling system and the electric motor.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'.

2500|$|The girls {{assembled}} in the studio {{towards the end of}} 1994 to begin work on the follow-up to Point of Grace. They met with 35 different songwriters. On March 15, 1995, The Whole Truth was released. The album's first single, [...] "The Great Divide", shot to No. 1 and became the girls' seventh consecutive No. 1 single. Its message of the gospel touched so many lives, and is a favorite among the members of the group and their listeners. Lyrically, the whole album had an evangelistic feel, with its messages about God's love, Christ's sacrifice and Christian life. The album performed very well on the charts, charting at No. 1 and staying there for 13 consecutive weeks. After it left the No. 1 spot, it remained in the Top 10 for 45 consecutive weeks. It was certified gold by the RIAA in 1997 and the remaining four singles also {{reached the top of the}} charts. The girls embarked on a nationwide tour with Phillips, Craig & Dean and special guest Cheri Keaggy, and were also a part of the Young Messiah Farewell Tour, along with artists like Sandi Patty, 4Him and Larnelle Harris. They also contributed songs in several special event albums. They recorded a new rendition of the hymn [...] "Fairest Lord Jesus" [...] for the Hymns & Voices album; the song [...] "Hold On To Me" [...] for the My Utmost for His Highest project and a new take on [...] "Hark!
