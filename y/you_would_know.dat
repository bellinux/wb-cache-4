5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> him. And if you knew him <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

500|$|On Tuesday 27 February 2007, Saprang led a 13-member {{delegation}} to Europe, {{on what was}} {{claimed to be a}} week-long trip to study safety and security measures at major European airports. [...] Many delegates and accompanying members shared the same surname, and the trip, which cost 7.2 million baht was attacked for [...] "squandering" [...] state funds for personal pleasure, disbursing unrealistic expenses, and inflating costs. [...] The travel agent along received a 500,000 baht commission fee for booking the trip. [...] Saprang denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign. [...] He also noted that [...] "If you knew my character, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> that even if a relative joined the trip he should have realised that he should work hard." [...] He also noted that instead of being a viewed as a defendant, he should be viewed as a hero for bringing down the Thaksin government. [...] Saprang then summoned the leader of the AoT labor union in order to identify who leaked information about the trip to his accusers.|$|E

2500|$|After badmouthing Wu-Tang at a concert, Bad Boy {{recording}} artist Mase had a run-in with Ghostface {{and his entourage}} at a club in New York City.

2500|$|... "Via, Veritas, Vita" [...] is a Latin phrase {{which means}} “The Way, The Truth, and The Life.” Chosen by the University as its motto, this phrase is {{attributed}} to Jesus Christ and {{is found in the}} Gospel of John chapter 14, verse 6, which reads “5Thomas said to him, [...] "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" [...] 6Jesus answered, [...] "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7If you really knew me, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." [...] (New International Version) [...] The choice of the motto is firmly rooted in the University’s belief that religious instruction, particularly in the teachings of Jesus Christ, is essential to the moral development of every young person. [...] Incidentally, the motto has been adopted by the Province of Negros Oriental by incorporating it in its provincial seal.|$|E
2500|$|Permission to film at the {{stations}} was granted after the script was vetted by the Metro's media relations office, which is notoriously discriminating about which productions it allows to {{film on the}} Metro. After the deaths of three Metro employees in 2006, the office was reluctant to allow filming of the scene, but because the script did not explicitly show a death, the office assented. Scenes on the Metro had to meet strict standards for logistics and safety. The portrayal of anything illegal in the system was not allowed, nor was showing characters eating, drinking, jumping over fare gates, or running on the tracks. The production also had to agree to film scenes at the busy Rosslyn station at times when the system was least busy: {{late at night and}} after rush hour. Producer E. Bennett Walsh said that the production chose not to shoot on the less restrictive Baltimore subway, which has substituted for Washington,D.C. in other films that have come up against the Metro's rules, because [...] "To shoot any other subway, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> you're not in Washington." ...|$|E
