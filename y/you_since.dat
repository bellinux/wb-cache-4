2500|$|Although {{the first}} name of 'I' is not stated {{anywhere}} in the film, {{it is widely believed}} that it is 'Peter'. This myth arose {{as a result of a}} line of misheard dialogue. In the scene where Monty meets the two actors, Withnail asks him if he would like a drink. In his reply, Monty both accepts his offer and says [...] "...you must tell me all the news, I haven't seen <b>you</b> <b>since</b> you finished your last film". [...] While pouring another drink, and downing his own, Withnail replies that he has been [...] "Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff".

Powell's opinion of Thatcher had declined after she endorsed John Major at the 1992 general election, which he believed to be a repudiation of her fight against European integration after the Bruges speech.|$|E

These remarks resulted in a backlash from the White House and some US conservative commentators, culminating in a call for an apology by the US envoy to the United Nations John Bolton. Bolton added to reporters, [...] "I spoke to the secretary-general this morning, I said [...] "I've known <b>you</b> <b>since</b> 1989 and I'm telling you this is the worst mistake by a senior U.N. official that I have seen in that entire time." ...|$|E

And one may investigate from one end of heaven to the other, but one should not investigate what was before this world. Both Rabbi Johanan and Rabbi Eleazar (or other say Resh Lakish) compared this to a human king who instructed his servants to build a great palace on a dunghill. They built it for him. Thereafter, the king did not wish to hear mention of the dunghill..

2500|$|The Feasts, Apostles and Prophets tiers {{are divided}} by two large icons in the middle. One {{of them is}} the Christ in Majesty {{situated}} directly above the Royal Door. At the start of the latest restoration this icon was in rather poor condition: the oil paint was peeling off and it was heavily infested by woodworm. The Christ in Majesty icon, as in that of the Pantocrator, is a traditional depiction of Jesus. Christ is seated on a throne as ruler of the world, wearing episcopal vestments. He makes the teaching gesture with his right hand, and he holds the Bible in his left, opened at the New Testament: [...] "Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for <b>you</b> <b>since</b> the creation of the world" [...] (Matthew 25:34). According to the Bible these are the words, Jesus will say for those who believe in him. This depiction is more popular in Western Christianity. Eastern Orthodoxy traditionally uses the so-called [...] "Deesis" [...] composition on iconostases. The Deesis illustrates the enthroned Christ entreated by Mary and John the Baptist. The Resurrection of Jesus was painted on the icon above the Christ in Majesty. It depicts the scene of the opening of the holy tomb, from which Jesus is ascending, with his five wounds on his hands, feet and chest. Four Roman soldiers, guarding the entrance of the tomb, witness the miracle of the resurrection.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{arrived at}} on 2 February 1802 at Le Cap with the Haitian {{commander}} Henri Christophe being ordered by Leclerc {{to turn over}} the city to the French. When Christophe refused, the French assaulted Le Cap and the Haitians set the city afire rather than surrender it. Leclerc sent Toussaint letters promising him: [...] "Have no worries about your personal fortune. It will be safeguarded for <b>you,</b> <b>since</b> it has been only too well earned by your own efforts. Do not worry about the liberty of your fellow citizens". When Toussaint still failed to appear at Le Cap, Leclerc issued a proclamation on 17 February 1802: [...] "General Toussaint and General Christophe are outlawed; all citizens are ordered to hunt them down, and treat them as rebels against the French Republic". Captain Marcus Rainsford, a British Army officer who visited St. Domingue observed the training of the Haitian Army, writing: [...] "At a whistle, a whole brigade ran three or four hundred yards, and then, separating, threw themselves flat on the ground, changing to their backs and sides, and all the time keeping up a strong fire until recalled…This movement is executed with such facility and precision as totally to prevent cavalry from charging them in bushy and hilly country". In a letter to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint outlined his plans for defeating the French: [...] "Do not forget, while waiting for the rainy reason which will rid us of our foes, that we have no other resource than destruction and fire. Bear in mind that the soil bathed with our sweet must not furnish our enemies with the smallest sustenance. Tear up the roads with shot; throw corpses and horses into all the foundations, burn and annihilate everything in order that those who have come to reduce us to slavery may have before their eyes the image of the hell which they deserve". Dessalines never received the letter as he already taken to the field, evaded a French column sent to capture him and stormed Léogane. The Haitians burned down Leogane and killed all of the French with the Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James writing of Dessalines's actions at Leogane: [...] "Men, women and children, indeed all the whites who came into his hands, he massacred. And forbidding burial, he left stacks of corpses rotting in the sun to strike terror into the French detachments as they toiled behind his flying columns". The French, who been expecting the Haitians to happily go back to being their slaves as they believed it was natural for blacks to be the slaves of whites were stunned to learn how much the Haitians hated them for wanting to reduce them back to a life in chains. A visibly shocked General Pamphile de Lacroix after seeing the ruins of Leogane wrote: [...] "They heaped up bodies" [...] which [...] "still had their attitudes; they were bent over, their hands outstretched and beseeching; the ice of death had not effaced the look on their faces".|$|E
