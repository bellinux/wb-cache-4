5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> through whatever you're going through, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to the other side.|$|E

25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. {{for the fact that}} the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.|$|E
