60|$|LADY CICELY. He did: {{you know}} he did. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell the exact truth.|$|E
60|$|MRS. PEARCE. He can't {{take her}} away, Mr. Higgins: how can he? <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> burn her clothes.|$|E
60|$|PHIPPS. The lady {{is in that}} room, my lord. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{show her}} into that room, my lord.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] I said. [...] "I {{thought you}} were rather fond of {{children}} from what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> going <b>to</b> the cross-roads the other day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't easy," [...] said Grant, {{checking}} a sigh. [...] "I 'most fancied {{they had}} come back the night <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how <b>to</b> get away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I wouldn’t put up {{with half}} that {{nonsense}} from anybody at sea. Don’t <b>you</b> remember <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yourself <b>to</b> go away? What was I to do?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m {{sure not}} great at talking,” Moran agreed. “Now, {{if he tried}} to have us sandbagged, and <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get after him—” ...|$|E
60|$|My dear papa, <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{tell you}} {{whenever}} I was miserable. I {{do not feel}} well, and I wish to get home.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn’t that," [...] said Blundell, slowly, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{improve on}} your plan, you know, and I’ve been {{thinking}} out improvements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about money, Ferdinand. If <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak {{to him about it}} before we were married I would have done so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> watch anything, Stephen, I {{should have}} religiously done it,' she capriciously went on, {{as soon as}} she heard him behind her.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [Coolly.] As {{it turns}} out you only did me a service. But still <b>you</b> haven't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> what I owe the honour of your visit.|$|R
60|$|My dear papa, <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{tell you}} {{whenever}} I was miserable. I {{do not feel}} well, and I wish to get home. Do take me with you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, ma'am," [...] said Sarah, {{opening the}} door, [...] "the {{preserves}} that <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> boil in treacle--the congfiters, {{as you call}} them--is all burnt to the pan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you please, ma'am,' she said, 'I {{have been}} waiting, as <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> let Dr Ferguson out, but it's nearly seven now; and the table's not laid yet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{called this}} morning," [...] he said, [...] "upon the gentleman whose name {{you will see}} there. He {{directed}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{never could}} give you up, I never would unless <b>you</b> {{yourself}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to.</b> Then I would do it,--for you. But you won't ask me, now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, do you {{remember}} when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> coming <b>to</b> her was an experiment, and you thought it might be better for the old friendship if you did not accept the situation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do!" [...] she cried, {{stamping}} {{her little}} foot. [...] "I do as I please. I am {{the daughter of}} a king, and furthermore, I hate you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Cos Jessie's {{going to}} have one, and <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be original," [...] and here the poor mite, {{reflecting}} upon the price her originality was going to cost her, burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|MRS GEORGE. You dont mind, Dad, do you? [As this {{greeting}} visibly {{gives him}} a shock that hardly bears out the Bishop's advice, she says anxiously] That was what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> call him, wasnt it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> look at you," [...] {{explained}} meekly the fishy-eyed young gentleman. [...] "I must go off somehow. I regard {{you as a}} {{very difficult}} man to please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will, I truly will! {{and when}} I {{get in a}} worry about things may I come <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> Uncle <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to,</b> and I feel as if I shouldn't be afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All right, all right,' {{said the}} waiter. 'Coming! He turns to Gentleman,' {{he went on}} rapidly, 'and he says, [...] "Bailey, I owe it all to you, because if <b>you</b> hadn't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> insult her folks--"' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} don't mind my coming to you, Mr. Jarvis," [...] she said. [...] "You know <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> if ever I were in trouble, so I've taken you at your word. You don't mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, sir? We're {{just come}} up from Mr. King's," [...] said Stalky. [...] "Please, sir, what am I to do about prep.? They've broken the desk <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sit at, and the form's just {{swimming}} with ink." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did. I {{told her}} what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell her: that you were now but an {{incoherent}} series of compound fractures extending from your scalp-lock to your heels, and that the comminuted projections caused you {{to look like a}} hat-rack.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Don. Clara. No, no; {{just now}} <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> tease you--"Who do you want, good signor?" [...] "Not you, not you!" [...] Oh you blind wretch! but swear {{never to be}} jealous again, and I'll forgive you.|$|R
6000|$|... "This, Allan. When I was at Umgungundhlovu I {{sought out}} the truth of that story <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> as <b>to</b> his having made a plot to get you killed by the Zulus {{on the ground that}} you were a wizard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nahana," [...] said Nandie, [...] "you {{are brought}} {{here that you}} may repeat to the King and his council a tale which <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as <b>to</b> the coming of a certain woman into my hut before {{the death of my}} first-born son, and what she did there. Say first, is this woman present here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{has been}} a close thing, indeed," [...] Mr. Blount said. [...] "I was wrong, after what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> trust that black scoundrel so entirely; but I own it never entered my mind that he was leading us astray." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. I {{told her}} what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell her: that you were now but an {{incoherent}} series of compound fractures extending from your scalp-lock to your heels, and that the comminuted projections caused you {{to look like a}} hat-rack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have not. I {{can assure}} you that at the present moment there is no more of an {{understanding}} between me and the young man you so much disliked than between him and you. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> forget him; and I have forgotten him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dad saw <b>you.</b> He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{come out}} and excuse him.... Oh, Ben, I'm {{so happy to see}} you! You don't look hurt at all. What a fight you had!... Oh, I was sick! But let me forget that.... How are you? And how's Wils?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I was <b>to</b> have no trouble. I am dressed,' said Mary, looking complacently at {{her full}} folds of white muslin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure there}} is," [...] said Mrs Foster, opening her box; [...] "alas! I fear {{the wind is}} rising even now. The {{rattling}} of the window-frames will bring what <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> remembrance ever after this night. How much does it require to establish a lifeboat?" ...|$|R
