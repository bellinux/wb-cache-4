[...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>welcome.</b> But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E
