25|$|As a first example, {{consider}} the six vectors in 2-dimensional Euclidean space, R2, {{as shown in}} the image at the right; call them roots. These vectors span the whole space. If <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> line perpendicular to any root, say β, then the reflection of R2 in that line sends any other root, say α, to another root. Moreover, the root to which it is sent equals α + nβ, where n is an integer (in this case, n equals 1). These six vectors satisfy the following definition, and therefore they form a root system; this one is known as A2.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

"Care Bears Movie II {{is a sort}} of pre-sequel that, I suspect, {{requires}} its {{audiences to}} have some prior knowledge of Care Bears," [...] Vincent Canby said in his New York Times review.

[...] Hal Lipper of the St. Petersburg Times remarked that it [...] "is an enormously engaging cartoonquite a feat when <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> saccharine psychobabble passing for dialogue". The Miami Heralds Bill Cosford gave it {{two and a half stars}} out of four, the same rating he had applied to its predecessor.

Sharp digressed, [...] "o be honest it isn't the most accessible of films and for those unfamiliar with Suzuki's unorthodox and seemingly disjointed style it will probably take a couple of viewings before the bare bones of the plot begin to emerge." [...] As Zorn has put it, [...] "plot and narrative devices {{take a back seat to}} mood, music, and the sensuality of visual images." [...] Japanese film historian Donald Richie thus encapsulated the film, [...] "An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers. [...] script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake." [...] David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible, [...] "f <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> movie soberly, it's hard to deny the bosses had a point". On a conciliatory note, Rayns commented, [...] "Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable; it's hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this." ...|$|E

500|$|Later reviews {{have been}} positive. Jess Harvell of Pitchfork opined that Quique [...] "still sounds timeless." [...] Glenn Swan of AllMusic gave the album {{four and a}} half stars out of five, stating [...] "this is Seefeel at their most ornate. They squint by staring into the {{geometric}} refractions of light and record the results." [...] Jason Ferguson of Harp described Quique as [...] "shimmered with a futuristic ethereality that was far more substantial than the electro-ambience of the era, but also much less assaultive than the shoegazers Seefeel was affiliated with early on." [...] and that the 2007 re-issue was [...] "a fitting tribute to a very unique sound." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the album as [...] "underrated" [...] and [...] "that even 20 years later sounds like nothing else." [...] The Sunday Times gave the Redux edition a positive review, referring to Quique as the group's [...] "finest moment" [...] and [...] "If you like music to have structure, Quique will drive you barmy; but if <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> presence of the word [...] "texture" [...] in an album review to be a positive, you might well enjoy this languid landmark." [...] Cam Lindsay wrote in Exclaim! that [...] "While it doesn't feel like a timely release, the re-discovery of Seefeel (no word yet on a reunion) certainly verifies their relevance in today's music, especially in light of neo-gazers like Ulrich Schnauss and Tim Hecker." [...] In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 34 on his list of [...] "The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties". In 2016, Pitchfork placed Quique at number 13 on its list of [...] "The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time".|$|E

It is utterly transparent Cold War propaganda, with delighted displays of military aircraft in action, an eager, anxious glimpse forward to the Space Race, and an interest in human-scale affairs so desultory as to make the machines and the ability to build and fly them seem much more important than the complications and consequences of militarism and war waged ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coauthor Bill Zanker {{writes in}} the work about the {{importance}} of brand name power for Trump: [...] "That {{is an example of the}} Trump attitude.

He loves connecting with people, helping them, and educating them. Zanker gave as an example his company The Learning Annex and its business relationship with Trump, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> advertising, promotions, and everything The Learning Annex does to enhance the Trump brand, nationally and internationally, Donald gets much more than $1.5 million per speech— but he donates much of the money to charity."

2500|$|The term may be spelled with {{or without}} a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some {{scholars}} favor the unhyphenated form because, [...] "If you use the hyphenated form, <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" [...] whereas [...] "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that." [...] For example, Emil Fackenheim supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to [...] " [...] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes." [...] Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at Merrimack College; Yehuda Bauer, professor of Holocaust studies at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and James Carroll, historian and novelist.

2500|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviews. Review normalizer Metacritic {{gave the}} album 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews. Andy Kellman of AllMusic said [...] "Timbaland does not stock Shock Value II with quite as many guests, and performs {{a higher percentage}} of the vocals, and what results is less schizophrenic and more directly pop than its antecedent. The highs here are not as high, and the lows are as low, unless <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> very presence of Chad Kroeger and Daughtry, or the unveiling of Brandy’s rapping alter ego Bran’ Nu, to be more odious than a sub-Coldplay ballad. [...] That said, it is a mildly entertaining album—as long as you block out most of the lyrics." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Timbaland dips into his usual bag of production tricks here and many of the supporting cast dutifully return, but never does this quite reach the same excitement levels as its predecessor. [...] it feels as though Tim's trying so hard to impress us with his pimped-up SUV that he's driven the thing off the road. The result? A disparate, disjointed collection of songs that feels like less {{than the sum of its}} parts. Where Shock Value was fresh and innovative, much of the sequel could pass for leftovers from its predecessor.
