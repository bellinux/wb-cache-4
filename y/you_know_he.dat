500|$|Initial discussions {{took place}} in 2008 between Tom Cruise and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were ongoing {{for more than a}} year between the pair and their representatives. It was finally decided that Cruise was unable to commit to the script, because he feared that the {{character}} was too close to his [...] character Ethan Hunt. Cruise decided to work on [...] Knight and Day instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt, but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said [...] "But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> had a valid point. It was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he’d already played. It’s like playing the brother, or the cousin, of somebody that you played in another movie".|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} {{presumptive}} 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump, Cryer shared his feelings on the May 5, 2016, {{episode of the}} podcast Never Not Funny. Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics. [...] I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
500|$|By April 2010, Joss Whedon {{was close}} to {{completing}} a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script, and was officially announced in July 2010. When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not [...] "have anything" [...] and they should [...] "pretend this draft never happened". Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is." [...] Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how [...] "these people shouldn't {{be in the same room}} let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family".|$|E
2500|$|Jindal's {{nickname}} {{dates to}} his childhood identification with Bobby Brady, an ABC sitcom character. He has said, [...] "Every day after school, I'd {{come home and}} I'd watch The Brady Bunch. And I identified with Bobby, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>He</b> was about my age, and 'Bobby' stuck." [...] He has been known by his nickname ever since, although his legal name remains Piyush Jindal.|$|E

The album is the speculated horror theme suggested by the title named after two of horror’s most popular villains Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. On January 7, 2017, Fabolous and Jadakiss had an interview with HipHopDX and Fab described the theme of the album during the interview. [...] "...Jason, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was killer. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> his work and <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>he</b> do. Freddy was a killer, and he might be a little more witty, cuz he talk more. The Jason character didn’t really say much, but <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was there. <b>You</b> can’t even escape it. Once you heard those footsteps, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was in the area. There’s a lot of comparisons when you want to compare to things, but {{that was one of the}} ones we were looking at with Freddy Vs. Jason. When it came to villains, they were always the two that were brought up." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2016, Kobach {{said that}} there are “interesting things” about the {{question}} of Obama’s citizenship that “just made you scratch your head.” Kobach said that Obama's opposition to Kansas's proof of citizenship requirement law was possibly because the president was not a citizen himself: [...] "maybe that’s why he doesn’t talk about proof of citizenship, because he, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> would rather not bring up the citizenship issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles Sporck retold another incident: {{during a}} European {{roadshow}} Widlar got drunk and publicly {{refused to speak}} to the audience unless he got more gin.

And he, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> got plastered, but the interesting part of it is he was just so damn smart, you know. Even drunk he could just wow these people." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of tawhid, {{in the words}} of the prominent Mu’tazili scholar Chief Justice Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415 AH/1025 AD), is: [...] the knowledge that God, being unique, has attributes that no creature shares with Him. This is explained by the fact that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that the world has a creator who created it and that: He existed eternally in the past and He cannot perish while we exist after being non-existent and we can perish. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> was and is eternally all-powerful and that impotence is not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> is omniscient of the past and present and that ignorance is not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> everything that was, everything that is, and how things that are not would be if they were. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> is eternally in the past and future living, and that calamities and pain are not possible for Him. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> sees visible things, and perceives perceptibles, and that He does not have need of sense organs. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> is eternally past and in future sufficient and it is not possible for Him to be in need. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> is not like physical bodies, and that it is not possible for Him to get up or down, move about, change, be composite, have a form, limbs and body members. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> is not like the accidents of motion, rest, color, food or smells. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>He</b> is One throughout eternity and there is no second beside Him, and that everything other than He is contingent, made, dependent, structured, and governed by someone/thing else. Thus, if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all of that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the oneness of God.|$|R
2500|$|Franklin {{was best}} {{described}} as an agnostic. Her lack of religious faith apparently did not stem from anyone's influence, rather from her own inquisitive mind. She developed her scepticism as a young child. Her mother recalled that she refused {{to believe in the}} existence of god, and remarked, [...] "Well, anyhow, how do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>He</b> isn't She?" [...] She later made her position clear, now based on her scientific experience, and wrote to her father in 1940: ...|$|E
2500|$|Goldwater {{was painted}} as a {{dangerous}} figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan [...] "In your heart, you know he's right" [...] with the lines [...] "In your guts, you know he's nuts", and [...] "In your heart, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> might" [...] (that is, he might actually use nuclear weapons as opposed to using only deterrence). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: [...] "Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff.

500|$|Throughout {{much of the}} campaign, Goldwater was on the defensive, using {{television}} commercials to respond to accusations from Johnson and clarify statements {{that he had made}} previously. In turn, Goldwater attempted to launch a counterattack via television, featuring a commercial showing Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev shouting [...] "We will bury you!" [...] over children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The commercial's effectiveness was diminished by Khrushchev's removal from office in October. In response to Goldwater's attacks, Johnson began reversing Goldwater's campaign slogan [...] "In Your Heart <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>He's</b> Right" [...] to slogans such as [...] "In Your Head <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>He's</b> Wrong" [...] and [...] "In Your Guts <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>He's</b> Nuts."
