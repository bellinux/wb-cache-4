500|$|Goddard {{considered}} varying {{styles and}} influences {{a key factor}} in the band's music. He explained to The Sun that creating music could be difficult because a member could introduce a different influence. Goddard and Doyle said that clashes and restlessness during recording led to [...] "unpleasant" [...] periods of silence, but ultimately thought the clashes created [...] "something more interesting because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> different voices and not one person dictating".|$|E
500|$|Hetrick {{thought that}} if she {{returned}} to DS9 as Vash, then something could be built around the Vash-Quark relationship: [...] "That would be a really nice pairing, because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> two different backgrounds but they're both after the same thing." [...] Towards {{the end of the}} , the producers inquired about Hetrick's availability. The actress was ready to appear on another DS9 episode, but the writers changed direction and there were no further plans for the Vash character. [...] "Q-Less" [...] was the final Star Trek appearance for Hetrick, and the only appearance in DS9 for John de Lancie.|$|E

500|$|On 15 March 1944, Operation Save was {{launched}} {{with the objective}} of clearing Partisans from the Semberija region. Sauberzweig wrote an open letter to the division: [...] "We have now reached the Bosnian frontier and will (soon) begin the march into the homeland.... The Führer has provided you with his best weapons. Not only do <b>you</b> (<b>have</b> <b>these)</b> in your hands, but above all you have an idea in your hearts – to liberate the homeland.... Before long, each of you shall be standing in the place that you call home, as a soldier and a gentleman; standing firm as a defender of the idea of saving the culture of Europe – the idea of Adolf Hitler." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilliam {{used the}} same filmmaking style as he had in Brazil (1985), {{including}} the art direction and cinematography (specifically using fresnel lenses). The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists {{was based on the}} work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three different power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a [...] "nightmarish intervention of technology. You try to see the faces on the screens in front of you, but the real faces and voices are down there and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> tiny voices in your ear. To me that's the world we live in, the way we communicate these days, through technical devices that pretend to be about communication but may not be." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus {{to use for}} the road trip based on his {{experience}} with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: [...] "I remember thinking, it's a road trip, what vehicle {{are you going to}} put them in? And [...] VW bus just seems logical, just because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put the camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody." [...] Five VW Microbuses were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques. Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers. During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming. Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.|$|E

I did not know <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>these</b> doubts. They come {{to all of us}} sooner or later. But we hide them from one another. It is foolish." ...|$|R

500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 August 1987 The Stems played {{what turned}} out to be their last gig. In October of that year, a {{proposed}} six-week European tour was cancelled and the group disbanded. McFarlane wrote; [...] "by that time they had developed into one of the best live bands on the Australian scene". In October 2009 Mariani told The Ages Michael Dwyer, [...] "we were on the charts, getting airplay, very popular. But within the band there was a bit of burnout ... <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> moments where you can't stop thinking negatively and I kept picturing myself pushing a van in the snow. I thought, 'I don't want to be doing that. I'm getting out of here'". The Huffington Posts Holly Cara Price described the group as [...] "one of the most tuneful and tasty garage rock bands of the era. Avid fans of pop, R and 60's garage punk, their predilection translated to great punchy songs".|$|E
2500|$|On December 30, 2010, The Washington Times {{reported}} that J Street [...] "paid {{tens of thousands}} of dollars to a consulting firm co-owned by its founder and president, Jeremy Ben-Ami". [...] "Even if it's technically legal, it gets very messy when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> sorts of deals going on because, if you're going to benefit on the other end of it, be it 100 percent or 5 percent, it raises questions about objectivity and the arm's length in the transaction," [...] said Ken Berger, president of Charity Navigator. [...] "Mr. Ben-Ami declined repeated interview requests, but provided a statement through a spokesman: 'I founded Ben-Or together with Oriella Ben-Zvi in 1998. When I left in 2000, I relinquished all rights to ongoing compensation from Ben-Or in any form. I have received no payments from the company in the past 11 years and have had no role in the management or operation of the firm.'" ...|$|E

Never in all your life have you loved, wholly, fully, steadfastly--as people deserve to be loved--not your mother nor your father, not your wife nor your children, nor me, nor our child, nor any living thing. Pleasant to all of us at times--at times bitterly disappointing. You do not even love this work of yours steadfastly, this work to which you sacrifice us all in turn. You do not love enough. That is why <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> moods and changes, that is why <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> lassitudes. So it is you are made....|$|E
6000|$|So the man {{gave him}} a pair of snow shoes.

When you have got there, just turn the shoes so that the toes point this way, and then they will come home again of their own accord.' ...|$|E
60|$|First, And for this, see Isaiah 45:15 where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> words, 'Verily, {{thou art}} a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour': And verse 21, 22 <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> words, 'Who hath {{declared}} this from ancient time?--Have not I the LORD? And {{there is no}} God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all {{the ends of the}} earth': Why, who art thou? 'For I am God, and there is none else.' Also in Isaiah 54:5 'For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.' Read also verses 6-8 of that chapter. I could abundantly multiply scriptures to prove this to be truth, but I shall only mind you of two or three, and so pass on; the first is in Jude, verse 25, 'To the only wise God our Saviour be glory.' And Acts 20:23; John 3:16; 1 John 5:20.|$|E
