Lovato {{said that it was}} [...] "important" [...] to have them on her album, because [...] "I mean, just look at how {{successful}} they are. I would love to have their input anytime, because they're obviously doing something right." [...] The band also contributed backing vocals and played the guitar to the song. It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums. In an interview, Lovato explained that the song is about being <b>yourself</b> <b>when</b> you are surrounded by [...] "the pressures of fame". She said, [...] "You get to Hollywood {{and a lot of times}} people can try to shape you and mould you into what they want you to be. The song is just about keeping it real and trying to stay <b>yourself</b> <b>when</b> you're out in Hollywood." [...] "La La Land" [...] was released as the album's second and final single on April 10, 2009. It was later released in the United Kingdom on May 31, 2009, with the new song [...] "Behind Enemy Lines".

500|$|The film {{opened in}} 3,929 theaters in the United States and Canada on May 16, 2008. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG. To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When you sit down and you're watching it, and you see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these things because you're essentially making the film for <b>yourself.</b> <b>When</b> you start showing it to an audience, that then influences how you feel about the film." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "In the Presence of Enemies" [...] was {{inspired}} by a Korean manhwa named Priest, as Petrucci explains that not being a manga fan, precisely, [...] " [...] I like it though. This one, I just stumbled upon and I really liked the content. It inspired me to take a different approach lyrically. You have to keep things interesting for <b>yourself</b> <b>when</b> writing new material so I just took this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to write, you know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E

2500|$|Archie also {{complains}} {{that there is}} never corned beef or rye bread on Wolfe's table, and he sometimes ducks out to eat a corned beef sandwich at a nearby diner. Yet a young woman gives Wolfe a lesson in preparing corned beef hash in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death". Another contradiction is found in Plot It <b>Yourself</b> <b>when</b> Archie goes to a diner to eat [...] "fried chicken like my Aunt Margie used {{to make it back}} in Ohio," [...] since Fritz does not fry chicken. But in The Golden Spiders, Fritz prepares fried chicken for Wolfe, Archie, Saul, Orrie, and Fred.|$|E
2500|$|Belle is an {{influential}} proponent {{of discipline and}} control in parkour, saying, [...] "Precision is all about being measured," [...] and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master. [...] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time {{but it does not}} mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, {{you have to do it}} at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to <b>yourself.</b> <b>When</b> you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times." [...] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{departed}} from Steampacket in March 1966, with Stewart {{saying he had}} been sacked and Auger saying he had quit. Stewart then joined a somewhat similar outfit, Shotgun Express, in May 1966 as co-lead vocalist with Beryl Marsden. The other members included Mick Fleetwood and Peter Green (who {{would go on to}} form Fleetwood Mac), and Peter Bardens. Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy [...] "I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round", before disbanding. Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket, and said [...] "I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people's music. I think you can only start finding <b>yourself</b> <b>when</b> you write your own material." [...] By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice.|$|E

2500|$|... "Remember {{when the}} world was young" [...] – {{childhood}} nostalgia brings with it a sense of [...] "things about to be swept away, ideals {{that can never be}} kept". The village green is an ideal past, a place of memory; Walter is [...] "just an echo of a world I knew so long ago... but memories of people can remain". Two songs [...] "People Take Pictures of Each Other" [...] and [...] "Picture Book") discuss photographs, [...] "pictures of things as they used to be", that people keep as a [...] "moment to last them for ever"; a [...] "picture of me when I was just three, sucking my thumb by the old oak tree" [...] by which he would first kiss Daisy.
