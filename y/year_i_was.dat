My wife, after the absence of her terms for seven weeks, gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year she hath them again.|$|E
500|$|Del Potro's {{first half}} of the season was {{hampered}} by injuries and a change of coach, starting with a first-round loss in Adelaide, where he was the seventh seed. He then made it to {{the second round of the}} Australian Open in January, only to retire against David Ferrer due to an injury. Del Potro returned to the circuit in March, winning his first match against Jesse Levine at the Sony Ericsson Open, before losing in the second round to López. Struggling with injuries, his ranking fell as low as no. 81 in April. [...] "At the start of the <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing good, but I had many injuries, many problems with my body, with my physique", said del Potro. [...] "I changed my coach, changed my physical trainer, I changed everything." ...|$|E
500|$|At the AIG Japan Open Tennis Championships, he {{made the}} final by {{defeating}} 11th seed Jarkko Nieminen, top seed and defending champion Ferrer, and fourth seed Richard Gasquet. He was defeated by Tomáš Berdych in the final. At the Madrid Masters, he lost in the quarterfinals in straight sets to Roger Federer. He reached the semifinals of his next tournament, the Davidoff Swiss Indoors, before losing to countryman Nalbandian. He was beaten by Nalbandian again in his next tournament, {{this time it was}} {{in the second round of}} the Paris Masters. Del Potro blamed fatigue for his defeat, [...] "It's difficult to play the last tournament of the <b>year.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tired, my mind was in Argentina [...] ". This left del Potro's qualification for the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup out of his hands; fortunately for him, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat James Blake in the semifinals, which was enough to ensure his place at the year-end event.|$|E

500|$|In March 2011, Aronofsky bowed out of {{directing}} the film, {{saying in a}} statement, [...] "As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox, {{it became clear that}} the production of The Wolverine would keep me out of the country for almost a <b>year....</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not comfortable being away from my family for that length of time. I am sad that I won't be able to see the project through, as it is a terrific script and I was very much looking forward to working with my friend, Hugh Jackman, again". Fox also decided to be [...] "in no rush" [...] to start the production due to the damage incurred in Japan by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Despite this, Jackman said the project was moving ahead. [...] "It's too early to call on Japan, I'm not sure where they're at. So now we're finding another director, but Fox is very anxious to make the movie and we're moving ahead full steam to find another director".|$|E
500|$|In early 2005, Brian Welch {{announced}} that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last <b>year</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I {{think that was the}} biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} full season in 1938, he batted [...]343 – behind only batting {{champion}} Jimmie Foxx's [...]349 – while leading the league with 18 triples. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a [...]292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. [...] "It was just another blunder in a bad season that has been full of mistakes", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, [...] "I'm going to show 'em I'm no flash in the pan. Last <b>year</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> overswinging and taking my eye of the ball. I'm {{not going to do that}} this season." [...] During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players and by the end of it, a statement of support from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low [...]219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh.|$|E

2500|$|White {{was made}} Australian of the Year for 1974, {{but in a}} {{typically}} rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians {{to spend the day}} reflecting {{on the state of the}} country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: [...] "Something terrible happened to me last week.

2500|$|In the {{following}} few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the Wahnzettel ("Madness Letters")—to {{a number of}} friends including Cosima Wagner and Jacob Burckhardt. Most of them were signed [...] "Dionysos", though some were also signed [...] "der Gekreuzigte" [...] meaning [...] "the crucified one". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: [...] "I have had Caiaphas put in fetters. Also, last <b>year</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, Bismarck, and all anti-Semites abolished." [...] Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany, that the pope should be put in jail and that he, Nietzsche, created the world and was in progress of having all anti-Semites shot dead.|$|E

I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point {{at the end of my}} first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine.

2500|$|It {{was within}} this post-war setting that McGready {{took part in}} several {{sporadic}} revivals, first in Virginia, at Hampden-Sydney College (1787-9) and then in Guilford County in 1791 {{in conjunction with a}} school where several of his future colleagues, including Barton Stone, studied for a career in politics under Presbyterian David Caldwell. [...] McGready’s hard-hitting sermons on the sinfulness of people and their need for conversion demanded a response beyond intellectual assent to the tenets of Christianity; McGready advocated a heartfelt and “sensible” religion centered on the doctrine of regeneration, or the new birth. [...] McGready’s preaching, however, was not without controversy. [...] His appeals were convincing to Stone in regard to his sinfulness, but were no source of relief for the state of his tortured soul. [...] Calvinist doctrine, as taught by the Scots-Irish Presbyterians, espoused limited atonement, the belief that Christ’s sacrifice for sin was available only to those who had been predestined. Years later, Stone would reflect that he had “anticipated a long and painful struggle before I should…get religion. … For one <b>year</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tossed on the waves of uncertainty…sometimes desponding and almost despairing.” [...] Stone eventually responded, with a sense of his own conversion, to the appeals of one of McGready’s associates, William Hodge, who spoke not of the flames of hell, but of the love of God for sinners.|$|E
2500|$|Callas herself {{appears to}} have been in {{agreement}} not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: [...] "The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses", and in 1968 she added, [...] "They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist [...] {{to be able to play}} everything; he [...] to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.|$|E
