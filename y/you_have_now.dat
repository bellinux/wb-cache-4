25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E
500|$|Hall of Fame player Magic Johnson said, [...] "The {{excitement}} [...] {{has caused}} in [...] Garden, man, I hadn't seen {{that in a}} long time." [...] He appeared {{on the cover of}} Sports Illustrated with the headline [...] "Against All Odds", which the Times called [...] "the greatest tribute". He also made the cover of Time in Asia; Forbes wrote, [...] "Congratulations Jeremy. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> made the cover of Time the same number of times as Michael Jordan. Linsanity reigns on." [...] Lin's story was also on the front-page of many Taipei newspapers. [...] "I haven't done a computation, but it's fair to say that no player has created the interest and the frenzy in this short period of time, in any sport, that I'm aware of like Jeremy Lin has," [...] said NBA commissioner David Stern.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt was {{impressed}} by some models Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty. [...] In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress {{be added to the}} obverse of the cent: [...] "I feel very strongly that on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress. [...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't you have just such a head as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>now,</b> but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn". [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle [...] "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress (or no headdress) for Liberty".|$|E

500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, and tell me all about it".|$|E
500|$|Stalemate {{drew closer}} as the Rhodesian Cabinet {{resolved}} that since Wilson had ruled out {{maintenance of the}} status quo, its only remaining options were to trust in the Royal Commission or declare independence. When the terms for the commission's visit were presented to Smith, he found that contrary to what had been discussed during the British Prime Minister's visit, the Royal Commission would operate {{on the basis that}} the 1961 constitution was unacceptable to the British government, and that Britain would not commit itself to accepting the final report. Smith said these conditions amounted to a [...] "vote of no confidence in [...] before they commenced", and therefore rejected them. [...] "The impression you left with us of a determined effort to resolve our constitutional problem has been utterly dissipated", he wrote to Wilson on 5 November. [...] "It would seem that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> finally closed the door which you publicly claimed to have opened." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{enthusiastic}} response {{came from}} atheists, with Hewett Watson hailing Darwin as the [...] "greatest revolutionist in {{natural history of}} this century". The 68-year-old Robert Edmund Grant, who had shown him the study of invertebrates when Darwin {{was a student at}} the University of Edinburgh and who was still teaching Lamarckian evolution weekly at University College London, brought out a small book on classification dedicated to Darwin: [...] "With one fell-sweep of the wand of truth, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> scattered to the winds the pestilential vapours accumulated by 'species-mongers'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Washington wrote {{a letter}} to Proctor {{accepting}} his resignation as follows. [...] "I am sorry to find that the situation of your domestic affairs renders it necessary for you to quit the service. It always gives me pain to part with an officer, but particularly so with one whose experience and attention have made him useful in his profession. I cannot in justice to you permit you to leave the army without expressing my approbation of your conduct upon every occasion since you joined me in 1776, and wish you success in the line of life which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> embraced." [...] From December 25, 1782 to October 22, 1783 Proctor held a commission from Congress as major.|$|E
