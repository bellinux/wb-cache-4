When Gittings' partner Kay Tobin Lahusen noticed that all the psychiatrists were heterosexual, she protested. Gittings remembered, [...] "My partner, Kay, said, 'This isn't right—here <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> psychiatrists pitted against two gays, and {{what you really need}} is someone who is both.' The panel moderator, Dr. Kent Robinson, agreed to add a gay psychiatrist if we could find one. In 1972 who would come forward? ... Kay and I wrote letters and made phone calls around the country." [...] A gay psychiatrist in Philadelphia finally agreed to appear on the panel in heavy disguise, and with a voice distorting microphone, calling himself [...] "Dr. H. Anonymous". He was [...] John E. Fryer, and he discussed how he was forced to be closeted while practicing psychiatry. Gittings read aloud letters from psychiatrists she had solicited who declined to appear for fear of professional ostracism. She described the event as [...] "transformative".|$|E

500|$|Robert L. Surtees, who {{had already}} filmed several of the most {{successful}} epics of the 1950s, was hired as cinematographer for the film. Early on in the film's production, Zimbalist and other MGM executives made the decision to film the picture in a widescreen format. Wyler strongly disliked the widescreen format, commenting that [...] "Nothing is out of the picture, and you can't fill it. You either have a lot of empty space, or <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> people talking and a flock of others surrounding them who {{have nothing to do with}} the scene. Your eye just wanders out of curiosity." [...] The cameras were also quite large, heavy, and difficult and time-consuming to move. To overcome these difficulties, Surtees and Wyler collaborated on using the widescreen lenses, film stocks, and projection technologies to create highly detailed images for the film. Wyler was best known for composition in depth, a visual technique in which people, props, and architecture are not merely composed horizontally but in depth of field as well. He also had a strong preference for long takes, during which his actors could move within this highly detailed space.|$|E
500|$|The Kurt–Blaine relationship, {{sometimes}} referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Klaine" [...] by Glee fans and the media, developed slowly. As the series showrunner, Murphy felt tasked with keeping the two apart as long as possible. He was initially unsure whether the relationship would become a romantic one, and intended to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of {{the middle of the}} season." [...] In December 2010, Colfer said, [...] "Fans really want it to happen. It's funny how many people want to see these boys hook up. We'll see." [...] Based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy decided to have Blaine become Kurt's love interest. Criss noted: [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> people that can be together you've got to hold it up." ...|$|E

[...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button.

500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was that close to our film. I guess if you stand back, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} {{on the second}} season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest. According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron. Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, {{a member of the}} rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season." [...] Kurt transfers from McKinley High to Dalton Academy and falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine only considers him a close friend. However, when Kurt sings the Beatles song [...] "Blackbird" [...] in [...] "Original Song", Blaine finally realizes his true feelings and the two kiss, marking the start of the relationship. Criss noted, [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> people that can be together you've got to hold it up." [...] When imagining Blaine and Kurt's potential future together, Murphy expected to treat them the same as all other Glee relationships by making their pairing [...] "as flawed and as exposed as everyone else's." [...] This plan was confirmed by Falchuk after the characters kissed for the first time, though he later clarified: [...] "They're solid. They have problems—you have two stars dating each other, there's going to be some competition there." [...] In the second-season finale, they each tell the other, [...] "I love you", and early in the third season they decide to have sex for the first time. The Kurt–Blaine relationship has been well received by critics, and they were named [...] "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium" [...] late in the second season by Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post.|$|E

2500|$|Things That Happen Again: For a Here and a There (1986-1991) was {{installed}} at the Chinati Foundation by Donald Judd and Roni Horn in 1988. The work consists of two identical truncated cones that are 35 inches long, tapering from a diameter of 17 inches to 12 inches. [...] The pair {{is part of a}} 1986-1991 suite consisting of four sets of paired, solid copper forms, each hand-lathed to duplicate mechanical identity. The entire suite is titled Things That Happen Again, and also includes For Two Rooms, For a This and a That, and For Things that are Near. In describing the piece's intention, Horn states the importance of the two objects' apparent duplicity: The narrative involves the recognition of uniqueness through the sequential experience of things which are identical. Then the subsequent and irreversible loss of the unique identity. Obviously the notion of being identical is a purely ideal one since when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> things, no matter how perfect the identity, you always have a this and a that, a here and a there. In both pieces we’re talking about the critical role of relation in defining the form.|$|E
2500|$|Freight trains {{operated}} by MMA were allowed (not [...] "permitted", see below) by regulators in Canada (Transport Canada) and the United States (Federal Railroad Administration) to have Single Person Train Operation (SPTO, alternately OPTO) status (1 operator). The [...] "permit" [...] process, which requires public input, was not followed. The Canadian regulator and the MMA {{entered into a}} negotiation process at the culmination of which, sometime before {{the second week of}} July 2012, the government allowed MMA to reduce their manpower to SPTO. An average of 80 tankcars per train was carried on this route under the supervision of one person only. The Maine regulator had already allowed SPTO status before the first week of April 2012. The use of SPTO for MMA freight trains was a cost-cutting move for which the railway company has received much criticism. In May 2010, former MMA engineer Jarod Briggs of Millinocket, Maine explained to the Bangor Daily News that “so much could happen in a 12-hour shift on one of these trains, such as a washed-out track, downed trees or mechanical failure. What if the engineer onboard were to encounter a medical problem? Who is going to know about it? If there is a fire engine or an ambulance needing to get by a train or a crossing when that happens, it could take hours.” Briggs left MMA to work for another railway in 2007; while he described the lone crew member involved in the Lac-Mégantic derailment as [...] "a very good engineer, one of the better on the property", he has long expressed safety concerns about the company's overall train operations because “if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>two</b> people watching you can catch a mistake.
