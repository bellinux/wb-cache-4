2500|$|Belle is an {{influential}} proponent {{of discipline and}} control in parkour, saying, [...] "Precision is all about being measured," [...] and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master. [...] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time {{but it does not}} mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times." [...] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.|$|E

2500|$|Bands {{like the}} Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company (with Janis Joplin), and Jefferson Airplane {{continued}} {{to live in the}} Haight, {{but by the end of}} the summer, the incessant media coverage led the Diggers to declare the [...] "death" [...] of the hippie with a parade. [...] According to the late poet Stormi Chambless, the hippies buried an effigy of a hippie in the Panhandle to demonstrate the end of his/her reign. [...] Regarding this period of history, the July 7, 1967, TIME magazine featured a cover story entitled, [...] "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." [...] The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: [...] "Do your own thing, wherever <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and whenever you want. [...] Drop out.

2500|$|The {{formation}} of a College for engineering, or technical university, was quite a difficult project, as the entire subject of engineering education was obscure. A small number of colleges had commenced this, such as Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and Harvard, Yale, and RPI in New York; MIT and Cornell were just being founded. The University of Pennsylvania opened a small school in 1852, for mining and materials, but which had closed {{at the onset of}} the Civil War. As W. Ross Yates notes: [...] "No one knew with certainty how many years a course [...] in engineering should take, or even what branches of engineering should be included within a university. The relationship between theory and practice was hazy." [...] A statement made years later by industrialist and Lehigh Trustee Eckley B. Coxe summarizes the problem succinctly: [...] "Not knowing exactly what you want to do or the material <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with, what is the best way of doing it?" ...|$|E

Supporting were Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect. This tour {{marked the beginning of}} the heavy theatrics later showcased in many of their live shows. Way expressed his plans for the tour in an interview with MTV, saying, [...] "we'd talked about bringing out dancers for our headlining tour in the fall, but it's a big undertaking; you have to have a bus full of dancers. We've always wanted to do a big theatrical tour. But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in steps". The use of theatrics was evident during The Black Parade World Tour, which supported their album of the same name.

2500|$|In June 1967, Herb Caen was {{approached}} by [...] "a distinguished magazine" [...] to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the San Francisco Chronicle. Caen determined that, [...] "Except in their music, they couldn't care less about {{the approval of the}} straight world." [...] Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture. On July 7, Time magazine featured a cover story entitled, [...] "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." [...] The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: [...] "Do your own thing, wherever <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and whenever you want. Drop out. Leave society as you have known it. Leave it utterly. Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach. Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun." [...] It is estimated that around 100,000 people traveled to San Francisco in the summer of 1967. The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the [...] "hippie" [...] label. With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos.|$|E
