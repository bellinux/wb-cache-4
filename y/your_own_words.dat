2500|$|Depp {{stated in}} a BBC radio {{interview}} on July 29, 2013 {{that he hopes}} {{to be involved with}} [...] "quieter things" [...] {{at some point in the}} near future, implying that he will retire from acting. Depp explained in further detail during the interview: [...] "I wouldn't say I'm dropping out any second, but I would say it's probably not too far away. When you add up the amount of dialogue that you say per year and you realise that you've said written words more than you've had a chance to say <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> you start thinking about that as an insane option for a human being." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{will be just}} as much {{stealing}} as if {{you took}} both," [...] said the second voice. [...] "Besides, you will be breaking <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word.</b> You said that you never would take another egg." ...|$|R

Why should you shake the sand which is passing so fast? the very executioner hurries not the prayers of the wretches upon the scaffold.--And see you not--I will argue as coldly as you can desire--see you not that you are {{breaking}} <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word,</b> and recalling the hope which yourself held out to me?" ...|$|R
2500|$|For example, {{a recipe}} is a process, and not copyrightable, {{but the words}} used to {{describe}} it are; see idea-expression divide and Publications International v Meredith Corp. (1996). Therefore, you can rewrite a recipe in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> and publish it without infringing copyrights. But, if you rewrote every recipe from a particular cookbook, you might still be found to have infringed the author's copyright {{in the choice of}} recipes and their [...] "coordination" [...] and [...] "presentation", even if you used different words; however, the West decisions below suggest that this is unlikely unless there is some significant creativity carried over from the original presentation. [...] It should be noted that a sufficiently novel, useful, and unique (i.e. non-obvious) recipe can be granted protection under patent law.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{repeat that}} it is an impertinence," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Beach, but with a careful avoidance of the direct issue. [...] "What! You, who have nothing in the world except a name which you father has--well--tarnished--to use <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word,</b> you ask me for my dear daughter's hand? You are so selfish that you wish not only to ruin her chances in life, but also to drag her into the depths of your poverty. Leonard, I should never have thought it of you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{this is very}} singular, sir, and I {{had almost}} used <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word</b> of 'alarming,'" [...] replied Mildred, {{slightly}} agitated by curiosity, but more amused. [...] "I shall be as frank as yourself, and say that you judge the gentleman harshly. Mr. Rotherham may not have all the qualities that a clergyman ought to possess, but he {{is far from being}} a bad man. Good or bad, however, it is not probable that he will carry his transient partiality any farther than he has gone already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{would you}} call that justice?" [...] asked Henry, sharply. [...] "Whatever {{punishment}} you may deserve, you do not deserve to die. You know well enough that <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word</b> will go for nothing, {{and no one else}} can bear witness in your favour. You will be regarded simply as a notorious pirate. Even if some of the people whose lives you have spared while taking their goods should turn up, their testimony could not prove that you had not murdered others; so your fate is certain if you go to trial. Have you any right, then, to compass <b>your</b> <b>own</b> death by thus giving yourself up?" ...|$|R

"Nothing in {{the least}} uncivil; but he has an idea in his head which nothing on earth will put out of it, and in which, but for <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word,</b> I should be {{inclined}} to agree." [...] Harry, when this was said, stood still on the mountain-side, and looked full into his companion's face. He felt {{at the moment that}} the idea had some reference to Mountjoy Scarborough and his disappearance. They were together on the heathy, unenclosed ground of Cannock Chase, and had already walked some ten or twelve miles. [...] "He thinks you know where Mountjoy is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have engaged}} {{yourself}} in my absence. <b>Your</b> <b>words</b> <b>own</b> it; <b>your</b> looks <b>own</b> it! You have engaged yourself to another man!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "At last, traitor, I {{have found}} you out. <b>Your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> have {{condemned}} you {{as surely as}} the acts of these red creatures have sealed their fates--unless--" [...] He paused. [...] "Unless the woman--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you speak}} in that tone of your hero, Dolores? Remember {{that he only}} warned me of my danger out of pure friendship. But his warning was thrown away; my unhappy passion, the sight of <b>your</b> loveliness, <b>your</b> <b>own</b> incautious <b>words,</b> were too much for my heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|As to {{quotations}} from ancient fathers, I {{think they are}} best brought in to confirm some opinion controverted by those who differ from us: in other cases we give you full power to adopt the sentence for <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> rather than tell us, [...] "as St. Austin excellently observes." [...] But to mention modern writers by name, or use the phrase of [...] "a late excellent prelate of our Church," [...] and the like, is altogether intolerable, and for what reason I know not, makes every rational hearer ashamed. Of no better a stamp is your [...] "heathen philosopher" [...] and [...] "famous poet," [...] and [...] "Roman historian," [...] at least in common congregations, who will rather believe you on <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>word,</b> than on that of Plato or Homer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have <b>your</b> <b>own</b> good <b>word,</b> doubtless," [...] said De Lacy; [...] "nevertheless, Sir Minstrel, thou goest {{not with}} me. The Crusade has been already too much {{encumbered}} by men of thy idle profession; and if thou dost {{add to the}} number, it shall not be under my protection. I am {{too old to be}} charmed by thy art, charm thou never so wisely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{agreed the}} Professor; [...] "but I {{want you to}} tell me in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> We do not speak of a maiden, you know; we say a girl. Yes, it is about a girl. Go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{take that}} for granted; and {{therefore}} I {{have come to}} you {{to tell you that}} it is your duty to repudiate with all the strength of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> the terrible charges which are brought against you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly so--The {{shape of}} the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it, it will indeed, to use <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> be an {{exquisite}} possession." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again I checked him. [...] "I {{have not}} done," [...] said I. [...] "Would God I had! All this my dear, unfortunate patron has endured without help or countenance. <b>Your</b> <b>own</b> best <b>word,</b> my lord, was only gratitude. O, {{but he was}} your son too! He had no other father. He was hated in the country, God knows how unjustly. He had a loveless marriage. He stood on all hands without affection or support--dear, generous, ill-fated, noble heart!" ...|$|R

"I {{verified}} the tale," [...] said Saladin, [...] "by {{causing the}} body to be examined; and I made this unhappy being, whom Allah hath made the discoverer of the crime, repeat in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> presence the <b>words</b> which the murderer spoke; and you yourselves saw the effect which they produced upon his conscience!" ...|$|R

Thank you LiU-‐Tryck for providing the flexibility needed to match reality. This work is a small contribution to the greater goal of making software systems used in healthcare more useful and sustainable. To come closer to that goal, health record data {{will need to be}} more computable and easier to exchange between systems. Interoperability refers to getting systems to work together and semantics concerns the study of meanings. If Semantic interoperability is achieved then information entered in one information system is usable in other systems and reusable for many purposes. Scalability refers {{to the extent to which}} a system can gracefully grow by adding more resources. Sustainability refers more to how to best use available limited resources.

"Lady Diana {{says that}} he attends Committees all day; that then again {{he is at the}} House all night; that he always votes as he is told; that he never speaks; that he will never get on beyond a {{subordinate}} place; and as his grandmother tells him, he is choked with red-tape. Are you going to follow the same career; Arthur? What is there in it so brilliant that you should be so eager for it? I would rather that you should stop at home, and write books--good books, kind books, with gentle kind thoughts, such as you have, dear Arthur, and such as might do people good to read. And if you do not win fame, what then? You own it is vanity, and you can live very happily without it.

60|$|It {{would be}} endless {{to run over}} the several defects of style among us; I shall {{therefore}} {{say nothing of the}} mean and paltry (which are usually attended by the fustian), much less of the slovenly or indecent. Two things I will just warn you against; the first is the frequency of flat unnecessary epithets, and the other is the folly of using old threadbare phrases, which will often make you go out of your way to find and apply them, are nauseous to rational hearers, and will seldom express your meaning as well as <b>your</b> <b>own</b> natural <b>words.</b>|$|R
