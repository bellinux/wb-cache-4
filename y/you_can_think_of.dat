500|$|Southerton's tour report {{refers to}} the crowds' {{reactions}} to the England team, and in particular to the [...] "barracking" [...] of Larwood. This, he says, only once reached unacceptable proportions—during the game against Victoria that took place between {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests. This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria's weakest batsman, Bert Ironmonger. In general, Southerton felt that crowd noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that, [...] "objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England, it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public out there as part of their day's enjoyment". Larwood's view was that [...] "it was a bit too thick at times... I got called every name you can imagine, and every four-letter word <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was used against me". The Surrey amateur batsman Douglas Jardine, was likewise a target of the crowds, and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians—which was fully reciprocated.|$|E
500|$|Following the album's release, Charles quickly {{earned an}} influx of white {{listeners}} and audiences at concert venues, without experiencing any fall-out from his predominantly black audience. Writer Daniel Cooper later said of the album's effect, [...] "It's an idea as corny as any country song <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> and one that Charles knew to be true; music unites people. It just really does." [...] Throughout the years following its initial reception, Modern Sounds gained further acknowledgment of {{its impact on the}} music industry and society. Through conceiving and recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to receive and practice artistic control bestowed upon by a mainstream record company. In a 1998 interview, country musician Raul Malo acknowledged the album's influence, calling it [...] "one of the most important records of our time, not only because of its content, but also due to its social and political ramifications." [...] In a July 8, 2004 article for Rolling Stone magazine, music journalist Robert Christgau praised the impact and influence that the Modern Sounds recordings had on music, stating [...] "In the world it created, not only could a black person sing the American songbook Ella Fitzgerald owned by then, but a country black person could take it over. Soon Charles's down-home diction, cotton-field grit, corn-pone humor and overstated shows of emotion were standard operating procedure in American music, black and white." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Jean Renoir, he said: [...] "I think Renoir is {{the only}} filmmaker who's {{practically}} infallible, who has never made a mistake on film. And I think if he never made mistakes, it's because he always found solutions based on simplicity—human solutions. He's one film director who never pretended. He never tried to have a style, and if you know his work—which is very comprehensive, since he dealt {{with all sorts of}} subjects—when you get stuck, especially as a young filmmaker, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> how Renoir would have handled the situation, and you generally find a solution".|$|E
2500|$|He had {{a lifelong}} {{ambition}} {{to make a}} film about his hero the political theorist and revolutionary Thomas Paine, whom he called [...] "one of the finest men that ever lived". He {{said in an interview in}} 2006 that [...] "I could understand him. He wrote in simple English. I found all his aspirations – the rights of women, the health service, universal education... Everything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that we want is in Rights of Man or The Age of Reason or Common Sense." [...] He could not secure the funding to do so. The website [...] "A Gift for Dickie" [...] was launched by two filmmakers from Luton in June 2008 with the aim of raising £40m in 400 days to help him make the film, but the target was not met and the money that had been raised was refunded.|$|E
2500|$|During his 10 {{years in}} Buffalo, Zelen helped the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) — {{one of several}} {{regional}} organizations established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to test experimental cancer treatments — with its studies. In an American University alumni magazine article in 2008, Zelen said those early studies were “terrible.” He said the studies were “poorly thought out; the data was wrong; they had poor quality control, not enough patients — everything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that was antiscientific.” [...] He urged biomedical researchers {{in charge of the}} studies to begin from scratch because they had learned relatively little because of study design flaws. They agreed with Zelen, and along with his longtime collaborator Paul Carbone, he established research standards and practice now used in clinical trials for many infectious diseases. [...] During that period, Zelen formed the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Buffalo, which focused on overseeing and improving statistical aspects of large, complex drug trials. [...] ECOG would later become one of the world's largest programs for testing and evaluating various cancer treatments.|$|E

2500|$|Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, artistic {{director}} of Jazz at Lincoln Center, learned about Joey Alexander after a friend suggested he watch a YouTube video clip of him playing compositions by Coltrane, Monk and Chick Corea. Marsalis praised Joey Alexander as [...] "my hero" [...] on his Facebook page, and invited him to appear at his organization's gala in May 2014, when he was 10. It marked Joey Alexander's United States debut. He received positive reviews for his performance, particularly for his solo version of the Monk song [...] "'Round Midnight". The New York Times said he became an [...] "overnight sensation" [...] after the performance. Allen Morrison of Down Beat magazine said of the performance: [...] "If the word 'genius' still means anything, it applies to this prodigy. He played his own solo variations on 'Round Midnight' with a breathtaking precocity and mastery of several decades of piano style." [...] Marsalis said of him: [...] "There has never been anyone that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> who could play like that at his age. I loved everything about his playing – his rhythm, his confidence, {{his understanding of the}} music." [...] Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, widow of tennis player Arthur Ashe, invited Joey Alexander to perform at the Arthur Ashe Learning Center gala, where he played for a crowd that included former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Moutoussamy-Ashe introduced him to Gordon Uehling III, founder of the CourtSense Tennis Training Center, who has allowed Joey Alexander and his family to stay at his estate in Alpine, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Leaving {{his wife}} and son, Clark began {{the first of his}} diaries a month before the First Fleet {{departed}} Portsmouth, on 13 May 1787. The writing in the diaries is very personal and informal, and was never intended for publication. Clark was extremely homesick, and longed to see {{his wife and}} son, writing as early as {{the second day of the}} voyage: [...] "Oh my God all my hoppes [...] are over of seeing my beloved wife and son". Like many of his fellow officers, he was aggrieved at the level of comfort and support offered to the convicts, noting [...] "I believe few Marines or Soldiers going out on a foreign Service under Government were ever better, if so well provided for as these Convicts are". On arrival in Botany Bay, Clark was dismayed at the unsuitable conditions, which were far from what had been promised in England: [...] "if we are obliged to settle here there will not a soul be alive in the course of a year". With the site for settlement subsequently moved to Sydney Cove, Clark remained distressed by the living conditions experienced by himself and his fellow officers, expressing in a letter to his family in England: [...] "I never slept worse, my dear wife, than I did last night, what with the hard cold ground, spiders, ants and every vermin <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was crawling over me". During the colony's early years, little food was produced, and the rations brought from England were soon consumed, leaving the colony in near starvation. Clark wrote [...] "God help us. If some ships dont [...] arrive, I dont know what will". Supplies finally arrived in June 1790, on Lady Juliana.|$|E
2500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "while failing to {{transform}} the classic film into an engrossing interactive experience, the game does shine when it doesn't {{have to rely on}} the film license to pull it along." [...] GameSpy's William Abner scored the PC version 3 out of 5, and was critical of the use of the license; [...] "where the original movie was full of political intrigue, wicked subplots and occasional gratuitous violence, the game is all about the violence." [...] He wrote [...] "Being a Godfather game, you'd expect things to be a bit less [...] "insane" [...] than your run-of-the-mill Grand Theft Auto clone. But there's more gunplay, more Blues Brothers-inspired car chases, and more thuggery in general, in 30 minutes of the game than in the entire movie trilogy." [...] He concluded [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as a generic gangland-themed game without constantly comparing it to the films it borrows its license from, you can certainly have a good time. That said, it's hard to play The Godfather without thinking that this was a missed opportunity." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the Xbox version 6 out of 10, calling it [...] "way too short, far too easy, too damned repetitive and far too in awe of Grand Theft Auto to be held up as anything other than a rather lightweight copycat offering." [...] Although he was critical of the length of the game's story in relation to the extortion gameplay, he felt the combat went some way to redeeming the game; [...] "the one main saving grace is that the combat is actually fun enough to nullify the overwhelming repetition." [...] He argued the game [...] "offers a decent amount of fun, with great combat, occasionally inspired set-pieces, but sub-par driving and a half-baked story mode with barely enough variety to fill a long evening." ...|$|E
