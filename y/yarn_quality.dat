5000|$|The {{quality of}} bed sheets is often {{conveyed}} by the thread count—the {{number of threads}} per square inch of material. In general, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet, but the weave and type of thread may affect the [...] "hand" [...] of the material so that a sheet with a lower thread count may actually be softer than one with a higher count. <b>Yarn</b> <b>quality</b> also plays {{a part in the}} look and feel of sheets, as finer yarns tend to create a finer sheet fabric. The ply also plays a role in how heavy the sheet feels. Ply represents how many fibers are twisted together as the sheet is being created.
