5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> 20’s.|$|E

The style {{was called the}} [...] "ponyhawk" [...] by host Ryan Seacrest. While singing, Malakar hesitated {{with some of the}} words to the song. Simon Cowell remarked, [...] "Sanjaya, I don't think it matters anymore what we say ... I think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own universe and if people like you, good luck." [...] The following night, host Seacrest walked out on stage wearing a wig with the same hairstyle, parodying Malakar.|$|E

2500|$|Affleck became Lopez's muse {{when writing}} and {{recording}} the album. [...] "I wrote {{a lot of}} songs inspired, in a way, by what I was going through {{at the time that}} this album was being made, and he was definitely a big part of that," [...] she told MTV News. The singer took more of a [...] "hands-on role", co-writing more material than she had on her previous albums. The album was titled This Is Me... Then, as it was something she wanted to look back on in retrospection. Lopez explained, [...] "Who you are at that time, what kind of music you like, what kind of beats you're into, what kind of state of mind you're in, what you're attracted to ... it's all very telling of where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life at that point. ... Twenty years from now, if I give this [...] to one of my kids, I'll be like, 'This was me then, at that moment.'" [...] Lopez dedicated the album to Affleck, with the words [...] "You are my life ... my sole inspiration for every lyric, every emotion, every bit of feeling on this record" [...] written on the disc jacket.|$|E
2500|$|Book of Leviticus: [...] "God {{spoke to}} Moses at Mount Sinai, {{telling him to}} speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you come to the land that I am giving you, the land must be given a rest period, a sabbath to God. For six years you may plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest your crops, but the seventh year is a sabbath of sabbaths for the land. It is God's sabbath during which you may not plant your fields, nor prune your vineyards. Do not harvest crops that grow on their own and do not gather the grapes on your unpruned vines, since it is a year of rest for the land. [...] the land is resting may be eaten by you, by your male and female slaves, and by the {{employees}} and resident hands who live with you. All the crops shall be eaten by the domestic and wild animals that are in your land." [...] (Leviticus 25:1–7) [...] "And if ye shall say: 'What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase'; then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store." [...] (Leviticus 25:20–22) [...] " [...] I will scatter you among the nations, and keep the sword drawn against you. Your land will remain desolate, and your cities in ruins. Then, as long as the land is desolate and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> enemies' land, the land will enjoy its sabbaths. The land will rest and enjoy its sabbatical years. Thus, {{as long as it is}} desolate, [...] will enjoy the sabbatical rest that you would not give it when you lived there." [...] (Leviticus 26:33-35) ...|$|E
