5|$|Ross {{declined}} {{to become the}} first Texas governor to run for a third term, and left office on January 20, 1891. During his four <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> he vetoed only ten bills, and pardoned 861 people. Compared to other Texas governors, these are small numbers; Governor Miriam A. Ferguson granted 1161 pardons in just two years.|$|E
5|$|Haakon Steen Lie (22 September 1905 – 25 May 2009) was a Norwegian {{politician}} {{who served as}} party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party from 1945 to 1969. Coming from humble origins, he {{became involved in the}} labour movement at an early age, and quickly rose in the party system. After actively working for the resistance movement and the exiled government during World War II, {{he was elected to the}} second-highest position in the party after the war, and his <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> were the most successful in the party's history.|$|E
5|$|Morrow urged {{enforcement}} of state laws against carrying concealed weapons and restricted {{activities of the}} Ku Klux Klan. During {{his first year in}} office, he granted only 100 pardons. This was a considerable decrease from the number granted by his immediate predecessors. During their first <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> J. C. W. Beckham granted 350 pardons, James B. McCreary (during his second stint as governor) granted 139, and Augustus O. Stanley granted 257. He was also {{an active member of the}} Commission on Interracial Cooperation, a society for the elimination of racial violence in the South.|$|E
50|$|The economy {{posted a}} {{positive}} growth of 3.4% {{during her first}} <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> But <b>in</b> {{the aftermath of the}} 1989 coup attempt, the Philippine economy remained stagnant. <b>In</b> her final <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> inflation was raging at 17%, and unemployment was slightly over 10%, higher than the Marcos years.|$|R
25|$|The {{budget year}} runs from October 1 to September 30 the {{following}} year and is submitted by the President to Congress prior to October for the following <b>year.</b> <b>In</b> this way the budget of 2013 is submitted {{before the end of}} September 2012. This means that the budget of 2001 was submitted by Bill Clinton and was in force during most of George W. Bush's first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> The budget submitted by George W. Bush <b>in</b> his last <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> was the budget of 2009, which was in force through most of Barack Obama's first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b>|$|R
500|$|As prime minister, Modi has {{received}} consistently high approval ratings; {{at the end}} of his first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of people rating him [...] "very favorably" [...] and 93% approving of his government. His approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani. At the end of his second <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him [...] "very favorably." [...] At the end of his third <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> The Times of India poll showed that 77% of the respondents rated him as [...] "very good" [...] and [...] "good".|$|R

5|$|The {{governing}} Labour administration led by Gordon Brown {{was defeated}} in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> The opposition Conservatives led by David Cameron won {{the largest number of}} seats in the new Parliament, but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg, aimed at forming a coalition government.|$|E
5|$|The longest-serving {{governor}} was the first, George Clinton, who first took office on July 30, 1777, and served seven terms {{in two different}} periods, totaling just under 21 <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> (As 18 of those years were consecutive, Clinton also served the longest consecutive period in office for a New York governor.) Charles Poletti had the shortest term, serving 29 days following {{the resignation of the}} previous governor in 1942. The current governor is Andrew Cuomo, who took office on January 1, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{disasters}} struck during 79 and 80. On 24 August 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted, {{burying the}} surrounding cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum under metres of ash and lava; the following year, a {{fire broke out}} in Rome that lasted three days and that destroyed {{a number of important}} public buildings. Consequently, Titus spent much of his reign coordinating relief efforts and restoring damaged property. On 13 September 81 after barely two <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> he unexpectedly died of fever during a trip to the Sabine territories.|$|E
5|$|According to the Gallup Organization, Obama {{began his}} {{presidency}} with a 68% approval rating before gradually declining {{for the rest}} of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration. Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.|$|E
5|$|As {{the result}} of a 2015 {{referendum}} in Houston, a mayor is elected for a four-year term, and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms. The term limits were spearheaded in 1991 by conservative political activist Clymer Wright. During 1991–2015, the city controller and city council members were subjected to a two-year, three-term limitation – the 2015 referendum amended term limits to two four-year terms. As of 2017 some councilmembers who served two terms and won a final term will have served eight <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> whereas a freshman councilmember who won a position in 2013 can serve up to two additional terms under the previous term limit law – a select few will have at least 10 years of incumbency once their term expires.|$|E

5|$|Ceolnoth (died 870) was {{a medieval}} English Archbishop of Canterbury. Although later chroniclers stated he had {{previously}} held ecclesiastical office in Canterbury, there is no contemporary evidence of this, and his first appearance in history is when he became archbishop in 833. Ceolnoth faced two problems as archbishop– raids and invasions by the Vikings and a new political situation resulting from a change in overlordship from one kingdom to another during {{the early part of}} his archiepiscopate. Ceolnoth attempted to solve both problems by coming to an agreement with his new overlords for protection in 838. Ceolnoth's later <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> were marked by more Viking raids and a decline in monastic life in his archbishopric.|$|E
5|$|Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts. In his eight <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams). Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} workload—Hay {{wrote that he}} was busy 20 hours a day—he tried to make as normal a life as possible, eating his meals with Nicolay at Willard's Hotel, going to the theatre with Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and reading Les Misérables in French. Hay, still in his early 20s, spent time both in barrooms and at cultured get-togethers {{in the homes of}} Washington's elite. The two {{secretaries}} often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln's salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses. Despite the secretaries' objections, Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor and managed to spend almost 70% of her husband's salary in his four <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

5|$|During Ceolnoth's archbishopric, monastic life {{declined}} {{under the}} pressure of the Viking attacks, and there was a noticeable decline in the quality of the books and other works produced by the scriptoriums. A number of monasteries died out {{under the pressure}} of the raids by the invaders, who wintered over in Kent in 851 and 855. He held councils in 839 and 845, the second at London. During his later <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> he was assisted by four clerics, who appear to have been or acted as archdeacons, one of the earliest appearances of this office in England. Ceolnoth is also known to have corresponded with Pope Leo IV.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} half of Letcher's term, the state was still {{struggling}} to recover from the financial Panic of 1837. Consistent with his Whig views, Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States. To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically cut spending, including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's deficit and improved its credit. In each of Letcher's <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> the state showed a small but growing budget surplus.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.|$|E

He was initially unsuccessful, though he {{was instrumental in the}} founding of Clemson University as an agricultural school. In 1890, Tillman took control of the state Democratic Party, and was elected governor. During his four <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> 18 African Americans were lynched in South Carolina—the 1890s saw the most lynchings of any decade in South Carolina. Tillman tried to prevent lynchings, but spoke in support of the lynch mobs, stating his own willingness to lead one. In 1894, {{at the end of his}} second two-year term, he was elected to the U.S. Senate by vote of the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the address}} is an {{extended}} policy statement about his eight <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> with some pointed comments mixed in highlight certain points, in which he builds a case for the steps needed to perpetuate the union, a concept that began to germinate among and between the states during the Revolutionary War. In doing so he lifts up a well-formed and functioning Constitution (the rule of law), along with the proper habits and dispositions (both intellectual and religious) of the people as essential. Washington also lays out the greatest threats he sees to the Union, warning Americans to: distrust the passions of political factionalism, be wary of foreign interference in the nation's domestic affairs, and avoid an entangling foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|On {{moving into}} , Thatcher {{introduced}} {{a series of}} political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles {{in the wake of the}} Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983.
