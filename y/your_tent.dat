500|$|The Byrds' {{recording}} of the song caused a minor controversy between the band and its author. Dylan's original demo of [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" [...] contained the lyric [...] "Pick up your money, pack up your tent", which was mistakenly altered in The Byrds' version, by guitarist and singer Roger McGuinn, to [...] "Pack up your money, pick up your tent". Dylan expressed mock-annoyance at this lyric change in his 1971 {{recording of}} the song, singing [...] "Pack up your money, put up <b>your</b> <b>tent</b> McGuinn/You ain't goin' nowhere." [...] McGuinn replied in 1989 on a new {{recording of the}} song included on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's [...] album, adding the word [...] "Dylan" [...] after the same [...] "Pack up your money, pick up your tent" [...] lyric. McGuinn and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1989 recording of the song, which also featured The Byrds' former bass player Chris Hillman, was released as a single and peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1989, as well as number eleven on the Canadian country music charts published by RPM. In spite of {{the involvement of the}} Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the single release was credited to McGuinn and Hillman alone.|$|E

2500|$|The recitatives {{are mostly}} secco, with an arioso only in {{movement}} 9 {{on the words}} [...] (splendor, pride, riches, honor, and wealth) from the chorale. The arias contrast, interpreting the text in its affekt and in single phrases. Gardiner notes about the first pair of recitative and aria: [...] In movement 8, the call to wake up is intensified by trumpet signals and fast scales, evoking the Last Judgement. The first motif in movement 10 is sung by the two singers of the duet on the words O Menschenkind ("o child of man") and are repeated instrumentally as a hint of that warning. Both parts of the cantata are concluded by the same four-part chorale setting, asking finally [...] (Take me, Jesus, if you will, into the felicity of <b>your</b> <b>tent).</b>|$|E
