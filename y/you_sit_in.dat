Writer director Jeethu Joseph's Drishyam is one such film, a gripping tale that leaves you spellbound with its skillful craft." [...] Veeyen of NowRunning rated the film 3/5 and commented, [...] "In Drishyam Jeethu attempts a stunning mix of the real with the imaginary, {{and the result is}} an unpredictable cinematic artichoke that takes you by surprise at every turn." [...] Rating the film 3.5/5, Paresh C Palicha of Rediff said, [...] "Drishyam can be credited for bringing Mohanlal back to form and pushing director Jeethu Joseph into the big league as he has made a cracker of a thriller." [...] Jabir Mushthari of The Hindu wrote: [...] "It takes craft, intelligence, and the superior acumen of a genuine storyteller to pull off a film in such an engaging manner." [...] He also noted that the film's [...] "thread and treatment are new to Malayalam cinema in many ways" [...] and its [...] "principles go against the set rules film goers here are familiar with".|$|E

2500|$|Eric Zorn, {{writing for}} the Chicago Tribune, criticized Encinia for his {{handling}} of the traffic stop, calling him a [...] "petty tyrant" [...] and referring to his [...] "Are you done?" [...] as [...] "snippy condescension familiar to anyone experienced in the bickering arts". However, he also said Bland was unnecessarily argumentative. [...] "...ou must always defer meekly to the police. Even when they're acting like bullies, goading you or issuing you preposterous orders like to put out your cigarette as <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> your own car, don't challenge their authority....Comply. And if you feel your rights are being violated, take it up later with a judge," [...] Zorn wrote.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses {{imparted}} God's instructions, the Shema and V'ahavta, saying: [...] "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God {{with all your}} heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. And these words, which I command you this day, shall be upon your heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when thou rise up.

2500|$|Players {{are each}} dealt two cards, face {{up or down}} {{depending}} on the casino and the table at which <b>you</b> <b>sit.</b> <b>In</b> the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value {{is the sum of}} the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called [...] "soft", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card; the value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is [...] "hard".|$|E
2500|$|Performed by the Four Freshmen, [...] "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" [...] (1961) was a {{particular}} favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: [...] "My mom turned me on to them. She {{turned on the radio}} and goes, 'Hear that song? This is called 'Day By Day' by the Four Freshmen.' And I listened and I went 'Oh, I love it, Mommy! I love it!' ... We went in [...] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them to see if you wanted to buy them. ... You know how <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic." [...] By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, [...] "If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." [...] Wilson continued: [...] "I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd play a little bit. Then I'd stop and try to figure it out, back and forth, back and forth, until I figured the whole song out." ...|$|E
