5|$|By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E

Between 1868 and 1877, the year of his retirement, he proved almost unbeatable in both countries.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, Holliday lost a {{substantial}} amount of weight and talked about her health struggles with depression during promotional interviews. Initially, the weight loss was attained strictly by diet. Eventually, in an effort to avoid regaining the weight, Holliday had gastric bypass surgery. After the initial weight loss, she released an LP and video titled I’m On <b>Your</b> <b>Side.</b> The video, unlike most videos, was recorded live. In 1995, Holliday released the gospel album On & On. In a March 2008 interview, she revealed that she was in the studio working on a new album, to be released later that year.|$|E
25|$|Her fifth studio album, Wildflower, was {{released}} in September 2005. Although the album debuted at No.2 on the Billboard charts, it received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as her previous albums. In December 2005, the album {{was nominated for a}} Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy, while Crow was nominated for a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy for the first single Good Is Good. However, she ultimately lost in both categories to Kelly Clarkson. The album got a new boost in 2006 when the second single was announced as Always on <b>Your</b> <b>Side,</b> re-recorded with British musician Sting and sent off to radio, where it was quickly embraced at Adult Top40. The collaboration with Sting resulted in a Grammy-nomination for Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals. As of January 2008, Wildflower has sold 949,000 units in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the Impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on <b>your</b> <b>side.</b> But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, of course, he was Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard I chose to fight.|$|E

500|$|The Black Crowes {{began writing}} songs for the {{follow-up}} to their 1999 album By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> as free agents, having left Columbia Records through a loophole in their contract. [...] The {{decision to leave}} was driven by Columbia's promotion of By <b>Your</b> <b>Side.</b> According to band member Rich Robinson, [...] "That record was destined to fail because... just said, 'It's {{not going to do}} well... It's no use wasting time or money.'" [...] The band also was frustrated by the label's request for albums sounding similar to their first, 1990's Shake Your Money Maker.|$|E
500|$|The Black Crowes {{promoted}} By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> {{by performing}} on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. [...] The album debuted {{at its peak}} position of number26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews. [...] While some critics depreciated By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes' return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990). [...] Chris Robinson's singing and Rich's guitar playing also won praise from critics, though reviews of the lyrics were mixed.|$|E
500|$|By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes.

[...] Audley Freed and Sven Pipien were hired as the new guitarist and bassist, respectively, although Rich Robinson played all the guitar parts on the album. [...] By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> was recorded in New York City during {{the second quarter of}} 1998 and produced by Kevin Shirley.

500|$|The Black Crowes {{played a}} few {{shows in the}} eastern US in early January before the release of By <b>Your</b> <b>Side,</b> then {{spent the rest of}} the month {{promoting}} the album via television appearances in the US, Canada and Europe. [...] A brief warm-up show in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February10 preceded a two-month tour of North American theaters, called the Souled Out Tour, with Moke as the opening band. [...] Every song from By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> was played at some point on this tour – [...] "Go Faster", [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around", [...] "By Your Side" [...] and [...] "Virtue and Vice" [...] were performed at most shows, but [...] "Diamond Ring" [...] was played only twice. [...] A 1963 Fender Esquire guitar belonging to Rich was stolen from the backstage area at DeVos Performance Hall in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on February16. [...] The band's management waited six weeks before issuing a press release asking for its return, hoping the guitar would turn up in a local pawnshop. No update on the guitar was ever provided. [...] After taking two weeks off, the band spent six weeks playing outdoor amphitheaters in the US on a co-headlining tour with Lenny Kravitz; opening acts were Everlast and Cree Summer.|$|E

By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> debuted at its peak position of number26 on the Billboard 200 on January30. [...] The album has sold 271,000 copies in the US as of January 2002. [...] The next two weeks were filled with radio and television appearances in Canada, Belgium, France, Sweden, and Italy. The Black Crowes returned to the US to perform during pre-game festivities at Joe Robbie Stadium before Super Bowl XXXIII on January31. [...] While on tour {{in support of the}} album in February, the band performed the second single, [...] "Only a Fool", on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. The single was released in mid-February and peaked at number7 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The accompanying promotional video was directed by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic. [...] After an early April stop at an Atlanta radio station where the band played a half-hour acoustic set, The Black Crowes made a third late night television appearance {{at the end of that}} month, playing the album's third single, [...] "Go Faster", on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

500|$|By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> was {{generally}} well received by critics. [...] Regarding the songwriting, most reviewers praised The Black Crowes for {{returning to the}} straightforwardness of Shake Your Money Maker (1990) following the more adventuresome Amorica (1994) and Three Snakes and One Charm. [...] Gemma Tarlach of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel welcomed the album [...] "because it represents a great band's return to what it does best", calling it [...] "45 minutes of good, dirty fun". [...] Wall of Sound's Russell Hall found that the band's emergence from [...] "the jam-band haze that's infected" [...] their recent work resulted in a [...] "laser-sharp focus". [...] Mark Falkner of The Florida Times-Union said that beyond the band's mastery of their influences' musical styles, what prevents them [...] "from being just another tribute act {{is that they have}} (also) mastered the power, the passion and the fun that made the mix work". Some critics, also noting the change in approach, derided the band for returning to mine the same influences perceived in their debut album. [...] Jim Farber of the Daily News thus described By <b>Your</b> <b>Side</b> as [...] "a copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy" [...] and marked [...] "Go Faster" [...] a sped-up version of Humble Pie's [...] "Hot 'n' Nasty". [...] The Times Nigel Williamson called [...] "HorseHead" [...] "Zeppelinesque" [...] and labeled [...] "By Your Side" [...] "a kicking boogie half way between [...] 'Cindy Incidentally' and [...] 'Tumbling Dice'".

According to Alex Roginski of Sydney Morning Herald, the song is [...] "fleshed out with the string grandeur" [...] of Welsh producers Hybrid, and channels European electropop music. The main concept of [...] "Follow Me Home" [...] is romance, and the song's lyrical content is about protecting your loved one.
