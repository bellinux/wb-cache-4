500|$|On {{the night}} of December 12–13, 1994, McGovern's {{daughter}} Teresa fell into a snowbank in Madison, Wisconsin, while heavily intoxicated and died of hypothermia. Heavy press attention followed, and McGovern revealed his daughter had battled her alcoholism for years and had {{been in and out}} of many treatment programs while having had one extended period of sobriety. He authored an account of her life, Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle with Alcoholism; published in 1996, it presented a harrowing, unsparing view of the depths to which she had descended, the torment that he and the rest of his family had experienced in trying unsuccessfully to help her, and his ongoing thoughts and guilt about whether the demands of his political career and the time he had spent away from the family had made things worse for her. The book was a modest best-seller, and with the proceeds, he founded the Teresa McGovern Center in Madison to help others suffering from the combination of alcoholism and mental health problems. He would later say that Terry's death was by far the most painful event in his life: [...] "You never get over it, I'm sure of that. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> you can live with it, that's all." ...|$|E

However, there was one person he could not get along well with – Cheng Pu. Cheng Pu was much older than Zhou Yu, and he often insulted and belittled the latter, but Zhou tolerated him. Cheng Pu was so impressed with Zhou Yu that he eventually changed his attitude towards Zhou and treated him respectfully. He even remarked, [...] "Befriending Zhou Yu is like appreciating fine wine. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> absorbed and intoxicated without even realising it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hippies {{embraced the}} old slogan of free {{love of the}} radical social reformers of other eras; it was {{accordingly}} observed that [...] "Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more <b>you</b> <b>get!</b> <b>So</b> why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth {{was one of the}} great hippie revelations." [...] Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characters}} of VII received near-unanimous praise from critics for their original appearance.

Simon Parkin of Eurogamer praised the characters' [...] "clear motivations, desires and flaws".
