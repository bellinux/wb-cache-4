500|$|It was screenwriter Joss Whedon's idea to {{incorporate}} Barbie {{as a character}} who would rescue Woody and Buzz in the film's final act. The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy. Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow {{the use of the}} toy as [...] "They [...] philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll. If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> doll a voice and animate it, you're creating a persona for it that might not be every little girl's dream and desire." [...] Hasbro likewise refused to license [...] (mainly because Sid was going to blow one up), but they did license Mr. Potato Head. The only toy in the movie that was not in production was Slinky Dog, which was discontinued since the 1970s. When designs for Slinky were sent to Betty James (Richard James's wife) she said that Pixar had improved the toy and that it was [...] "cuter" [...] than the original.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 NHL General Managers' Meeting, it was {{discussed}} whether the rule should be eliminated {{as a solution}} to the increasing number of injuries on defenseman who were being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful." [...] He also expressed his concern for defencemen, [...] "It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time... You've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt." [...] At the time of his statement, Devils defencemen Paul Martin, Johnny Oduya and Bryce Salvador were all out with injuries.|$|E
500|$|The DSi helped {{maintain}} strong {{sales for}} Nintendo's handheld product line. The DSi accounted for 40 {{percent of its}} product line's 2009 UK sales and frequently topped weekly sales charts in Japan during its first year of availability. In the United States, the console's initial three-month sales surpassed those of the DS, DS Lite, and Wii. Average weekly sales of the Wii and Nintendo DS declined slightly in March; Nintendo DS hardware sales stabilized at over 200,000 units for seven months after the DSi's April launch, while Wii sales diminished. Gamasutra estimated that, in October 2009 and February 2010, 50 percent of Nintendo DS unit sales were DSi consoles. In an October 2009 interview, Fils-Aimé announced that the DSi had sold 2.2 million units in the United States. He said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> consumer great value {{in terms of what}} they pay, they're willing to spend, and we say [...] based on the experience of launching the DSi". The United States had its highest yearly DS sales in 2009 with 11.22 million units sold. The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 16.88 million of the 27.11 million units sold worldwide of its product line for Nintendo's 2009 fiscal year beginning April 1, 2009 and ending March 31, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Gregory {{began by}} aggressively {{requiring}} his churchmen {{to seek out}} and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not. In {{a letter to a}} subordinate in Sicily he wrote: [...] "I asked you most of all {{to take care of the}} poor. And if you knew of people in poverty, you should have pointed them out ... I desire that <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> woman, Pateria, forty solidi for the children's shoes and forty bushels of grain ...." [...] Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind. He understood that expenses must be matched by income. To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici. The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent {{evolutionary}} biologists such as Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne {{have proposed}} various [...] "controversies" [...] {{that are worth}} teaching, instead of intelligent design. Dawkins compares teaching intelligent design in schools to teaching flat earthism: perfectly fine in a history class but not in science. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> idea {{that there are two}} schools of thought within science, one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat, you are misleading children." [...] Tufts University Professor of Philosophy Daniel C. Dennett, author of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, describes how they generate a sense of controversy: [...] "The proponents of intelligent design use an ingenious ploy that works something like this: First you misuse or misdescribe some scientist's work. Then you get an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a 'controversy' to teach." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
