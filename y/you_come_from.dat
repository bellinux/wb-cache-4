A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that [...] "it doesn't matter where <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>from,</b> only who you are inside". In Dawn, the importance of cooperation is explored. The four Clans, normally hostile to each other, are forced to work together in order to find a new home. Other themes that have been pointed out deal with family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 study titled An Empirical Analysis of [...] "Acting White" [...] by Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University and Paul Torelli {{suggested}} that the phenomenon probably had little to no effect on students achieving at average levels, but might explain {{a significant role in}} the disparities between black and white students at high achievement levels. Fryer has also written that, in contrast to Fordham and Ogbu's theory, [...] "acting white" [...] prejudices are actually more common the more integrated the school, with historically black schools free of any effects. He found that groups such as Italian immigrants in Boston’s West End and the Maori of New Zealand display similar behaviors. He concluded that there is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.|$|E

She claims it is about how [...] "whoever you are or where you live – you can self-proclaim this inner fame based on your {{personal}} style, and your opinions about art and the world, despite being conscious of it", and also about her experiences as a struggling artist working in the Lower East Side. The line [...] "Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah", according to Gaga, was inspired by [...] "rich kids" [...] in the area who she would hear calling their parents for money to buy drugs with. She added that [...] "ultimately what I want people to take from it is 'Bang-bang.' No matter who you are and where <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>from,</b> you can feel beautiful and dirty rich." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevenson was {{appointed}} a High Court judge on 1 October 1957, and (as is traditional) was knighted {{a few days}} later. From 1958 until 1960 {{he was a member}} of an Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Artificial Insemination. For the first four years of his judicial career Stevenson was assigned to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, after which he was transferred to the Queen's Bench Division, where he presided over criminal cases. He then began to attract press attention. Known for his outspokenness, Stevenson described one case as a [...] "pretty anaemic kind of rape", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence. To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked [...] "I see <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Slough. It is a terrible place. You can go back there." [...] In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in Manchester was [...] "a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make".|$|E
500|$|On February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Frémont Pass (now Donner Pass); as {{they neared}} where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. Mrs. Murphy {{appeared}} from {{a hole in the}} snow, stared at them and asked, [...] "Are you men from California, or do <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> heaven?" [...] The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated immigrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the emigrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing [...] "such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description." [...] George Donner's arm was so gangrenous that he could not move. Twenty-three people were chosen to go with the rescue party, leaving twenty-one in the cabins at Truckee Lake and twelve at Alder Creek.|$|E

500|$|... "Stranger in Moscow" [...] is an R ballad, penned by Jackson in 1993 {{during his}} Dangerous World Tour stop in Moscow. The {{instrumental}} {{portion of the}} song {{is based on the}} end credits theme of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), a video game which Jackson and his tour keyboardist Brad Buxer were brought in to compose music for. Conflicting accounts state that Jackson either dropped out of the project after scandals involving him arose around this time or because of his own personal dissatisfaction with the limitations of the Sega Genesis's sound chip. The lyrics for the song are based upon a poem written by Jackson. A background guitar was played by Steve Lukather while keyboards, synthesizers and bass are credited to David Paich and Steve Porcaro. Originally, HIStory was planned as a greatest hits release, with a few new tracks. However, Jackson and his collaborators were so pleased with the result of [...] "Stranger in Moscow" [...] that they decided to give HIStory a full studio album as the second disc. Jackson used elements of Russian imagery and symbolism to help promote the concept of fear and alienation in the track, in a similar fashion to Simply Red's album Love and the Russian Winter several years later. It concludes with a narrative, spoken in Russian, by a KGB interrogator (Ed Wiesnieski). The narrative, translated into English is, [...] "Why have <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the west? Confess! To steal the great achievements of the people, the accomplishments of the workers...".|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But I always thought I was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has also}} been an issue with {{minority}} populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of [...] "Acting White." [...] It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one {{is trying to be}} a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots.

Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, [...] "There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders."
