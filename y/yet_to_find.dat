5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E

Her father {{suspects that}} they have incurred {{the wrath of the}} gods, and consults the oracle of Apollo. The response is unsettling: the king is to expect no human son-in-law, but rather a dragon-like creature who harasses the world with fire and iron and is feared by even Jupiter and the inhabitants of the underworld.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being used}} in several publications, such as the grammar of Romani {{compiled}} by Gheorghe Sarău and the Polish publication Informaciaqo lil, the IRU standard has <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a broad base of support from Romani writers. One reason for the reluctance to adopt this standard, according to Canadian Rom Ronald Lee, is that the proposed orthography contains a number of specialised characters not regularly found on European keyboards, such as θ and ʒ.|$|E
25|$|His highest score, coincidentally, was 30 in both {{forms of}} the game. By {{the end of his}} career, he had such a {{reputation}} for poor batting that the crowd would cheer every ball he faced.

25|$|Like other finches, the Gouldian finch is a seed eater. During the {{breeding}} season, Gouldian finches feed mostly on ripe or half-ripe grass seeds of sorghum. During the dry season, they forage {{on the ground}} for fallen seed. During the wet season, spinifex grass seed (Triodia sp.) is an important component of their diet. So far Gouldians have been recorded as consuming six different species of grass seed, but during crop analysis, researchers have <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> evidence of insect consumption.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 the {{director}} of the Opéra, Émile Perrin, {{wrote in a letter to}} a minister of state that Thomas had nearly finished writing the music. Later the press conjectured as to the reason for the delay of the opera, suggesting that Thomas had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> his ideal Ophélie. Thomas' opera Mignon (1866), an adaptation of Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre, had been the composer's very effective response to Gounod's earlier Goethe adaption, the opera Faust, which had premiered in 1859. Mignon had been performed at the Opéra-Comique, and Thomas was under pressure to provide a similar success at the Opéra, in particular as several of his earlier productions there had done poorly.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of their {{previous}} band, At the Drive-In, drummer Tony Hajjar and bassist Paul Hinojos got together and talked about forming a new band. Hinojos contacted former At the Drive-In guitarist and back-up vocalist Jim Ward to take the role of lead vocalist. After a brief stint with Erick Sanger, the three recruited Matt Miller, a native to El Paso and then bassist of the band Belknap to permanently fill the position of bassist, with Hinojos switching to guitar. The band then scored a deal with Dreamworks in 2001. The band released their first EP entitled Austere in early 2002 under the name Sparta. The EP met with mixed reviews, with most believing that the group had talent and the ability, but had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their voice.|$|E

Still, with 11 years of success behind her and still just 22-years-old, she has plenty of time to discover a song that's as good as her voice is. If that ever happens, volume two of this collection could be even better".|$|R

25|$|The European Union {{has imposed}} {{restrictions}} on cooperation with Iran in foreign trade, financial services, energy sectors and technologies, and banned {{the provision of}} insurance and reinsurance by insurers in member states to Iran and Iranian-owned companies. On 23 January 2012, the EU agreed to an oil embargo on Iran, effective from July, and to freeze the assets of Iran's central bank. The next month, Iran symbolically pre-empted the embargo by ceasing sales to Britain and France (both countries had already almost eliminated their reliance on Iranian oil, and Europe as a whole had nearly halved its Iranian imports), though some Iranian politicians called for an immediate sales halt to all EU states, so as to hurt countries like Greece, Spain and Italy who were <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> alternative sources.|$|E
25|$|Grüner Veltliner {{has been}} {{believed}} to {{date back to}} Roman times, with its name being derived from Veltlin (Valtellina) in northern Italy, though ampelographers and wine historians have <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a link between the}} grape and the Italian commune. The grape is likely indigenous to Austria. The current name appeared in a document {{for the first time in}} 1855; before that time it was known as Weißgipfler. Only by the 1930s was Grüner Veltliner established as the standard name of the grape. Until the Second World War it was regarded as just another Austrian grape. It took Lenz Moser's Hochkultur system of vine training to really get the best out of it, and it expanded quickly in plantation from the 1950s to later become Austria's most planted variety.|$|E
25|$|We felt keenly {{that while}} the miraculous events of the {{founding}} of the State of Israel had found fitting expression {in the other Conservative siddurim} the more difficult experience of the Holocaust had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an appropriate place in our prayers, Therefore, we composed a Nahum prayer for Yom Ha-shoah, inspired by that which appeared in Siddur Va-ani Tefillati of the Masorti Movement in 1998. In an insert into the Amidah, similar to that used traditionally on Tisha B'Av, we seek God's comfort in light of our people's losses in Europe during the Holocaust. We felt the need, beyond that, to acknowledge on a daily basis the enormous effect that the Holocaust has had upon our people. At the end of Tahanun papers, in a prayer which reflects our suffering, we added reference to the anguish we still feel.|$|E

25|$|There {{are about}} 4,000 Karaites {{living in the}} United States. The Congregation B'nai Israel is located in Daly City, California, which is a suburb of San Francisco.

One notable congregant, Mark Kheder, the Synagogue's treasurer, has described his internment in an Egyptian prisoner of war camp during the 1967 Six Day war. The congregation's acting Rav (Ḥakham), Joe Pessah, was also among those who were arrested by the Egyptian government. Another, much smaller congregation, Karaite Jewish Congregation Oraḥ Ṣaddiqim, exists in Albany, NY, but they have <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a permanent dedicated facility and, in the mean time, continue to use {{a room in the}} home of their Ḥakham, Avraham Ben-Raḥamiël Qanaï, as their temporary synagogue.|$|E

500|$|Little {{is known}} of Native American {{activity}} in the area prior to 1600, though the presence of hunting bolas indicates that the area may {{have served as a}} hunting ground as far back as 5,000 years ago. Native American communities were already in existence in the swamp when the maroons began to settle there. Because leaving the area could inevitably lead to recapture, the inhabitants often used what was readily available in the swamp, even recycling tool remnants left by Native Americans. [...] Since the maroons had few possessions, the few small artifacts that have been recovered have given historians little insight into their day-to-day lives. To date, excavation has <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any human remains. According to Sayers, historical archaeologist at American University who has led research on the maroons of the swamp, {{it is possible that the}} acidity of the water disintegrated any bones which may have been left behind.|$|E
500|$|Lindsey Fraser, who had {{supplied}} {{one of the}} blurb comments, wrote what {{is thought}} to be the first published review, in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997. She described Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as [...] "a hugely entertaining thriller" [...] and Rowling as [...] "a first-rate writer for children". Another early review, in The Herald, said, [...] "I have <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a child who can put it down." [...] Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in The Guardian, The Sunday Times and The Mail on Sunday, and in September 1997 Books for Keeps, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five. The Mail on Sunday rated it as [...] "the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl"; a view echoed by the Sunday Times ("comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified"), while The Guardian called it [...] "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit" [...] and The Scotsman said it had [...] "all the makings of a classic".|$|E

[...] Martin too praised the {{performance}} of [...] "Somebody to Love", writing: [...] "Love or hate Queen, when New Directions sings it, it's magical. And it's {{the first time since}} 'Don't Stop Believin' that I got goosebumps. Something about kids singing songs, raising all those arms, makes everyone—can't just be me!—giddy and hopeful. They're not as technically skilled as [...] Vocal Adrenaline—yet—but that only makes their underdog story more real." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly also called [...] "The Rhodes Not Taken" [...] the best episode of Glee so far, deeming all the musical numbers [...] "fantastic". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 8.5/10. He felt that Chenoweth was [...] "terrific" [...] as April, and that the character was a [...] "hysterical creation". Goldman assessed that the episode [...] "soared" [...] musically, though felt that its resolution was [...] "rushed" [...] and [...] "forced", suggesting that the series has <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the right balance between music, comedy and drama.|$|E
