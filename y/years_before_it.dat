5|$|Kripke was {{developing}} the concept for ten <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> was greenlit {{as a television}} series. Before it could be filmed, the script underwent numerous revisions. The episode was produced in Los Angeles, though future episodes were filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, to save money. The episode established the series' tradition of a rock-music soundtrack, and included background music scored by Kripke's friend Christopher Lennertz. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising the horror elements but having varying opinions of the lead actors' performances.|$|E

Hamilton was {{one of the men who}} restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality.|$|E
5|$|In November 1982, three <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> {{became a}} round of the F1 World Championship, Prost, along with fellow F1 drivers Jacques Laffite and Nelson Piquet, made the trip to Melbourne, Australia to drive in the non-championship 1982 Australian Grand Prix at the short (1.609km (1.000mi)) Calder Park Raceway. Driving a Formula Pacific spec Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6 litre Ford engine, Prost sat on pole for the race {{with a time of}} 39.18.

Having experienced excellent health for most of his life, Matthews died of pneumonia at the age of 111 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

5|$|The Book of the Dead first {{developed}} in Thebes toward {{the beginning of}} the Second Intermediate Period, around 1700 BCE. The earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the Book of the Dead is from the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, of the 13th dynasty, where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. Some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric to spell 30B states that it was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure, many hundreds of <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> is attested in the archaeological record.|$|E

5|$|The Hickmans {{began work}} on Ravenloft in the late 1970s, intent on {{creating}} a frightening portrait of a vampire in a setting that combined Gothic horror with the D game system. They play-tested the adventure {{with a group of}} players each Halloween for five <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> was published. Strahd has since appeared in a number of D accessories and novels. The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations, including a campaign setting of the same name and a sequel. In 1999, on the 25th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons, two commemorative versions of Ravenloft were released.|$|E
5|$|The NavyJohns Hopkins rivalry was an American intercollegiate {{football}} {{rivalry between}} the Navy Midshipmen football {{team of the}} United States Naval Academy and the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays football team of Johns Hopkins University. The two institutions, located within the span of a few miles {{in the state of}} Maryland, first met for a football game in 1882. Following the initial contest, both teams played each other annually for eight <b>years,</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> was called off for unknown reasons. The teams competed again in 1911 and 1912, again disbanding the contest until a final match took place in 1919.|$|E

With fresh credibility, even with young fans {{who had been}} introduced to him through the Anthology project, it debuted at number 2 in the UK in May, giving McCartney his best new entry since Flowers in the Dirt eight <b>years</b> <b>before.</b> <b>It</b> was kept off the top spot by the Spice Girls' album Spice. Flaming Pie was also received positively in the United States, where it became McCartney's first top 10 album since Tug of War. Flaming Pie debuted at number 2, with 121,000 copies sold in its first week, behind Spice, which sold just 16,500 more copies that week.|$|E

5|$|Vs. debuted {{at the top}} of the Billboard 200 album {{chart and}} stayed there for five weeks. Vs. sold 950,378copies in its first five days of release, which set a record for the most copies of an album sold in its first week of release and {{outperformed}} all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. Vs. held this record for five <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> was broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. While Double Live officially beat Vs. in first week sales, Vs. still holds an unbreakable record in that SoundScan only counted the first five days of an album's release in its first week sales until 1998. Vs. has been certified seven times platinum by the RIAA, and, as of July 2013, has sold 6,010,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|Harclay's {{head was}} on display in London for five <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> was taken down. His sister {{petition}}ed the king to return the {{various parts of the}} body for a Christian burial, and in 1328 her request was granted. Further clemencies were not awarded. In the reign of Edward III, Harclay's nephew Henry petitioned to have the charge of treason annulled, but the petition was ignored. As for the peace treaty, the wisdom of Harclay's policy was vindicated after his death. Edward II's inability to win the war against the Scots, combined with his refusal to give up his claim on the Scottish crown, proved untenable in the end. Furthermore, it was Harclay's military skills and well-organised forces that gave what little protection the northern borders had over the previous years. Less than three months after Harclay's execution, Edward agreed on a thirteen-year truce with Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis {{married in}} 1977. Soon after, {{while living in}} Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. When they began work on Ravenloft, they felt the vampire {{archetype}} had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it {{with a group of}} players every Halloween for five <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the horror genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time. At the time of Ravenlofts release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. Ravenloft was labeled I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.|$|E
