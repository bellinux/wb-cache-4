[...] VanDerWerff also wrote in his review, [...] ""Blood of My Blood" [...] is another exciting hour of television, even if it's a bit more piece move-y than, say, [...] "The Door". The revelations are milder, the characters mostly talk about what they're going to do next, and the stories go from Point A to Point B, instead of Point X, Y, or Z. But there's still plenty going on that's worth checking out." [...] Comparing the episode to [...] "Book of the Stranger", Jeremy Egner of The New York Times said, [...] "The problem with emerging naked from a flaming temple is that it's hard to top. It's hard to top, that is, unless <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a dragon with a flair for dramatic timing." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only <b>you</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
