5|$|The Styan's {{red panda}} is {{supposedly}} larger and darker in color than the Western {{member of the}} species, but with considerable variation in both subspecies, and some individuals may be brown or <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> rather than red.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pisciodorus {{is similar}} in form to Tylopilus tabacinus. Unlike, T.tabacinus however, B.pisciodorus has spores that are hyaline in mass, and dark <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> rather than hyaline when viewed with a light microscope. Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is {{apparent}} in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E
50|$|Ophraella communa {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 3.4 - 4.1 mm in males, of 3.9 - 4.3 mm in females. The head is <b>yellowish,</b> with dark <b>brown</b> spots at the back. Body is {{coarsely}} punctured. Antennae are dark <b>brown.</b> Pronotum is <b>yellowish</b> or pale <b>brown,</b> with three black or dark brown spots. Elytra are <b>yellowish</b> or pale <b>brown</b> and show dark brown longitudinal stripes.|$|R
50|$|The bold-striped tit-babbler has a {{distinctive}} yellowish supercilium and rufous crown. The throat is <b>yellowish</b> with <b>brown</b> streaks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shell is}} smooth. It is plicately ribbed with the ribs rather distant. Its color is light <b>yellowish</b> and <b>brown</b> banded.|$|R
5|$|Spore {{prints are}} purplish brown to {{chocolate}} brown. The smooth, thick-walled spores are broadly ellipsoidal, and typically measure 5.8–7.3 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, hyaline (translucent, and measure 20–21.3 by 5.8–7.0μm. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are sac-shaped to club-shaped, hyaline to pale <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> in color, and have dimensions of 18.3–25.6 by 7.3–11.0μm; {{there are no}} cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia).|$|E
5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> {{in color and}} have a dark spot located {{in the center of}} their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large number of plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E
50|$|Dorsally <b>yellowish</b> with <b>brown</b> spots. Some spots {{arranged}} in alternating confluent pairs, others forming crossbands. Upper lip, sides of body, and ventrum unspotted.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18-21 mm. The forewings are <b>yellowish</b> tan <b>brown</b> and the hindwings are dirty white, darkening somewhat towards the terminal area.|$|R
50|$|The spore dust is rusty-brown. The spores are egg-shaped, obliquely pointed, <b>yellowish</b> rusty <b>brown,</b> {{with fine}} warts and dots on the surface, and measure 8-9 by 4.5-5 μm.|$|R
5|$|Formerly {{a member}} of Hygrophoropsis, Aphroditeola olida is also similar in {{appearance}} to H.aurantiaca but can be distinguished from the false chanterelle by its smaller, pinkish fruit bodies and candy-like odour. It also has smaller spores. Chrysomphalina chrysophylla has a <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> cap and unforked yellow gills. Cortinarius hesleri, an eastern North American species that associates with oaks, has a rusty brown spore print and a cortina in young specimens. The poisonous jack-o'-lantern mushrooms (genus Omphalotus) comprise another group of lookalikes; however, they have straight, non-forked true gills. The European wood-rotting species Haasiella splendidissima, sometimes confused with H.aurantiaca, is most readily distinguished from the latter by its pink spore print and gills that do not fork.|$|E
5|$|The fur, {{which is}} soft, dense, and thick, is dark brown to gray on the upperparts, grading to black on the midback and <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> on the sides. The underparts are sharply {{different}} in color. There, the hairs are dark gray at their bases and white at the tips, {{so that the}} fur appears grayish white. The fur is shorter and darker than in T.talamancae and softer and thicker than in H.alfaroi. Young animals have darker, finer, and softer fur. Pine separated the subspecies alleni and orinus {{on the basis of}} their darker fur, but Musser and colleagues could not confirm this pattern and found paler and darker specimens within the same geographical regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{intermediate}} in size for the Akodon boliviensis species group; it {{is smaller than}} A.polopi and A.sylvanus, but larger than A.boliviensis and A.caenosus. The more distantly related A.budini and A.simulator, which occur in the same area, are larger. Akodon spegazzinii is variable in coloration, ranging from light to dark and from reddish to <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown.</b> In general, animals in wetter, lower-lying areas are darker, and those in open, dry environments are paler. There is also variation within populations, and sometimes young mice are darker and lactating females are more reddish. The formerly recognized species Akodon tucumanensis corresponds to the dark, low-altitude populations, while A.leucolimnaeus and A.alterus represent more reddish, high-altitude animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} a {{distinctive}} yellowish supercilium and rufous crown. The throat is <b>yellowish</b> with <b>brown</b> streaks. Call is a loud repeated chonk-chonk-chonk-chonk-chonk somewhat {{reminiscent of a}} common tailorbird.|$|R
50|$|Dorsally <b>yellowish</b> or grayish <b>brown,</b> uniform or {{with dark}} brown spots; dark streak {{on each side}} of head, passing through eye; upper lip <b>yellowish,</b> usually with <b>brown</b> dots; posteriorly four series of brown spots, {{confluent}} into stripes on tail. Ventrally yellowish, usually powdered or dotted with brown; a brown spot at each outer end of anterior ventrals.|$|R
50|$|The head, thorax and abdomen {{are dark}} <b>yellowish</b> and reddish <b>brown.</b> The wings are <b>yellowish</b> and reddish <b>brown.</b> The hindwings are more uniform reddish brown. On the underside, there are dark {{striations}} {{and both the}} forewing and hindwing have three grey spots in the discal cell. There are four pale rufous bands along the medial, postmedial, submarginal region.|$|R
5|$|The spores are spherical, and 3.5–4.5µm in diameter. They {{are covered}} with short narrow {{abruptly}} terminating projections of a translucent (hyaline) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in potassium hydroxide, and a dark dull brown (nearly sepia) when stained with iodine. The capillitium is made of {{what appears to be}} encrusted cylindrical filaments 3–6µm in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> in potassium hydroxide, and yellowish in iodine; its walls are thickened {{to the point where the}} interior (lumen) appears as only a line. Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that attach the spores) are long, up to 20µm. Geastrum triplex does not have cystidia.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are fairly}} large and rounded. The {{origin of the}} first dorsal fin lies over {{the last third of}} the pelvic fin bases, while the origin of the much larger second dorsal fin lies over the rear of the anal fin. The claspers of adult males are moderately long and tapering, though those of some individuals may be knob-shaped and spiky. The anal fin is roughly equal in size to the pelvic fins, and smaller but longer-based than the second dorsal fin. The short caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is thick; the dermal denticles have three-pointed crowns and are widely spaced compared to other species in the genus. Coloured <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> above and cream below, this shark has a characteristic series of ten dorsal saddles from the head to the tail; each saddle is dark brown with a darker edge and a lighter middle. Unlike in the similar lined catshark, there are no spots or additional markings between the saddles.|$|E
25|$|Juveniles are <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> {{with dark}} lateral bands.|$|E
50|$|Beneath hyaline; {{primaries}} broadly {{suffused with}} dark ochreous at apex and outer margin; costal margin of both wings <b>yellowish,</b> a <b>brown</b> mark just beyond cell, and an incomplete submarginal row of spots of same colour.|$|R
50|$|The whey can be {{concentrated}} and then moulded. Cheeses produced with this method possess {{a relatively high}} lactose content. Typically they have a <b>yellowish</b> to <b>brown</b> color and possess a sweet, cooked, or caramelized flavor.|$|R
50|$|Glue: The resin {{collected}} {{from the base of}} the plant, <b>yellowish</b> to <b>brown,</b> can be heated and used as a glue. The O'odham and Seri use it for hafting, to hold points on arrows and harpoons.|$|R
25|$|The {{perianth}} is persistent in fruit. The fruit wall (pericarp) is membranous. The vertical seed is ellipsoid, with <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown,</b> membranous, hairy seed coat. The seed {{contains no}} perisperm (feeding tissue).|$|E
25|$|Soils in Columbia {{are well}} drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil. The subsoil may be {{yellowish}} red {{sandy clay loam}} (Orangeburg series), <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> sandy clay loam (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All belong to the Ultisol soil order.|$|E
25|$|This moss {{grows in}} a low turf, {{yellowish}} green from above but <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> below. It has unbranching stems about six millimetres in length, with a reddish-brown mat of hairs on their lower half. These support numerous narrow spathulate leaves from 2.0 to 3.1 millimetres long. Nothing is known of its sexual structures and sporophytes.|$|E
5000|$|The white, opaque, outer coat of {{the shell}} is very much {{inclined}} to separate from the inner or central coat, which presents, where the outer coat is removed, a smooth surface of <b>yellowish</b> or <b>brown</b> colour.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-13.5 mm. Adults are <b>yellowish</b> and <b>brown,</b> but vary in {{the intensity}} of colouration. The forewings have a straw-yellowish ground colour with light, fawn-coloured brown scales. The hindwings are very light, almost translucent yellowish.|$|R
50|$|Xanthophyllum heterophyllum {{grows up}} to 30 m tall with a trunk {{diameter}} {{of up to}} 50 cm. The smooth bark is greyish or <b>yellowish.</b> The <b>brown</b> fruits are round and measure up to 1.5 cm in diameter.|$|R
25|$|The head, {{neck and}} upper breast {{of an adult}} female are olive-brown. Just like the male, a narrow white band crosses the mid breast, {{underneath}} which the lower breast to abdomen is light red to pink. The mantle and back appear orange to brown in colour. The wings are vermiculated dark brown and <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown.</b> The tail feathers {{are very similar to}} those of the males. The bill, gape and bare eyering are pale blue on females.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{range from}} 3–7mm {{in length and}} have a light tan thorax, legs and {{slightly}} darker head with black mandibles. The gaster is brownish-gray. Queens are roughly 9mm in length. The head and mandibles are a reddish brown. The thorax is <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown,</b> and the gaster is a lighter shade of yellow. The legs are a dull yellow. Males are typically about 6mm long and have a small black head and black thorax, except a reddish-brown pronotum. The gaster is a dark brown, and the legs are gray. Males are winged.|$|E
25|$|Clocks, watches, and {{instruments}} {{dating from the}} first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint. They are usually no longer luminous; however, this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600 years) but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium. The appearance of an often thick layer of green or <b>yellowish</b> <b>brown</b> paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard. The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk; but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested.|$|E
5000|$|The cap grows {{from about}} 2 cm to 6 cm, and is <b>yellowish</b> or reddish <b>brown.</b>|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Puccinellia maritima, Artemisia and Atriplex species. The case is sparsely {{covered with}} grass. The {{length of the}} case is 8-12 mm. The larvae itself is <b>yellowish</b> with <b>brown</b> shields on the thorax. The head is black.|$|R
