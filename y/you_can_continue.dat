40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is, on one hand, to obtain an {{understanding}} of how children in municipal music- and culture schools choose instruments and what forms of recruitment methods they are subjected to, and on the other hand, how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make them <b>continue</b> to play once they have begun.

The result of the study shows some apparent tendencies. Even though some of the instruments have trouble recruiting students and other instruments have trouble keeping them, the old methods, which obviously do not work in a satisfactory manner, are still being used. Instead, increased commitment at the occasion of recruitment, more group teaching which strengthens the social bonds through role models and a will to have the courage to change the organization when it does not work, is required...|$|R
40|$|Private Vices, Public Virtues, Miklos Jancso’s latest film, {{is such a}} {{feast for}} the senses - vibrant music, rich coloring, warm, frank sensuality - that it comes as {{something}} of a shock to realise how tame and even tedious the whole exercise is. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> manufacture a <b>continuing</b> low level of interest in it, of course, by spotting the Jancso trademarks - dialogue so sparse that it tempts you to dismiss the story line outright, visuals so lovingly dwelled upon that you break your brains trying to squeeze as much significance out of the scene as the director obviously does, ritual stripping, the humiliation motif, etc. But such high art gamesmanship soon palls, and you are left with a somewhat dense, but basically centre-less film featuring small doses oi inchoate politics and large doses of curiously sexless sex...|$|R
