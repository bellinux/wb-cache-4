I knew that what I said in admiration might be an opinion too often forced upon you to give any pleasure, but I certainly did think that the kindness of your nature might prevent you judging an uncontrolled tongue harshly--which you have done--and thinking badly of me and wounding me this morning, when I am working hard to save your hay." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jordan {{knew what}} she meant, though he could not grasp her purpose in {{pressing}} the point. [...] "It wouldn't be business if I did. When a man starts out to make money he can't afford to load himself up with purely personal grievances. If another man tries to get the things you want you naturally have to fight, but it's wiser to grin and bear it when he's too smart for <b>you.</b> <b>Still,</b> <b>there</b> are cases when {{the feeling that you}} would like to get even afterward is apt to be 'most too much for human nature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must be mad, Derek, {{to dream}} of handicapping {{yourself}} at this vital stage of your career with a wife who not only {{will not be a}} help to you, but must actually be a ruinous handicap. I am not blaming you for imagining yourself in love in the first place, though I really should have thought that a man of your strength and character would.... However, as I say, I am not blaming you for that. Superficially, no doubt, this girl might be called attractive. I do not admire the type myself, but I suppose she has that quality--in my time we should have called it boldness--which seems to appeal to the young men of to-day. I could imagine her fascinating a weak-minded imbecile like your friend Mr. Rooke. But that <b>you....</b> <b>Still,</b> <b>there</b> is no need to go into that. What I am trying to point out is that in your position, with a career like yours in front of you--it's quite certain that {{in a year or two}} you will be offered some really big and responsible position--you would be insane to tie yourself to a girl who seems to have been allowed to run perfectly wild, whose uncle is a swindler...." ...|$|E

You will stay right here until Geoffrey has fixed up all plans for your journey, and you can trust me to be kind to <b>you.</b> <b>Still,</b> <b>there's</b> one favor I'm going to ask.

6000|$|... "But our {{relations}} being those of real life--far sweeter, after all--I {{never dreamed of}} marrying you, having gained and enjoyed your friendship without that eye to business which our nineteenth century keeps open even whilst it sleeps. You, being equally disinterested in your regard for me, do not think of breaking your heart, but you are, I suppose, a little hurt at my apparently meditating and resolving on such a serious step as marriage with Agatha without confiding my intention to you. And you punish me by {{telling me that you}} {{have nothing to do with}} it--that it is nothing to you. But I never meditated the step, and so had nothing to conceal from you. It was conceived and executed in less than a minute. Although my first marriage was a silly love match and a failure, I have always admitted to myself that I should marry again. A bachelor is a man who shirks responsibilities and duties; I seek them, and consider it my duty, with my monstrous superfluity of means, not to let the individualists outbreed me. Still, I was in no hurry, having other things to occupy me, and being fond of my bachelor freedom, and doubtful sometimes whether I had any right to bring more idlers into the world for the workers to feed. Then came the usual difficulty about the lady. I did not want a helpmeet; I can help myself. Nor did I expect to be loved devotedly, for the race has not yet evolved a man lovable on thorough acquaintance; even my self-love is neither thorough nor constant. I wanted a genial partner for domestic business, and Agatha struck me quite suddenly as being the nearest approach to what I desired that I was likely to find in the marriage market, where it is extremely hard to suit oneself, and where the likeliest bargains are apt to be snapped up by others if one hesitates too long in the hope of finding something better. I admire Agatha's courage and capability, and believe I shall be able to make her like me, and that the attachment so begun may turn into as close a union as is either healthy or necessary between two separate individuals. I may mistake her character, for I do not know her as I know you, and have scarcely enough faith in her as yet to tell her such things as I have told <b>you.</b> <b>Still,</b> <b>there</b> is a consoling dash of romance in the transaction. Agatha has charm. Do you not think so?" ...|$|E

40|$|A notable {{feature of}} {{language}} {{is the use}} of the same word to communicate different meanings. The first example that comes to mind in English is still.

5000|$|... "That song {{seems like}} it's really {{just kind of}} like asking a {{question}}. Its question {{is kind of a}} strange one. It's not just asking, “If I fall down, will you be there for me?” Because it's easy to be there for someone when they're down. But it's not always easy to be there for somebody when they're doing good. And that's the question it's asking. It's like, “If I go crazy, will <b>you</b> <b>still</b> call me Superman?” It's asking, “If I'm down, will <b>you</b> <b>still</b> be <b>there</b> for me?” But at the same time, “If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?” That's kind of asking, “If I'm doing good, will you be there for me? Will you not be jealous of me?” That's the basic question that song's asking, and maybe throughout the years of singing that song, I might have come up with more meanings for it than it actually might have originally had." ...|$|R

6000|$|According to this {{threefold}} division, {{it appears}} {{that there are certain}} features common to North and South Germany in which they differ from Central Germany, and the nature of this difference Riehl indicates by distinguishing the former as Centralized Land and the latter as Individualized Land; a distinction which is well symbolized by the fact that North and South Germany possess the great lines of railway which are the medium for the traffic of the world, while Middle Germany is far richer in lines for local communication, and possesses the greatest length of railway within the smallest space. Disregarding superficialities, the East Frieslanders, the Schleswig-Holsteiners, the Mecklenburghers, and the Pomeranians are much more nearly allied to the old Bavarians, the Tyrolese, and the Styrians than any of these are allied to the Saxons, the Thuringians, or the Rhinelanders. Both in North and South Germany original races are still found in large masses, and popular dialects are spoken; <b>you</b> <b>still</b> find <b>there</b> thoroughly peasant districts, thorough villages, and also, at great intervals, thorough cities; <b>you</b> <b>still</b> find <b>there</b> a sense of rank. In Middle Germany, on the contrary, the original races are fused together or sprinkled hither and thither; the peculiarities of the popular dialects are worn down or confused; there is no very strict line of demarkation between the country and the town population, hundreds of small towns and large villages being hardly distinguishable in their characteristics; and the sense of rank, as part of the organic structure of society, is almost extinguished. Again, both in the north and south <b>there</b> is <b>still</b> a strong ecclesiastical spirit in the people, and the Pomeranian sees Antichrist in the Pope as clearly as the Tyrolese sees him in Doctor Luther; while in Middle Germany the confessions are mingled, they exist peaceably side by side in very narrow space, and tolerance or indifference has spread itself widely even in the popular mind. And the analogy, or rather the causal relation between the physical geography of the three regions and the development of the population goes still further: ...|$|R
