[...] and she feels the biggest advantages are in sports where her prestigious height has afforded her advantages. She stated, “I feel I have a presence on the court. I hope I intimidate other people”. Another advantage Taylor possesses, as she has expressed, is because of her larger stature then other players she has what she describes [...] "a bird's eye view of everything" [...] on the court. Literally she can see over other players. Taylor's height has also {{made it difficult for}} other players to guard and block her and are generally unable to overpower her.|$|E
2500|$|When {{encrypting}} files with EFS – when converting plaintext {{files to}} encrypted files – the plaintext files are not wiped, but simply deleted(i.e. data blocks flagged as [...] "not in use" [...] in the filesystem). This means that, unless they for example {{happen to be}} stored on an SSD with TRIM support, they can be easily recovered unless they are overwritten. To fully mitigate known, non-challenging technical attacks against EFS, you should configure encryption at the folder level (so that all temporary files like Word document backups which are created in these directories are also encrypted). When you wish to encrypt individual files, copy them to an encrypted folder or encrypt the file [...] "in place", and then securely wipe the disk volume. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Windows Cipher utility (with the /W option) to wipe free space including that which still contains deleted plaintext files; various third-party utilities may work as well.|$|E

So <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same source material in different contexts. If you're {{in a different place}} at a different time and in a different frame of mind you can use stuff that originally didn't go anywhere, and make something of it. So yeah, we keep everything, but, man, it's a lot of music and ideas lying on the backups these days. I'm guessing 10 per cent of what we start ends up as something presentable. We feel like a lot of things are interesting for 30 seconds or so, but then what? We could probably sell riffs to rock bands, sell hundreds of riffs or piano themes or whatever, but our main problem is to tie elements together—to 'bring it home,' as they say. We are quite selective." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{has been}} a {{consistent}} and outspoken critic of the United States government, and criticism of the foreign policy of the United States has {{formed the basis of}} much of his political writing. Chomsky gives reasons for directing his activist efforts to the state of which he is a citizen. He believes that his work can have more impact when directed at his own government, and that he holds a responsibility {{as a member of a}} particular country of origin to work to stop that country from committing crimes. He expresses this idea often with a comparison of other countries holding that every country has flexibility to address crimes by unfavored countries, but is always unwilling to deal with their own. Speaking [...] in Nicaragua in 1986, Chomsky was asked [...] "We feel that through what you say and write you are our friend but at the same time you talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath. I ask you how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same arguments as reactionaries?" [...] to which Chomsky responded, ...|$|E
2500|$|Another type of PTC {{thermistor}} is {{the polymer}} PTC, which is sold under brand {{names such as}} [...] "Polyswitch" [...] "Semifuse", and [...] "Multifuse". [...] This consists of plastic with carbon grains embedded in it. [...] When the plastic is cool, the carbon grains are all in contact with each other, forming a conductive path through the device. [...] When the plastic heats up, it expands, forcing the carbon grains apart, and causing {{the resistance of the}} device to rise, which then causes increased heating and rapid resistance increase. [...] Like the BaTiO3 thermistor, this device has a highly nonlinear resistance/temperature response useful for thermal or circuit control, not for temperature measurement. [...] Besides circuit elements used to limit current, self-limiting heaters can be made in the form of wires or strips, useful for heat tracing. [...] PTC thermistors 'latch' into a hot / high resistance state: once hot, they stay in that high resistance state, until cooled. [...] In fact, Neil A Downie showed how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> effect as a simple latch/memory circuit, the effect being enhanced by using two PTC thermistors in series, with thermistor A cool, thermistor B hot, or vice versa.|$|E

2500|$|The final single, [...] "God's Hotel" [...] was co-written with Nick Cave. Kelly {{had read}} Cave's book of lyrics, King Ink (1988), and found [...] "God's Hotel". When {{interviewing}} Cave for {{a newspaper article}} in The Age, Kelly asked about the lyrics, Cave said [...] "It's just a blues ... <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> words if you want". Kelly only used five of twelve verses and adapted the tune from the chords of [...] "Bittersweet" [...] by Hoodoo Gurus. [...] "Everybody Wants to Touch Me" [...] describes how a pregnant woman becomes the object of curiosity, wonder or revulsion. Although some believe the song relates to a celebrity being the centre of attention (see Paul Kapsis' cover version). In 2000 Kelly's friend Deborah Conway recorded her version for The Women at the Well tribute album. Kelly noted [...] "I don't like all covers of my songs but I {{have to say this}} one's awesome. Absolutely". [...] "Lately" [...] was co-written with Geyer and followed their work on the soundtrack for the ABC-TV mini series The Seven Deadly Sins, Geyer and Kelly sang alongside Vika Bull and Conway for the 13 tracks. The cover art for Wanted Man is a colophon rendering of Australia's legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (no relation) as a guitarist and was painted by David Band.|$|E

6000|$|The {{wedding was}} private, {{but it was}} not quite a family affair.

The Aroostook had been delayed by repairs which were found necessary at Trieste, and Captain Jenness was able to come over and represent the ship at the wedding ceremony, and at the lunch which followed. He reserved till the moment of parting a supreme expression of good-will. When he had got a hand of Lydia's and one of Staniford's in each of his, with his wrists crossed, he said, [...] "Now, I ain't one to tack round, and stand off and on a great deal, but what I want to say is just this: the Aroostook sails next week, and if you two are a mind to go back in her, the ship's yours, as I said to Miss Blood, here,--I mean Mis' Staniford; well, I hain't had much time to get used to it!--when she first come aboard there at Boston.
