5000|$|Pyrus × bretschneideri (or Pyrus ×bretschneideri), the <b>ya</b> <b>pear</b> or pearple or Chinese white pear (...) , is an {{interspecific}} hybrid species of pear native to North China, {{where it is}} widely grown for its edible fruit.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fruits of temperate regions, being the species from which most orchard pear cultivars grown in Europe, North America, and Australia have been developed. Two other species of pears, the Nashi pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) and the hybrid Chinese white or <b>ya</b> <b>pear</b> (Pyrus × bretschneideri, [...] ) are more widely grown in East Asia.|$|E

40|$|Result {{of impact}} and {{compression}} tests on Chojuro, Twentieth Century, Tsu Li, and Ya Li varieties of Asian pears indicate that Chojuro pears are the firmest and most resistant to mechanical damage. At {{the time of}} harvest, Tsu Li and <b>Ya</b> Li <b>pears</b> could resist mechanical damage nearly as well as Chojuro pears, but they become more susceptible to bruising in cold storage. Twentieth Century pears are most sensitive to impact and compression bruising. Increased time in the ripening room produces more softening and increased bruise resistance of Chojuro and Twentieth Century pears than of Tsu Li and <b>Ya</b> Li <b>pears...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Along with cultivars of P. pyrifolia and P. ussuriensis, {{the fruit}} is {{also called the}} nashi pear. These very juicy, white to light yellow pears, unlike the round Nashi pears (P. pyrifolia) that are also grown in eastern Asia, are shaped more like the European pear (Pyrus communis), narrow towards the stem end. The “Ya Li” (...) , {{literally}} [...] "duck pear" [...] due to its mallard-like shape, is one cultivar widely grown in China and exported around the world. <b>Ya</b> <b>pears</b> taste similar to a mild Bosc pear, but are crisp, with a higher water content and lower sugar content.|$|R
