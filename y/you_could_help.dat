He said, 'Yes, I know, but no one else but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> me.' He said, 'Two sticks, a dash and cake with a stick down. What is it?' I said, 'Did you wake me up just to tell me this?' As it turns out, two sticks is the number 11. A dash is a dash. And cake with a stick down is the number nine. And that was September 11." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The country {{seems to}} do pretty well. But you're a radical, Bell. My belief is, you wouldn't be a lady if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You do not {{understand}} the combination that has been effected. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> yourself. <b>You</b> would be drafted into the militia." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Clara; <b>you</b> {{certainly}} <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> what {{he might}} say to <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not refuse to listen to him. A lady in such a case, when she is on terms of intimacy with a gentleman, as you were with Mr. Fitzgerald, is bound to listen to him, and {{to give him an}} answer. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> {{what he might}} say, Clara.

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>COULD</b> <b>help</b> it, Janet. It isn't {{too late}} yet. Take a firm stand. Let that man {{know you are}} not going to endure his shillyshallying any longer. I'LL back you up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{they come}} up close, papa, I might take the helm, if you show me which way to hold it. I could do it sitting down on deck, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> Rupert keep them off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Leonard," [...] {{said his}} father, {{who had been}} {{whispering}} with him all this time, [...] "speak up; you may be grieved to disappoint a once-friendly companion, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> the defect of your ears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> that," [...] she said, piercingly. [...] "Blame {{can never}} rest upon you. You were only an--American soldier.... Oh, I know! You were magnificent.... But your duty that way is done. A higher duty awaits you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's {{just like}} Phineas," [...] he said. [...] "Hard as nails, {{and without a}} dime's worth of consideration. I don't see how <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> what happened. You gave nothing up voluntarily. You told nobody anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} you need any excuse, Mr. Hemphill," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "In fact, if you loved her, I do not see how <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> {{speaking}} after what she herself said to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{never thought}} of {{anything}} but what <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do to <b>help</b> me; and I was so troublesome. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> tell me things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|His low, stern tone {{of bitter}} {{suffering}} and self-reproach {{was something new}} and frightful to Laura. She clung to his arm and tried to say--'O, don't speak in that way! You know you meant the best. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> being mistaken.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Barrett {{uttered a}} groan {{intended}} for sympathy. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> {{me with the}} furnishing," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "I’ve never had a place of my own before, and I don’t know much about it." ...|$|E
