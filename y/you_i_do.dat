5|$|My loving people, we {{have been}} persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not desire to live to {{distrust}} my faithful and loving people... I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E

500|$|John's Gospel {{presents}} {{the teachings of}} Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in : [...] "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." [...] In [...] Jesus says, [...] "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." [...] He asserts {{the same thing in}} : [...] "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2013, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg {{said after}} meeting with his Georgian {{counterpart}} Maia Panjikidze that Russia respected only a state [...] "that is larger" [...] and therefore the Czech Republic could not mediate between Russia and Georgia. As for Georgia’s future {{with regard to the}} occupied territories, the Czech Foreign Minister said Georgia should maintain contacts with them. [...] "It is difficult when your territories are occupied, but sometimes you have to wait for years, even decades before the window of possibilities will be opened for <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know when that time will come, but it will necessarily come", he said.|$|E
2500|$|This {{approach}} earned {{praise from}} two influential intellectual {{figures of the}} Romanian diaspora, critics Monica Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca, whose letter to the author read: [...] "the distances you take from your own background are of most-rare authenticity and tact. You accomplish a radical break, being {{at the same time}} participative, negating things only after you have understood them, being dissociated from both roles of judge and defense counsel." [...] Cioroianu also notes: [...] "He is not the only son of (relatively) well-known communists; but {{he is one of the}} few to have reached the level of detachment needed in order to X-ray, in a cold and precise way, a political system. Does this seem easy to <b>you?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know how many of us would be capable of introspecting with such lucidity our own parents' utopias, phantasms and disappointments". The historian opposes Tismăneanu's approach to that of Petre Roman, Romania-s first post-1989 Premier, whose attempts at discussing the public image of his father, the communist politico Valter Roman, are argued by Cioroianu to have [...] "failed".|$|E

You are now twenty-three. In ten years' time you will still be a young man. I only ask you to wait. If you marry now, that is, marry such a girl as Mary Thorne--" ...|$|E
