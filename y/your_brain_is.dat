500|$|Following her {{critical}} {{success with}} Walk the Line, Witherspoon admits to spending several years [...] "kind of floundering career-wise". Reflecting on {{this period of}} time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent [...] "a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel like <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> scrambled eggs." [...] She claims that she [...] "wasn't making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything I was putting out there." ...|$|E

'Journey's End' is almost a two fingers up at technobabble; there's {{certainly}} tons {{of it in the}} episode, but it's largely irrelevant." [...] He praises the action sequences and the portrayal of Davros, Donna, Rose and the Doctor, but remarks that the overcrowding of minor characters made parts of the script seem [...] "underdeveloped" [...] and describes the Daleks as mostly [...] "annon fodder". [...] " [...] plot does hang together, but only just". [...] Overall, he describes the episode as [...] "exceptional" [...] but [...] "not perfect".|$|E

6000|$|... "Let {{me explain}} a little more," [...] he said, [...] "what I mean by 'going on.' I {{think that this}} {{loosening}} of the ties of association that bind a man to his everyday life and his everyday self is in nine cases out of ten a loosening of the ties that bind him to everyday sanity. One common form of this detachment is the form you have in those cases {{of people who are}} found wandering unaware of their names, unaware of their places of residence, lost altogether from themselves. They have not only lost their sense of identity with themselves, but all the circumstances of their lives have faded out of their minds like an idle story in a book that has been read and put aside. I have looked into hundreds of such cases. I don't think that loss of identity is a necessary thing; it's just another side of the general weakening of the grip upon reality, a kind of anaemia of the brain so that interest fades and fails. There is no reason why you should forget a story because you do not believe it--if <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> strong enough to hold it. But if <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> <b>is</b> tired and weak, then so soon as you lose faith in your records, your mind is glad to let them go. When you see these lost identity people that is always your first impression, a tired brain that has let go." ...|$|E

[...] There, you {{are fast}} asleep; {{and perhaps that}} is the best thing for you; for sleep will (so I am informed, though I never saw it happen, nor any one else) put fresh gray matter into your brain; or save the wear and tear of the old gray matter; or {{something}} else--when they have settled what it is to do: and if so, you will wake up with a fresh fiddle-string to your little fiddle of a brain, on which you are playing new tunes all day long.
