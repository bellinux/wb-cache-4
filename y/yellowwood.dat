5|$|Kentucky Extension specialists suggest {{selecting}} uncommon {{species to}} replace removed ashes in the landscape. Previous generations created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, {{a factor in}} the extent of the devastation caused by the emerald ash borer. Favoring instead a diversity in species helps keep urban forests healthy. University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing monotypic species such as the pawpaw, <b>yellowwood,</b> Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, Osage orange, sourwood, and baldcypress.|$|E
5|$|Gray became {{engaged to}} Jane Lathrop Loring of Boston in May 1847. Two of Gray's younger brothers, George and Joseph, were {{students}} at Harvard {{in the late}} 1840s and lived with Gray. During his junior year, George caught typhoid fever in late 1847 and died on January9, 1848, in the Loring house in Boston. This {{is part of the}} reason Gray's marriage was delayed from fall 1847 to spring 1848. Gray and Jane Loring married on May4, 1848. Her parents were Charles Greely Loring, a member of the Harvard Corporation and a lawyer, and Anna Pierce (Brace) Loring. Her family was Unitarian, like most faculty and staff of Harvard at the time. Both of them kept to their separate religious denominations yet seem to have had no difficulties over it. They had no children. Jane Gray accompanied her husband on most of his expeditions. Gray was a devout Presbyterian and was a member of First Church in Cambridge, a Congregational church, where he served as a deacon. He was also an ardent empiricist in the tradition of John Locke and John Stuart Mill. When the congregation moved into its present building in 1872, at 11Garden Street, Gray planted two Kentucky <b>yellowwood</b> trees, Cladrastis kentukea, in front of the church. They stood until October 2014.|$|E
25|$|In 1796, French {{botanist}} André Michaux {{was staying}} at Fort Blount when he discovered the rare American <b>yellowwood</b> tree in the surrounding forests. The following year, future French King Louis-Philippe passed through Fort Blount, and reported it was being modified or replaced. In 1802, Michaux's son, François André Michaux (17701855), travelling with prominent early Middle Tennessean Moses Fiske, stayed at the Williams' tavern. He reported that Fort Blount had been demolished.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1941, the Brown County Game Preserve and Brown County State Park were unified as {{a single}} state park. Since that time, two {{portions}} of the park have been designated as nature preserves—giving them additional protection from development. [...] Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve was established in 1970 and consists of [...] in Ogle Hollow containing the rare <b>yellowwood</b> tree. [...] The second preserve is the [...] Ten O'Clock Line Nature Preserve. [...] This preserve was designated in 2010, and is Indiana's largest. [...] It also contains <b>yellowwood</b> trees, and {{is the home of}} some of Indiana's deep forest species, including the red bat, timber rattlesnake, and broad-winged hawk. [...] The term [...] "Ten O'Clock Line" [...] refers to a treaty with the Miami Indians from the early 1800s.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} {{tree in the}} park is the <b>yellowwood</b> (Cladrastis lutea). [...] This tree typically does not grow further north than central Kentucky, and has been designated as a state threatened species in Indiana. [...] Other trees found in the park include at least four types of oak (black, chestnut, red, and white) and three types of hickory (bitternut, pignut, and shagbark). [...] The park also contains at least two types of maple trees: [...] black and sugar. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an edible fruit. In areas with good moist soil, the black walnut tree grows, and this tree is {{an excellent source of}} wood for lumber or furniture. [...] Among other trees growing in the park are the American beech, basswood, black cherry, black gum, and red elm. [...] Also the sassafras, sycamore, white ash. [...] The park also contains at least eight kinds of ferns and 20 types of wildflowers, including bloodroot and wild geranium.|$|E
500|$|Except {{for a few}} {{possible}} glyphs cut {{in stone}} (see petroglyphs), all surviving texts are inscribed in wood. According to tradition, the tablets were made of toromiro wood. However, Orliac (2005) examined seven objects (tablets B, C, G, H, K, Q, and reimiro L) with stereo optical and scanning electron microscopes and determined that all were instead made from Pacific rosewood (Thespesia populnea); the same identification had been made for tablet M in 1934. This 15-meter tree, known as [...] "Pacific rosewood" [...] for its color and called mako‘i in Rapanui, is used for sacred groves and carvings throughout eastern Polynesia and was evidently brought to Easter Island by the first settlers. However, not all the wood was native: Orliac (2007) established that tablets N, P, and S were made of South African <b>Yellowwood</b> (Podocarpus latifolius) and therefore that the wood had arrived with Western contact. Fischer describes P as [...] "a damaged and reshapen European or American oar", as are A (which is European ash, Fraxinus excelsior) and V; notes that wood from the wreck of a Western boat {{was said to have}} been used for many tablets; and that both P and S had been recycled as planking for a Rapanui driftwood canoe, suggesting that by that time the tablets had little value to the islanders as texts. Several texts, including O, are carved on gnarled driftwood. The fact that the islanders were reduced to inscribing driftwood, and were regardless extremely economical in their use of wood, may have had consequences for the structure of the script, such as the abundance of ligatures and potentially a telegraphic style of writing that would complicate textual analysis.|$|E
