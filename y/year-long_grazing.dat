40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The {{majority of the}} rangelands of Hidalgo County, Texas are used in cow-calf operations. Continuous <b>year-long</b> <b>grazing</b> is practiced on about 60 % of the acreage and some type of deferred system on the rest. Mechanical brush control is used more than chemical control. Ground surveys gave representative estimates for 15 vegetable crops produced in Hidalgo County. ERTS- 1 data were used to estimate the acreage of citrus in the county. Combined Kubleka Munk and regression models, that included a term for shadow areas, gave a higher correlation of composite canopy reflectance with ground truth than either model alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{impacts of}} 4 grazing {{strategies}} (<b>year-long</b> <b>grazing,</b> summer grazing, winter grazing and winter grazing plus spring burning) on the grass:legume balance were studied between 2000 and 2006 in a pasture oversown with Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca (Seca stylo) in central Queensland. Seasonal rainfall {{throughout the study}} was generally below average. Total pasture yields in autumn {{were higher in the}} 2 winter grazing than the 2 summer grazing treatments, largely reflecting the sampling time relative to when grazing occurred. There were few differences in Seca composition in autumn, although there was a clear trend for Seca composition to be reduced by winter grazing plus burning. Both the frequency of occurrence and plant density of Seca were higher under the 2 summer grazing treatments and there was also a trend for the density of juvenile plants (< 5 cm height) to be higher in the 2 summer grazing treatments. Seca soil seed banks were generally low and were reduced in the winter grazing plus burning treatment in spring 2002. The frequency of the palatable perennial grass Pennisetum ciliaris (Biloela buffel grass) was reduced while that of the 'increaser' species Bothriochloa pertusa (Indian couch grass) and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis (snake weed) increased in the 2 summer grazing treatments compared with the 2 winter grazing treatments. Burning in spring increased soil loss in treatments grazed in winter. Differences in Seca frequency and density but not composition were explained by the 2 summer grazing treatments promoting 'gaps' in the pasture which were then colonised by Seca plants and other 'increaser' species. It was reasoned that, with time, mature Seca plants in the 2 winter grazing treatments would die so that Seca composition would eventually become higher under summer grazing regimes than under winter grazing. It was concluded that limiting grazing to particular seasons can alter legume:grass balance and that a time-frame of 5 - 8 years with average to good rainfall would be necessary to achieve large shifts in composition...|$|E
40|$|In {{the year}} 2006 we {{investigated}} mechanical compaction of soil {{on the mountain}} pasture (altitude 920 m). Penetration resistance was researched on the compacted places, by cattle hoofs (breed Charolais), which were compared with unmanaged place after deforested. We investigated, that penetration resistant increasing with depth. However intensive increase of compaction was registered exclusively into certain depth. Soil compaction of unmanaged place and cutting - grazing place had high signifi cation of lower penetration resistant (MPa) to compare with place <b>year-long</b> used by <b>grazing...</b>|$|R
40|$|We study bison (Bos bison) herds {{that are}} managed year-long without protein or energy {{supplements}} in large mixed prairie pastures in Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota. We also manage cattle (B. taurus) grazing {{during the growing}} season in separate, but adjacent pastures. Management reflects the divergent evolution of bison and cattle with their respective human cultures and landscapes. Bison exhibit a stronger preference for the perennial grasses that form the prairie matrix, and they are strongly attracted to open landscapes {{during the growing season}}. Cattle include more forbs in their diet, and they use wooded areas and riparian zones more intensively. At similar annual stocking rates, the amount of grass remaining {{at the start of the}} dormant season is higher under <b>year-long</b> bison <b>grazing</b> compared to growing season cattle grazing. There are inherent differences between bison and cattle, suggesting that they be managed differently. Under our respective management regimes, bison are less productive than cattle, but they require less processed feed and labor inputs. We recommend that the focus of mixed prairie conservation be on developing ecologically sound goals and practices for grazing management, rather than on whether bison or cattle are more appropriate grazers...|$|R
