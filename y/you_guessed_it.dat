[...] She found it strange that the Bree, Andrew, and Danielle characters showed little emotion {{in regards to}} Rex's death. Additionally, she noted that the Lynette and Gabrielle storylines provided comic relief while Susan, a character [...] "so often saddled with the comic relief of the show, had a sad and serious premiere." [...] Sarah Gilbert of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, stating the episode delivered [...] "lots of juicy resolution, several power suits, and (<b>you</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it)</b> lots of tears and shouting." [...] The Futon Critic selected [...] "Next" [...] as the 42nd best television episode of 2005, writing, [...] "Say what you will about the show's rocky sophomore season but one can't deny how strongly it started," [...] and citing the tie-changing scene as the episode's most memorable moment.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy named [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] {{one of the}} [...] "10 tracks you need to hear", praising Minaj's vocal delivery, the inclusion of Soulja Boy, and the line [...] "Fix it, Jesus." [...] Colin Joyce of Spin called the song an [...] "unbridled joy", and noted that while {{it may not be}} included on The Pink Print, the album would be [...] "lucky, however, to feature any track half as exuberant as this one." [...] A writer for MTV News UK praised both the production and vocals on [...] "Yasss Bish", saying that Minaj's [...] "melodic" [...] vocals and [...] "fierce" [...] rap delivery were {{the best part of the}} song. Several critics noted a musical departure from the pop and dance-pop stylings of her second studio album [...] (2012). MTV News writer Emilee Lindner said [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] found Minaj going back to her original sound, saying: [...] "Nicki Minaj is letting her rapping speak for itself. She's left her colorful wigs, fancy robes and tutus behind — along with the hyper-pop production of some of her biggest hits — and now she's getting back to her roots." [...] Emma Goddard of Bustle praised the chemistry between the two rappers and saw the song as a change from the more upbeat sound found in Minaj's catalogue, which she credited with [...] "show her rapping prowess much more". Writing for The Source, Khari said of [...] "Yasss Bish": [...] " [...] sheds the wig and the excessive make-up, we get the most gorgeous Nicki we've seen in her career. Now, she grabs Soulja Boy & Joseph DaVinci for the hook and the beat. <b>You</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it,</b> score again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the series {{suffered}} a sophomore slump and that the second season {{failed to live up}} to the first. Henry Goldblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the new season a [...] "B", blaming the deteriorating quality on the fact that it [...] "morphed into four series," [...] with [...] "the actresses wandering through their separate scenes." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today suggested that the series' weakness was due to Marc Cherry leaving the episodic screenwriting to other writing staff members. Variety Brian Lowry gave the season premiere a positive review, opining that the Lynette storyline looked [...] "extremely promising" [...] and enjoyed the addition of Joely Fisher to the cast as Lynette's [...] "tight-assed new boss." [...] He identified the Bree storyline as [...] "the real water-cooler sequence" [...] and complimented Marcia Cross' performance. However, Lowry criticized the Gabrielle and Susan storylines, opining that they are [...] "exhibiting signs of wear and tear." [...] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "Next" [...] had [...] "a particularly sleepy opening twenty minutes" [...] while its exciting plot points all occurred in the second half of the episode. He praised the scene in which Bree changes the tie on Rex's corpse and called Cross' performance throughout the episode [...] "pitch-perfect." [...] Slezak also complimented Huffman's performance, but wondered if Fisher was [...] "a steely enough an actress to go Manolo-a-Manolo with Huffman every week." [...] Though he criticized the repetitive nature of the Susan and Gabrielle storylines, Slezak thought that the Applewhite mystery would help reduce the show's chances of falling into a sophomore slump. He praised Woodward's acting as well as her character's storyline, opining, [...] "there's something so inherently warm and maternal in Woodard's performance, such apple-pie wholesomeness, that it makes her touches of menace all the more chilling." [...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC complimented that Applewhite storyline, writing: [...] "Forget Lynette's career stress, Gabrielle's baby daddy drama, and even Bree's new widowhood: This story has legs, and apparently arms." [...] She found it strange that the Bree, Andrew, and Danielle characters showed little emotion in regards to Rex's death. Additionally, she noted that the Lynette and Gabrielle storylines provided comic relief while Susan, a character [...] "so often saddled with the comic relief of the show, had a sad and serious premiere." [...] Sarah Gilbert of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, stating the episode delivered [...] "lots of juicy resolution, several power suits, and, <b>you</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it,</b> lots of tears and shouting." [...] Aaron Wallace of Ultimate Disney notes Susan's decreasing importance throughout the season, pointing out Bree, who [...] "comfortably moves into position as the show's lead". Also in response to Susan's storyline, many critics saw the character suffer as a result of the declining quality of the second season. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that the writers were making her look [...] "too stupid".|$|E

Foley merely poses them like spears of prize broccoli. Berry plays a reporter trying to pin a murder on a married ad exec. <b>You</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it,</b> Willis plays the rich horndog with a jealous wife and a jones for finding fresh meat on Internet chat rooms. That's right, it's a techno thriller that treats the already cliché topic of Web abuse with an idiotic sense of discovery. I won't go on, but the movie does with droning predictability." ...|$|E

5000|$|Andy Hinds at AllMusic {{considered}} Second Heat {{superior to}} its predecessor and described it as having [...] "some of the most amazing dual-guitar work ever recorded" [...] thanks to the addition of second guitarist Bruce Bouillet in accompaniment with Gilbert. The rhythm section of drummer Scott Travis and bassist John Alderete was also praised as being [...] "one of the most formidable around." [...] Highlights listed included [...] "Hammer Away", [...] "Living the Hard Way" [...] and the instrumental [...] "Scarified".

Reed Fischer of the Alternative Press panned the album as [...] "all flash and no substance" [...] and wrote that the [...] "umpteen attempts at serious lyrics topple this album right off the runway."
