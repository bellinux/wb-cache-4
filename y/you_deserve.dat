25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. <b>You</b> <b>deserve</b> happiness. <b>You</b> <b>deserve</b> happiness, and peace.|$|E

Judge Leon Auge, the judge in the case, said that if [...] "that is the only reason for your coup d'état, <b>you</b> <b>deserve</b> a severe penalty." [...] Aubame affirmed his position that he did not participate in its planning.

He continued, [...] "What I {{care about is}} if you’re an artist and you work hard as fuck and the streets say that <b>you</b> <b>deserve</b> that shit. Then can’t no motherfucking networks try to gas everybody up so they can sell some product with the prettiest motherfucker out". Nevertheless, on February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Bruno Mars on Twitter while asking him to sing a hook on a song that he co-produced. West asked Tyler, the Creator to direct the music video. Mars confirmed that West called him and apologized.|$|E
500|$|The rather later satirist Juvenal (born, probably, in the 50s CE) also {{provides}} {{evidence for the}} monkey, he even pities the monkey, at one point, as an innocent sufferer. Not so with how Emperor Nero was reviled. In one play, Juvenal suggests that for Nero, being put in merely one sack is not good enough. This might, for example, be a reference both {{to the death of}} Nero's mother Agrippina Minor, widely believed to have been murdered on Nero's orders, and also to how Nero murdered his fatherland. Not only Juvenal thought the sack was the standard by which the appropriate punishment for Nero should be measured; the statues of Nero were despoiled and vandalized, and according to the Roman historian Suetonius, one statue was draped in a sack given a placard that said [...] "I have done what I could.

500|$|The {{prosecution}} called 64 separate witnesses. Essone, Mbene, and Aubame {{claimed that}} {{their involvement in}} the coup was {{due to a lack}} of development in the Gabonese army. [...] Judge Leon Auge, the judge in the case, said that if [...] "that is the only reason for your coup d'état, <b>you</b> <b>deserve</b> a severe penalty." [...] Essone said that almost all Gabonese military officers knew of an imminent coup beforehand, while Aubame affirmed his position that he did not participate in its planning. According to him, he formed the provisional government in a constitutional manner, and at the request of some [...] "putschists". He reasoned that the French intervention was effectively an illegal act of interference, an assertion which Gondjout and the former education minister, Jean Marc Ekoh, shared. Ekoh had served as Foreign Minister during the coup. The Gabonese actor said that it should be the French troops being tried, not he and his comrades: [...] "If we'd been able to put up a few more Gabonese soldiers against the French, we'd have won— and we shouldn't be here today." ...|$|E
500|$|Leno {{began to}} drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, {{like his father}} and {{stepfather}} before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often {{a result of his}} diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of Bluebeard, Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of Mother Goose in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno rose to his feet and said: [...] "Governor, it's a magnificent present! I congratulate you and <b>you</b> <b>deserve</b> it!" ...|$|E

This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Judge further explained her position saying, [...] "Let's be clear– live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think <b>you</b> <b>deserve</b> better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, [...] "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. There is a lot to see about this show, there's nothing like this in the world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for. We absolutely give them a show". After opening night in Perth, The Advertiser writer Rebekah Devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of the show. They were apparently [...] "disappointed" [...] and [...] "outraged" [...] regarding Spears's lip syncing and subdued dancing.

500|$|Still, in the World Series against Colorado, he did {{not start}} the team's away games. Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it [...] "the most {{difficult}} decision any American League manager has had {{to make in the}} 34-year history of the DH". Youkilis said, [...] "It doesn't bother me. I want to play, but I totally understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do. I'm playing in a World Series. I'm playing every day. I'm happy. I just want to win.... If I have to take a seat, that's just the way it has to be." [...] Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, [...] "Move on and go to another team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think <b>you</b> <b>deserve</b> to play over somebody else." ...|$|E

According to Stewart, {{the reason for this is}} that [...] "it would not be right" [...] for the game to simply be ported, as the developers built the game to be platform-specific before the Wii U was announced, and goes on to mention that if they started building the game for the platform [...] " [...] would build it very differently and [...] would build it with unique functionality."
