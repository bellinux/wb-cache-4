500|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Hitler's {{administration}} was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had [...] "demonstrated their loyalty to Germany" [...] by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: [...] "On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil Service Code of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to teach at the University of Göttingen." [...] Several of Noether's colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked. Noether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that [...] "Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was {{in the midst of}} all the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace." [...] Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization Sturmabteilung (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later. This, however, was before the bloody events of Kristallnacht in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebels.|$|E
2500|$|In a major opening chorus, the courtiers {{learn from}} Beatrice's maids {{of the terrible}} torture that {{has been applied to}} Orombello and, [...] "no longer able to {{withstand}} the atrocious suffering, he declared his guilt", thus implicating Beatrice. The Court is summoned and Anichino, Orombello's friend, pleads for Beatrice. Agnese declares that the [...] "longed-for hour of my revenge has come" [...] but, {{at the same time she}} is troubled. Filippo addresses the judges. Beatrice is brought in, and protests: [...] "who gave <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to judge me?" [...] Orombello then appears and Beatrice is told that she has been denounced. [...] "What do you expect to gain from lying?" [...] she demands of him. He desperately seeks forgiveness from Beatrice: under torture [...] "my mind became delirious, it was pain, not I that spoke" [...] and he proclaims her innocence to the amazement of all.|$|E

5000|$|Santorum said that, {{while he}} {{had no problem with}} {{homosexual}}ity, he did have a problem with homosexual acts, [...] "as I would with acts of other, what I would consider to be, acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships. And that includes a variety of different acts, not just homosexual." [...] He continued: We have laws in states, like the one at <b>the</b> Supreme Court <b>right</b> now, that has sodomy laws and they were there for a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family. And if the Supreme Court says that <b>you</b> have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to consensual sex within your home, then <b>you</b> have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to bigamy, <b>you</b> have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to polygamy, <b>you</b> have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to incest, <b>you</b> have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to adultery. <b>You</b> have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to anything.

2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection. He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. When he confronts her about her lies after she discovers he lied to her, she says, [...] "Just because I chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to be rude!": and Andrew replies, [...] "How about driving my father away? Do I get to be rude then?", {{and shuts the door}} in her face. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E
2500|$|Her second album, Ahl Al Esheg {{produced}} the hit single [...] "Ahl Al Esheg" [...] in early 1997 and the moderate hit [...] "Bizal Minak" [...] in summer 1997. [...] "Ahl Al Esheg" [...] {{is considered one}} of Haddad's signature songs and is still performed in most of her concerts. [...] "Bizal Minak", while not as successful as [...] "Ahl Al Esheg", had a controversial music video which was shot in London. The song's chorus can be translated to [...] "I showed <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way, but you're still walking in the wrong direction". Hence, the black and white music video, which was directed by Haddad's then-husband, shows padestrians in London walking backwards while Haddad is the only person walking in the correct direction. Haddad claimed that she memorized the lyrics of the song backwards {{in order to make the}} video works. The video also shows Prince Charles walking backwards in reference to his marriage problems. Ironically, Princess Diana died few months after the shooting of the video.|$|E
2500|$|When it {{came time}} to record the score for Double Indemnity, Lipstone made no secret that he despised what Rózsa had done, to which Wilder finally turned to him and snapped, [...] "You may be {{surprised}} to hear that I love it. Okay?" [...] Lipstone then disappeared and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned Rózsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing [...] "Carnegie Hall music" [...] which had no place in a film. Rózsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not – and suggested he listen to the music from Madame Curie to learn how to write a proper film score. When Rózsa pointed out that Double Indemnity was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to The Battle of Russia. Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director, Buddy DeSylva, heard the music he would throw it out. At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over: expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief – only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: there was not enough of it. By this time Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously, [...] "I always find <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> guy for the job, Buddy, don't I?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, {{said that}} the Supreme Court has never ruled that {{companies}} have religious beliefs and that [...] "it has never held that religious exercise provides a license to harm others, or violate the rights of third parties." [...] Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said religious freedom [...] "gives us all the right to hold our beliefs, but it doesn't give <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to impose your beliefs on others, to discriminate against others." [...] The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that the decision [...] "swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees." [...] A Fox News columnist wrote, [...] "..., {{with all of the}} debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees? They are just as important, and should not be trampled upon." [...] The director of the United Church of Christ's Washington, D.C. office, {{said that the}} ruling [...] "may embolden private employers to claim religious objections to particular health care services, in effect forcing their own religious views upon their employees." [...] Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, [...] "It's the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means that the ... corporation's employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees." [...] The Center for American Progress said that the ruling [...] "moves in the direction this court has been moving already, which is talking about corporate personhood—really treating corporations like people, saying that the corporation has a religion itself and that should be imposed on its employees." [...] Interfaith Alliance leader Rev. Welton Gaddy said, [...] "The First Amendment is at its best when it is used {{to protect the rights of}} minorities from the whims of the powerful. Today's decision, which gives the powerful the right to force their religious beliefs on those around them, is a far cry from the best traditions of religious freedom." ...|$|E
