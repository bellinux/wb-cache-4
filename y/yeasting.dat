The survived <b>yeasts</b> consisted of RTSH <b>yeast</b> and wild-type <b>yeast</b> in a ratio of 1 : 46, and the blended <b>yeast</b> (the combination of RTSH <b>yeast</b> and wild-type <b>yeast)</b> produced 1.48 -fold more ethanol than wild-type <b>yeast</b> alone at 6 h. The amount of ethanol produced by RTSH <b>yeast</b> alone was almost equal to that produced by wild-type <b>yeast</b> alone at 6 h. Interestingly, RTSH <b>yeast</b> produced 1.21 -fold more ethanol than wild-type <b>yeast</b> at 24 h (Figure 4). The higher fermentation rate of RTSH <b>yeast</b> indicates that the saccharification of cellulose by RTSH <b>yeast</b> might be faster than that by wild-type <b>yeast.</b> Thus, CBM with RTSH mutation is probably more efficient than wild-type CBM for partial degradation. Attractively, only 1 RTSH <b>yeast</b> was obtained during the selection process, in contrast to 46 wild-type <b>yeasts,</b> which indicates that RTSH <b>yeast</b> could have helped wild-type <b>yeast</b> to degrade the cellulose of newspaper in the early phase of cellulose degradation.
