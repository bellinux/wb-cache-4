5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and {{sold as a}} set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.|$|E
5|$|Anna Maria Luisa's {{single most}} {{enduring}} act was the Family Pact. It ensured {{that all the}} Medicean art and treasures collected over nearly three centuries of political ascendancy remained in Florence. Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art-historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany's future economy through tourism. Sixteen <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> death, the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo the Great, {{the founder of the}} Grand Duchy, was made open to public viewing.|$|E

5|$|Cather's {{letter to}} Anderson {{can only be}} paraphrased by scholars, because she left a clause in her will forbidding the {{publication}} of her letters and private papers. The correspondence enters the public domain in 2018, 70 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> death. The Willa Cather Trust permitted the publication of selected letters in 2013, and a complete edition is planned for early January 2018.|$|E

5|$|Despite Dickinson's {{prolific}} writing, {{fewer than}} a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's Complete Poems in 1955, Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.|$|E
5|$|Sibyl Mary Collings {{was born}} in Guernsey {{in a house that}} once belonged to John Allaire, her privateering great-great-grandfather, whose {{business}} dealings brought the fief of Sark to his daughter, Marie Collings. Her parents were William Frederick Collings and his Montreal-born wife Sophie (née Moffatt). Collings was born two <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> notoriously intemperate father inherited the fief from his father, William Thomas Collings. She had one sibling, a sister named Doris.|$|E
5|$|The Kongō-class {{ships were}} redesignated as 3rd-class coast defense ships in 1898 {{although}} they continued their training duties. They played a minor {{role in the}} Russo-Japanese War before they were reclassified as survey ships in 1906. Kongō was stricken from the Navy List in 1909 and sold the next year for scrap. Hiei was struck from the Navy List two <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> sister ship and was sold before 25 March 1912.|$|E

5|$|Work {{began on}} the pair of Pisa-class ships in August 1904, nearly {{a year before the}} keel of Amalfi, named after the eponymous city, was laid down on 24 July 1905 at the Cantieri navali Odero {{shipyard}} in Sestri Ponente. It was nearly three years before Amalfi was launched on 5 May 1908. The ship was completed on 1 September 1909, just over four <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> keel was laid.|$|E
5|$|Hansa {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Royal Dockyard in Danzig in 1868. She was the first ironclad warship {{to be built in}} a German shipyard; her {{predecessors}} had all been built in French and British shipyards. The ship was launched on 26 October 1872 and moved to the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin for fitting out work. The work proceeded very slowly, and Hansa was not commissioned into the German fleet until 19 May 1875, two and a half <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> launch. By comparison, all of the earlier foreign-built ironclads were completed in less than a year.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Schwester Selma {{founded the}} Shaare Zedek Nursing School. The idea was {{initially}} opposed by Dr. Wallach, who {{worried that the}} school would emphasize theory over practical nursing, but Schwester Selma's curriculum proved him wrong. Examinations following the three-year course of study were administered by doctors from the British government hospital in Jerusalem. Schwester Selma taught all the practical nursing classes in the school's early <b>years.</b> <b>After</b> <b>her</b> death, the school instituted a Schwester Selma Award, which is bestowed on each year's outstanding graduate.|$|E

5|$|Over the <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> sinking, many impractical, {{expensive}} and often physically impossible schemes {{have been put}} forward to raise Titanic from her resting place. They have included ideas such as filling the wreck with ping-pong balls, injecting it with 180,000 tons of Vaseline, or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it inside a giant iceberg that would float back to the surface. However, the wreck is far too fragile to be raised and is now protected by a UNESCO convention.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> husband's death, Sarah Conlon and {{her family}} decided to fight for a public apology for the {{miscarriage}} of justice on her family. Once again she led the campaign, lobbying church leaders and politicians, among them the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who pledged his support, which culminated in Tony Blair's apology to the Conlon family. Ill, {{she was unable to}} make the trip to London to hear the apology, but her children spoke to her by telephone from the House of Commons. After securing the apology, she mentioned that she no longer had to worry about dying and what it means.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>her</b> selection, Sarumpaet was {{approached}} by UNICEF and asked to do a survey of child trafficking in Southeast Asia and promote awareness of the problem. After discovering {{the extent of the}} problem, she wrote Pelacur dan Sang Presiden (The Prostitute and the President), spending six months interviewing prostitutes in Surabaya, Surakarta, Garut, and Borneo in preparation. The play was shown in five different cities in 2006 and received warmly. Also in 2006, Sarumpaet organised the seventh triannual Women's Playwright International Conference in Bali.|$|E
