2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fighting, the division was used as political bargaining chip (among other arguments) during a series of back and forth telegrams between Churchill and Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin, discussing the possibility of diverting Australian troops to Burma rather than being allowed to return home. On 20 February, Churchill sent a telegram in which, he stated [...] "...your message of January 23, in which <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evacuation of Singapore would be 'an inexcusable betrayal'. Agreeably with your point of view, we therefore put the 18th Division ... into Singapore instead of diverting them to Burma, and ordered them to fight it out to the end. They were lost at Singapore and did not save it, whereas they could almost certainly have saved Rangoon. I take full responsibility with my colleagues on the Defence Committe for this decision; but you also bear a heavy share on account of your telegram." [...] Two days later, Curtin retorted [...] "In regard to your statement that the 18th Division was diverted from Burma to Singapore because of our message, it is pointed out that the date of the latter was January 23, whereas in your telegram of January 14 you informed me that one brigade of this division was due on January 13 and the remainder on January 27." ...|$|E

Yves, at the beginning <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> operation of the Mott detector would be particularly complicated and delicate.
