He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a <b>youth</b> <b>violence</b> bill that allowed school districts to use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422—1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Prior to the commissioning of Casualty@Holby City, the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between Holby City Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and Casualty Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). The first full crossover was spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness of organ donation and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. The third Casualty@Holby City crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of <b>youth</b> <b>violence,</b> following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.|$|E

25|$|Klonsky {{became one}} of the leaders of the modern small schools {{movement}} which has done much to transform the face of secondary school education in the United State. His academic work focused on small school size as a solution to the problems of inner city schools; his early research on issues of school size and its impact on student achievement, school violence, and dropout rates, helped pave the way towards the development of thousands of new small and charter schools across the country. By 1996, he was the director of the Small Schools Workshop at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and in 1999, he was named by president Bill Clinton to the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against <b>Youth</b> <b>Violence,</b> where he advocated small schools as a mechanism for violence reduction.

Method: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual design was used. Nine focus group discussions were conducted with 58 (23 males, 35 females) purposefully selected <b>youth</b> victims of <b>violence</b> between the ages of 15 and 19. Data analysis was done through open coding. Ethics clearance was received from the University Ethics Committee prior to the study being conducted.

Conclusion: This study provides evidence that <b>youth</b> victims of <b>violence</b> have important expectations from health care professionals concerning their wellness.
