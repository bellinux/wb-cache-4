25|$|After {{the neighbors}} have {{left and the}} kings are resting, the mother {{attempts}} to steal for her son some of the kings' gold that was meant for the Christ Child ("All That Gold"). She is thwarted by the kings' page ("Thief! Thief!"). When Amahl wakes to find the page grabbing his mother, he attacks him ("Don't You Dare!"). Seeing Amahl's defense {{of his mother and}} understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom ("Oh, Woman, <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Keep</b> That Gold"). The mother says she has waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his crutch ("Oh, No, Wait"). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed ("I Walk, Mother"). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed.|$|E

500|$|... "Part of Me" [...] is a dance-pop {{and power}} pop song set {{to a house}} beat. It is {{composed}} in the key of D minor and set in a 4/4 time signature at a tempo of 130 beats per minute. The melody spans the tonal range of D4 to D5, while the music follows the chord progression of Dm–F–Bb-C. Production was done by Perry's frequent collaborator, Dr. Luke. The song begins with Perry's somber and emotional delivery of the line, [...] "Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade." [...] At the bridge, the beat amplifies and Perry's lyrics become more aggressive as she commands [...] "Now Look at Me!", signalling to her ex that she is still strong, regardless of what he tries to do to bring her down. The beat reaches a peak at the chorus, and Perry's tone and the song's lyrics become more aggressive and prominent as she sings, [...] "This is the Part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me." [...] As the song continues, Perry's lyrics become strong and empowered: [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the diamond ring/ It don't mean nothing anyway/ In fact <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> everything Yeah/ Yeah Except for me". Perry repeats the ending chorus as the beat fades.|$|E
500|$|Howe himself {{wrote to}} Burgoyne on 17 July that he {{intended}} to stay close to Washington: [...] "My intention is for Pennsylvania, where I expect to meet Washington, but if he goes to the northward contrary to my expectations, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> him at bay, be assured I shall soon be after him to relieve you." [...] This suggested that Howe would follow Washington if he went north to assist in the defence of the Hudson. [...] Howe, however, sailed from New York on 23 July. [...] On 30 August, shortly after his arrival at Head of Elk, Howe wrote to Germain that he would be unable to assist Burgoyne, citing a lack of Loyalist support in the Philadelphia area.|$|E

500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E
500|$|Zeta-Jones {{returned}} to stage in 2009 with {{a revival of}} the musical A Little Night Music, which marked her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the relationship between three people (Zeta-Jones, Angela Lansbury and Alexander Hanson) during the course of an evening. She played Desirée Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the play, saying, [...] "There's no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings,... It's not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> digging and digging and digging". She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the play so she could bring her own interpretation to them. The critic Claire Prentice of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a [...] "quiet, reflective poignancy" [...] in her rendition of the song [...] "Send in the Clowns", but Emma Brocks of The Guardian was more critical, remarking that [...] "with her pretty voice, head wresting this way and that, [...] seems to be auditioning for stage school". For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Swift and {{produced}} by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. It was inspired by an ex-boyfriend who was later revealed to be opposite of what Swift had originally thought. Swift recalled that, at first, [...] "He came across as prince charming." [...] As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. [...] "And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was," [...] she said. She wrote [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] in an emotional state, which she described as [...] "the breaking point", where she thought to herself, [...] "'You know what? Don’t even think that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> on hurting me.'" [...] The circumstances {{reached a point where}} she felt she had to walk away. [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on October 28, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store. The song was reissued on March 5, 2009, as remix, the same day she made her guest appearance on the television series [...] in the episode [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn". The remix was featured in the episode.|$|E

500|$|With Varsity a success, the 6th Airborne Division {{was ordered}} by Major General Matthew Ridgway, {{commander}} of U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, to advance eastwards. It {{was supported by}} the 6th Guards Tank Brigade, and many of the airborne troops used unconventional transport during the advance, including captured German staff cars, prams and even horses. Hill requisitioned a motorcycle for his batman and travelled alongside the 3rd Parachute Brigade as it advanced; at one point his batman stopped the motorcycle and relieved a captured German colonel of his binoculars before driving off again. Hill disapproved of battlefield looting and admonished his batman, although eventually relented by stating [...] "If you can get me a pair , <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> them!" [...] At midnight, 27/28 March the division came under the control of British VIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Evelyn Barker, and became part of the general Allied advance through Germany towards the Baltic Sea, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade as the division's leading unit. German resistance continued to be heavy, but the division managed to advance at a rapid pace despite this, with the brigade at one point advancing fifteen miles in twenty-four hours, with eighteen of those being spent in combat. By early April the 6th Airborne reached the River Weser, with the brigade approaching it near the town of Minden, accompanied by armoured support; as it did so, the brigade found itself moving parallel to several German tanks, with Hill sitting on the rear of one of the British tanks. Both sides opened fire, but did little damage, the two German tanks managing to outpace the brigade.|$|E
500|$|Released to {{positive}} reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered Super Monkey Ball {{the highlight of}} the GameCube's launch lineup. The staff of Edge praised the main game as [...] "absorb" [...] due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its [...] "reductive control system" [...] and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: [...] "Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It's beatable; it's an afterthought on the route to your next impossible hurdle." [...] Writing for GameSpy, Ben Turner commented on the [...] "excellent progression of difficulty" [...] engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding [...] "most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game" [...] and [...] "every single level played adds to your skill." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina commended the [...] "great level variation", with [...] "well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience." [...] Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high [...] "ceiling of mastery" [...] enhanced the game's longevity through a [...] "simple but well conceived" [...] scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. Edge and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating [...] "there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more." [...] N-Sider's Tim Knowles pointed out that [...] "the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated", while Casamassina felt [...] "it may be a little too difficult for the casual gamer." [...] However, N-Sider's Mark Medina called the learning curve [...] "perfectly spot on": [...] "Any falling off the platforms feels entirely your fault and at the same time, you always get the sense that you're just that little bit closer to that elusive goal." [...] Edge and N-Sider's Jason Nuyens and Will Stevenson agreed with this sentiment, with the latter emphasizing the addictive quality of the gameplay. On a technical note, GamePros Four-Eyed Dragon faulted the camera system, which [...] "can get out of position, making it hard to maneuver in tight spots." [...] In The Japan Times, Steven L. Kent described the game as [...] "a test of nerve" [...] requiring [...] "advanced eye–hand coordination." [...] Turner reflected on the game's ability to evoke feelings of [...] "nervous excitement", [...] "intensity", and [...] "electrifying, stomach-wrenching fear": [...] "It's a thrilling feeling to be winding down a paper-thin path with ten seconds on the clock, hoping against hope that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> your balance for just a few more seconds and make it to the goal before time expires." [...] Edge opined that the game is [...] "defined" [...] by [...] "unrefined and angular" [...] emotions: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1923, Valentino {{published}} a book of poetry titled Day Dreams. He later serialized events in various magazines.

2500|$|Another way to {{understand}} {{the solution is to}} consider the two original unchosen doors together (Adams 1990; Devlin 2003, 2005; Williams 2004; Stibel et al., 2008). As Cecil Adams puts it (Adams 1990), [...] "Monty is saying in effect: <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> your one door or you can have the other two doors." [...] The [...] chance of finding the car has not been changed by the opening of one of these doors because Monty, knowing the location of the car, is certain to reveal a goat. So the player's choice after the host opens a door is no different than if the host offered the player the option to switch from the original chosen door to the set of both remaining doors. The switch in this case clearly gives the player a [...] probability of choosing the car.|$|E
2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album.

It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that one thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she was thinking about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E
