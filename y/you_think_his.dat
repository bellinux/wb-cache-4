6000|$|... 'I don't look on you {{quite as}} he does now,' said Amy, with a very pretty smile. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> opinion of you will ever alter?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> urging {{us to go}} to the race? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he meant it? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he {{intended}} it for an invitation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Lamb {{was afraid}} we would injure you. Tell him, old Cloud, whether you're afraid of your friends. Tell Lamb what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> conduct." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Probably. A very {{worrying}} {{time our}} headmaster is having, {{taking it all}} round, {{in connection with this}} painful affair. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> move will be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why I {{mentioned}} Mr. Smethurst," [...] she said, [...] "it {{was because}} we had been talking of Ogden. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> treatment would be just what Ogden needs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, why don't {{you answer}} me?" [...] my aunt went on, warming up. [...] "DO {{you mean to}} tell me <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> {{behaviour}} respectful to a nice girl in Daphne's position?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> time so short!" [...] exclaimed the deacon. [...] "I was {{in hopes}} he might last until the Sea Lion goes out, {{and that a}} voyage might help to set him up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My good woman,' said Gashford, 'how can you!--Dear me!--What do {{you mean}} by tempting, and by danger? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> lordship is a roaring lion, going about and seeking whom he may devour? God bless me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|GIACOMO [LIGHTING THE LAMP]: And yet once {{quenched}} I cannot thus relume My father's life: do <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>his</b> ghost Might plead {{that argument}} with God? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will I not!" [...] Edmund exclaimed; [...] "but tell {{me first}} what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> are <b>his</b> plans. Which way has he gone, and what force has he with him?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You find no {{difficulty}} in tolerating him, then?--you have {{a respect for}} a political platitudinarian as insensible as an ox to everything he can't turn into political capital. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> monumental obtuseness suited to {{the dignity of the}} English gentleman." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, {{and so did}} I, {{from what}} little I saw of him,' replied Lowten, 'it only shows how one may be deceived. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> going to Demerara, too?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What difference?" [...] inquired Caroline, {{accompanying}} {{her to the}} door. [...] "James Helstone--that is, my father--is {{generally considered}} the best-looking of the two.

6000|$|... "Nothing, {{except that}} he seems to have gone mad," [...] Borrowdean said, bitterly. [...] "I went to him to-day to get him to fix the dates for his {{meetings}} at Glasgow and Leeds. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> answer was?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> {{going to}} Wuthering Heights?' I inquired. 'He is {{reformed}} in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering {{the right hand}} of fellowship to his enemies all around!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Better go in careful, gentlemen,' says I. 'He seems {{impatient}} at times, {{and when}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> late professional pursuits one {{would look for}} abrupt actions if he was come upon sudden.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--he couldn't. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> {{imagination}} has wandered {{away from}} you--to something impossible.

6000|$|... "After all," [...] she said, [...] "a soldier's {{official}} record is sometimes as little {{to be trusted}} as <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> friends' estimate of him ought to be.

As it happened, neither was deserved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> condition?" [...] {{she asked}} me, {{after the second}} day was over. I could see by her own grave face that she had already formed her own conclusions.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Foley {{is quite}} {{satisfied}} with that--in fact he thinks it's best. Do you know, {{he seems to}} have gained a new lease of life during the last few weeks. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> commission on your Manchester strike?" ...|$|R
