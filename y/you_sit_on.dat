500|$|Shekhar of Oneindia Entertainment {{gave the}} film 3.5 out of 5 stars {{and called it}} a [...] "good {{suspense}} thriller which will be a treat for family audience", and stated [...] "the {{second half of the}} film is simply superb and the suspense element makes <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the edge of the seat and watch the movie biting your nails. The climax is also good and it makes the viewers to walk out of the cinema hall with a contented heart". IndiaGlitz gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "The biggest strength of Drushyam is not its genre, but the fact that an excellent screenplay has been written around too less characters for a movie of this genre and without sub plots and the like", and added that [...] "Drushyam is edge-of-the-seat, but it doesn't demand the audience to connect the threads. An unconventional film, this film is refreshing as it is not formulaic".|$|E

[...] Skotte also compared it to the director's previous film: [...] "Through its material and look, Melancholia creates rifts, but unlike Antichrist I don't {{feel that there is}} a fence pole in the rift which is smashed directly down into the meat. <b>You</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> your seat in the cinema and mildly marveled go along in the end of the world." [...] Berlingskes Ebbe Iversen wrote about the film: [...] "It is big, it is enigmatic, and now and then rather irritating. But it is also a visionary work, which makes a gigantic impression." [...] The critic continued: [...] "From time to time the film moves on the edge of kitsch, but with Justine played by Kirsten Dunst and Claire played by Charlotte Gainsbourg as the leading characters, Melancholia is a bold, uneven, unruly and completely unforgettable film." ...|$|E
