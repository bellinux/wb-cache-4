Several reviews of geochemical literature emphasize the carbon event at the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary as being an indicator of a massive dump of CO 2 derived from the mantle and entering the atmosphere by extensive global volcanism. Oxygen isotope data indicates extreme warming at the end of the Cretaceous which is consistent with a greenhouse effect attending the CO 2 event.

40|$|Despite being heavily criticised in the {{literature}} {{the most widely used}} and accepted compaction equation is the Heckel equation proposed by Heckel in 1961. Its presence in literature for 55 years is due to the ease in which it can distinguish between plastic and brittle materials. Achieving the correct balance of plastic and brittle materials in a formulation is critical to ensure adequate tablet strength is achieved therefore classifying materials using the Heckel equation is attractive. Despite the importance of this understanding, especially in the design and manufacture of direct compression formulations, there are no set analytical testing standards or materials classification guidelines. Instead many workers have attempted to develop techniques for the measurement and classification of a materials deformation but there is still confusion and contradiction present in this field. In this study we repot on report the effect of compaction pressure on the <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> of ibuprofen and its sodium salt. Ibuprofen and its sodium salt were selected as models for study due to the availability of comparative literature <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> values. The reported variation in <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> can be significant e. g, ibuprofen which has literature values of 21 - 1139 MPa. This study proposes an approach to determine <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> from the Heckel equation using a linear regression method. The full linear regression methodology utilised is described and is used to report the <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> of ibuprofen and its sodium salt dihydrate. This technique reveals the most representative compaction pressure in order to derive <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> to be 121 MPa. The <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> of ibuprofen and its sodium salt have been shown to increase with increasing compaction pressure. The reported values lie between 52 - 78 MPa for ibuprofen and 48 - 75 MPa for ibuprofen sodium dihydrate. The slightly lower reported <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> values for ibuprofen sodium suggest increased plasticity which could be attributed to the water contained within the structure acting as a plasticiser...|$|E
40|$|It is {{intuitive}} that a {{clamping element}} will grip better if {{the surface is}} provided with teeth which penetrate Into {{the surface of the}} clamped object. This paper is concerned with the problem of determining a quantitative comparison of the gripping ability of various penetrator shapes. It is presumed that the effects noted for a single penetrator will be applicable to an array of penetrators as on a serrated clamping element. Mathematical considerations show that a vertical penetrator load is held in equilibrium by the vertical components of the <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> which act on the penetrator surfaces. This is mathematically equivalent to the force given by the <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> acting over the area of the indentation projected on a plane normal to the direction of the load. This paper endeavors to show that the same concept will apply to forces applied transversely. Therefore the maximum possible transverse force which can be applied to a penetrator is theoretically equal to the product of the <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> of the Penetrated material and the area of tie penetrator face projected on a plane normal to the transverse force. Plasticity considerations show that the, <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> for a given material varies according to the penetrator shape. Strain hardening is also a factor in most materials. The influence of conventional friction is also shown to vary with the penetrator shape. In same cases vectorial addition of the frictional effect is required, but special cased permit algebraic addition. It is shown analytically that a friction reversal occurs at the surface of the penetrator as the transverse force roaches its maximum value. The result of the friction reversal is to lower the <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> Against the penetrator face. Experiments show that the foregoing theories are justified for the cases tested...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} work was to observe {{the impact of the}} mass composition of the mixture on the compressibility. The single-compound materials and their mixtures were compacted using instrumented presses. It allowed obtaining compression cycles (i. e., force-displacement curves) which were associated with energy measurements (specific compaction energy, E-spcp and specific expansion energy, E-sp exp). It was observed that for the mixtures studied, the change of E-sp cp with the mass composition could be fitted using a linear relationship (it was not the case with E-sp exp). A linear relationship between the porosity of mixture's compacts and the mass composition was also obtained. Heckel's plots were then obtained for the three excipients and the mixtures. The mean <b>yield</b> <b>pressure</b> was calculated with the "in-die-method" and the "out-of-die method". A proportional relationship was not valid for the mean yield pressures.
