25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of}} the nature connectedness construct.|$|E

Jon Peters {{reworked}} the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst {{to create a}} [...] model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs?

500|$|Stone {{wanted to}} shoot the movie in New York City and that {{required}} a budget of at least $15 million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed Platoon {{felt that it was}} too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer Edward R. Pressman took it to 20th Century Fox and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year. According to Stone, he was [...] "making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies. Bob [...] and I wanted the camera to become a predator. There is no letup until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fixed world of Charlie’s father, where the stationary camera gives you a sense of immutable values". The director saw Wall Street as a battle zone and [...] "filmed it as such" [...] including shooting conversations like physical confrontations and in ensemble shots had the camera circle the actors [...] "in a way that makes you feel you're in a pool with sharks".|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
500|$|Schwartz {{uses the}} [...] "Unlimited" [...] theme {{as the second}} major motif running through the score. Although not {{included}} as a titled song, the theme appears as an interlude {{in several of the}} musical numbers. In a tribute to Harold Arlen, who wrote the score for the 1939 film adaptation, the [...] "Unlimited" [...] melody incorporates the first seven notes of the song [...] "Over the Rainbow." [...] Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, [...] "according to copyright law, when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'". Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a minor key in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in [...] "Defying Gravity", which is written primarily in the key of D-flat major. In the song [...] "The Wicked Witch of the East", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the [...] "Unlimited" [...] theme is played in a major key.|$|E

"Between the Lines" [...] {{became the}} album's first single; it was {{released}} digitally on the band's Twitter page on March22, later peaking at {{number one on the}} Billboard Rock Songs chart.The music video for [...] "Between the Lines", [...] directed by Christopher Sims, was shot on April11 in Los Angeles, California, and premiered on Fuse TV's Top 20 Countdown on May 7.The song was written by Robert, with a guitar solo written by Dean. Robert was inspired by the 1960s rock groups, The Zombies and The Animals, and who had been picturing [...] "a '60s go-go beat and a girl in a miniskirt" [...] before Weiland changed the song's meaning with his lyrics. Dean commented on how Weiland had turned [...] "Between the Lines" [...] into a love song: [...] "Sometimes we don't feel musically what Scott does lyrically. He took it to an exciting place. It's pretty twisted." [...] Weiland's lyrics reflected on his relationship with his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, and his history with drug abuse. Speaking of the at-times strange lyrics, Weiland cited The Beatles' [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] as an inspiration. [...] "Sometimes you throw together random words that phonetically sound good with the melody and then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> meat of the song in the chorus." [...] "Between the Lines" [...] was originally the working title of the song, which Weiland incorporated into his lyrics.|$|E
500|$|ILM's {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar said that [...] "not {{only were the}} film's effects ambitious, they also had to be designed for 3-D", and explained the company's solutions for the new perspective: [...] "We did make sure things are as bright as possible; Michael called up theatre owners {{to make sure they}} keep the lamps bright in the theatres... make everything a little sharper, because we know that through the steps, no matter what, when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final screening things tend to go less sharp." [...] On the last weekend of ILM's work on Dark of the Moon, the company's entire render farm was being used for the film, giving ILM more than 200,000 hours of rendering power a day—or equivalent to 22.8 years of rendering time in a 24-hour period. Farrar embraced the detail in creating giant robots for 3-D, making sure that in close-ups of the Transformers' faces [...] "you see all the details in the nooks and crannies of these pieces. It's totally unlike a plain surface subject like a human head or an animated head." [...] The supervisor said that Bay's style of cinematography helped integrate the robots into the scenes, as [...] "Michael is keen on having foreground/midground/background depth in his shots, even in normal live-action shots. He'll say, ’Put some stuff hanging here!' It could be women's stockings or forks and knives dangling from a string out of focus – it doesn't matter, but it gives you depth, and focus depth, and makes it more interesting." ...|$|E

Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it.
