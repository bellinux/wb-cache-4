500|$|He {{signed as}} a {{professional}} footballer for Leicester City in August 1944, choosing them ahead of local club Middlesbrough primarily due to the close links between Middlesbrough Swifts and Leicester City; he also worked as an apprentice bricklayer. Leicester originally thought him {{not good enough to}} turn professional, but he was taken under the wing of Leicester player Sep Smith who mentored Revie on many of his ideas about the game. Smith instructed Revie that [...] "When not in position, get into position; never beat a man by dribbling if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>beat</b> him more easily with a pass; it is not the man on the ball but the one running into position to take the pass who constitutes the danger; and the aim is to have a man spare in a passing move. Soccer would then become easy." [...] He played in the wartime league, before making his debut in the Football League on the opening day of the 1946–47 season, a 3–0 defeat to Manchester City, who would go on to win the Second Division that season. He showed good form at Filbert Street before breaking his right ankle in three places after a tackle from Tottenham Hotspur's Ron Burgess; the injury could have ended his career, but he recovered to full fitness within 19 weeks.|$|E

On that episode, he moderated a contract signing between Vince McMahon and Bret Hart for their match at WrestleMania XXVI. In the same episode, Austin met up backstage with his longtime rival Shawn Michaels, who asked Austin whether he believed that Michaels could end the Undertaker's undefeated WrestleMania streak in their upcoming match. Austin replied [...] "Hell yeah I think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>beat</b> the Undertaker, but you're not going to, The streak {{is going to go}} 18–0". Michaels lost the match extending the Undertaker's streak to 18–0 and forcing Michaels to retire.|$|E

Ranked no. 120 in the world, Blake accepted a wild card into Cincinnati Masters. He beat a qualifier and Arnaud Clément to reach the round of 16, where he met Patrick Rafter. Blake came close to winning the first set (falling in a tiebreak), and after dropping the second set, Rafter, according to Blake's autobiography, complimented him at the net and boosted his confidence immeasurably by saying, [...] "Now do you believe <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>beat</b> someone like me, or even me?" [...] Blake's name became more recognizable worldwide after he pushed the eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt to five sets at the US Open.|$|E

6000|$|Sir Marmaduke Langdale, who was {{our general}} for the expedition, {{was for a}} general attempt to raise the siege, but I had persuaded him off of that; first, because, if we should be beaten, as might be probable, we then lost the town.

You can tell by the sound of the bullet if you hit the figure, and if you hit him you have done what you want to. You do not need to practise at distances over three hundred yards; that is quite the outside range at which you would ever want to do any shooting, indeed from fifty to two hundred I consider the useful distance to practise at. If you get to shoot so well that you can with certainty hit a man between those ranges, you may feel pretty comfortable in your mind that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>beat</b> off any attack that might be made on a house you are defending.|$|E

I might live among other Tartars, but what good would that be? They would be strangers to me. Why should I leave you, who have been more than a brother to me, to go among strangers? No, {{wherever}} you go I shall go with you, and when you get to your own land I shall be your servant. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>beat</b> me if you like, but I will not leave you.
