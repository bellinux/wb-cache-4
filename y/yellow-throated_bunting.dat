40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to analyze the avifauna of the hiking trail and roads near the Mudeungsan (Mt.) region of Gwangju Metropolitan City between July of 2008 and March of 2009 over a total of 4 sessions, each in summer, fall, winter and spring. A total of 6, 779 birds of 76 species, 31 families and 12 orders were observed during the study period. The most dominant species was the <b>yellow-throated</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza elegans) (12. 2 %), followed by, in decreasing order, the mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) (8. 8 %), the long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) (8. 3 %), the brown-eared bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis) (7. 6 %), the great tit (Parus major) (7. 1 %) and the azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyana) (5. 5 %), marking dominance of over 5 %. In terms of seasons, winter showed the highest individual count at 2, 844 birds of 53 species, while summer showed the lowest count, at 784 individual counts of 39 species. Furthermore, 7 species of passage migrant birds, which are rare in South Korea, were recorded in the region of Mudeungsan. Furthermore, 9 natural monument and government-protected endangered species of the mandarin duck, long-billed ring plover, sparrow hawk, northern goshawk, Chinese sparrow hawk, Eurasian buzzard, cinereous vulture, common kestrel and the little cuckoo, were observed during the study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{investigation}} on avifauna of the Bangtaesan Mountain {{was carried out}} from February until November, 2010 and it drew the results as follow. The number of birds observed in the whole Bangtaesan Mountain region was 989 individuals of 51 species (Maximum counts). Considering the results from literature research in addition, at least 90 species 1, 000 individuals are thought {{to live in this}} region. In result, dominant species proved to be <b>Yellow-throated</b> <b>Bunting</b> (Emberiza elegans), Marsh Tit (Parus palustris), Azure-winged Magpie (Cyanopica cyana), Eastern Crowned Willow Warbler (Phylloscopus coronatus), Varied Tit (Parus varius), and more. Most of birds breeding in the forest of Korea were found to constitute these dominant bird species. Entire species diversity index appeared to be 3. 35 relatively a high level; 3. 34 in the south slopes while 3. 22 in the north slopes showing relatively a high level in the south. Of them, 12 species including Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) were the Protected Birds species nominated and protected by the Cultural Heritage Administration or the Ministry of Environment, while 10 and 6 species were the natural monument species and endangered species level, respectively. Should further consistent surveys be carried out, a broader range of species would be found to breed, and therefore the Bangtaesan Mountain region including the area where the protected species are observed is believed to need a conservation and management through protected area designation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} the study on the avian fauna of the Taebaeksan (Mt.) region of the Seodeukbong of the BaekduDaegan between May and October of 2007 are as follows. A total of 1, 831 {{individuals}} of 71 bird species were observed in the study sites, and based on the average of the highest number of individuals, the most dominant species was the Brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) at 28. 6 individuals (21. 8 %), followed by the <b>Yellow-throated</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza elegans) at 13. 5 individuals (10. 3 %), Long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) at 11. 6 individuals (8. 8 %), Brown-eared bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis) at 7. 6 individuals (5. 8 %), Marsh tit (Parus palustris) at 6. 9 individuals (5. 3 %) and the Great tit (Parus major) at 6. 5 individuals (5. 0 %). This was followed by the dominance, in decreasing order, of the Jay (Garrulus glandarius) at 5. 7 individuals (4. 4 %), Siberian blue robin (Luscinia cyane) at 4. 1 individuals (3. 2 %), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea) at 3. 9 individuals (3. 0 %), Varied tit (Parus varius) at 3. 6 individuals (2. 8 %), Crowned willow warbler (Phylloscopus occipitalis) at 3. 5 individuals (2. 7 %) and Arctic warbler (Phylloscopus borealis) at 2. 9 individuals (2. 2 %). It is predicted {{that there is a need}} to assess the importance of this region through continuous monitoring of the protected region of the BaekduDaegan...|$|E
