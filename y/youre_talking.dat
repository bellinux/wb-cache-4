5000|$|In June 2007, {{based on}} his New York City audition, Tidwell was asked {{directly}} to Las Vegas callbacks without a second audition. [...] Quickly, however, judges such as contemporary dance choreographer Mia Michaels and hip hop choreographer Shane Sparks, found Tidwell to be arrogant, with the latter saying Tidwell acted {{as if he were}} [...] "Gods gift to the world." [...] The allegation was a recurring issue throughout the show, and Tidwell found his reputation as a gifted dancer at odds with his aloof demeanor. Nigel Lythgoe (head judge and executive producer) for his part found the accusations tiresome, responding to choreographer Adam Shankmans comment on Tidwells arrogance with, [...] "I think <b>youre</b> <b>talking</b> crap." [...] The New York Times, in an article titled [...] "So He Knows He Can Dance: A Prince Among Paupers", praised the technically talented Tidwell, and noted that [...] "his unflinching poise and his chiseled, determined jaw" [...] can be misread on television. The article continued, [...] "If Mr. Tidwell is different from the other dancers on the show, the distinction has {{as much to do with}} his dignity as with his impeccable line and his ability to infuse slight choreography with authority...He never mugs for the camera. Its sad, yet hardly a surprise, that such behavior could be taken as superciliousness." [...] The aforementioned Sparks later retracted his previous statement and said Tidwell could [...] "be one of the greats." ...|$|E
5000|$|Anonymous: [...] "...so, if we {{dislike the}} {{certificate}} {{model in the}} (tls) PKI, but we like, say, the SSH PKI, which seems to work fairly well, basically the fundamental thing is: if I give my data to someone, I trust them with the data. So I should be remembering their certificate. If someone else comes in with a different certificate, signed by a different authority, I still dont trust them. And if we did it that way, then that would solve {{a lot of the}} problems- it would solve the problems of rogue CAs, to some extent, it wouldnt help you with the initial bootstrapping but the initial bootstrapping would use the initial model, and then for continued interaction with the site you would use the ssh model which would allow you continued strength beyond what we have now. So the model we have now can be continued to be re-used, for only the initial acceptance. So why dont we do this?"Dan: [...] "So, Im a former SSH developer, and let me walk very quickly, every time theres an error in the ssh key generation, the user is asked, please type yes to trusting this new key, or, please go into your known hosts file and delete that value, and every last time they do it, because its always the fault of a server misconfiguration. The SSH model is cool, it dont scale".Moxie: [...] "And I would just add, what <b>youre</b> <b>talking</b> about is called Trust on First Use, or tofu, and theres a project that Im involved in called perspectives, that tries to leverage that to be less confusing than the pure SSH model, and I think its a really great project and you should check it out if youre interested in alternatives to the CA system." ...|$|E

So Hood yells at her to shut up and to stop talking to her, and Bay Bay Bay runs in from the other room and immediately starts screaming in Bubbless face. Bubbles tries to defend herself, but So Hood, Bay Bay Bay, Ki Ki, Risky, and K.O. form a group and start screaming at Bubbles. Farrah states that [...] "Its ridiculous, theyre up in her face yelling at her. Who the hell would yell at Bubbles? She doesnt even know what <b>youre</b> <b>talking</b> about! Its like you get into it with one of the girls from Real Chance and they all jump in. It doesnt make any sense. How are you supposed to be in Charm School dealing with that?" [...] Meanwhile, Ashley and Brittanya are lying on a bed in another room together and ponder why the girls are screaming and are so loud. Ricki said she can already hear another fight, and states she will not tolerate disruptive individuals.

Marcia begins to drink her favorite alcoholic beverage, tequila, saying that shes nervous for her first lesson.

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{intended}} as a romantic and comic version of the violent gangster films of the 1930s, updated with modern filmmaking techniques. Arthur Penn portrayed some of the violent scenes with a comic tone, sometimes reminiscent of Keystone Kops-style slapstick films, then shifted disconcertingly into horrific and graphic violence. The film was strongly influenced by the French New Wave directors, both in its rapid shifts of tone, and in its choppy editing, which is particularly noticeable in the films closing sequence.The first handling of the script was in the early 1960s. Very influenced by the French New Wave writers and in a state not yet completed, it was first sent by its writers David Newman and Robert Benton to Arthur Penn. He was already engaged in the first decisions of production for the 1966 film The Chase and could not further involve himself at that point. The writers then sent to François Truffaut, renowned director of the New Wave movement, who made contributions to the script. He passed on the project and went on to make Fahrenheit 451. At Truffauts suggestion, the writers, much excited (the films then-producers less so), approached Jean-Luc Godard. Some sources claim Godard didnt trust Hollywood and refused; Robert Benton claimed that Godard wanted to shoot the film in New Jersey in January during the winter and took offense when would-be producer Norah Wright objected that that was unreasonable considering the story took place in Texas with its year-round warm environment. Her partner Elinor Jones claimed they did not believe Godard was right for the project in the first place. Godards retort: « Je vous parle de cinéma, vous me parlez de météo. Au revoir. » ("Im talking cinema and <b>youre</b> <b>talking</b> weather. Goodbye.") After the 1968 Academy Awards, Godard would send Benton and Newman a cable that read, [...] "Now, lets make it all over again!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Jim Gray: Pete, {{let me ask}} you now. It {{seems as}} though there is an opening, the American public is very forgiving. Are you willing to show contrition, admit that you bet on {{baseball}} and make some sort of apology to that effect?Pete Rose: Not at all, Jim. Im not going to admit to something that didnt happen. I know youre getting tired of hearing me say that. But I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans voting me on the All-Century Team. Im just a small part of a big deal tonight.Gray: With the overwhelming evidence in that report, why not make that step...Rose: No. This is too much of a festive night to worry about that because I dont know what evidence <b>youre</b> <b>talking</b> about. I mean, show it to me...Gray: Well, the Dowd Report says- but we dont want to debate that, Pete.Rose: Well, why not? Why do we want to believe everything he says?Gray: You signed a paper acknowledging the ban. Why did you sign it if you didnt agree with it?Rose: It also says I can apply for reinstatement after one year, if you remember correctly. In the press conference, as a matter of fact, my statement was [...] "I cant wait for my little girl to be a year old so I can apply for reinstatement". At my press conference. So you forgot to add that clause that was in there.Gray: Well, you have reapplied. ... Youve applied for reinstatement in 1997. Have you heard back from Commissioner Selig?Rose: No, and that kind of surprises me. Its only been two years, though, and hes got a lot of things on his mind. But I hope to some day.Gray: Pete, its been 10 years since youve been allowed on the field. Obviously, the approach that you have taken has not worked. Why not, at this point, take a different approach?Rose: Well, when you say it hadnt worked, what do you exactly mean?Gray: Youre not allowed in baseball. Youre not allowed to earn a living in the game you love. And youre not allowed to be in the Hall of Fame.Rose: Well, I took that approach and that was to apply for reinstatement. I hope Bud Selig considers that and gives me an opportunity. I wont need a third chance. All I need is a second chance.Gray: Pete, those who will hear this tonight will say you have been your own worst enemy and continue to be. How do you respond to that?Rose: In what way are you talking about?Gray: By not acknowledging what seems to be overwhelming evidence.Rose: Yeah, Im surprised youre bombarding me like this. I mean Im doing an interview with you on a great night, a great occasion, a great ovation. Everybody seems to be in a good mood. And youre bringing up something that happened 10 years ago.Gray: Im bringing it up because I think people would like to see ... Pete, weve got to go, weve got a game.Rose: This is a prosecutors brief, not an interview, and Im very surprised at you. I am, really.Gray: Some would be surprised that you didnt take the opportunity.|$|E
