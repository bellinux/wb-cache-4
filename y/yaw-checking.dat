40|$|International Maritime Organization (IMO) {{adopted the}} interim {{standards}} for ship manoeuvr-ability A 751 (18) in 1993 for preventing the marine disasters. These standards cover the typical manoeuvrability including turning ability, course-keeping and <b>yaw-checking</b> ability and stopping ability. As these standards, however, were not settled under the sufficient manoeuvrability data, {{it was noted}} that they should be reviewed and finalised after practical experiences. For this purpose, the Ministry of Transport of Japan has been gathering the many trial data for these 5 years, and pointed out that the criteria regarding to course-keeping, <b>yaw-checking</b> and stopping abilities have some problems in the practical application to the actual ships [IMO DE 35 INF. 14]. In this paper, the authors review the manoeuvrability standards particularly focussing the criteria for the course-keeping and <b>yaw-checking</b> abilities in the present interim standards. Firstly, the indices for these abilities are discussed. Then, the criteria are evaluated based on the many trial data as well as theoretical and simulator studies. Finally, some proposals are summarised for the revise of the interim manoeuvrability standards. 1...|$|E
40|$|The interim {{standards}} for ship manoeuvrability A 751 (18) {{was adopted by}} International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1993. In these standards, the criterion of <b>yaw-checking</b> ability is noted. This ability is well evaluated by the overshoot angle of zigzag manoeuvre (z-tests), but it cannot be clearly explained {{from the viewpoint of}} ship manoeuvring dynamics. One reason is the overshoot of z-test cannot be obtained by a simple calculation even though the mathematical model is linear. In this paper, the author has investigated the <b>yaw-checking</b> ability by means of numerical computations of z-test using the mathematical models whose course-stability, rudder forces, mass of ship and ship’s speed are widely changed. As the results, {{it is clear that the}} overshoot angle as well as the spiral loop width depends on not only the course-stability (=course- keeping ability) but also the rudder force (=turning ability) and so on. Furthermore, it is found that the characteristics of overshoot angles of z-test are almost the same if the spiral loop width and ship’s speed are the same. Therefore, both overshoot angles and spiral loop width can become the index of <b>yaw-checking</b> ability. They are not the individual indices of course-keeping or turning ability. These mechanisms should be reflected to the revision of the IMO’s manoeuvrability standard...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a ship’s rudder largely determines its manoeuvrability, which includes turning ability, initial turning ability, <b>yaw-checking</b> ability and course-keeping ability. However, existing empirical formulas for rudder forces do not concern the rudder profile. This paper discusses the impacts of various rudder profiles on ship manoeuvrability. Instead of empirical formulas for rudder characteristics, Computational Fluid Dynamic methods (CFD) are applied to obtain lift and drag coefficients of five profiles. Then, the normal force coefficient of each profile is calculated and corrected for the aspect ratio. Commercial packages Pointwise and ANSYS ICEM generate the unstructured and structured mesh, respectively. ANSYS Fluent solves the Navier-Stokes equations. 2 D steady-state viscous simulations of rudders in incompressible water are carried out with the k-w SST turbulence model. To test the impacts on manoeuvrability, a manoeuvring model is built in Python for the KVLCC 2 tanker in deep water. Turning circle manoeuvres and zigzag manoeuvres are performed to compare the manoeuvring parameters. This paper concludes with insights into the impacts of rudder profiles on ship manoeuvrability.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} simulation code {{is used to}} study the characteristics of constant-depth zigzag manoeuvres of the axisymmetric autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) MUN Explorer. Sea trials data for several manoeuvres with the AUV have been reported during the past four years; however, to obtain a more complete understanding of the vehicle's hydrodynamics, additional towing tank tests and computer simulation were performed. The present work, based on the towing tank test results and sea-trials data, utilizes computer simulations to predict {{the performance of the}} MUN Explorer AUV during horizontal zigzag manoeuvres. Next, the Nomoto indices for this AUV during constant-depth zigzag manoeuvres are estimated using the simulation results, and, then, Nomoto's first-order model for the rate of turn of the vehicle during horizontal zigzag manoeuvres in response to a square-wave input for the rudder deflection angle is analytically solved. The paper investigates the validity of the simplified yaw equation to predict a zigzag manoeuvre. Results of this research are a first step to understand the details of zigzag manoeuvres of an AUV such as duration of the first execute, <b>yaw-checking</b> ability, and duration of the overshoot.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{simulation}} {{model for a}} Very Large Crude Carrier is revised. MARINTEK s software ShipX is used to develop, improve, test and validate {{a model for the}} case vessel KVLCC 2. The Manoeuvring Plug-In (SIMAN, 3 -DOF) and the Vessel Simulator Plug-In (VeSim, 6 -DOF) are utilized for this purpose. The underlying field of study has been ship manoeuvrability. KVLCC 2 s hull lines, propeller and rudder data are available at SIMMAN 2014 websites [4]. Captive and free model tests conducted in connection to the workshop on verification and validation of ship manoeuvring simulation methods SIMMAN 2008 are available. The methodology for improving the simulation model is to use the model to simulate the IMO standard manoeuvres. Turning circles, zig-zag and stopping tests in deep water is simulated. Turning circles(35), zig-zag(10 / 2. 5, 20 / 5) and spiral tests are simulated in shallow water. The simulation results are compared to results from SIMMAN in 2008. The 26 th ITTC has suggested benchmark data from average values of the free sailing model tests from the workshop that are used for model validation. The simulation results are also evaluated and compared to the results from MARINTEK s contribution in SIMMAN 2008 using SIMAN. A sensitivity analysis is performed to find which parameters are of high importance in the model. The parameters of high importance are investigated further. The linear velocity coefficients are compared with empirical methods and PMM tests. Shallow water effects and low speed manoeuvring are assessed. The shallow water simulations at low speed are compared with the shallow water effect trends from full-scale trials with Esso Osaka. Validation and verification of simulation modelsare assessed and understood. The simulation model does fulfil all the IMO criteria of turning, initial turning/course-changing, <b>yaw-checking</b> abilities in both VeSim and SIMAN. The model in VeSim fulfil the IMO criteria of stopping ability, while the model in SIMAN does not. The differences in the results of VeSim and SIMAN and small. The simulation results do not correspond well with the benchmark data based on free model tests from SIMMAN 2008, and the model can not be validated. MARINTEK s contribution using SIMAN in 2008 was more consistent with the benchmark data, and indicates that the changes made in the plug-in does not give better results for KVLCC 2. Changes has been observed in the calculation of the hydrodynamic coefficients and resistance polynomial. Especially the calculation methods of Yr and Nr have been altered. When usingthe same input parameters as well as the same hydrodynamic coefficients and resistance polynomial as in 2008 the manoeuvring simulations deviates substantially. These deviations must be because of changes in either non-linear cross-flow drag, rudder module or the propeller module(or all). These subroutines are hard to assess because of lack of updated documentation. The linear damping coefficients proved to be of high importance in the sensitivity analysis, especially Nv and Nr. Wake fraction and thrust deduction are also of some importance. ShipX tends to overestimate Nv and underestimate Nr and can not be validated against results from PMM tests. An input value of 0. 150 [-] for the wake fraction of the hull has been observed to be too low compared to literature and other wake fractions used in SIMMAN 2008. The same shallow water trends for KVLCC 2 are observed as for Esso Osaka for the turning circle test. The same trends are not found for checking and counter turning ability for KVLCC 2. From the 23 rd ITTC committee s review of shallow water ratios as well as using methods of Clarke, Ankudinov and Kijima it seems like SIMAN s shallow water formulae underestimates the linearvelocity coefficient ratios. There has been made several changes in the different subroutines and modules of the plugin during the last six years. These changes are easily noticed by looking at results when using exactly the same inputs and coefficients. It is impossible to assess and suggest improvements to the cross-flow drag, rudder module and propeller module when the documentation is not updated. Nv is overestimated and Nr is underestimated compared to empirical methods and PMM tests. Due to the high importance of these a review of the current calculation methods of these should be looked into. SIMAN and VeSim is tuned for offshore vessels, which could have an impact of the results since KVLCC 2 is a VLCC. An assessment of SIMAN s shallow water formulae is hard to do as well due to lack of documentation, but this should be looked into after SIMMAN 2014...|$|E
