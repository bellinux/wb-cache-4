Yet fear her, you who are Nature's darling: she may detain her treasure, but not keep it forever. Her last account, though delayed, must be paid and her discharge is to render you up.|$|E

500|$|Once he {{was back}} in London Gordon-Cumming {{received}} a response to the letter he had written to Williams. Signed by the prince, Coventry and Williams, the note advised him that [...] "you must clearly understand that {{in the face of the}} overwhelming evidence against you, it is useless to attempt to deny the accusations". Gordon-Cumming wrote to Edward with a [...] "final appeal to show how utterly it remains in <b>your</b> <b>power</b> to utterly damn, morally and physically, one who has ever been a loyal and devoted subject": it went unanswered by prince and courtiers.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} side, some look upon kings as {{answerable}} for every mistake or omission in government, and bound {{to comply with}} the most unreasonable demands of an unquiet faction; which was the case of those who persecuted the blessed Martyr of this day from his throne to the scaffold. Between these two extremes, it is easy, from what hath been said, to choose a middle; to be good and loyal subjects, yet, according to <b>your</b> <b>power,</b> faithful assertors of your religion and liberties; to avoid all broachers and preachers of newfangled doctrines in the Church; to be strict observers of the laws, which cannot be justly taken from you without your own consent: In short, 'to obey God and the King, and meddle not with those who are given to change.' ...|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew <b>your</b> <b>power</b> / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E

500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in <b>your</b> <b>power</b> to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} century CE, the Yulanpen Sutra was {{translated}} from Sanskrit into Chinese. Distinctively Chinese phrases describe how [...] "Mulian," [...] as the name was put into Chinese, used his [...] "divine eyes" [...] to see his mother's suffering, and pleaded with the Buddha. But the Buddha explained that [...] "it is not within <b>your</b> <b>power</b> as a single individual {{to do anything about}} it", for her sins were deep and tenacious. Instead, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month he must gather the [...] "sweetest, prettiest things of the world" [...] and offer them to the monks, who at that time of year were emerging from their season of fasting. This Yulanpen Festival became associated with feeding and appeasing the spirits of deceased ancestors who would otherwise become [...] "hungry ghosts", reconciling Buddhism with Chinese ideas of filial piety.|$|E
