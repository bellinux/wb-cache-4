Daniels first performed his signature song [...] "That Old Black Magic" [...] at Club Harlem in 1942. Guitarist Pat Martino has stated that as a younger man he would play at Smalls Paradise in New York City {{for six months and}} then perform in the summer at the Club Harlem.

However, in the 1950s Frank Sinatra came from the 500 Club to Club Harlem to perform with Sammy Davis, Jr., and sang with Davis, a member of the Rat Pack, back at the 500 Club. Lonnie Smith recorded a live album, Move <b>Your</b> <b>Hand,</b> <b>at</b> Club Harlem in 1969. Even in its waning years in the 1970s, Club Harlem continued to attract contemporary black stars such as Harry Belafonte, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Redd Foxx, Marvin Gaye, Leslie Uggams, and Dionne Warwick.|$|E
