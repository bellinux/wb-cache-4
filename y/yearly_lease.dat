2500|$|The renovations {{were not}} enough. Shutt died in 1919, and his widow {{attempted}} {{to run the}} hotel. Mrs. Shutt eventually turned the hotel over to Augustus Gumpert. Prohibition began in the District of Columbia on November 1, 1917. The night before, Ebbitt Grill ran out of liquor by 10:45 P.M. While Prohibition lasted, Ebbitt Grill was known as part of [...] "Rum Row"—former bars in an area bounded by 13th and 14th streets NW and E and F streets NW which continued to sell alcohol furtively. In 1923, the Willard estate (which had retained ownership since Lucy Willard's death in 1910), decided to sell the hotel. [...] The new owners refused to renew Gumpert's lease on a yearly basis. [...] They insisted on a month-to-month lease, but Gumpert could not come to agreement with his vendors (who required a <b>yearly</b> <b>lease</b> to ensure {{a steady stream of}} income).

2500|$|Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (...) , officially {{known as}} Naval Station Guantanamo Bay or NSGB (also called GTMO {{because of the}} {{airfield}} designation code or Gitmo because of the common pronunciation of this code by the U.S. military), is a United States military base located on [...] of land and water at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, which the U.S. leased {{for use as a}} coaling and naval station in 1903 for $2,000 in gold per year until 1934, when the payment was set to match the value in gold in dollars; in 1974, the <b>yearly</b> <b>lease</b> was set to $4,085. The base is on the shore of Guantánamo Bay at the southeastern end of Cuba. It is the oldest overseas U.S. Naval Base. Since the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the Cuban government has consistently protested against the U.S. presence on Cuban soil and called it illegal under international law, alleging that the base was imposed on Cuba by force. At the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2013, Cuba's Foreign Minister demanded the U.S. return the base and the [...] "usurped territory", which the Cuban government considers to be occupied since the U.S. invasion of Cuba during the Spanish–American War in 1898.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to a <b>yearly</b> <b>leasing</b> licence in Finland is to pay a one-time [...] "re-mechanisation" [...] fee per track, which allows tracks to be copied to cd-r or other such media, and used {{for as long as}} the media exists. Backups are not allowed, and should the disc be damaged the fee will have to be paid again if the licensee wishes to use the same tracks again. While this type of licensing is cheaper in the long run for acquiring a large song library, it does not have the flexibility of the leasing system.|$|R
5000|$|Selectors were {{required}} to live on their land {{for three years and}} to make improvements worth £1 per acre. Speculation was to be prevented by requiring actual residence on the land. [...] In return pastoralists were protected by granting them, at the conclusion of their present leases, annual leases in the settled districts and five <b>yearly</b> <b>leases</b> elsewhere, with a maximum area or carrying capacity, and an increase in rent by appraisement of the runs. The pastoralist retained the pre-emptive right to buy one twenty-fifth of his lease in addition to improved areas, and also possessed the pre-lease to three times the area of the freehold. In addition they were to continue to possess the right to request the survey and auctioning of large parcels of their lease. This meant that they could bid at short notice for such land while other potential bidders were unaware that the land was on the market. The work of Alexander Grant McLean, Surveyor General of New South Wales facilitated the introduction of these Land Acts.|$|R
5000|$|In 1743, British Colaba was leased to Richard Broughton at Rs. 200 <b>yearly,</b> and the <b>lease</b> was renewed in 1764. By 1796, Colaba {{had become}} a cantonment. Colaba was known for the variety of fishes [...] - [...] the bombil (Bombay duck), rawas, halwa, turtles, crabs, prawns and lobsters.|$|R

50|$|The {{quarrying}} and slate business {{did well}} {{until the early}} 1920s when demand fell and the Bryn Eglwys quarry was only kept open by pillaring the easy to obtain slate rather than by digging out new underground chambers. At times there was a three-day week, but the quarry soldiered on until 1941 when Sir Haydn's lease expired. He continued on a <b>yearly</b> <b>lease</b> until 1946 when a roof fall caused by the continued pillaring closed the quarry for good.|$|E
5000|$|The leased Auckland service {{model was}} {{replaced}} in 2007 by a second-hand {{model of the}} same make (with a low number of flight hours and was fully rebuilt from the ground up), and equipped with extended night-flying gear, weather radar and better internal configuration. The new helicopter has cost NZ$3.3 million, compared with a <b>yearly</b> <b>lease</b> of NZ$1 million for the previous model. A second machine was purchased in 2010, providing better coverage {{to the more than}} 1.5 million population of the serviced region.|$|E
5000|$|Two Australian companies, Burns Philp and {{the trading}} house W. R. Carpenter and Co Ltd managed {{many of the}} {{plantations}} {{on behalf of the}} ex-servicemen. The companies found that it was cheaper to pay the ex-servicemen a <b>yearly</b> rent to <b>lease</b> the land rather than purchase it themselves. The controversial but legal scheme became known as [...] "dummying", and was common at the time.|$|R

"'The Rancho de las Sombras,'" [...] read Octavia from a {{sheet of}} violently purple typewriting, [...] "'is {{situated}} one hundred and ten miles southeast of San Antonio, and thirty-eight miles from its nearest railroad station, Nopal, on the I. and G.

5000|$|Today, the Camp Meeting Association of the Newark Conference of the Methodist Church, the [...] "CMA" [...] {{exists as}} a homeowner's association, {{deriving}} its {{power from the}} homeowners, much like a typical condo or townhouse association. The CMA is governed by twelve elected homeowners, empowered to act as {{the board of trustees}} of the CMA. Mount Tabor homeowners own their houses but lease the land on which the homes are built (a land-lease arrangement). The land is <b>leased</b> <b>yearly</b> from the CMA for a nominal amount.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, the City evicted the {{previous}} tenant who managed the Carousel and the Trump Organization, a prominent New York City conglomerate owned by Donald Trump, stepped {{in as the}} new tenant. In return for a lease until 2020, Trump promised to invest $400,000 in renovations over ten years and pay a <b>yearly</b> <b>lease</b> that started at $250,000 and scaled up to $325,000. In statements released {{as part of the}} Trump presidential campaign, the Carousel grossed $1.72 million between 2013 and the end of 2015. [...] The Trump Organization has also managed the nearby Wollman Rink on and off since 1987.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Manor Theatre Company (RMTC) {{first began}} in 1947, {{when it was}} known as the Portland Dramatic Society (PDS). The Society was formed when {{approximately}} a dozen local people wished to return live theatre to Portland following the Second World War. The venues used by the Society would range across Portland and Weymouth. During early 1957, the Society successfully obtained the use of the Masonic Hall in Victoria Square on a <b>yearly</b> <b>lease.</b> The Society attracted good audience numbers throughout this period, but in early 1964 suffered a setback after the hall owners decided they wanted full use of the premises. After an eighteen-month search for a new venue, an agreement was made for use of the Jubilee Hall in Easton Square. The Society continued to use the Jubilee Hall until the end of 1970, when they were evicted again because the owners had other plans for the hall.|$|E
50|$|Still, however, {{management}} at the 15,000-seat Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena worried that the team's revenues were too low to justify the expense of setting up the facility for ice hockey. After the season the Arena proposed {{an increase in the}} Barracudas' <b>yearly</b> <b>lease</b> that was beyond what the team could afford. For the 2007-2008 season they relocated to Jacksonville Ice, a local 1,200-seat recreational ice rink. They continued their on-ice success, qualifying for the playoffs and advancing to the league finals {{for the second year in}} a row, ultimately losing to the Knoxville Ice Bears. However, the new venue was too small for the team to be financially viable, and unable to secure any other arena lease, the Barracudas suspended operations after the season. While team officials believed that an arena of between 3,000 and 5,000 seats would allow the team to be viable, the Barracudas have never returned.|$|E
25|$|Yankee Stadium is {{accessible}} by car via the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87), with {{connections to the}} Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95), Bruckner Expressway (I-278), and other highways and roads. Aside from existing parking lots and garages serving the stadium, construction for additional parking garages is planned. The New York State Legislature agreed to $70 million in subsidies for a $320 million parking garage project. On October 9, 2007, the New York City Industrial Development Agency approved $225 million in tax-exempt bonds to finance construction of three new parking garages that will have 3,600 new parking spaces, and renovation of the existing 5,569 parking spaces nearby. Plans initially called for a fourth new garage, but this was eliminated before the final approval. The garages will be built (and renovated) by the Community Initiatives Development Corporation of Hudson, New York, a nonprofit entity that will use the parking revenue to repay the bonds and pay a $3 million <b>yearly</b> land <b>lease</b> to the City of New York. Parking is expected to cost $25 per game.|$|R

40|$|The joint {{development}} of urban mass transit facilities and private real estate projects {{has become a}} popular practice throughout the United States. As of October 1990, 114 transit joint-development projects had been constructed {{in more than two}} dozen US cities, although the vast majority of projects have been concentrated in just five cities: New York City, Washington, DC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Boston. Of completed joint-development projects 58 % have occurred at or near heavy-rail transit stations; another 18 % of projects have been developed around commuter rail facilities. Transit joint-development activity can be classified into two basic forms: (1) revenue-sharing arrangements, and (2) cost-sharing arrangements. Of the joint-development projects completed to date, 40 % have involved cost- sharing, and 25 % have involved revenue-sharing. The remaining projects have involved both types. Joint-development projects have yet to generate very much income to local transit operators, either through capital contributions or through <b>yearly</b> <b>lease</b> payments. Except in New York City, capital contributions from {{joint development}} have generally amounted to less than 1 % of yearly capital expenditures. This study reveals that there are four conditions necessary for successful joint-development projects. First, the local real estate market must be active and healthy. Second, the agency with the lead responsibility for pursuing joint development must have an entrepreneurial bent. Third, coordination is essential when joint-development projects involve more than one public agency. Fourth, sponsoring agencies need to understand that there are benefits to joint development that go beyond generating revenues. To date, in fact, the direct revenue benefits of joint development have been quite small. The best joint-development projects are those that encourage greater transit usage, create more interesting station environments, and reinforce other planning and development goals. ...|$|E
