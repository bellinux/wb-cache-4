6000|$|Henrietta {{straightened}} herself, and {{her large}} eyes expanded. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> remark to an English lady?" [...] she enquired with soft asperity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Be sorry, only do not roar. <b>You</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> {{noise from}} habit, I am convinced, {{and you may}} break {{yourself}} off it if you choose.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Lady Harman slowly, arresting {{him by a}} gesture, [...] "if <b>you</b> could <b>make</b> <b>that</b> about {{autonomy}} {{a little}} clearer...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> {{a little}} clearer?" [...] And Leland looked astonished, though he remembered now several little {{incidents}} that had {{struck him as}} strange.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exciting? How do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> out? I sat in {{the bleachers}} all afternoon, waiting for {{something}} to break loose. Doesn't anything ever happen at cricket?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> out? I {{can see a}} lot {{of things}} that cost more than a dollar. Look at the silver watch, and the revolver." ...|$|E
60|$|STREPHON. If <b>you</b> <b>make</b> {{me believe}} <b>that,</b> I shall kill myself now.|$|R
60|$|CAESAR. Yes; unless <b>you</b> <b>make</b> him believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... “Can <b>you</b> <b>make</b> out <b>that</b> man?” he said. “This is {{the third}} time I have seen him. It is {{noticeable}} that he shows himself just under the lamp.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> out?" [...] Archie cried sharply. [...] "Seth Jepson {{has told}} the Britishers all he knows, and your name has been put down with the others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} parding, young man,' demanded Mrs. Raddle, in a louder and more {{imperative}} tone. 'But {{who do you}} call a woman? Did <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> remark to me, sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Babbitt {{had reached}} [...] "It isn't the books you study in college but the friendships <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> counts" [...] {{when the men}} at {{head of the table}} broke into song. He {{attacked}} McKelvey: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There! go on. I {{only said}} that to get a rise out of you, Doctor. How do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> out <b>that</b> I should gain by leaving this house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--for {{making such}} bad poetree!" [...] {{finished}} Tom, and {{added with a}} groan: [...] "Hans, did <b>you</b> really <b>make</b> <b>that</b> all up by yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What in hell do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of <b>that,</b> Crocker?" [...] cried my client, eyeing me {{closely and}} repeating the {{question}} again and again, {{as was his}} wont when agitated.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{matters of}} faith I do; and so, I suppose, do you; at least <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> profession. You declare {{it to be}} your duty to submit {{yourself}} to your spiritual pastors and masters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But if {{you turn}} God's grace in keeping you alive into a cloak for licentiousness and an excuse for sinning--if, when God keeps you alive that you may lead good lives, you take {{advantage}} of His fatherly love to lead bad lives--if you go on returning God evil for good, and ungratefully and basely presume on His patience and love {{to do the things}} which He hates, what must you expect? God loves you, and <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> an excuse for not loving Him; God does everything for you, and <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> an excuse for doing nothing for God; God gives you health and strength, and <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> an excuse for using your health and strength just in the way He has forbidden. What can be more ungrateful? What can be more foolish? Oh, my friends, if one of our children behaved to us in return for our care and love a hundredth part as shamefully as most of us behave to God our Father, what should we think of them? What should we say of them? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{so glad to}} see you, Mr. French. I didn't {{know you}} were in Florence again. <b>You</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> journey from Venice so often. I wonder you don't get tired of it," [...] cried Corinna Wade.|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> couldn't <b>make</b> <b>that</b> boy angry. We held {{a meeting}} {{just as we}} got to the hotel, and he and Corny both voted for me.|$|R
60|$|Algernon. I'm afraid I'm not that. That is why I {{want you}} to reform me. <b>You</b> might <b>make</b> <b>that</b> your mission, if you don't mind, cousin Cecily.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>make</b> all <b>that</b> {{noise and}} tumult he will," [...] said Patience, who could bear no more. [...] "Are {{you come here}} to finish what you have done? Do go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{follow that}} passage with your eye, {{and tell me}} whether it {{distinctly}} states that the prisoner expressly {{said that he was}} instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come! Do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> of it?" ...|$|E
60|$|PICKERING. Higgins: I'm interested. What {{about the}} ambassador's garden party? I'll say you're the {{greatest}} teacher alive if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> good. I'll bet {{you all the}} expenses of the experiment you can't do it. And I'll pay for the lessons.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> remark out of {{interest}} in me, I have merely to assure you that I am impervious to cold. I should not mind taking my turn to watch the mill one of these summer nights, armed with your musket, Joe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll get {{you into}} the camp quietly," [...] Long Jim muttered. [...] "You'll be safer there for the night. Then <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> <b>that</b> eighty-thirty in the morning." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Silence!" [...] ses Mr. Smith, at last. [...] "Silence! How dare <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> {{noise in}} my 'ouse, {{giving it a}} bad name? Bob Pretty 'as won it fair and square. Nothing could ha' been fairer. You {{ought to be ashamed}} o' yourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was still}} puzzled, but {{he lowered his}} tone. The true-born Briton bowed by {{instinct}} before {{the woman who had}} jilted him, when she presented herself in the character of a lord's mother. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> out, Maria?" [...] he asked politely.|$|E
6000|$|... "That’ll do," [...] {{said the}} captain, sharply. [...] "How dare <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> noise in my house? I {{think that the}} tale about the clothes is all right," [...] he added, turning to Joseph. [...] "I saw them go into church looking very smart. And you know nothing about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seemed to}} expect <b>you</b> to <b>make</b> <b>that</b> {{restitution}} for him. Tell {{us what you}} know. Most of {{it will not be}} news to Father Tiebout, but I haven't his advantages." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I Love <b>You</b> And <b>That</b> <b>Makes</b> Me God" [...] is {{video art}} {{exploring}} {{the themes of}} convictions, power, and intimacy.
