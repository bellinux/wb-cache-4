[...] Most of the album includes sounds influenced by 1980s synthesizer music.

John Flansburgh offered an {{explanation}} of the legal issue with the inclusion of a brand name: [...] It was a brief education for us in the difference between protected speech and trademark infringement.

According to our lawyer <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> anything in a song about a product, and that expression is a protected part of every American's freedom of speech. However when you title a song after a trademarked product and then start selling your recording (which is also a product) {{you run the risk of}} the trademark holder suing you for infringing on their trademark. To make matters tougher on ol' NyQuil Driver, trademark holders are compelled by the law to protect their trademark or they run the risk of their product name falling into the public domain.|$|R

He said, [...] "I want to expand the universe and also see how others perceive Darrow." [...] Besides introducing new characters, the new trilogy will explore planets and elements only briefly touched on in the previous series. Brown called the scope of the new trilogy [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "far more ambitious than Red Rising", noting: [...] "It spans the solar system, weaves in disparate cultures and moons and planets—most of which had to be created from scratch. It has been an exercise not only in world-building but in understanding how the world would affect these diverse characters." [...] Comparing the new trilogy to the previous, Brown said, [...] "It has the firefights and midnight duels and blood feuds, but many of the characters are not wrecking balls like Darrow. They must use other means to achieve their goals." [...] He explained that the novel's title [...] "refers to the original Gold conquerors; the founders of Society who were infinitely tougher, smarter, and more brutal than their descendants would become after 700 years of rule.

I said that {{it had nothing to}} do with anything other than the fact that I just wanted to go home and be a full-time husband and father. But there were a lot of issues. Understandably so, I was always the fifth wheel there. Those guys, they grew up in the same music scene together. They grew up playing together. Three of the guys were in a band for seven years before I even joined. So, understandably, I was always on the outside looking in. It was a lot of different personality conflicts. Over time, you’re living on a bus together, it’s almost impossible to deal with when you’re living in that close proximity. I don’t think it was anybody’s fault. We were just different people and it was time for me to go. And when I did go, I didn’t even say that, and then all of a sudden I got attacked in the press in every form that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine. They <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> made every story up about me that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> even think of saying about somebody. It got really ugly. I never retorted. Even when I joined Drowning Pool and they started attacking Drowning Pool, none of the guys in the band ever commented or replied. We just ignored it. So, this song “Enemy” is about that, it’s about taking the high road. The chorus, itself, is “I walked the high road away from you/God knows what I’ve been through.” I tried to write it in a way that works for anybody who’s been in any kind of a situation, whether it be any type of a relationship or any type of working situation, where you took the high road, you kept you’re mouth shut and you’re trying to do the right thing and you still get called out for complete bullcrap. It’s a tough thing to deal with. I just put it in a song instead of going public with it." ...|$|R
