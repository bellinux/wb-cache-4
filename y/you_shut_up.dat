6000|$|... "I am serious to-night." [...] Indeed, {{her voice}} betrayed as much. How well I recall those rich and low tones! [...] "I said I wished <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> in the Marshalsea, and I meant it. I have been {{worrying}} about you." ...|$|E

6000|$|Morris {{sprang up}} and, {{walking over to}} the sneering husband, glared down {{at him with a}} look of ferocity that sat {{singularly}} upon his round, fresh face.

6000|$|It must be confessed, {{that unless}} we do {{find some way}} to take off this wool from the Irish, we cannot so {{reasonably}} blame them for selling it to the French, or to anybody else that will buy, for what else can they do with it, seeing <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> all their ports against the manufacturers; at least you shut them up as far as you are able; and if you will neither let them manufacture it, for not letting them transport the manufacture when made is in effect forbidding to make them; I say, if you will neither let them manufacture their wool nor take it off their hands, what must they do with it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Money. You {{make them}} raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the general way. Only you don't kill the women. <b>You</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> the women, but you don't kill them. They're always {{beautiful}} and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and things, {{but you always}} take your hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers --you'll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've been in the cave {{a week or two}} weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} passed, and nothing happened. My unhappy father got on very slowly. The vile {{woman who had}} caused the {{disaster}} (and who had run off with his antagonist) was perpetually in his mind; disturbing him and keeping him back. Why is a destroying wretch of this sort, a pitiless, treacherous, devouring monster in female form, allowed {{to be out of}} prison? <b>You</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> in a cage a poor tigress, who only eats you when she is hungry, and can't provide for her dear little children in any other way--and you let the other and far more dangerous beast of the two range at large under protection of the law! Ah, {{it is easy to see}} that the men make the laws. Never mind. The women are coming to the front. Wait a little. The tigresses on two legs will have a bad time of it when we get into Parliament.|$|E
6000|$|Very {{pleasant}} is {{the sensation}} of being ushered into a pestiferously stablesome drawing-room. [...] "Does this always happen?" [...] "No, not unless <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> the room for some time; but if you open the shutters there are other smells. You see the stables and the servants' quarters are close to." [...] People pay five hundred a month for half-a-dozen rooms filled with scents of this kind. They make no complaint. When they think the honour {{of the city is}} at stake they say defiantly: [...] "Yes, but you must remember we're a metropolis. We are crowded here. We have no room. We aren't like your little stations." [...] Chowringhi is a stately place full of sumptuous houses, but it is best to look at it hastily. Stop to consider for a moment what the cramped compounds, the black soaked soil, the netted intricacies of the service-staircases, the packed stables, the seethment of human life round the durw√¢ns' lodges and the curious arrangement of little open drains mean, and you will call it a whited sepulchre.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not right}} that you should ask me any more," [...] she said. [...] "I am {{not in favor of}} your coming here to court Miss March, while my cousin is away, and I should feel like a traitor if I helped you at all, {{especially}} if I were to carry messages to her. Of course, I am very sorry for <b>you,</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> here, and I will do anything I can to make you more comfortable and contented; but what you ask is too hard for me." [...] And, as she said this, a little air of trouble came into the large eyes with which she was steadfastly regarding him. [...] "I don't want to seem unkind to you, and I wish you would ask me something that I can do for you. I'll walk down to Howlett's and get you anything you may like to have. I'll bring you a lot of novels which I found in the house, and which I expect, anyway, you will like better than those old-time books. And I'll cook you anything that is in the cook-book. But I really cannot go wooing for you, and if you ask me to do that, every time I come near you, I really must--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] said Mrs. Bell. [...] "I {{wish that}} <b>you</b> would <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> {{this house and}} take the {{children}} and come to my house, {{at least for a}} while, until you can determine what to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're botherin' too much, Bill," [...] {{came the}} sleepy response. [...] "You was never like this before. <b>You</b> jes' <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> now, an' go to sleep, an' you'll be all hunkydory in the mornin'. Your stomach's sour, that's what's botherin' you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Were <b>you</b> {{ever before}} <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> in a cave, far under the earth, {{with no way}} of getting out?" [...] enquired the horse, seriously.|$|R
