25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} the train being pulled by Rocket {{approached}} on the other line. Rocket was being driven by Joseph Locke, George Stephenson's assistant and future eminent engineer in his own rights. A shout went up, [...] "An engine is approaching. Take care, gentlemen!" [...] The other disembarked passengers either climbed back into their seats, or stepped over the northern line and {{completely out of the}} way. A third option was available, to stand with <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the stationary coaches, as there was a four-foot gap between the lines, and even though the Duke's private carriage was wider that then standard carriage, it would have still been possible to stand between the stationary and the travelling train and remain safe. However, what unfolded was a calamitous series of events. Huskisson was known to be clumsy. He had endured a long list of problems from his regular trips and falls, and he had twice broken his arm and never fully recovered the use of it. Add to this, that he was only a few weeks post surgery and was there against his doctor's advice.|$|E

60|$|It was a rainy afternoon, and we {{had been}} passing the time by telling ghost stories.
