500|$|... "Mind's Eye" [...] {{marked the}} rare {{television}} appearance of Lili Taylor, who primarily worked on well-regarded independent films. Taylor was cast as Glenn; initially, the producers {{for the show}} felt that Taylor would not be interested, but she actually was {{a fan of the}} show and series co-star Anderson. Taylor, in fact, had contacted the series' casting director, Rick Milikan, and requested a role.

500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] {{is central}} to the 2004 Michael Winterbottom film 9 Songs, being one of the nine songs {{mentioned}} in the title. The movie charts the relationship of main characters Matt and Lisa from their initial meeting to the pair splitting up. Footage of the two attending a series of nine concerts at Brixton Academy, where they initially meet, is interspersed with scenes of the actors performing unsimulated sex.

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Selective Hearing {{was positive}} in his review. They praised {{the production and}} BoA's English pronunciation, stating [...] "The production {{as a whole has}} a bit of en edge to it which is a slight departure from the typical BoA song but it works... Her pronunciation is miles above the English in her older songs. Her vocals are as strong as ever and even when the vocal effects are laid on thick her voice doesn’t get drowned in them. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> hear her clearly." [...] Overall, the reviewer felt it was a great debut track for the North American audience. Asian Junkie member Random J reviewed the song on his personal blog site, and his response was mixed. He felt the song was [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "bog standard" [...] upon its release. However, he stated, [...] "But in comparison {{to the rest of the}} album, the song is actually rather decent and a highlight. A definite grower." ...|$|E

Ethan Brown of New York commended West's [...] "emotional brand of hip-hop" [...] and stated [...] "he makes autobiography universal in a way that hasn't really been heard in hip-hop since the mid-nineties". Hua Hsu of The Village Voice felt that his sped-up samples [...] "carry a humble, human air. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> hear tiny traces of actual people inside". The newspaper's Robert Christgau wrote that [...] "not only does [...] create a unique role model, that role model is dangerous—his arguments against education are as market-targeted as other rappers' arguments for thug life".

500|$|... "Our Man Bashir" [...] was {{the longest}} shoot of any single episode of Deep Space Nine, taking nine days to film instead of the normal seven. The episode {{required}} {{a great deal of}} stunt work and special equipment, such as stuntmen going through tempered glass instead of sugar glass because of the better glass breaking effect. There {{was a great deal of}} new sets used as well, which each took longer to set up camera and lighting for as the crew were not as familiar with them as the standing sets. The backdrop used for Mount Everest was rented, but the crew realised it lacked snow so they had to modify it and then return it to the original condition afterwards. The majority of the 1960s style technologies such as Dr. Noah's base, were all custom built in house and where parts moved they were generally manually operated off screen. Art director Herman Zimmerman said that [...] "Everything that could be manually operated was, because the brain is still smarter than most computers and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> do some things faster by hand." ...|$|E

500|$|Humor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in No One Lives Forever. As Hubbard explained, the game's intention is [...] "to make you laugh, but not at the expense of providing a broader, more satisfying emotional experience than a spoof generally allows, so that even if you don't chuckle once, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> have plenty of fun playing the game. At heart, NOLF is an action/adventure/espionage game with a healthy dose of levity." [...] Humor is presented mainly via visual gags, overheard conversations, textual intelligence items, and cutscenes. The humor includes [...] "situational humor, and even a dash of absurdity and bathroom humor for good measure. Some of it is subtle, some of it isn't." [...] The name of UNITY, H.A.R.M., and other fictional organizations mentioned in the game follow the spy genre formula of using contrived acronyms for organizations (see List of fictional espionage organizations). What H.A.R.M. actually stands for is never revealed, and speculation about its true meaning is used as a running gag in the game and its sequel.|$|E

[...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E

Guitarist Welsh added that the title reflects the UK underground scene and how people will go to see a local band who are their friends and leave before seeing other bands– saying that [...] "that's not the way it should be." [...] In an interview in 2011, Welsh explained that the lyrics on [...] "My Conscience, Your Freedom" [...] are about the government– specifically noting on the line [...] "our coins can pay for the crime." [...] When questioned about the single [...] "Be(lie)ve", Welsh said that it was about the government and religion. Taylor explained further; [...] "we wrote about how people follow shit and don't really think about what they're following".|$|E
