Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers {{in a manner similar}} to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. Whether you have a multi-channel or stereo sound system in your home theater or living room, Windows Vista also includes the ability to calibrate your speakers for your room. By placing a microphone where <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> sit and then running a wizard that measures the room response, Windows Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance for each channel accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the ability to have surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function.|$|E

If you live in open country, or have access at least to good pasture for cattle, a merlin can excel there. If <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> hunt mostly in town or suburb, and especially if <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> hawk from a car, I’d recommend the kestrel. [...] The consideration coming in at close second is your intended quarry. To snipe, dove, quail and open-country sparrows, merlins are best suited. For most blackbirds (Icteridea), either falcon can prove effective. Starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels; but in the open are best prey for merlins. [...] The {{same holds true for}} house sparrows, with this exception: sparrows in thick cover are better quarry for kestrels. This is the slip for which I feel the American kestrel is perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} made into the well-received 1962 film with the same title, {{starring}} Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. The film's producer, Alan J. Pakula, remembered Universal Pictures executives questioning him about a potential script: [...] "They said, 'What story do <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> tell for the film?' I said, 'Have you read the book?' They said, 'Yes.' I said, 'That's the story.'" [...] The movie was a hit at the box office, quickly grossing more than $20 million from a $2-million budget. It won three Oscars: Best Actor for Gregory Peck, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Horton Foote. It was nominated for five more Oscars including Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Mary Badham, the actress who played Scout.|$|E

500|$|... "Trivia" [...] {{received}} relatively positive reviews, {{although many}} critics {{did not enjoy}} the Florida sub-plot. Many television critics agreed that [...] "Trivia" [...] was a marked improvement over many of the episodes {{in the first part}} of the season. Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, [...] "Aside from a few weak moments, 'Trivia' was a solid episode of The Office and a vast improvement over most of the episodes this season." [...] Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B+ rating and wrote positively of the trivia plot, saying, [...] "When The Office reaches its next hiatus, and then its subsequent return, I’ll find myself hoping for more like the trivia side of 'Trivia', storylines that even after contrived introductions can simply sit back and let the character-driven jokes take over the narrative." [...] Chris Plante from New York magazine explained that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> continue watching The Office, here’s my advice ... You need to forget the negative energy this show attracts. Start thinking of Season Eight like a reboot." [...] He concluded that [...] "The Office is not irreparable. It’s not great either, but there is some marked improvement here over the worst episodes from the first half of the season." [...] Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar.com wrote positively on both the trivia A-plot and the Dwight and Robert B-plot. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella called the trivia conceit [...] "quite fun" [...] and awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars. The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "The Office continues to find fun and unique ways to spotlight how mundane office life can be by showing ways the gang finds to fill their day." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, who was notably critical of the new season, called the episode [...] "charming." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to the third episode of the British version of the show, entitled [...] "The Quiz", writing that [...] "while 'Trivia' does loosely allude to that pub quiz with a bar trivia night, that turns out to be the only thing the two have in common." [...] She did, however, positively write about the humor of the episode, noting that, [...] "the writers squeezed some good laughs out of the idea, and it feels good to be laughing again at The Office." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{argument}} of Law and the Unionists between 1912 and 1914 {{was based on}} three complaints. Firstly, Ulster would never accept forced Home Rule, and made up a quarter of Ireland; if the Liberals wanted to force this issue, military force {{would be the only}} way. Law thundered that [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> hurl the full majesty and power of the law, supported on the bayonets of the British Army, against a million Ulstermen marching under the Union Flag and singing 'God Save The King'? Would the Army hold? Would the British people– would the Crown– stand for such a slaughter?". A second complaint was that the government had so far refused to submit it to a general election, as Law had been suggesting since 1910. Law warned that [...] "you will not carry this Bill without submitting it to the people of this country, and, if you make the attempt, you will succeed only in breaking our Parliamentary machine". The third complaint was that the Liberals had still not honoured the preamble of the Parliament Act 1911, which promised [...] "to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of a hereditary basis". The Unionist argument was that the Liberals were trying to make a massive constitutional change while the constitution was suspended.|$|E
