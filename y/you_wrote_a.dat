Where I was, the house was sold and the old lady I hired the room from had to move out and give the owner possession. I like my new quarters pretty well--I have a room to myself, 3d story hall bedroom. I have my meals in the house. Mother, it must be sad enough about Nance and the young ones. Is the little baby still hearty? I believe <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> few weeks after it was born that it was quite a fine child. I see you had a draft in the 3d Congressional district. I was glad enough to see Jeff's name was not drawn. We have had it awful hot here, but there was a sharp storm of thunder and lightning last night, and to-day it is fine. Mother, do any of the soldiers I see here from Brooklyn or New York ever call upon you? They sometimes say they will here. Tell Jeff I got a letter yesterday from W. E. Worthen, in which he sent me some money for the men. I have acknowledged it to Mr. W. by letter. Well, dear mother, I must close. O, how I want to see you all--I will surely have to come home as soon as this Richmond campaign is decided--then I want to print my new book. Love to Mat--write to a fellow often as you can.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Fader, Rowsell stated: [...] "I was on tour, and I'd been on tour for about one thousand years at that point. I was in Columbus, Ohio or somewhere. I wrote it really quickly, and I didn't refine it. It was this outpour of emotion. I was in my dressing room — we were playing on this radio show, and {{there were lots of}} bands surrounding rooms. I didn't want anyone to hear me shouting, so I was shouting like a mouse into the microphone. Foals were in the dressing room next to me, and I was thinking, I wonder if they can hear me screaming [...] "I wanna fuck all the people I meet"? I must have had so much rage inside me, and it just came out. I'd just read that book, Our Band Could Be Your Life, about American hardcore, and I really wanted to make a three-minute, angry song. A lot of it is about expectations of me — as someone's girlfriend, as someone's friend, as someone in a band, as someone with a platform, as a woman. ... Normally I would cross out the line wanna fuck all the people I meet"; I would have kept that to myself. But the performance and the lyrics and how abrasive they are — that was my point. I wasn't swearing because I think it's cool, or because I couldn't think of anything to say. I was doing it because that's what you do when you're angry, you curse and scream. People are going to be like, [...] "What do you mean, you want to fuck all your friends?" [...] But it's like, you don't to a director of a movie, [...] "It's so awkward that <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> film about murdering prostitutes." [...] It's made up!" ...|$|E
50|$|Master Kuthumi {{replied in}} this letter:"Last spring — March 3rd — <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> letter {{to me and}} {{entrusted}} it to 'Ernest'. Tho' the paper itself never reached me — nor was it ever likely to considering {{the nature of the}} messenger — its contents have. I did not answer it at that time, but sent you a message through Upasika.In that message of yours it was said that, since reading Esot. Bud: and Isis your 'one great wish has been to place yourself under me as a chela, that you may learn more of the truth.' 'I understand from Mr. S.' you went on 'that it would be almost impossible to become a chela without going out to India'. You hoped {{to be able to do}} that in a few years, tho' for the present ties of gratitude bind you to remain in this country. Etc.I now answer the above and your other questions.(1) It is not necessary that one should be in India during the seven years of probation. A chela can pass them anywhere.(2) To accept any man as a chela does not depend on my personal will. It can only be the result of one's personal merit and exertions in that direction. Force any one of the 'Masters' you may happen to choose; do good works in his name and for the love of mankind; be pure and resolute in the path of righteousness (as laid out in our rules); be honest and unselfish; forget your Self but to remember the good of other people — and you will have forced that 'Master' to accept you.So much for candidates during the periods of the undisturbed progress of your Society. There is something more to be done, however, when theosophy, the Cause of Truth, is, as at the present moment on its stand for life or death before the tribunal of public opinion — that most flippantly cruel, prejudiced and unjust of all tribunals. There is also the collective karma of the caste you belong to — to be considered. It is undeniable that the cause you have at heart is now suffering owing to the dark intrigues, the base conspiracy of the Christian clergy and missionaries against the Society. They will stop before nothing to ruin the reputation of the Founders. Are you willing to atone for their sins? Then go to Adyar for a few months. 'The ties or gratitude' will not be severed, nor even become weakened for an absence of a few months if the step be explained plausibly to your relative. He who would shorten the years of probation has to make sacrifices for theosophy.Pushed by malevolent hands to the very edge of a precipice, the Society needs every man and woman strong in the cause of truth. It is by doing noble actions and not by only determining that they shall be done that the fruits of the meritorious actions are reaped. Like the 'true man' of Carlyle who is not to be seduced by ease — 'difficulty, abnegation, martyrdom, death are the allurements that act' during the hours of trial on the heart of a true chela.You ask me — 'what rules I must observe during this time of probation, and how soon I might venture to hope that it could begin'. I answer: you have the making of your own future, in your own hands as shown above, and every day you may be weaving its woof. If I were to demand that you should do one thing or the other, instead of simply advising, I would be responsible for every effect that might flow from the step and you acquire but a secondary merit. Think, and you will see that this is true. So cast the lot yourself into the lap of Justice, never fearing but that its response will be absolutely true.Chelaship is an educational as well as probationary stage and the chela alone can determine whether it shall end in adeptship or failure. Chelas from a mistaken idea of our system too often watch and wait for orders, wasting precious time which should be taken up with personal effort. Our cause needs missionaries, devotees, agents, even martyrs perhaps. But it cannot demand of any man to make himself either. So now choose and grasp your own destiny, and may our Lord's the Tathâgata's memory aid you to decide for the best.−K.H."In the book Jinarajadasa gave about thirty detailed commentaries to statements of the Master's first letter.|$|E
