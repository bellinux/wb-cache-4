500|$|Clinton {{expressed}} {{support for}} Common Core. She said, [...] "The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized.... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [...] you see the value of it, <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that and so don't {{understand the value of}} a core, in this sense a Common Core." ...|$|E
500|$|After her {{suspension}} with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker {{appeared in}} William Wyler's Western epic The Big Country (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot {{was described as}} [...] "problematic": Baker was four months pregnant {{at the time and}} had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her {{on the verge of tears}} after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. She followed The Big Country with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in The Miracle (1959) co-starring Roger Moore, and in But Not for Me (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. The New York Times praised Baker's performance in But Not for Me, saying: [...] "Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks but also can act, makes <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> Mr. Gable would like to cheat a little bit on Father Time." [...] She disliked The Miracle so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. But Not for Me was made at Paramount.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt's friends {{could not}} {{understand}} what she saw in him. Her contemporaries were puzzled by her decision to discard professional actors so as to perform next to a rank amateur. Bernhardt {{seems to have been}} blinded by emotion: Damala has been described as exceptionally untalented, lacking any acting qualifications, technique, or timing, and possessing an unintelligible Greek accent. Bernhardt was oblivious of all these shortcomings, and on the basis of her attraction for him, considered him appropriate and cast him as Armand Duval in La Dame aux Camélias (The Lady with the Camelias). Bernhardt is cited as telling a (rather shocked) Alexandre Dumas about Damala: [...] "Won't he make an excellent Armand? Only by looking at him, <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> Marguerite Gautier dies in the way she does!".|$|E
