25|$|The main {{theme of}} the trilogy would be moral and {{philosophical}} problems, such as the necessity for moral choices and the wisdom needed to distinguish right from wrong, justice, confrontation, and passing on what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> (Lucas in 1983 and 1989).|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were also}} divided about the game's {{graphics}} and pacing. Destructoid stated that [...] "while detailed, most environments alternate between concrete gray and brick red." [...] GameSpot echoed {{criticism of the}} [...] "lack of visual variety." [...] IGN added that [...] "the world map and dungeons are crying for more detail." [...] Despite this, Destructoid allowed that [...] "the colorful clothing helps offset the game's otherwise limited palette." [...] IGN disliked the fact that [...] "large difficulty spikes are interjected every now and then" [...] and [...] "Resonance of Fate is built for those that enjoy the grind." [...] In contrast, the GameSpot reviewer liked {{this aspect of the}} game, [...] "You need to use every trick <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned,</b> and a few you may not have even realized yet, to tackle these treacherous monsters, but there is nothing quite as sweet as toppling something that has tormented you for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; once <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> that, you cannot unlearn it any more than you can unlearn to think." ...|$|E

But {{there you}} are again, {{worrying}} about what idiots and the generally evil-minded will think of <b>you.</b> I should <b>have</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> self-reliance on Berande, instead of needing to lean upon the moral support of every whisky-guzzling worthless South Sea vagabond." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{well-known}} role {{of repetition}} {{in the common}} process of memorization of course {{plays a role in}} the more complex techniques of the art of memory. The earliest of the references to the art of memory, the Dialexis, mentioned above, makes this clear: [...] "repeat again what you hear; for by often hearing and saying the same things, what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> comes complete into your memory." [...] Similar advice is a commonplace in later works on the art of memory.|$|E
2500|$|Larisch {{continued}} {{to direct the}} regimental commanders course that had started in March. By late April 1945, the course {{continued to}} take place in Krün, a municipality in Southern Bavaria, adjacent to Tyrol. When Hitler's suicide became known on 30 April, the course came to an end. Before relieving the officers of their duties, Larisch assembled them in the local schoolhouse. His parting words were: [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> in the past weeks was certainly not in vain, for just a few years from now, there will be a new German Army!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Schnitzler's {{works were}} often controversial, both for their frank {{description}} of sexuality (in {{a letter to}} Schnitzler Sigmund Freud confessed [...] "I have gained the impression that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> through intuition – although actually {{as a result of}} sensitive introspection – everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons") and for their strong stand against anti-Semitism, represented by works such as his play Professor Bernhardi and his novel Der Weg ins Freie. However, although Schnitzler was himself Jewish, Professor Bernhardi and Fräulein Else are among the few clearly identified Jewish protagonists in his work.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred's {{educational}} and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion {{and learning in}} Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as {{the building of the}} burhs. As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people. The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: [...] "Study Wisdom, then, and, when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it".|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{criminal}} trial, Cheney Mason, one of Casey Anthony's defense attorneys, blamed {{the media for}} the passionate hatred directed toward Anthony. He {{described it as a}} [...] "media assassination" [...] of her before and during the trial, saying, [...] "I hope that this is a lesson to {{those of you who have}} indulged in media assassination for three years, bias, and prejudice, and incompetent talking heads saying what would be and how to be." [...] Mason added: [...] "I can tell you that my colleagues from coast to coast and border to border have condemned this whole process of lawyers getting on television and talking about cases that they don't know a damn thing about, and don't have the experience to back up their words or the law to do it. Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> a lesson." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Christians {{note that}} the Christian faith teaches [...] "salvation is by faith", [...] "But as for you, {{continue}} in what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which {{are able to make}} you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus." [...] The Holy Bible, New International Version. International Bible Society. 1984. and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God's existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. Søren Kierkegaard argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans. It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important to us. In The Justification of Knowledge, the Calvinist theologian Robert L. Reymond argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond's position {{is similar to that of}} his mentor Gordon Clark, which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a [...] "leap of faith". This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.|$|E
