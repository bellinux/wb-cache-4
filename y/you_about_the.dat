MacDonald claimed Lennon deliberately wrote the lyrics to mock fans who claimed to find [...] "hidden messages" [...] in songs, and referenced other songs in the Beatles catalogue– [...] "The Walrus was Paul" [...] refers back to [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] (which itself refers to [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"). McCartney, in turn, overdubbed a recorder part after the line [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Fool on the Hill", as a deliberate parody of the earlier song.

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think), and Fourth Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way <b>you</b> think).

Evans exhorts [...] "Let us not respond to evil by debasing ourselves with plaintive campaigns or angry rebuttals; rather, show people what our religion is really about by being the same kind, fun, interesting people we've always been. If people ask <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> book? Yawn, and respond that people are always saying crazy stuff about the Mormons." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along with Arthur Godfrey, Arlene Francis, Steve Allen and Jack Paar, Garroway {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of the {{television}} talk show. Television commentator Steven D. Stark traces the origins of the style to Chicago. Garroway, Studs Terkel, and Hugh Downs all hosted relaxed, garrulous, extemporaneous shows in that city in the early 1950s. Earlier radio and television voices spoke with an authoritative [...] "announcer's" [...] intonation, resembling public oration, often dropping about a musical fifth on the last word of a sentence. Garroway {{was one of the}} broadcasters who introduced conversational style and tone to television, beginning some broadcasts as though the viewer were sitting in the studio with him, as in this November 20, 1957, introduction for the Today show: [...] "And how are <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world today? Let's see what kind of shape it's in; there is a glimmer of hope." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song's initial {{concept was}} based on a lyric draft Jackson had written and discovered, which she thought would be {{suitable}} for the film's theme. Jackson stated [...] "it really tells <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say." [...] Following its release, Jackson stated [...] "I really liked that song a lot," [...] adding it was [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "a good summer song." [...] Jackson felt unsure of how the song would fare, but was pleased with its success. An unmastered version leaked and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans. Several radio stations created their own edits until the official version was released, prompting producer Jimmy Jam to exclaim [...] "That's wonderful, because it means radio is excited about it." [...] The song's success was likened to Jackson's return to a more positive and upbeat style in comparison to the bleak aura of The Velvet Rope, saying [...] "In the history of Janet, the records that are the happy records, that make people smile, have always traditionally been the more successful records, going back as far to songs like 'When I Think of You' to 'Doesn't Really Matter.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Asquith {{followed}} this {{by agreeing to}} hold Commissions of Inquiry into {{the conduct of the}} Dardanelles and of the Mesopotamian campaign, where Allied forces had been forced to surrender at Kut. Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary to the War Committee, considered that; [...] "the Coalition never recovered. For (its) last five months, the function of the Supreme Command was carried out under the shadow of these inquests." [...] But these mistakes were overshadowed by the limited progress and immense casualties of the Battle of the Somme, which began on 1 July 1916, and then by another devastating personal loss, the death of Asquith's son Raymond, on 15 September at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. Asquith's relationship with his eldest son had not been easy. Raymond wrote to his wife in early 1916; [...] "If Margot talks any more bosh to <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inhumanity of her stepchildren you can stop her mouth by telling her that during my 10 months exile here the P.M. has never written me a line of any description." [...] But Raymond's death was shattering, Violet writing; [...] "…to see Father suffering so wrings one", and Asquith passed much of the following months [...] "withdrawn and difficult to approach". The War brought no respite, Churchill writing that; [...] "The failure to break the German line in the Somme, the recovery of the Germanic powers in the East , the ruin of Roumania and the beginnings of renewed submarine warfare strengthened and stimulated all those forces which insisted upon still greater vigour in the conduct of affairs." ...|$|E
