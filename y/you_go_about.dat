2500|$|Each {{episode of}} the season is named after a kung-fu move. Quesada stated in July 2016 that [...] "there's a lot going on" [...] in the season, with Buck and the season's writers weaving {{together}} [...] "some great legends from Marvel present and past" [...] including what Quesada {{believed to be the}} most antagonists in a single season of a Marvel/Netflix series. Buck likened Iron Fist to a mystery, saying, [...] "It’s very much about how do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> proving who you are when there's no way to do that, and that's not just the story, that's also the theme of it, which is 'How do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> proving who you are when no one knows, including yourself, what's happened to you?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{weeks of}} Fireballs release, the band were already {{performing}} songs {{planned for the}} next album. One song (which later became [...] "Highway Star") was performed at the first gig of the Fireball tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> writing songs?" [...] Three months later, in December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record Machine Head. The album was due to be recorded at the Montreux Casino, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, but a fire during a Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention gig, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song [...] "Smoke on the Water". The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty Grand Hotel.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> praising everything, and {{screaming}} and shouting, and my-dearing and my-childing her, and patronizing--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is meant}} for higher things," [...] said Goodloe. [...] "I shall find her myself. But, {{tell me how}} <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> {{discovering}} the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently buried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's ludicrous. It's insane. There isn't two penn'orth of {{legality}} in {{the whole}} thing. Of course, you could have withdrawn the charge, but the way <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> it is childish--besides being illegal. What on earth was the Chief Constable thinking of?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "David," [...] she said, [...] "we have {{a little}} money--not much, but {{such as it is}} you must share. I cannot have <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> starved or in rags." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if you DID want {{to catch}} a man how would <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> it? I want to know," [...] persisted Davy, for whom the subject evidently possessed a certain fascination.|$|E
6000|$|... "Vell, if your sthory is {{straight}} dat lafer ain't here now; so <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> your beesness." [...] And {{with a wave}} of his arm the stalwart workman motioned for Richard to clear out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{what else}} {{should we have}} done? It {{would have been very}} dull and stupid to have stayed in together," [...] said Cecil, with a world of {{innocent}} wonder in her eyes. Then turning to her neighbour, [...] "Surely, Julius, <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> and saw things!" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. LUNN. No: it's too long. <b>You</b> can't <b>go</b> <b>about</b> {{calling a}} woman Seraphita.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Mrs. Cook, 'that butler thinks {{himself a}} great beau, no doubt! I {{asked him whether}} he thought you pretty, Charlotte, and he said you hadn't no air nor no complexion. It's as I tells you--nobody will never take no notice of <b>you</b> while <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> so dowdy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my dear sir, {{you have}} feasted me royally, and better far than I deserve, but why will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> {{to make me}} drunk twice over, first with vainglory and then with wine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you don't}} know it," [...] he said, [...] "but you're getting {{yourself}} talked about. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> saying perfectly impossible things to people. You won't marry. You have refused nearly every friend I have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It was {{all right}} when you took it!” he exclaims indignantly. “Why don’t you think what you are doing? <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> things in such a slap-dash style. You’d get a {{scaffolding}} pole entangled you would!” ...|$|E
60|$|SHELDER. Well, all we'll ask is that <b>you</b> shouldn't <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the country, saying so.|$|R

30|$|Thank {{you very}} much for taking the time to talk with me today and for letting me observe your class. As the email mentioned, we are {{studying}} course planning and classroom teaching at the undergraduate level in your field, and the interview will focus on how <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> planning the class that I’ll be observing this week.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} surmise. Let us leave Prince Shan for the moment, Nigel. Now listen. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> a great deal. What do people say about me--honestly, I mean? Speak with your {{face to the}} light." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{not telling}} us that you were Sir Cyril Shenstone, and in letting us put you up in an attic, and letting <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> as Nellie's escort, {{as if you had}} been but an apprentice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now it's {{clear to}} me,' said Mr. Bounderby, 'that {{you are one}} of those chaps who have always got a grievance. And <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about,</b> sowing it and raising crops. That's the {{business}} of your life, my friend.' ...|$|E
30|$|Q 3. Now I {{have a few}} {{questions}} about your planning process for the class I’ll be observing on [fill in day]. I’d like you to think <b>about</b> how <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> preparing for this class, starting {{as far back as}} you can in the planning process, and walk me through the exact steps that <b>you</b> <b>went</b> through, paying particular attention to specific points at which you made important decisions about things like course content and/or teaching strategies-activities.|$|R
6000|$|... "How, how?" [...] {{still more}} bewildered, [...] "do <b>you,</b> then, <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the world, gratis, seeking to invest people's money for them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once like <b>you</b> I <b>went</b> <b>about</b> inciting {{other people}} to go and kill the man I wanted dead. You'll say I was a coward, of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Nathan," [...] {{continued}} Jonas, [...] "the {{world is}} full of people that are continually mistaken; and if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> trying to set them all right by disputing them, you'll have a hard row to hoe." ...|$|E
6000|$|AUGUSTA (going {{up to him}} {{and putting}} her hand on his arm). I've been so nervous all day. Do be careful how <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> during this strike. Those sullen and angry groups of men on the street this morning-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How foolish of me." [...] She spoke {{rather to}} herself {{than to the}} stranger. [...] "Why, of course, people--people whose opinion is worth troubling about--judge of you by what you are, not by what <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> saying you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I fear {{there is}} not very much,' I answered; 'I might suggest that <b>you</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> in fear of some {{personal}} attack within the last twelvemonth.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>you</b> <b>go</b> again <b>about</b> the women! I {{tell you}} I don't like these stories about women. Confound me, Sampson, {{why is a}} gentleman's {{character}} to be blackened so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{particular}} {{friend of}} mine with whom I am staying at present. <b>You</b> don't <b>go</b> <b>about</b> a great deal, Aunt Linlithgow, but surely you must have met Mrs. Carbuncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{for me to}} judge. If you {{engage to}} do my work and take my money, you're {{swindling}} me when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> another job as you are now. You needn't scratch your head. You understand it all as well as I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you do that? What {{did you do}} it for? What's {{the sense}} of it? How do you suppose you can ever make {{yourself}} popular if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> touching people on the shoulder? My nerves are sticking a yard out of my body this morning, Reggie!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I want to know," [...] said Miss Lillycrop, {{after the}} {{conversation}} had run {{on for some}} time, and appetites began to abate,--"when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the poorer {{parts of the city}} in dark nights, if you are ever attacked, or have your letters stolen from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{to begin}} with, Hughie,' said Trevor, 'it never entered {{my mind that}} <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> distributing alms in that {{reckless}} way. I can understand your kissing a pretty model, but your giving a sovereign to an ugly one--by Jove, no! Besides, {{the fact is that}} I really was not at home to-day to any one; and when you came in I didn't know whether Hausberg would like his name mentioned. You know he wasn't in full dress.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MAGISTRATE. [Hissing, with {{protruded}} neck.] You {{took it out}} of spite? Well now, that's something! But do {{you imagine}} <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the town taking things out of spite? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God's daisy chain. And then <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on <b>about</b> how {{twilight}} {{always makes}} you sad. I know you're {{going to say}} it doesn't, but on this occasion it has jolly well got to." ...|$|R
