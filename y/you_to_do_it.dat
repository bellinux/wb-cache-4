2500|$|A Midrash {{asked to}} which commandment [...] refers when it says, [...] "For if you shall {{diligently}} keep all this commandment that I command <b>you,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> {{to love the}} Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him, then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves." [...] Rabbi Levi said that [...] "this commandment" [...] refers to the recitation of the Shema (...) , but the Rabbis said that {{it refers to the}} Sabbath, which is equal to all the precepts of the Torah.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that a belief in a reward after death is poor {{motivation}} for moral behavior while alive. Sam Harris wrote, [...] "It is rather more noble to help people purely {{out of concern for}} their suffering than it is to help them because you think the Creator of the Universe wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> or will reward you for doing it, or will punish you for not doing it. The problem with this linkage between religion and morality is that it gives people bad reasons to help other human beings when good reasons are available." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, Michael Redgrave {{recommended}} Bikel to {{his friend}} Laurence Olivier as understudy for the parts of both Stanley Kowalski and Mitch in the West End premiere of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Bikel graduated from understudy to star opposite the director's wife, Vivien Leigh, with a sudden unplanned performance when a co-star, {{playing the role of}} Mitch, came down with a case of flu. Bikel showed up backstage and went directly to Leigh's dressing room to ask if she wanted to rehearse with him, {{to make sure he was}} right for the role. She replied that she did not need to: [...] "Go and do it," [...] she said. [...] "You are a professional, and Larry gave you this job because he trusted <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> well." [...] After the show, Leigh told him, [...] "Well done." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{clash between}} order and chaos, {{and the people}} caught in between, plays an {{important}} role in Babylon 5. The conflict between two unimaginably powerful older races, the Vorlons and the Shadows, is represented as a battle between two competing ideologies, each seeking to turn the humans and the other younger races to their beliefs. The Vorlons represent an authoritarian philosophy: you will do what we tell you to, because we tell <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The Vorlon question, [...] "Who are you?" [...] focuses on identity as a catalyst for shaping personal goals; the intention is not to solicit a correct answer, but to [...] "tear down the artifices we construct around ourselves until we're left facing ourselves, not our roles." [...] The Shadows represent another authoritarian philosophy cloaked in a disguise of evolution through fire (as shown in the episode in which Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum and when he refuses to cooperate, Justin tells him: [...] "But we do what we're told... and so will you!"), of sowing the seeds of conflict in order to engender progress. The question the Shadows ask is [...] "What do you want?" [...] In contrast to the Vorlons, they place personal desire and ambition first, using it to shape identity, encouraging conflict between groups who choose to serve their own glory or profit. The representation of order and chaos was informed by the Babylonian myth that the universe was born in the conflict between both. The climax of this conflict comes with the younger races' exposing of the Vorlons' and the Shadows' [...] "true faces" [...] and the rejection of both philosophies, heralding the dawn of a new age without their interference.|$|E
