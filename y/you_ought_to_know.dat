He appears in the pep rally scene, where {{he is a member of}} the local community questioning coach Taylor. Brown played without a script because, according to Berg, [...] "you've heard fathers for 33 years, so <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what to say." [...] Kyle Chandler, as coach Taylor, was reportedly surprised by Brown's intensity.|$|E
500|$|Settling in London, Geldray took up British citizenship, {{and worked}} {{on a number of}} BBC radio programmes, such as Workers' Playtime, Melody Magazine and Forces' All-Star Bill. In 1951 he {{provided}} the musical interludes for a new BBC series Crazy People, a comedy show that starred Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine. Crazy People changed its name for subsequent series to The Goon Show and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC were using the same structure for a number of radio series, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). In The Goon Show, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing [...] "Crazy Rhythm" [...] for the play-out music. On occasions Geldray was given lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a long-running joke within the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goons jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as [...] "Conk", on account of his nose, and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: [...] "That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica. We thought <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what it was, anyhow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Randall Adams of The Harvard Crimson writes that, in {{the spring}} of 2002, a {{petition}} within Harvard calling for Harvard and MIT to divest from Israeli and American companies that sell arms to Israel gathered over 600 signatures, including 74 from the Harvard faculty and 56 from the MIT faculty. Among the signatories was Harvard's Winthrop House Master Paul D. Hanson, in response to which Dershowitz staged a debate for 200 students in the Winthrop Junior Common Room. He called the petition's signatories antisemitic, bigots, and said they knew nothing about the Middle East. [...] "Your House master is a bigot," [...] he told the students, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that." [...] Adams writes that Dershowitz cited examples of human rights violations in countries that the United States supports, such as the execution of homosexuals in Egypt and the repression of women in Saudi Arabia, and said he would sue any professor who voted against the tenure of another academic because of the candidate's position toward Israel, calling them [...] "ignoramuses with PhDs." ...|$|E
