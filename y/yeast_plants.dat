2500|$|The PDZ domain is {{a common}} {{structural}} domain of 80-90 amino-acids found in the signaling proteins of bacteria, <b>yeast,</b> <b>plants,</b> viruses and animals. Proteins containing PDZ domains {{play a key role}} in anchoring receptor proteins in the membrane to cytoskeletal components. PDZ is an initialism combining the first letters of the first three proteins discovered to share the domain — post synaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), and zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1). PDZ domains have previously been referred to as DHR (Dlg homologous region) or GLGF (glycine-leucine-glycine-phenylalanine) domains. Proteins with these domains help hold together and organize signaling complexes at cellular membranes. These domains {{play a key role in}} the formation and function of signal transduction complexes.

60|$|Well, then, the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant</b> being {{essential}} {{to the production of}} fermentation, where does the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant</b> come from? Here, again, was another great problem opened up, for, as I said at starting, you have, under ordinary circumstances in warm weather, merely to expose some fluid containing a solution of sugar, or any form of syrup or vegetable juice to the air, in order, after a comparatively short time, to see all these phenomena of fermentation. Of course the first obvious suggestion is, that the torula has been generated within the fluid. In fact, it seems at first quite absurd to entertain any other conviction; but that belief would most assuredly be an erroneous one.|$|R
60|$|But, without presuming {{to discuss}} a {{question}} which leads us into the very arcana of chemistry, {{the present state of}} speculation upon the modus operandi of the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant</b> in producing fermentation is represented, on the one hand, by the Stahlian doctrine, supported by Liebig, according to which the atoms of the sugar are shaken into new combinations either directly by the Toruloe, or indirectly, by some substance formed by them; and, on the other hand, by the Thénardian doctrine, supported by Pasteur, according to which the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant</b> assimilates part of the sugar, and, in so doing, disturbs the rest, and determines its resolution into the products of fermentation.

Phospholipase D is an important player in many physiological processes, including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, receptor-mediated endocytosis, exocytosis, and cell migration.

6000|$|Having thus, {{as far as}} I can, {{discussed}} the general state of the question, it remains only that I should speak {{of some of those}} collateral results which have come in a very remarkable way out of the investigation of yeast. I told you that it was very early observed that the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant</b> consisted of a bag made up of the same material as that which composes wood, and of an interior semifluid mass which contains a substance, identical in its composition, in a broad sense, with that which constitutes the flesh of animals. Subsequently, after the structure of the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant</b> had been carefully observed, it was discovered that all plants, high and low, are made up of separate bags or [...] "cells," [...] as they are called; these bags or cells having the composition of the pure matter of wood; having the same composition, broadly speaking, as the sac of the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant,</b> and having in their interior a more or less fluid substance containing a matter of the same nature as the protein substance of the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant.</b> And therefore this remarkable result came out--that however much a plant may differ from an animal, yet that the essential constituent of the contents of these various cells or sacs of which the plant is made up, the nitrogenous protein matter, is the same in the animal as in the plant. And not only was this gradually discovered, but it was found that these semifluid contents of the plant cell had, in many cases, a remarkable power of contractility quite like that of the substance of animals. And about 24 or 25 years ago, namely, about the year 1846, {{to the best of my}} recollection, a very eminent German botanist, Hugo Von Mohl, conferred upon this substance which is found in the interior of the plant cell, and which is identical with the matter found in the inside of the yeast cell, and which again contains an animal substance similar to that of which we ourselves are made up--he conferred upon this that title of [...] "protoplasm," [...] which has brought other people a great deal of trouble since! I beg particularly to say that, because I find many people suppose that I was the inventor of that term, whereas it has been in existence for at least twenty-five years. And then other observers, taking the question up, came to this astonishing conclusion (working from this basis of the yeast), that the differences between animals and plants are not so much in the fundamental substances which compose them, not in the protoplasm, but in the manner in which the cells of which their bodies are built up have become modified. There is a sense in which it is true--and the analogy was pointed out very many years ago by some French botanists and chemists--there is a sense in which it is true that every plant is substantially an enormous aggregation of bodies similar to yeast cells, each having to a certain extent its own independent life. And there is a sense in which it is also perfectly true--although it would be impossible for me to give the statement to you with proper qualifications and limitations on an occasion like this--but there is also a sense in which it is true that every animal body is made up of an aggregation of minute particles of protoplasm, comparable each of them to the individual separate <b>yeast</b> <b>plant.</b> And those who are acquainted with the history of the wonderful revolution which has been worked in our whole conception of these matters in the last thirty years, will bear me out in saying that the first germ of them, to a very great extent, was made to grow and fructify by the study of the <b>yeast</b> <b>plant,</b> which presents us with living matter in almost its simplest condition.|$|R
