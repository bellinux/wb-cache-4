25|$|The two skew {{perpendicular}} opposite {{edges of}} a regular tetrahedron define a set of parallel planes. When one of these planes intersects the tetrahedron the resulting cross section is a rectangle. When the intersecting plane is {{near one of the}} edges the rectangle is long and skinny. When halfway between the two edges the intersection is a square. The aspect ratio of the rectangle reverses as <b>you</b> <b>pass</b> this halfway point. For the midpoint square intersection the resulting boundary line traverses every face of the tetrahedron similarly. If the tetrahedron is bisected on this plane, both halves become wedges.|$|E

He {{spoke with a}} high pitched voice that became even shriller when he became excited, so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West [...] "Tweety Bird".

Baylor once commented: [...] "Rumors are safe with you, Tweety Bird. <b>You</b> <b>pass</b> them on, but nobody can understand you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jessome became {{close friends}} with several wrestlers while touring with RAW among these being Lincoln Steen who {{claimed he was}} a {{practical}} joker. He once joked during an interview about learning [...] "a great deal of invaluable lessons while {{on the road with}} them, things like don't trust Duke MacIsaac with a sharpie if <b>you</b> <b>pass</b> out in Mike Hughes’ van." [...] In late-2001, Jessome injured his knee and remained out of action for several months. When RAW resumed operations early the following year, Jessome {{was one of the main}} stars to rejoin the promotion.|$|E
2500|$|The album's first single, {{the double}} A-side release [...] "Def Surrounds Us" [...] / [...] "I've Been Trying", was shipped to {{selected}} record {{stores in the}} United States and the United Kingdom and placed in other random European stores in September 2010 to coincide with Shadow's tour in the continent. Terming the practice as [...] "shop-placing", Shadow released the single in vinyl format beforehand because of his belief that [...] "downloads are so impersonal and soulless." [...] Each 12-inch vinyl copy of the single features its own distinct sleeve design, most of which originated from drawings by Shadow's children; some copies bear stickers reading [...] "Please add to the artwork before <b>you</b> <b>pass</b> it along." [...] The tracks were later made available to download on his official website on September 13, while a release to the iTunes Store followed a week later.|$|E

He was old, maybe 75 years old, {{but he had}} a strong [...] body. He struggled. He lay in front of the entrance to the home, by the door, and cried out. [...] "Only over my dead body will <b>you</b> <b>pass</b> through here! Over my corpse!" [...] One rioter wielded his knife over Abu-Shaker and yelled. 'I will kill you, traitor|!" [...] The knife struck him. Abu-Shaker's leg was cut. His blood was spilt. He did not emit any groans of pain. He did not shout, he only said.'Go and cut! I am not moving!" [...] The rioters consulted with each other: {{there was a moment of}} silence. Later we heard them leaving. We knew we had been saved. We wanted to bring our savior inside and bandage his wound and thank him. He refused and said that others might arrived and that his task has not ended yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters are remembered chiefly for {{the sociological}} {{significance}} of a lengthy roadtrip they took in 1964, traveling across the United States in a psychedelically painted school bus enigmatically labeled Further, and for the [...] "Acid Tests". Kesey believed that psychedelics were best used {{as a tool for}} transforming society as a whole, and believed that if a sufficient percentage of the population had the psychedelic experience then revolutionary social and political changes would occur. Therefore, they made LSD available to anyone interested in partaking - most famously through the [...] "electric kool-aid" [...] made available at a series of [...] "Acid Tests"; musical and multi-media events where participants were given [...] "acid", the street name for LSD. The tests were held at various venues in California, and were sometimes advertised with colorful crayoned signs asking [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>pass</b> the acid test?" [...] The first Acid Test was held in Palo Alto, California in November 1965. (LSD was legal in the United States until October 6, 1966.) The young psychedelic music band the Grateful Dead supplied the music during these events.|$|E
2500|$|Anjali ashram has {{a unique}} {{architectural}} design. [...] The entrance to the ashram is marked by wide open entrance without a gate(openness to all) which leads to Viswagopuram and an outer mandapa without walls meant for yoga, upadesa and dialogue meetings. [...] On {{both sides of this}} mandapa, there are two footpaths in a curved fashion taking you to the inner area directly. [...] If you walk directly through the mandapa, <b>you</b> <b>pass</b> through Swagata Nilaya - welcome abode and [...] reach another structure(Atma Purna Nivas) used for meditations and prayer meetings. [...] Then comes the residences for inamates like Dasavatara cottages, Star shaped Buildings, pyramidal buildings, Om Building, Yin Yang and the 24 hermitages. There are trees Peepal tree( [...] morning samdhya) Fig tree (Noon samdhya) and Banyan trees (for upadesas). Then comes the sanctum. [...] The last building is the sanctum sanctorum containing the Satcitananda Mandir within which the samadhi of the Founder is found.. [...] The small cottages for the inmates are built on either sides of the sanctum sanctorum. [...] There is a footpath that takes you directly to the other gate from the sanctum sanctorum. Beyond it is found Ashtabhagya gopuram inviting everyone either to sing kirtana (praises) or be in mauna(silence). Still beyond is the Navagrahavana forest of nine planets.|$|E

2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... <b>You</b> <b>pass</b> away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If <b>you</b> <b>pass,</b> I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
