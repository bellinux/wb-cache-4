500|$|According to Lennon in a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine: [...] "I {{was going home}} in the car, and Dick Lester suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in In His Own Write, {{but it was an}} off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>one</b> of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On 6 December 2012, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard {{delivered}} a hoax speech for {{the radio station}} triple J in which she declared [...] "My dear remaining fellow Australians; {{the end of the}} world is coming. Whether the final blow comes from flesh-eating zombies, demonic hell-beasts or from the total triumph of K-Pop, if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> thing about me it is this - I will always fight for you to the very end." [...] Radio announcer Neil Mitchell described the hoax as [...] "immature" [...] and pondered whether it demeaned her office.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the film's 2008 release, Hayden Christensen {{reflected}} {{on the possibility of}} one or more sequels: [...] "This has definitely been set up {{in a way that will}} allow for more films, and Doug has been careful to make sure that he's created characters that will have room to grow." [...] Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: [...] "The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>one</b> or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So we planned the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to leave room for the other two movies." ...|$|E

500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E
2500|$|Starr's {{statement}} was {{the inspiration for}} the title of the film, which in turn inspired the composition of the song.

I had used it in In His Own Write , but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>one</b> of those malapropisms.

2500|$|In March 2011, Brown {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} for a senate floor {{speech in which}} he cited the names of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin while he criticized Republican efforts in Ohio and Wisconsin to mitigate the power of public employee unions to negotiate with taxpayers. In his speech he said [...] "some of the worst governments that we've ever had, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> {{of the first things}} they did? They went after unions. Hitler didn't want unions, Stalin didn't want unions, Mubarak didn't want independent unions". Brown, however, added that he was not comparing the two situations. He later apologized for his speech.|$|E

"Sylvia, while I {{help our}} cousin to select and fasten up {{the books and}} prints she likes to take with her, will you run down into the garden and fill your prettiest basket with our finest grapes?
