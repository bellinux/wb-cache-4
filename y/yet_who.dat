But around 1810, it is believed, the {{original}} Federal style mantel on the main fireplace was replaced with the current one. The same 1882 history that assesses the house as being built around 1730 claims that the house had never passed out of the Martin family, although Edward Martin, the family member living in the area at that time, appeared to be living in the house Gottlieb Martin had built rather than the older one, which was recorded as being the residence of E.L. Traver, another farmer and member of a prominent local family of longstanding residence in the area.|$|E
25|$|Currently the Genovese {{crime family}} {{maintains}} five crews in New Jersey, each overseen by a caporegime. As {{of the beginning}} of 2010, these caporegimes (or captains) were Tino Fiumara (died of natural causes in 2010),Angelo Prisco (currently serving life sentence in prison), Ludwig Bruschi, Joseph Gatto (died of natural causes in 2010) and Silvio DeVita. In addition, the family appoints one person as the boss of the New Jersey faction, who directly oversees and maintains the crews. Since the 1990s and up until his death in 2010, Fiumara had been in control. Fiumara's influence in New Jersey was so strong that the Genovese family was considering him as a candidate to take over as boss of the entire family.

500|$|Symeon's teachings on {{the hearing}} of {{confession}} and the absolution of sins {{brought him into}} regular conflict with church authorities, particularly Archbishop Stephen. According to Symeon, only one who had the grace and direct experience of God was empowered by God to preach and absolve the sins of others. Stephen held the view that only ordained priests had that authority. Symeon's views were colored by his own spiritual father, Symeon the Studite, who was a simple monk, unordained, and <b>yet</b> <b>who</b> preached and gave absolution. In one of his Ethical Discourses Symeon went further and wrote that one should not give absolution without having first received the experience of God's grace: ...|$|E

[...] He went into some detail about Rimsky-Korsakov's epiphany and turnaround regarding musical training, and his efforts to remedy this situation for himself. Tchaikovsky then called Cui [...] "a talented dilettante" [...] whose music [...] "has no originality, but is clever and graceful"; Borodin a man who [...] "has talent, even a strong one, but it has perished through neglect ... and his technique is so weak that he cannot write a single line [...] without outside help"; Mussorgsky [...] "a hopeless case", superior in talent but [...] "narrow-minded, devoid of any urge towards self-perfection"; and Balakirev as one with [...] "enormous talent" [...] <b>yet</b> <b>who</b> had also [...] "done much harm" [...] as [...] "the general inventor of all the theories of this strange group".|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, [...] "'Are {{you going to}} let her do that?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact that}} Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her, <b>yet</b> <b>who</b> could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E

500|$|Ariel has {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the character, writing that [...] "Ariel is a fully realized female character who thinks and acts independently, even rebelliously, instead of hanging around passively while the fates decide her destiny". James Bernardelli of Reelviews wrote that Ariel {{can be viewed as}} a template for future Disney heroes and heroines. He also praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance for the character. In an article for Empire, Levi Buchanan stated that Ariel is [...] "powerful and self-reliant". Janet Maslin of The New York Times complimented Ariel, stating that [...] "teenagers will appreciate the story's rebellious heroine" [...] and went on to praise Ariel's wit. Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend wrote favorably about Ariel although he believed that the character was eroticized, stating, [...] "The scene where Ursula rips out her throat and gives her extremely naked parts below the waist is almost titillating, though I'm sure to little kids it seems entirely innocent". Similarly, reviewer John Puccio said that [...] "Ariel is perhaps the sexiest-looking animated character the Disney artists have ever drawn". In his review of Ariel's Beginning, James Plath of DVD Town wrote, [...] "For little girls, Ariel is one of the most beloved of Disney princesses, and she holds a warm place in the hearts of parents as well". Rory Aronsky of Film Threat praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance in Ariel's Beginning, writing that [...] "Benson adds more to the appeal of Ariel for older fans, and younger girls just learning about her, as well as generations not born <b>yet</b> <b>who</b> will undoubtedly become attached to her, ensuring the continued existence of the franchise".|$|E

I really only hit him twice, once on my feet, once on the ground. I didn't keep going. I didn't go after him after the ref tried to stop me, it was nothing like that. It was a reaction of mine to keep going until I was stopped—and you know, it did feel good though." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{one time}} it was widely {{believed}} that the Kol Nidre was composed by Spanish [...] "Marranos", Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity, <b>yet</b> <b>who</b> secretly maintained their original faith. This idea {{has been shown to}} be incorrect, as the prayer pre-dates this era (circa 15th century) by many centuries. However, this prayer was indeed used by the Marranos and it is possible that its great significance and wide usage derives from this persecution. As Kol Nidre clearly predated the Spanish Inquisition, it was supposed that it may have commenced during the Visigothic period in Spain (7th century), but this theory has serious weaknesses, such as its adoption by Jewish communities around the world, even in liturgical communities that did not experience such persecution. It may be that it was simply inspired by the Talmudic instructions about avoiding oaths.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 August, Christchurch {{businessman}} Paul Lonsdale {{announced his}} candidacy {{for a position}} as councillor in the Hagley-Ferrymead ward, and as mayor.

2500|$|Singelenberg's {{analysis}} of Jehovah's Witness preaching {{activity in the}} Netherlands {{in the wake of}} the 1975 prophetic failure showed a drop in the group's membership from mid-1976, a trend that was not reversed until 1980. It is thought that in the Netherlands about 5000 Witnesses either left the movement, were expelled, or became marginal and inactive members. Singelenberg suggested many of those expelled and shunned in the late 1970s had rebelled against the group's authority structure out of [...] "post-prophecy frustration"; post-1975 defectors were described to him and American researcher A. J. Brose as [...] "opportunists" [...] who had joined the group out of fear when the end seemed imminent, <b>yet</b> <b>who</b> lacked genuine commitment. One elder told Singelenberg: [...] "It was good that Armageddon did not take place. It separated the wheat from the chaff." [...] Researcher Mathew N. Schmalz suggested the leadership drew attention from the disconfirmation by requiring an even greater loyalty from members, a demand enforced with the expulsion of almost 30,000 Witnesses in 1978 alone. The insistence on doctrinal orthodoxy reached the highest levels of the organization in 1980, with many in the writing committee disfellowshipped.|$|E

2500|$|Queensland {{political}} scientist Rae Wear described Bjelke-Petersen as an authoritarian who treated democratic values with contempt and was intolerant and resentful of opposition, <b>yet</b> <b>who</b> also demonstrated a down-home charm and old-fashioned courtesies {{as well as}} kindness to colleagues. Those who worked closely with him described him as stubborn with a propensity to fly into rages {{in which he would}} [...] "rant and rave like Adolf Hitler", creating [...] "fantastic performances" [...] as he shook with rage, becoming increasingly incoherent. Many of his National Party colleagues were in terror of him on such occasions. Raised by migrant parents in spartan rural surroundings, he combined a strong work ethic with an ascetic lifestyle that was strongly shaped by his Lutheran upbringing. As a young man Bjelke-Petersen lived alone for 15 years in an old cow bail with a leaky bark roof and only the most basic of facilities. He had a lifelong habit of hard work and long days and while premier often slept for just four hours a night. He valued [...] "the School of Life, the hard knocks of life" [...] more than formal education and showed little respect for academics and universities, although he accepted an honorary doctorate of Laws from Queensland University in May 1985, prompting criticism from both students and staff. Wear dismissed Bjelke-Petersen's claim that he was a reluctant and accidental entrant into state politics, concluding that he [...] "seized opportunity whenever it presented and held tenaciously to power", and was later willing to use any device to remain premier. She said that although Bjelke-Petersen denied ever knowing anything about corruption, [...] "the evidence suggests this is untrue. He ignored it because to acknowledge its presence was to hand a weapon to his political enemies and because he was prepared to trade off corruption for police loyalty".|$|E
