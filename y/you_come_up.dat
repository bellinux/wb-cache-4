Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a [...] "briefcase full of cash" [...] to buy drugs.

500|$|The {{archive of}} Mari reports a plan between Zimri-Lim, {{the king of}} Carchemish and the king of Eshnunna (who made peace with Mari), to attack Qatna. Such an {{alliance}} {{could not have been}} realized without the participation of Yamhad, overlord of both Mari and Carchemish; in the end, the plan was not pursued and the tense relations between Qatna and Yamhad eased toward the last years of Yarim-Lim's reign. In a letter written to Zimri-Lim, Yarim-Lim I agreed to establish peace with Qatna if Amut-piʾel II were to come by himself to Aleppo, thus acknowledging the supremacy of Yamhad; no proof can be shown for a meeting taking place between the two kings. Just before his death in 1765 BC, Yarim-Lim called a meeting of his vassals, and Zimri-Lim traveled to Aleppo where he met messengers from Qatna and Hazor, indicating that Amut-piʾel II started recognizing the supremacy of Yarim-Lim, and that Hazor, Qatna's vassal, was now obeying Yamhad. Yarim-Lim's successor Hammurabi I arranged a peace with Qatna that probably did not require the Qaṭanean king to visit Aleppo personally, but indicated Qatna's acceptance of Yamhad's superiority. This apparent yielding seems a mere formality as Qatna continued its aspirations for power, as became clear in its behavior during the Elamite invasion of Mesopotamia in year ten of Zimri-Lim's reign. An Elamite messenger reached Emar and sent three of his servants to Qatna; Hammurabi I of Yamhad learned of this and sent troops to intercept them on their return. The servants were captured and questioned, revealing that Amut-piʾel II told them to tell their monarch that [...] "The country is delivered to <b>you,</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to me! if <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up,</b> you will not be taken by surprise." [...] The Qaṭanean king also sent two messengers to Elam, but they were probably captured in Babylon.|$|E

500|$|Howarth said of {{starring}} on a soap opera, [...] "Every actor at {{one time}} passes through daytime. I wouldn't have said yes to the offer if I didn't want to stay a while on daytime." [...] He added, [...] "I don't crave fame. It's kind of goofy. I didn't {{want to be a}} public figure. I wanted to be an actor, not a movie star.

2500|$|Proponents {{believe that}} the FairTax would have {{positive}} effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system. [...] Some of these include social inequality, economic inequality, financial privacy, self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, burden of proof, and due process. [...] Proponents state the FairTax would remove the exemptions and deductions that discriminate against gays, singles, childless couples, and others based on spending and lifestyle choices. [...] The principles of an income tax regarding individual liberty are also argued by critics. Frank Chodorov wrote [...] "... <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> {{with the fact that}} it gives the government a prior lien on all the property produced by its subjects." [...] The government [...] "unashamedly proclaims the doctrine of collectivized wealth.... That which it does not take is a concession." [...] This situation is no different from the current system of income taxation, in which the government has a [...] "prior lien" [...] on all labor undertaken by its subjects.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Limerick became Ireland's inaugural National City of Culture, with a {{wide variety}} of artistic and {{cultural}} events occurring at various locations around the city. The Limerick City Gallery of Art on Pery Square is the city's chief venue for contemporary art exhibitions. Theatres include the Limetree Theatre, Mary I; the University Concert Hall and the Millennium Theatre, LIT all in the city. Others include the Friar's Gate in Kilmallock and the Honey Fitz in Lough Gur. The city has an active music scene, which has produced bands such as The Cranberries. The Limerick Art Gallery and the Art College cater for painting, sculpture and performance art of all styles. Limerick is also home to comedians The Rubberbandits, D'Unbelievables (Pat Shortt and Jon Kenny) and Karl Spain. Its most famous acting son is Richard Harris. The city is the setting for Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes and the film adaptation. A limerick is a type of humorous verse of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme: the poem's connection with the city is obscure, but the name is generally taken to be a reference to Limerick city or County Limerick, sometimes particularly to the Maigue Poets who were based in Croom and its environs, and may derive from an earlier form of nonsense verse parlour game that traditionally included a refrain that included [...] "Will [...] <b>you</b> <b>come</b> (<b>up)</b> to Limerick? Riverfest is an annual summer festival held in Limerick. The festival was begun in 2004. Other festivals include the Knights of Westfest in Newcastle West, Fleadh by the Feale in Abbeyfeale and the Ballyhoura International Walking Festival. The west of the county is known for its Irish music, song and dance and is part of the Sliabh Luachra area of traditional Irish music along the borders of County Cork, County Kerry and County Limerick]].|$|E
