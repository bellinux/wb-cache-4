5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
25|$|When {{an engine}} on a multi-engine {{aircraft}} fails, the thrust distribution on the aircraft becomes asymmetrical, {{resulting in a}} <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> {{in the direction of}} the failed engine. A sideslip develops, causing the total drag of the aircraft to increase considerably, resulting in a drop in the aircraft's rate of climb. The rudder, and to a certain extent the ailerons via the use of bank angle, are the only aerodynamic controls available to the pilot to counteract the asymmetrical thrust <b>yawing</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Failure of {{a single}} inboard engine, from a set of four, has a much smaller effect on controllability. This is because an inboard engine {{is closer to the}} aircraft's centre of gravity, so the lack of <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> is decreased. In this situation, if speed is {{maintained}} at or above the published VMCA, as determined for the critical engine, safe control can be maintained.|$|E
40|$|Basically, {{there are}} two main {{techniques}} to control the vehicle <b>yaw</b> <b>moment.</b> First method is the indirect <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control, which works on the basis of active steering control (ASC). The second one being the direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control (DYC), which is based on either the differential braking or the torque vectoring. An innovative idea for the direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control is introduced by using an active controller system to supervise the lat-eral dynamics of vehicle and perform as an active <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control system, denoted as the stabilizer pendulum system (SPS). This idea has further been developed, analyzed, and implemented in a standalone direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control system, as well as, in an inte-grated vehicle dynamic control system with a differential braking <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> controller. The effectiveness of SPS has been evaluated by model simulation, which illustrates its superior performance especially on low friction roads. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4027499]...|$|R
40|$|Direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> {{control is}} an {{effective}} means to enhance vehicle stability and handling. The majority of the latest direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control works employ sliding mode control to generate the target <b>yaw</b> <b>moment.</b> In this paper, a new sliding mode-based direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control method is proposed for electric and hybrid vehicles equipped with independent motors. This method employs a novel switching function design to simultaneously track the desired yaw rate and vehicle side-slip.

40|$|Rally {{drivers are}} known by their driving skills, {{controlling}} the vehicle beyond the linear region and generating impressive <b>yaw</b> <b>moments</b> {{to maximize the}} vehicle agility. In this study, the Moment Method Diagram and Beta Method representations are used to show the maximum achievable <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> generated by {{the front and rear}} tires. A new maneuverability map is proposed to bypass the limitations imposed by the steady state assumptions, based on the wheel slip – <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> representation. Furthermore, a simple strategy is developed to determine the sequence of inputs required to achieve a target <b>yaw</b> <b>Moment.</b> Finally, a finite state machine is modelled in a two track vehicle model to evaluate the proposed methodology...|$|R
25|$|If {{an engine}} fails during taxiing or takeoff, the thrust <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> will force the {{aircraft}} {{to one side}} on the runway. If the airspeed is not high enough and hence, the rudder-generated side force is not powerful enough, the aircraft will deviate from the runway centerline and may even veer off the runway. The airspeed at which the aircraft, after engine failure, deviates 9.1m from the runway centerline, despite using maximum rudder but {{without the use of}} nose wheel steering, is the minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG).|$|E
25|$|Heavier {{aircraft}} are more stable and {{more resistant to}} yawing moments, and therefore have lower VMCAs. The longitudinal centre of gravity affects the VMCA as well: the further from the tail it is, the lower the minimum control speed, because the rudder {{will be able to}} provide a larger <b>yawing</b> <b>moment,</b> and so it is easier to counteract the imbalance in thrust. The lateral centre of gravity also has an effect: the nearer the inoperative engine it is, the larger the moment of the working engine, and so the more force the rudder has to apply. This means that if the lateral centre of gravity shifts towards the inoperative engine, the aircraft's VMCA will increase. The thrust of most engines depends on altitude and temperature; increasing altitude and higher temperatures decrease thrust. This means that if the air temperature is higher and the aircraft has a higher altitude, the force of the operative engine will be lower, the rudder will have to provide less counteractive force, and so the VMCA will be lower. The bank angle also influences the minimum control speed. A small bank angle away from the inoperative engine is required for smallest possible sideslip and therefore lower VMCA. Finally, if the P-factor of the working engine increases, then its <b>yawing</b> <b>moment</b> increases, and the aircraft's VMCA increases as a result.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} tail or vertical stabilizer of a multi-engine aircraft plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust <b>yawing</b> <b>moment.</b> This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the {{vertical tail}} must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum bank angle of 5° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by FAR.|$|E

A two-passenger, all-wheel-drive urban electric vehicle (AUTO 21 EV) with four direct-drive in-wheel motors has been designed and developed at the University of Waterloo. A 14 -degree-of-freedom model of this vehicle {{has been used to}} develop a genetic fuzzy <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> controller. The genetic fuzzy <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> controller determines the corrective <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> that is required to stabilize the vehicle, and applies a virtual <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> around the vertical axis of the vehicle. In this work, an advanced torque vectoring controller is developed, the objective of which is to generate the required corrective <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> through the torque intervention of the individual in-wheel motors, stabilizing the vehicle during both normal and emergency driving maneuvers. Novel algorithms are developed for the left-to-right torque vectoring control on each axle and for the front-to-rear torque vectoring distribution action. Several maneuvers are simulated to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed advanced torque vectoring controller, and the results are compared to those obtained using the ideal genetic fuzzy <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> controller.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} electric vehicles with multiple motors {{is how to}} control the individual drivetrains {{in order to achieve}} measurable benefits in terms of vehicle cornering response, compared to conventional stability control systems actuating the friction brakes. This paper presents a direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> controller based on the combination of feedforward and feedback contributions for continuous yaw rate control. When the estimated sideslip exceeds a pre-defined threshold, a sideslip-based <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> contribution is activated. All <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> contributions are entirely tunable through model-based approaches, for reduced vehicle testing time. The purpose of the controller is to continuously modify the vehicle understeer characteristic in quasi-static conditions and increase yaw and sideslip damping during transients. Skid-pad, step-steer and sweep steer tests are carried out with a front-wheel-drive fully electric vehicle demonstrator with two independent drivetrains. The experimental test results of the electric motor-based actuation of the direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> controller are compared with those deriving from the friction brake-based actuation of the same algorithm, which is a major contribution of this paper. The novel results show that continuous direct <b>yaw</b> <b>moment</b> control allows significant "on-demand" changes of the vehicle response in cornering conditions and to enhance active vehicle safety during extreme driving maneuvers...|$|R
