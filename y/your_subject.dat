2500|$|<b>Your</b> <b>subject</b> had, in the past, {{depended}} on your heavenly power {{to give my}} minor contributions. [...] I am old and my bones are weak, but if Your Imperial Majesty does not look down on me, I am nevertheless willing to go despite my sickness.|$|E
2500|$|Termination: If {{you don't}} want <b>your</b> <b>subject</b> {{to know what}} you are doing, you simply {{distract}} their attention, usually by some appropriate remark, and casually terminate. Sometimes they remark, [...] "What did you say? I got absentminded there for a moment and wasn't paying attention to anything." [...] This is slightly distressing to the subjects and indicative of the fact that their attention was so focused and fixated on the peculiar hand stimuli that they were momentarily entranced so they did not hear what was said.|$|E

2500|$|Whenever Shi Yi {{recommended}} {{talents to}} Sun Quan, he only pointed out {{their strengths and}} said nothing about their weaknesses. Sun Quan thus chided him for not saying anything about their weaknesses and not making judgments about them. In response, Shi Yi said, [...] "Your Majesty, as <b>your</b> <b>subject,</b> my duty is to perform my role well. I am always worried about not being competent in my role. (I keep my opinions about their weaknesses to myself because) I don't want to let my ignorance and limited knowledge affect Your Majesty's judgment about them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, while Song {{carried the}} long-abandoned and now-reinstituted titles of Left Prime Minister (左丞相, Zuo Chengxiang) and Da Shitu (大師徒, a more {{magnified}} {{form of the}} title of Situ, one of the Three Excellencies) in the new Southern Tang administration, he was not given real responsibilities. [...] He became so displeased that when an imperial edict was read out loud, honoring him referred to him as [...] "Our friend from when we wore civilian clothing," [...] he loudly replied, [...] "When <b>your</b> <b>subject</b> was wearing civilian clothing, Your Imperial Majesty was a prefect; now that Your Imperial Majesty is the Son of Heaven, you no longer need this old subject." [...] After making the comment, he went home and expected punishment. [...] Emperor Liezu issued another edict thanking him but not giving him additional responsibilities. [...] Unsure {{what to do to}} regain the emperor's trust, he submitted petitions requesting that Yang Pu (whom Emperor Liezu continued to honor as a retired emperor and allowed to live at the palace in Guangling, while Southern Tang's capital was set at Jinling (i.e., Sheng Prefecture)) be moved out of Guangling and be given a lesser title, so that people would not be tempted to rebel to restore Wu, and that the marriage between Emperor Liezu's daughter Princess Yongxing and Yang Pu's son Yang Lian the Duke of Hongnong (the former crown prince) be severed. [...] Emperor Liezu did not accept either proposal. [...] When Song again objected in 938 that, as Left Prime Minister, he should be allowed to participate in the governance, Emperor Liezu gave the excuse that the office building had not been built yet. [...] Meanwhile, apparently accepting one of Song's ideas after all (and with Yang Pu himself being uncomfortable remaining at Guangling as a former emperor), Emperor Liezu moved Yang Pu and the former Wu imperial family from Guangling to Run Prefecture and put them under secure guard. [...] Still, when Song subsequently again complained about being separated from the emperor by wicked people, Emperor Liezu became publicly angry, causing Song to again return to his home to wait for punishment. [...] When others spoke on his behalf, Emperor Liezu commented, [...] "Song Qiqiu is talented but does not know what is appropriate." [...] He sent Xu Jingtong (whose name would soon thereafter be changed to Li Jing by this point and who had, as the emperor's oldest son, been created the Prince of Wu, as Emperor Liezu had himself restored his birth name of Li in order to claim legitimate succession from Tang Dynasty, apparently under a suggestion initially made by Song) to Song's mansion to recall him to the government, and Song subsequently returned. [...] Subsequently, Emperor Liezu accepted another suggestion of Song's — that when a Khitan emissary arrived, the emissary was treated with great honors, {{but as soon as the}} emissary headed north, back across the Huai River (i.e., now in Later Jin territory), assassins were sent to kill him, so that the killing could be blamed on Later Jin. [...] It was said that this incident did bring frictions between Later Jin and Khitan (whose aid was critical in Later Jin's establishment). [...] Meanwhile, it was also at Song's proposal (although apparently a proposal driven by Emperor Liezu himself) that when Emperor Liezu established the seven imperial ancestral temples, while most of the temples were dedicated to Emperor Liezu's biological Li ancestors, Emperor Liezu's adoptive father Xu Wen was given one of the three most honored temple positions (and given the temple name of Yizu), along with Tang's first two emperors Emperor Gaozu and Emperor Taizong.|$|E
