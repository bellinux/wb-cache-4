It follows the story of Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe), a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> southern England who has {{to move to the}} North after her father decides to leave the clergy. The family struggles to adjust itself to the industrial town's customs, especially after meeting the Thorntons, a proud family of cotton mill owners who seem to despise their social inferiors. The story explores the issues of class and gender, as Margaret's sympathy for the town mill workers clashes with her growing attraction to John Thornton (Richard Armitage).|$|E

5|$|With the {{uncertainty}} {{caused by the}} Utah War, the Church called off all European emigration for 1858. In 1859 one handcart company crossed the plains. The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to Saint Joseph, Missouri, after which they went by riverboat to Florence, where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. When the 1859 company reached Fort Laramie, they discovered their food was running dangerously short, so they cut back on rations. When they reached Devil's Gate the last flour was distributed. Emigrant Ebeneezer B. Beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough mountain men fed the hungry emigrants. One of the mountain men then asked a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> the company to stay with him, which the tired woman agreed to do. (William Atkin recalled another {{version of the story}} in which two young women married two mountain men.) The hunger worsened when expected supplies were not available when they reached the Green River. Three days later wagons from Utah carrying provisions finally rescued the famished emigrants.|$|E

Willard visited Washington, D.C., in October 1847 to meet with Tayloe, who subsequently leased the six buildings to him for use as a hotel. Willard combined the six structures into one building in 1850, added two additional stories, and called the new business the Willard Hotel.|$|E

Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage.

This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last.

Several candidates were presented to him including one <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E

40|$|While <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> {{relatively}} affluent backgrounds tend {{to abort}} their pregnancies, <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> relatively deprived backgrounds tend to keep theirs. It {{has been suggested}} that this socio-economic-pregnancy outcome relationship is due to some form of subcultural acceptance of teenage motherhood existing among disadvantaged groups. The aim of this thesis was to assess how <b>young,</b> never pregnant <b>women</b> <b>from</b> diverse social and economic backgrounds perceive teenage pregnancy and early motherhood, and to consider whether these perceptions could, at least in part, explain this relationship. 248 women (mean age 15. 6) completed a questionnaire which requested information on their lives, experiences, expectations about their futures, and their views of teenage pregnancy and early motherhood. Six discussion groups were then held with selected sub-groups of these women to explore their views in greater detail. As the thesis had an additional aim of exploring the process embarked upon by women following the confirmation of a teenage pregnancy, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight women who were currently pregnant, had recently entered motherhood, or had an abortion. It was evident that <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> relatively deprived backgrounds may be more likely than their relatively affluent peers to predict they would keep a teenage pregnancy, and may anticipate early motherhood as having fewer implications for their current situation and futures. It was also evident that <b>young</b> <b>women</b> may view this role as beneficial and plan their pregnancies. However, it was clear that <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> diverse backgrounds may view early motherhood in a predominately negative light, and a range of factors may influence the outcome of a teenage pregnancy. Thus, whilst there was evidence to support the subcultural acceptance hypothesis, it did appear that this acceptance is one which would maintain a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> on the pathway to motherhood rather than encouraging her to enter this role...|$|R
