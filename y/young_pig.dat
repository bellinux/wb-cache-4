The species is considered a good gamefish and can be taken by fish or squid baits as well as various patterns of lure and fly. When taken from the water, the fish often 'grunt' in similar manner to a <b>young</b> <b>pig.</b> They are considered an excellent table fish despite being {{known to be a}} host to parasitic infection in some regions.|$|E

Through a <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> named Squealer, Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder {{with the promise of}} easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project. Once Snowball becomes a scapegoat, Napoleon begins to purge the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who {{was nowhere to be found}} during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Jones', while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle. [...] "Beasts of England" [...] is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes a}} method for monitoring the condition of <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> by measuring their water intake. Water flow-meters and micro computers have been installed in 4 production units for <b>young</b> <b>pigs,</b> located on 3 different farms in Denmark. Water consumption data was aggregated into 1 hour intervals. The pigs showed a very stabile diurnal drinking pattern {{as long as they}} were healthy whereas the pattern often changed when the pigs were affected by a disease. A method using a state-space model in conjunction with a Cusum control chart is presented as a tool for on-line monitoring of <b>young</b> <b>pigs,</b> based on their water consumption. By an example it is shown that an outbreak of a disease (diarrhoea) can be detected by the monitoring method approx. one day before physical signs are seen on the pigs. ...|$|R

40|$|Our {{results in}} a {{previous}} study indicated that the portal absorption of intragastrically fed alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) was limited in <b>young</b> <b>pigs.</b> Our aim was to quantify the net portal absorption, first-pass metabolism, and whole-body flux of enterally infused AKG. In study 1, we quantified the net portal nutrient absorption in <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> (n = 9) given an intraduodenal infusion of milk replacer [10 mL/(kg. h) ] and either saline (control) or 930 mu mol/(kg. h) AKG for 4 h. In study 2, we quantified the luminal disappearance of a duodenal AKG bolus in <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> (n = 7). In study 3, we quantified the whole-body kinetics of C- 13 -AKG metabolism when infused either enterally (n = 9) or intravenously (n = 9) in <b>young</b> <b>pigs.</b> In study 1, {{when compared with the}} control group, enteral AKG infusion increased (P < 0. 01) the arterial (13. 8 +/- 1. 7 vs. 27. 4 +/- 3. 6 mu mol/L) and portal (22. 0 +/- 1. 4 vs. 64. 6 +/- 5. 9 mu mol/L) AKG concentrations and the net portal absorption of AKG [19. 7 +/- 2. 8 vs. 95. 2 +/- 12. 0 mu mol/(kg. h) ]. The mean fractional portal appearance of enterally infused AKG was 10. 23 +/- 1. 3 %. In study 2, the luminal disappearance of AKG was 663 mu mol/(kg. h), representing 63 % of the intraduodenal dose. In study 3, the whole-body C- 13 -AKG flux [4685 +/- 666 vs. 801 +/- 67 mu mol/(kg. h) ] was higher (P < 0. 05) when given enterally than intravenously, but (CO 2) -C- 13 recovery was not different (37. 3 +/- 1. 0 vs. 36. 2 +/- 0. 7 % dose). The first-pass splanchnic C- 13 -AKG utilization was similar to 80 %, of which 30 % was oxidized to (CO 2) -C- 13. We conclude that the intestinal absorption of AKG is limited in <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> largely due to substantial first-pass gastrointestinal metabolism...|$|R

60|$|The {{language}} of the vizcacha is wonderful for its variety. When the male is feeding he frequently pauses to utter a succession of loud, percussive, and somewhat jarring cries; these he utters in a leisurely manner, and immediately after goes on feeding. Often he utters this cry in a low grunting tone. One of his commonest expressions sounds like the violent hawking of a man clearing his throat. At other times he bursts into piercing tones that may be heard a mile off, beginning like the excited and quick-repeated squeals of a <b>young</b> <b>pig,</b> and growing longer, more attenuated, and quavering towards the end. After retiring alarmed into the burrows, he repeats at intervals a deep internal moan.
