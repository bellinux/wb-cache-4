25|$|Australian born Tony Smith {{took charge}} of England in 2008 and his first game was against France in Toulouse where his Lions won 56–8. In his second game England were missing St Helens and Leeds Rhinos players but the team still created history with a record 74–0 win over Wales in Doncaster. It was England's biggest win they {{recorded}} over Wales since 1978. Smith {{has been living in}} England since he first arrived to play for Workington in 1996 and he controversially became a neutralised British citizen on 8 September 2008 in Huddersfield. It was World Cup year and he announced his ambitions that he wanted England to win their first World Cup since 1972 when Great Britain represented the country at the event. In the event they were placed in Group A alongside hosts Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. England faced a scare in their opening game against Papua New Guinea as the Lions were trailing 16–12 at halftime but they did go on to win the game. They were humiliated in their second game against the hosts suffering their biggest defeat to date, beating their 43-point margin against New Zealand eight years ago. In their final pool game against New Zealand they produced a much better performance but for only 28 minutes as they gave up a 24–8 lead to lose 24–36. Before and during the match England were accusing New Zealand of being soft, however after the match media outlets were calling England the biggest losers of the tournament. Controversy also occurred before the game kicked off, when England refused to face New Zealand's haka challenge. Smith said 'In some cultures poking <b>your</b> <b>tongue</b> out at others could be seen as insulting and the Kiwis pushed things too far by crossing into England’s side of halfway.' They took on New Zealand again in the semi-final. This time they never had the lead over the Kiwis as they lost the match by 10 points. After rumours Smith would be sacked from his position, the RFL announced they'd keep faith in Smith for the remainder of his contract. The World Cup players took the blame for their performances.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone named [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as {{the third}} best song of 2011. The writer concluded, [...] "Brit {{delivers}} the Apocalypse Now of Eurotrash electrotrance disco songs, as that throbbing pulse builds to a pure drop-the-bomb chorus. And that 'whoa-ho-ho' choir sounds like Cher leading an aircraft carrier full of gay sailors." [...] The song was also named {{as the third}} best single of 2011 by Billboard, and commented that it is [...] "Britney's most immediate single since 'Toxic'." [...] Sam Lansky of PopCrush considered [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] the best pop song of 2011, writing, [...] "2011 was already Year of the Spears by January, when Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' topped the charts — but [...] had something even better up her sleeve, the crackling dancefloor barnstormer 'Till the World Ends,' penned by rowdy popstrel Kesha and produced by monster hitmaker Dr. Luke. It's a gargantuan party song with provocative lyrics (“This kitten got <b>your</b> <b>tongue</b> tied in knots,” anyone?), throbbing synths, and a thrillingly euphoric hands-in-the-air chant-along chorus — and there wasn't a more exuberant pop song this year." [...] Digital Spy also considered the track as the best song of 2011, naming it [...] "Britney's best track since 'Toxic'" [...] and commenting, [...] "judging from its chart position, it's also her most underrated hit." [...] The Village Voices Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as the seventh best song of 2011, tied with Lana Del Rey's [...] "Video Games".

500|$|In August 2013, Cyrus {{became the}} subject of {{widespread}} media attention and public scrutiny following a controversial performance and duet with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards at Barclays Center in New York City. The performance began with Cyrus performing [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] in bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage and Cyrus stripped down to a skin-colored two-piece outfit. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch. An article published in The Hollywood Reporter described the performance as [...] "crass" [...] and [...] "reminiscent of a bad acid trip". The performance was described by XXL critic B. J. Steiner as a [...] "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment", while the BBC said Cyrus stole the show with a [...] "raunchy performance". The performance generated 306,100 tweets per minute on Twitter, breaking the record for the most tweeted-about event {{in the history of the}} social network; the previous record, held by the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show featuring Beyoncé, generated 268,000 tweets per minute. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone magazine recognized published a criticism of the presentation of Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards 2013, “It's Miley, Bitch: The Tongue That Licked the World”. The article praises the performance of the singer said: [...] " [...] Miley was the one star in the room who truly understood what the MTV Video Music Awards are all about — waggling <b>your</b> <b>tongue,</b> grabbing your crotch, rocking a foam finger, going to third with the Care Bears, twerking and shrieking and acting out America's goriest pop-psycho nightmares. She showed up Robin Thicke as one uptight douche, though he helped by dressing as the world's edgiest Foot Locker manager. Miley stole the night, which is why the nation is still in recovery today. Thanks, Miley." [...] According to Forbes, Cyrus' performance resulted in a gain of over 213,000 Twitter followers, 226,000 likes on Facebook, and 90,000 downloads of her new promotional single, [...] "Wrecking Ball", within days of the controversial performance. This amounted to a total 112% increase in Cyrus' social media activity.|$|E

2500|$|To gain wider {{recognition}} for their message, Shyamsundar {{had the idea}} of meeting the Beatles and asking them to introduce the Hare Krishna mantra, or Maha Mantra, into their songs. In October 1968, Mukunda and Shyamsundar went to the band's Apple Records offices, on Savile Row, where Peter Asher subsequently passed a recommendation on to George Harrison, the Beatle most interested in Indian philosophy and culture. The following month, the devotees' public appearances in Oxford Street received national attention in London's Times newspaper. The article carried a quote from Gurudas that read: [...] "Hare Krishna is a chant that sets God dancing on <b>your</b> <b>tongue.</b> Try chanting 'Queen Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth' and see the difference." ...|$|E

Krugman later said that he was [...] "temperamentally unsuited for that kind of role. You have to be very good at people skills, biting <b>your</b> <b>tongue</b> when people say silly things." [...] In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Krugman added, [...] "you have to be reasonably organized...

[...] Further, [...] "the picture galleries at Rome disappointed me quite". Eventually he found plenty to admire, but the accumulation of monuments of art in one place was almost too much for him, and there were also too many distractions.
