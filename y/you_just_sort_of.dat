[...] "I wasn't a science prodigy or a math prodigy ... I had a prodigious life, living in a grown-up world when I was a child. But I think my abilities were about perceptiveness and they were about examining psychology and examining people and relationships. And I had instincts about adult stories that I shouldn't have known anything about. That's very different to all those really cool prodigies that can play piano. But I wouldn't change it for anything. I found, at a very young age, even though it's not my personality to be an actor, a way of expressing myself that allowed me to not be so lonely." [...] -Foster on her early success Foster also acted in another film nominated for the Palme d'Or in 1976, Bugsy Malone. The British musical parodied films about Prohibition Era gangsters by having all roles played by children; Foster appeared in a major supporting role as a star of a speakeasy show. Its director Alan Parker was impressed by her, saying that [...] "she takes such an intelligent interest in the way the film is being made that if I had been run over by a bus I think she was probably the only person on the set able to take over as director." [...] She gained several positive notices for her performance: Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "at thirteen she was already getting the roles that grown-up actresses complained weren't being written for women anymore", Variety described her as [...] "outstanding", and Vincent Canby of The New York Times called her [...] "the star of the show". Foster's two BAFTAs were awarded jointly for her performances in Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone. Her third film release in spring 1976 was the independent drama Echoes of a Summer, which had been filmed two years previously. The New York Times named Foster's performance as a terminally ill girl the film's [...] "main strength" [...] and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune stated that she [...] "is not a good child actress; she's just a good actress", although both reviewers otherwise panned the film.|$|E

[...] John Barrett of the John Barrett Salon at Bergdorf Goodman said that Sassoon [...] "was the creator of sensual hair.

5000|$|Adam Duritz said, {{about this}} song: [...] "I {{read this book}} in college when I was at Berkeley called “Henderson, the Rain King.” And the main {{character}} in the book was kind of this big, open-wound of a person, Eugene Henderson, he <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> bled all over everyone around him. For better or for worse, full of joy, full of sorrow, he just made a mess of everything. And when I wrote the song years later, it didn’t really {{have anything to do}} with the book except the book had kind of become a totem for how I felt about creativity and writing-that it was just this thing where <b>you</b> <b>just</b> took everything inside <b>of</b> <b>you</b> and <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> noise sprayed it all over everything, and not to worry too much about it. You try and craft it but not to be self-conscious about it, in any case. And, it’s <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a song about everything that goes into writing, all the feelings, everything that makes you want to write, makes you want to maybe pick up a guitar and do it, and express yourself because it’s full of all the doubts and the fears about how I felt about my life at that time. And also the feeling that I really deserved something better than what I had accomplished up to that point. I think it *is* <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a religious song about the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> undefinable thing inside you or out there somewhere that makes you write, makes you create, makes you do any kind of art form, you know?

You were a memory that seemed to personify all the other memories of the best time of my life. You were the goddess of old associations. Then I met you in London, and it was different. I wanted you--you! I didn't want you because you recalled old times and were associated with dead happiness, I wanted you! I knew I loved you directly you spoke to me at the theatre that night of the fire. I loved your voice and your eyes and your smile and your courage. And then you told me you were engaged. I might have expected it, but I couldn't keep my jealousy from showing itself, and you snubbed me as I deserved. But now ... things are different now. Everything's different, except my love." ...|$|R

The latest rumor going around now is that we’ll get off the 23 rd regardless of whether we’ve gotten the required extra thirty hours in or not, but it’s strictly a rumor. In the army they fly thick and fast. Another on[e] has it that we’re going to Kansas for advanced, but that’s strickly [sic] stuff. No one knows where we’re going, but I imagine we’ll stay in the East. Gosh I hope it’s not too far away from you, darling, it’s bad enough being only fifty miles away. I’m glad Woody can make it this weekend. I don’t know what time I’m getting off Saturday, but the ground display is open at nine in the morning, so I imagine I’ll have all Saturday off. If I do you can come up early. When I find out I’ll call Mom, and she can get in touch with you. I sure hope this week goes fast and doesn’t drag like the last one. That was the worst yet. The more I see of you, hon, the longer the time seems that we’re apart; the shorter it seems when we’re together. Did you go to work today? I hope your ankle is better, hon. You should have stayed off of it this weekend, you’ve got to take it easy with something like that. I can just see me trying to keep you in bed on a weekend. Hmm—come to think of it, sounds like a pretty good job to me, er—how’s your cold? Well darling, I’ve got some homework to do.

6000|$|We {{were talking}} of this {{the other night}} {{at the house of}} that lady whom Mrs. Makely invited me {{specially}} to meet on Thanksgiving-day. It happened then, as it often happens here, that although I was asked to meet her, I saw very little of her. It was not so bad as it sometimes is, for I have been asked to meet people, very informally, and passed the whole evening with them, and yet not exchanged a word with them. Mrs. Makely really gave me a seat next Mrs. Strange at table, and we had some unimportant conversation; but there was a lively little creature vis-à-vis of me, who had a fancy of addressing me so much of her talk that my acquaintance with. Mrs. Strange rather languished through the dinner, and she went away so soon after the men rejoined the ladies in the drawing-room that I did not speak to her there. I was rather surprised, then, to receive a note from her a few days later, asking me to dinner; and I finally went, I am ashamed to own, more from curiosity than from any other motive. I had been, in the mean time, thoroughly coached concerning her by Mrs. Makely, whom I told of my invitation, and who said, quite frankly, that she wished Mrs. Strange had asked her, too. [...] "But Eveleth Strange wouldn't do that," [...] she explained, [...] "because it would have the effect of paying me back. I'm so glad, on your account, that you're going, for I do want you to know at least one American woman that you can unreservedly approve of; I know you don't begin to approve of me; and I was so vexed that you really had no chance to talk with her that night you met her here; it seemed to me as if she ran away early just to provoke me; and, to tell you the truth, I thought she had taken a dislike to you. I wish I could tell <b>you</b> <b>just</b> what <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a person she is, but it would be perfectly hopeless, for you haven't got the documents, and you never could get them. I used to be at school with her, and even then she wasn't like any of the other girls. She was always so original, and did things from such a high motive, that afterwards, when we were all settled, I was perfectly thunderstruck at her marrying old Bellington Strange, who was twice her age and had nothing but his money; he was not related to the New York Bellingtons at all, and nobody knows how he got the name; nobody ever heard of the Stranges. In fact, people say that he used to be plain Peter B. Strange till he married Eveleth, and she made him drop the Peter and blossom out in the Bellington, so that he could seem to have a social as well as a financial history. People who dislike her insisted that they were not in the least surprised at her marrying him; that the high-motive business was just her pose; and that she had jumped at the chance of getting him. But I always stuck up for her--and I know that she did it for the sake of her family, who were all as poor as poor, and were dependent on her after her father went to smash in his business. She was always as high-strung and romantic as she could be, but I don't believe that even then she would have taken Mr. Strange if there had been anybody else. I don't suppose any one else ever looked at her, for the young men are pretty sharp nowadays, and are not going to marry girls without a cent, when there are so many rich girls, just as charming every way; you can't expect them to. At any rate, whatever her motive was, she had her reward, for Mr. Strange died within a year of their marriage, and she got all his money. There was no attempt to break the will, for Mr. Strange seemed to be literally of no family; and she's lived quietly on in the house he bought her ever since, except when she's in Europe, and that's about two-thirds of the time. She has her mother with her, and I suppose that her sisters and her cousins and her aunts come in for outdoor aid. She's always helping somebody. They say that's her pose, now; but, if it is, I don't think it's a bad one; and certainly, if she wanted to get married again, there would be no trouble, with her three millions. I advise you to go to her dinner, by all means, Mr. Homos. It will be something worth while, in every way, and perhaps you'll convert her to Altrurianism; she's as hopeful a subject as I know." ...|$|R
