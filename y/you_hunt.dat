50|$|And were <b>you</b> <b>hunted</b> {{out by the}} police? - No, {{they have}} never interfered. They have always been kind to me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>hunted</b> me {{with all}} the pack, [...] Too blind, too blind, to see By no wild hope of force or greed [...] Could you make sure of me.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the idea}} of <b>you</b> <b>hunting</b> a man," [...] replied Peter. [...] "Your heart is all right, Lightfoot, but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one. Big as you are I wouldn't fear you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That though <b>you</b> <b>hunt</b> the Christian man [...] Like a hare on the hill-side, [...] The hare {{has still}} more heart to run [...] Than you have heart to ride.|$|E
6000|$|One look at Jerry's face showed {{everybody}} that Jerry, big as he was, {{was afraid of}} Billy Mink. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>hunt</b> when you are on land?" [...] asked Old Mother Nature.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing whatever. I {{scarcely}} knew {{of their}} existence until <b>you</b> <b>hunted</b> them out for me and found they were alive. But I'm going to know them, and study them, and the one that's most capable and deserving shall have my property." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ventura has {{frequently}} {{referred to his}} military career in public statements and debates.

6000|$|... "I'll help <b>you</b> <b>hunt</b> for Tom," [...] {{said the}} bluff farmer. [...] "I know {{he must be}} somewhere around. Don't you worry so," [...] for {{he could see that}} Nellie had been crying.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{there is}} left of her might {{be found at the}} bottom of the Patuxent, if <b>you</b> <b>hunted</b> long enough," [...] I replied, feeling a bit saddened by the loss of the pungy, and not having had time before to think very much about her fate.|$|R
6000|$|LYDIA. [...] Oh, hide thee, I implore: [...] I cannot see <b>thee</b> <b>hunted</b> {{down like}} this. [...] There is my room. Conceal thyself therein. [...] Quick, I command. [...] [He {{goes into the}} room. [...] With horror I foresee, [...] Lydia, that never lied, must lie for thee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, Jim, I {{have been}} on board, and counted the guns. That is the craft I swam off to, nearly two years ago. <b>You</b> <b>hunted</b> for her, then, you know; but I suppose she had gone {{into one of the}} ports. But that is her, I can almost swear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>hunt</b> hens," [...] asked Tom Chase, who was {{mixing the}} salad--he {{was one of}} those men who seemed to do {{everything}} a shade better than anyone else--"for amusement or by your doctor's orders? Many doctors, I believe, insist on it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why do <b>you</b> <b>hunt</b> and persecute me, God help me!' {{said the}} old man turning to his grandson. 'Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here? How often am I to tell you that my life is one of care and self-denial, and that I am poor?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've read it," [...] {{admitted}} Sarah, [...] "and I {{know where}} it is. You might perhaps find it, if <b>you</b> <b>hunted</b> long enough, but it isn't worth your while.

5000|$|You {{should not}} kill living creatures, nor should <b>you</b> admire <b>hunting</b> or fishing.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I thought you would be feeling, Tom. But {{it was just as}} well that your first watch should be a short one, without much chance of an ambush being on foot; and I knew that if your eyes deceived <b>you,</b> <b>Hunting</b> Dog was there. Next time you won't feel so nervous; that sort of thing soon passes off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am heartily {{obliged to}} him," [...] said the baron. [...] "But, as I was saying before, {{these sort of}} things never came in my way. If I {{remember}} right, my father would have thought I was mad had I talked of going out hunting. Did <b>you</b> <b>hunt,</b> Staveley?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Reckon I couldn't say fer sure. But he was sore at Hardman, an' {{the funny}} thing is he wasn't sore till some time after Hardman left these parts. Mebbe he learned somethin'.

6000|$|... "Bravely," [...] the Northman replied. [...] "As soon as I {{sniffed the}} salt {{air of the}} sea my {{strength}} seemed to return to me. My wound is well-nigh healed; but the joint has stiffened, and my leg will be stiff {{for the rest of}} my life. But that matters little. And now tell me all your adventures. We have heard from the messenger you sent how shrewdly <b>you</b> <b>hunted</b> out Sweyn's hiding-place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Man, Man," [...] it exclaimed, [...] "you {{say that}} I {{finished}} you. But {{what did you}} do to me? You shot me. Look at the marks upon my back. You coursed me with your running dogs. <b>You</b> <b>hunted</b> me with your hounds. You dragged me out of the sea into which I swam to escape you by death, and threw me living to the pack," [...] and the Hare stopped exhausted by its own fury.|$|R
60|$|A little packet {{will come}} to <b>you</b> from <b>Hunt</b> and Roskell's, almost at the same time, I think, as this note.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose because I can't {{imagine you}} {{anything}} of the sort," [...] she declared. [...] "You see, <b>you</b> <b>hunt</b> and play polo, and do everything which the ordinary Englishmen do. Then one meets you everywhere. I think, Count von Hern, that you are much too spoilt, for one thing, to take life seriously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what, Captain Aylmer; I don't know what pack <b>you</b> <b>hunt</b> with, but I'll bet you a five-pound note that we killed more foxes last year than you did;--that is, taking {{three days a}} week. Nine-and-twenty brace {{and a half in}} a short season I don't call poor at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "BADEN-BADEN (no date). Lot of vociferous Americans {{at breakfast}} this morning. Talking AT everybody, while pretending to talk among themselves. On their first travels, manifestly. Showing off. The usual signs--airy, easy-going {{references}} to grand distances and foreign places. 'Well GOOD-by, old fellow--if I don't run across you in Italy, <b>you</b> <b>hunt</b> {{me up in}} London before you sail.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, sir," [...] {{continued}} the doctor, [...] "since I now know there's such a fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and night. I'm {{not a doctor}} only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath of complaint against you, if it's only {{for a piece of}} incivility like tonight's, I'll take effectual means to have <b>you</b> <b>hunted</b> down and routed out of this. Let that suffice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much, {{this time}} o' year, lad. But <b>you</b> might <b>hunt</b> a bear--if he cornered you!" [...] And Tom Dillon laughed at his little joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may go to}} work at once," [...] said Mr. Sumner. [...] "I {{would advise}} <b>you</b> to <b>hunt</b> up a boarding-house after {{business}} hours, three o'clock." ...|$|R
