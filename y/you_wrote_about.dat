60|$|Washington, Oct. 11, 1863. DEAR FRIEND[18]--Your {{letters were}} both received, and were indeed welcome. Don't mind my not {{answering}} them promptly, for {{you know what}} a wretch I am about such things. But you must write just as often as you conveniently can. Tell me all about your folks, especially the girls, and about Mr. A. Of course you won't forget Arthur,[19] and always when you write to him send my love. Tell me about Mrs. U. and the dear little rogues. Tell Mrs. B. she ought to be here, hospital matron, only it is a harder pull than folks anticipate. <b>You</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> Emma;[20] she thinks she might and ought to come as nurse for the soldiers. Dear girl, I know it would be a blessed thing for the men to have her loving spirit and hand, and whoever of the poor fellows had them would indeed think it so. But, my darling, it is a dreadful thing--you don't know these wounds, sickness, etc., the sad condition in which many of the men are brought here, and remain for days; sometimes the wounds full of crawling corruption, etc. Down in the field-hospitals in front they have no proper care (can't have), and after a battle go for many days unattended to.|$|E
60|$|Washington, Oct. 6, 1863. DEAREST MOTHER--Your {{letter and}} George's came safe--dear brother George, one don't more than {{get a letter}} from him before {{you want to hear}} again, {{especially}} as things are looking pretty stormy that way--but mother, I rather lean to the opinion that the 51st is still in Kentucky, at or near where George last wrote; but of course that is only my guess. I send George papers and occasionally letters. Mother, I sent him enclosed your letter before the last, though you said in it not to tell him how much money he had home, as you wanted to surprise him; but I sent it. Mother, I think Rosecrans and Burnside will be too much for the Rebels down there yet. I myself make a great acc't of Burnside being in the midst of friends, and such friends too--they will fight and fight up to the handle, and kill somebody (it seems as if it was coming to that pass where we will either have to destroy or be destroyed). Mother, I wish you would write soon after you get this, or Jeff or Mat must, and tell me about Andrew, if there is anything different with him--I think about him every day and night. I believe I must come home, even if it is only for a week--I want to see you all very much. Mother, I know you must have a great deal to harass and trouble you; I don't mean about Andrew personally, for I know you would feel to give your life to save his, and do anything to nourish him, but about the children and Nancy--but, mother, you must not let anything chafe you, and you must not be squeamish about saying firmly at times not to have little Georgy too much to trouble you (poor little fellow, I have no doubt he will be a pleasanter child when he grows older); and while you are pleasant with Nancy you must be sufficiently plain with her--only, mother, I know you will, and Jeff and Mat will too, be invariably good to Andrew, and not mind his being irritable at times; it is his disease, and then his temper is naturally fretful, but it is such a misfortune to have such sickness--and always do anything for him that you can in reason. Mat, my dear sister, I know you will, for I know your nature is to come out a first-class girl in times of trouble and sickness, and do anything. Mother, you don't know how pleased I was to read what <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> little Sis. I want to see her so bad I don't know what to do; I know she must be just the best young one on Long Island--but I hope it will not be understood as meaning any slight or disrespect to Miss Hat, nor to put her nose out of joint, because Uncle Walt, I hope, has heart and gizzard big enough for both his little nieces and as many more as the Lord may send.|$|E

Whether your Lordship recollects {{an account}} {{that you have}} [...] given to the Court of Directors, in your letter of the 2d of [...] August, 1789, {{concerning}} the state of those provinces?--A. I [...] really could not venture to be particular as to any letter I may [...] have written so long since, as I have brought no copies of my [...] letters with me from India, having left them at Bengal when I went [...] to the coast.--Q. Whether your Lordship recollects, in any letter [...] that <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> the 2d of August, 1789, paragraph 18, any [...] expressions to this effect, namely: 'I am sorry to be obliged to [...] say, that agriculture and internal commerce have for many years [...] been gradually declining, and that at present, excepting the class [...] of shroffs and banians, who reside almost entirely in great towns, [...] the inhabitants of these provinces are advancing hastily to a [...] general state of poverty and wretchedness':--whether your Lordship [...] recollects that you have written a letter to that effect?--A. I [...] cannot take upon me to recollect {{the words of a}} letter that I have [...] written five years ago, but I conclude I must have written to that [...] effect.--Q. Whether your Lordship recollects that in the [...] immediately following paragraph, the 19th, you wrote to this [...] effect: 'In this description' (namely, the foregone description) 'I [...] must even include almost every zemindar in the Company's [...] territories, which, though it may have been partly occasioned by [...] their own indolence and extravagance, I am afraid must also be in a [...] great measure attributed to the defects of our former system of [...] management.' (Paragraph 20.) 'The settlement, in conformity to [...] your orders, will only be made for ten years certain, with the [...] notification of its being your intention to declare it a perpetual, [...] an unalterable assessment of these provinces, if the amount and the [...] principles upon which it has been made should meet with your [...] approbation':--whether your Lordship recollects to have written [...] something to the effect of these two last paragraphs, as well as of [...] the first?--A. I do recollect that I did write it; but in that [...] letter I alluded to the former system of annual assessments.--Q. [...] Whether your Lordship recollects that you wrote, on or about the [...] 18th of September, 1789, in one of your minutes, thus: 'I may [...] safely assert that one third of the Company's territory in [...] Hindostan is now a jungle, inhabited only by wild beasts: will a [...] ten years' lease induce any proprietor to clear away that jungle, [...] and encourage the ryot to come and cultivate his lands, when at the [...] end of that lease he must either submit to be taxed ad libitum [...] for the newly cultivated lands, or lose all hopes of deriving any [...] benefit from his labor, for which perhaps by that time he will [...] hardly be repaid?'--whether your Lordship recollects a minute to [...] that effect?--A. I perfectly recollect to have written that [...] minute.--Q. Now with respect to a letter, dated November the 3d, [...] 1788, paragraph 38, containing the following sentiments: 'I shall [...] therefore only remark in general, that, from frequent changes of [...] system or other reasons, much is wanting to establish good order [...] and regulations in the internal business of the country, and that, [...] from various causes, by far the greatest part of the zemindars, and [...] other landholders and renters, are fallen into a state much below [...] that of wealth and affluence. This country, however, when the [...] fertility of its soil, and the industry and ingenuity of its [...] numerous inhabitants are taken into consideration, must [...] unquestionably be admitted {{to be one of the}} finest in the world; [...] and, with the uniform attention of government to moderation in [...] exaction, and to a due administration of justice, may long prove a [...] source of great riches both to the Company and to Britain.' [...] (Paragraph 39.) 'I am persuaded, that, by a train of judicious [...] measures, the land revenue of these provinces is capable in time of [...] being increased; but, consistent with the principles of humanity, [...] and even those of your own interest, it is only by adopting [...] measures for the gradual cultivation and improvement of these waste [...] lands, and by a gentle and cautious plan for the resumption of [...] lands that have been fraudulently alienated, that it ought ever to [...] be attempted to be accomplished. Men of speculative and sanguine [...] dispositions, and others, either from ignorance of the subject, or [...] with views of recommending themselves to your favor, may [...] confidently hold forth specious grounds to encourage you to hope [...] that a great and immediate accession to that branch of your revenue [...] might be practicable. My public duty obliges me to caution you, in [...] the most serious manner, against listening to propositions which [...] recommend this attempt; because I am clearly convinced, that, if [...] carried into execution, they would be attended with the most [...] baneful consequences.' (Paragraph 40.) 'Desperate adventurers, [...] without fortune or character, would undoubtedly be found, as has [...] already been too often experienced, to rent the different districts [...] of the country at the highest rates that could be put upon them; [...] that [but?] the delusion would be of a short duration, and the [...] impolicy and inhumanity of the plan would, when perhaps too late [...] for effectual remedy, become apparent by the complaints of the [...] people and the disappointments at the treasury in the payments of [...] the revenue, and would probably terminate in the ruin and [...] depopulation of the unfortunate country':--whether your Lordship [...] recollects to have written anything to that effect about that [...] time?--A. I perfectly recollect having written the extracts that [...] have been read." ...|$|E
