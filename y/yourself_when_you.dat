To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When you sit down and you're watching it, and you see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these things because you're essentially making the film for <b>yourself.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> start showing it to an audience, that then influences how you feel about the film." ...|$|E
500|$|... "La La Land" [...] {{is one of}} six {{songs on}} Lovato's debut album Don't Forget (2008) that she co-wrote with the Jonas Brothers. Lovato {{said that it was}} [...] "important" [...] to have them on her album, because [...] "I mean, just look at how {{successful}} they are. I would love to have their input anytime, because they're obviously doing something right." [...] The band also contributed backing vocals and played the guitar to the song. It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums. In an interview, Lovato explained that the song is about being <b>yourself</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are surrounded by [...] "the pressures of fame". She said, [...] "You get to Hollywood {{and a lot of times}} people can try to shape you and mould you into what they want you to be. The song is just about keeping it real and trying to stay yourself when you're out in Hollywood." [...] "La La Land" [...] was released as the album's second and final single on April 10, 2009. It was later released in the United Kingdom on May 31, 2009, with the new song [...] "Behind Enemy Lines".

2500|$|Belle is an {{influential}} proponent {{of discipline and}} control in parkour, saying, [...] "Precision is all about being measured," [...] and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master. [...] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time {{but it does not}} mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, {{you have to do it}} at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to <b>yourself.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times." [...] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart {{departed}} from Steampacket in March 1966, with Stewart {{saying he had}} been sacked and Auger saying he had quit. Stewart then joined a somewhat similar outfit, Shotgun Express, in May 1966 as co-lead vocalist with Beryl Marsden. The other members included Mick Fleetwood and Peter Green (who {{would go on to}} form Fleetwood Mac), and Peter Bardens. Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy [...] "I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round", before disbanding. Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket, and said [...] "I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people's music. I think you can only start finding <b>yourself</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> write your own material." [...] By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice.|$|E

60|$|HECTOR. Oh, don't explain. We understand. You have {{a couple}} of {{thousand}} pounds in exchequer bills, 50,000 shares worth tenpence a dozen, and half a dozen tabloids of cyanide of potassium to poison <b>yourself</b> with <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are found out.

5000|$|The {{novel is}} written in a first-person narrative, and Ellory uses {{descriptive}} prose extensively.

6000|$|... "I love my uncle," [...] was her reply: [...] "I owe {{him some}} {{kindness}} (such {{it was meant}} for at least), and I will leave you to draw his picture <b>yourself,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know him better." ...|$|E

60|$|There was {{one thing}} more that I had to ask of you, {{relating}} to a poor lost creature {{who is in the}} room with us at this moment. But, oh, I am so weary!
