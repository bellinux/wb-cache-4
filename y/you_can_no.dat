500|$|Stuart {{was known}} for working {{without the aid of}} sketches, {{beginning}} directly upon the canvas, which was very unusual for the time period. His approach is suggested by the advice which he gave to his pupil Matthew Harris Jouett: [...] "Never be sparing of colour, load your pictures, but keep your colours as separate as <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> <b>No</b> blending, tis destruction to clear & beatiful effect." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E
5000|$|You {{know this}} show is exploitation. The CW knows it. Maybe even Katiba and Alazzio know it, deep down in their bodies. Katiba Ketubah is a car crash, and {{everybody}} looks at a car crash, right? It's human nature. Yes, except that if you play that card, {{you also have to}} realize that human nature comes with the capacity to draw a line, to hold fast against the dehumanization and incremental tearing down of the religious fabric, even if this never-ending onslaught of reality television suggests that's a losing effort. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> say <b>no</b> to visual exploitation. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> say <b>no</b> to The CW. And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say <b>no</b> to Katiba Ketubah. Somebody has to.|$|R

500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer hide just because you have a government job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Duke of Cambridge {{served as}} {{commander-in-chief}} for 39 years. Although {{he was deeply}} concerned about the welfare of soldiers, he earned {{a reputation for being}} resistant to doctrinal change and for making promotions based upon an officer's social standing, rather than merit. [...] Under his command, the British Army became a moribund and stagnant institution, lagging far behind its continental counterparts. [...] There were no new ideas. [...] It is said that he rebuked one of his more intelligent subordinates with the words: [...] "Brains? I don't believe in brains! You haven't any, I know, Sir!" [...] He was equally forthright on his reluctance to adopt change: [...] "There is a time for everything, and the time for change is when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer help it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Steve Hewitt {{and the rest}} of the band had become tense during the recording of Meds and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that [...] "Being in a band is very much like being in a marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. To say that you don't love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you've been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from your relationship and that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer live under the same roof, so to speak". Olsdal commented [...] "We couldn't go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn't have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. It all went wrong during the Meds tour. [...] There was no communication between us. Brian and I are one, but at some point we even didn't talk to each other anymore. We realised Placebo was dying. To be able to go on, things had to change." [...] According to Hewitt, [...] "Alex Weston, our manager, [...] called me in to the office and said I was not in the band anymore. And that's it. I was thrown out". Hewitt claims that it was [...] "very hurtful" [...] and [...] "disappointing" [...] to have been ejected in this way after being in the band for over a decade. Early in 2008 Hewitt founded the band Love Amongst Ruin, switching to guitar and singing lead vocals. In August 2012 he became the drummer of the reformed Six by Seven.|$|E

6000|$|Scrope got up, {{walked slowly}} to the window, {{clasping}} {{his hands behind his}} back, and turned. His manner still retained much of his episcopal dignity. [...] "I am sorry.
