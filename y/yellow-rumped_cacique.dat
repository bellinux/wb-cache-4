40|$|International audienceA {{field study}} has been {{conducted}} in French Guiana since 2005, by recording “short songs” of male <b>yellow-rumped</b> and red-rumped <b>caciques.</b> This is a rare field study on Neotropical birdsong, focusing on the Icterid family, a very good model to study the evolution of birdsong in relation with sociality. Short songs are involved in male-male communication in these two colonial multi-male / multi-female species. We found dialects characterized by time and frequency parameters in male short songs in both species. This is the first description for such song and dialect in male red-rumped caciques. We analyzed the temporal evolution of these songs in the two species, over seven years at the same localities. We find dialects each year but the short songs’ frequency and time parameters vary from year to year. Playback experiments were also made at different colonies in 2012 for <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>caciques.</b> We observed {{in reaction to the}} stimuli (familiar or unfamiliar song) neither alarm calls or flight, nor aggressive behavior toward the loudspeaker. We discuss the results in relation with hypotheses for the evolution of bird dialects, with a special focus on social influences on song plasticity...|$|R
50|$|For seabirds, colonies on islands have {{an obvious}} {{advantage}} over mainland colonies {{when it comes}} to protection from terrestrial predators. Other situations can also be found where bird colonies avoid predation. A study of <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>caciques</b> in Peru found that the birds, which build enclosed, pouch-like nests in colonies of up to one hundred active nests, situate themselves near wasp nests, which provide some protection from tree-dwelling predators such as monkeys. When other birds came to rob the nests, the caciques would cooperatively defend the colony by mobbing the invader. Mobbing, clearly a group effort, is well-known behavior, not limited to colonial species; the more birds participating in the mobbing, the more effective it is at driving off the predator. Therefore, it has been theorized that the larger number of individuals available for vigilance and defense makes the colony a safer place for the individual birds nesting there. More pairs of eyes and ears are available to raise the alarm and rise to the occasion.|$|R
50|$|The <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>cacique</b> {{has benefited}} from the more open habitat created by forest {{clearance}} and ranching. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The song of {{the male}} <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>cacique</b> is a {{brilliant}} mixture of fluting notes with cackles, wheezes and sometimes mimicry. There are also many varied calls, and an active colony can be heard from a considerable distance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>cacique</b> (Cacicus cela) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} New World family Icteridae. It breeds in much {{of northern}} South America from Panama and Trinidad south to Peru, Bolivia and central Brazil. However, they have been sighted {{as far north as}} Nayarit state in Mexico.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFunctional {{analysis}} of bird song dialects {{have been the}} object of extensive researches. Several hypotheses emerged from these investigations, among which the social adaptation hypothesis : using the same dialectal variant as social partners would facilitate the integration of newcomers into a social group. The social dialect could also constitute a local population or group marker. The social adaptation model predicts changes in bird vocalizations in response to social changes. In a previous study, we found local dialectical variants in French Guyanian populations of <b>yellow-rumped</b> and red-rumped <b>caciques,</b> two congeneric species of Icterid birds, both living in large multi-males / multi- females groups. We found dialects characterized by time and frequency parameters in male short songs involved in social communication. The social adaptation hypothesis predicts a progressive change in local dialectal vocalization types. In the present study, we analyze the temporal evolution of timing and frequency parameters of male short songs in these two species, over five years at the same localities...|$|R
50|$|The Tropical Encounters Exhibit {{was created}} in 2005. Animals in this exhibit include Arrau River turtles, bay-headed tanagers, black pacu, {{turquoise}} honeycreepers, emerald tree boas, golden-headed manakins, leafcutter ants, mata matas, paradise tanagers, peacock bass, red-capped cardinals, red-tailed catfish, rufous-crowned tanagers, silver-beaked tanagers, stingrays, sunbitterns, swallow tanagers, turquoise tanagers, violaceous euphonia, <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>cacique,</b> yellow-spotted Amazon river turtles, green anaconda, and saffron finches.|$|E
5000|$|The male is {{in average}} 28 cm long and weighs about 104 g, {{with the female}} 23 cm long and {{weighing}} 60 g approximately. The <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>cacique</b> is a slim bird, with a long tail, blue eyes, and a pale yellow pointed bill. It has mainly black plumage, apart from a bright yellow rump, tail base, lower belly and wing [...] "epaulets". The female is duller black than the male, and the juvenile bird resembles the female, but has dark eyes and a brown bill base.|$|E
50|$|This tyrant flycatcher {{is found}} in savannah and other semi-open habitat with large trees. It gets its name {{because it does not}} build its own nest, but appropriates the domed or {{enclosed}} nests of other, often far larger, bird species, such as <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>cacique</b> or crested oropendola. Once the persistence of the flycatchers has driven the rightful owners away, their eggs are removed, and the female flycatcher lays up to four, but usually two, black-streaked brown eggs. She incubates these on her own for 16 days to hatching, with a further 18-20 days to fledging.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is popular}} with birdwatchers {{due to its}} {{abundance}} of bird species; some 525 bird species are found here. Pipeline Road extends for 17.5 km north-south through the park and passes through old-growth and secondary forest. Pipeline Road {{is one of the}} best places to see tropical birds in the Americas, with a bird species list exceeding 400. Birds regularly seen along Pipeline Road include double-toothed kite, slaty-backed forest-falcon, orange-chinned parakeet, brown-hooded parrot, blue-headed parrot, red-lored parrot, squirrel cuckoo, white-necked jacobin, violet-bellied hummingbird, crowned woodnymph, blue-chested hummingbird, white-tailed trogon, gartered trogon, black-throated trogon, black-tailed trogon, slaty-tailed trogon, black-mandibled toucan, keel-billed toucan, collared aracari, black-cheeked woodpecker, cinnamon woodpecker, crimson-crested woodpecker, white-whiskered puffbird, broad-billed motmot, rufous motmot, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, fasciated antshrike, black-crowned antshrike, checker-throated antwren, dot-winged antwren, white-flanked antwren, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced antthrush, southern bentbill, brownish twistwing, olivaceous flatbill, ruddy-tailed flycatcher, bright-rumped attila, purple-throated fruitcrow, red-capped manakin, blue-crowned manakin, golden-collared manakin, bay wren, song wren, gray-headed tanager, white-shouldered tanager, red-throated ant-tanager, blue-black grosbeak, scarlet-rumped cacique, and <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>cacique.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>yellow-rumped</b> <b>cacique</b> (Cacicus cela cela), {{a colonial}} {{polygynous}} Icterid widespread inSouth America, {{is a model}} of reference for demonstrating colony dialects in songbirds, asshown by Feekes (1977, 1982) on the ‘short song’ (‘Cela-song’) in this species. Furtherstudies, e. g. in European starling (Hausberger, 1986), showed the presence of individualsignature and dialects at different spatial scales (local and regional). This work presents ourfield study of the vocal repertoire of C. c. cela and Cacicus haemorrhous haemorrhous inFrench Guyanian metapopulations. One to three males per colony were followed by eyeduring a one-period observation and their vocalizations digitally recorded. Instead of thetraditional visual categorization of songs on sonagrams, we used a series of objective andreproducible measures of frequencies and timing. Results showed vocal sharing of the shortsong at colony level in C. c. cela and at local level in C. h. haemorrhous. These results agreewith those found by Trainer (1989) on another subspecies: C. cela vitellinus in Panama. While Feekes (1977, 1982) proposed that song sharing at colony level could work has agroup-closing process in C. c. cela (the ‘password hypothesis’), our observations rathersuggest song imitation in socially open groups...|$|E
