They offered her a free flight to New York for the interview {{and as part of}} the trip she was taken to the Shawangunks, a famous nearby climbing area.

5|$|The {{allure of}} class respectability is another {{constant}} in Les Chouans, {{as it is}} for Balzac's entire oeuvre. Marie's birth as an illegitimate child contributes to her position {{at the start of the}} novel. The ups and downs of her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's {{apartment}} {{and she tells}} him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E

25|$|Although the Kuomintang had an {{advantage}} in numbers of men and weapons, controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the long war with Japan and in-fighting among various generals. They were also losing the propaganda war to the Communists, with a population weary of Kuomintang corruption and <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> peace.|$|E
25|$|While {{creating}} Still Life, Dimitris Papaioannou {{thought a}} lot about the human crave for meaning, and about the absurdity of the human condition, rooted in matter but <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> spirit. He was thinking about Albert Camus, and about work as meaning in and of itself. At the same time, Dimitris Papaioannou concentrated deeply on simplicity, interaction with real materials, and silence — musically-composed silence.|$|E
25|$|But {{all this}} was short-lived. In 1913 the plot {{moved on to the}} next tenant - a {{successful}} entrepreneur, the owner of the Aquarium Garden Friedrich Thomas. He built a two-storey stone Variety Theatre “Maxim’s” adjoining the mansion from the garden. The entrance to the theatre was from Kozitskiy Lane. The theatre featured light-minded shows, one-act plays, operettas, comic musical interludes and short ballets. The trouble years that followed the events of 1905 aroused an incredible <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> shows and entertainments.|$|E

25|$|The one failing {{of their}} {{marriage}} was that it remained childless. Head adored children, {{as can be seen}} in his poems and his poetry also gives considerable insight into Head's great desire for a child of his own. In his poem , for example, he takes on the perspective of a woman <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> 'the fierce joy of motherhood' and presents a sympathetic view of her plight. Head's deeply personal poems also could be said to suggest that Ruth had at some point been pregnant (maybe more than once) and perhaps even to term.|$|E
25|$|Sobhraj {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be a psychopath. He was driven to murder as a means to sustain his adventurous lifestyle. This, as well as his cunning and cultured personality, made him a celebrity long before his release from prison. He enjoyed the attention, charging large amounts of money for interviews and film rights. He {{has been the subject of}} four books and three documentaries. Sobhraj's return to India, where he was still eagerly sought by authorities, is believed to be the result of his <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> attention and overconfidence in his own intellect.|$|E

According to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres the white cross stands for the <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom.|$|E

25|$|An {{analysis}} of Israeli textbooks in 2000 by the Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace (CMIP) {{found that there}} was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. Islam, Arab culture and the Arabs' contribution to human civilization were presented in a positive light. No book called for violence or war, and many books reportedly expressed the <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> peace between Israel and the Arab countries. However, some textbooks within the Orthodox Jewish community were found to contain prejudices towards Palestinians and the Arabs were often held responsible for Israel's wars.|$|E
25|$|Life in the Iron Mills {{is set in}} a {{small village}} whose center is {{industrial}} work, especially that of the iron mills. It is described as a polluted and oppressive village, inhabited by laborers, mostly “masses of men, with dull, besotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes”. The novella's protagonist is Hugh Wolfe, an iron mill laborer who possesses artistic talent and a spiritual desire for higher forms of pleasure and fulfillment. Despite the hopefulness of Wolfe’s artistic drive, he becomes the story's tragic hero, as his <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> a better life leads to his imprisonment and ultimate death.|$|E

Riff and Bernardo agree to meet for a War Council at Doc's, a drug store which is considered neutral ground, but meanwhile, an infatuated and happy Tony finds Maria's building and serenades her outside her bedroom ("Maria"). She appears on her fire escape, and the two profess their love for one another ("Tonight").

25|$|During {{the period}} of post-war austerity, U Hla {{continued}} to publish using any kind of paper {{that he could get}} hold of including coloured matchbox packing paper and used office paper with printing on one side. He would also still manage to send his new books as gifts, about 200 on each occasion, to all his friends in Rangoon at a time when communication lines and road and rail transportation had all but broken down. It was in 1945 that he launched the fortnightly Ludu (The People) Journal with his wife as assistant editor. The following year saw the launch of the Ludu Daily newspaper and subsequently the couple {{came to be known as}} Ludu U Hla and Ludu Daw Amar. Their incisive political commentaries and analyses made a significant contribution to the country's <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> independence and unified struggle against colonial rule. Their publications had never carried advertisements for alcohol, drugs to enhance sexual performance or gambling, nor racing tips, salacious affairs and gossip. U Hla had to be persuaded to make an exception of film advertisements for the survival of the paper.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of March 21–23, John Brown Baldwin of the Valley’s Augusta County made a Unionist speech, {{beginning}} with a defense of “African slavery, as it exists in Virginia, is a right and a good thing…” But {{he believed that the}} idea that the election of someone to the Presidency could justify secession “as a direct assault upon the fundamental principles of American liberty”. The three branches of government with their Constitutional checks and balances protect against “encroachment upon the liberties of the minority of the people or upon the rights of the States.” And even with the withdrawal of Southern delegations, the remaining Republican majority passed a Constitutional Amendment for ratification prohibiting the Federal Government to interfere with slavery in the states in any respect. “...the great masses of people, leaving out the politicians and fanatics of both sections, have this day an earnest <b>yearning</b> <b>for</b> each other, and for peace and Union with each other…” Baldwin sought a conference of border states to adopt the Peace Convention recommendations that he believed would cause the Confederate states to separately return to the Union.|$|E
