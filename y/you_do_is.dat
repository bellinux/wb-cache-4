500|$|In New Zealand, {{the game}} was banned on December 11, 2003, with {{possession}} deemed an offence. Bill Hastings, the Chief Censor, stated [...] "it's a game where the only thing <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> kill everybody you see ... You have to at least acquiesce in these murders and possibly tolerate, or even move towards enjoying them, which is injurious to the public good." [...] The game was similarly [...] "refused classification" [...] in Australia on September 28, 2004 by the Classification Review Board, despite having already been on sale {{for almost a year}} at the time with the classification of MA15+ (restricted to ages 15 and over).|$|E
500|$|Mars {{says that}} the trust that he, Levine and Lawrence have built in seven years of working {{together}} is essential. He added [...] "I may say, 'Yo, I like this song,' but if Ari or Phil say it's the corniest shit they've ever heard, I trust them. And the other way around. We all know when we're onto something...We also know when something's not jelling. And that's the thing you pray you will always have. You can't believe that everything <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> hot." [...] Nevertheless, Levine points to the musical influences {{the three of them}} share completing his idea [...] "It's about finding ways to mix the classic we all love with modern songs. That's why people connect to the music on multiple levels: It's familiar-sounding but new-classic songwriting and instrumentation with a little twist".|$|E
500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{directed}} by Wim Wenders, produced by Debbie Mason, and edited by Jerry Chater. The video was filmed in Berlin {{over the course of}} three days, primarily in black-and-white but with some sequences in colour. It contains cameos of some of the actors who appeared in Faraway, So Close!, including Otto Sander, as well as Wenders' nephew. Several scenes are taken directly from Faraway, So Close! and Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, which also served as the principal inspiration for the video's premise. Wenders noted that [...] "making a video is really a very different ballgame. You have the script, so to speak, because you have the song, and everything <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> in order to help the song shine... You want to make that song look as good as possible and sound as good as possible and as interesting as possible." [...] Several shots depict the band members standing on the statue of Victoria, a monument {{at the top of the}} Berlin Victory Column; a model of the angel was created for those scenes. Leftover military equipment from the Cold War, including the Soviet MiG, were included in the background.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MistaJam, Tempah cites Dizzee Rascal and So Solid Crew as influences for the album, who've influenced him since his childhood. He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E

The coalition controlled 92% of the seats in Parliament. In 2005, Mahathir stated that [...] "I believe that the country should have a strong government but not too strong. A two-thirds majority like I enjoyed when I was Prime Minister is sufficient but a 90% majority is too strong. ... We need an opposition to remind us if we are making mistakes.

You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Vegas eRace {{was heavily}} {{promoted}} {{in the days}} before the event. The series's first champion Nelson Piquet Jr. (NextEV NIO) spoke of his excitement for the eRace and believed Formula E combining the worlds of simulation and real-life racing was a positive step: [...] "I think this is going to be really fun with all the drivers together." [...] Andretti driver Robin Frijns revealed his interest in how he would compare against sim drivers: [...] "I don’t really know what to expect, maybe the sim drivers or the fans are really good, maybe not, we don’t know. If all <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> race on simulators at home, then maybe they are pretty good!” Hans-Jürgen Abt, the team principal of Audi Sport ABT, felt the Vegas eRace was [...] "a good example" [...] of how the series was moving farther than several other sporting championships: [...] "For more than six decades, we have been racing in motorsport on all of the world’s race tracks – but this event is a total first for us." ...|$|E

He told the latter, [...] "According to official records, there are 300,000 troops under my command now. (Ji Province) is indeed a large province." [...] Cui Yan replied, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state of}} chaos and the Nine Provinces are divided, while the Yuan brothers fight among themselves and the bodies of the dead are scattered throughout the wilderness. The people have yet to see how your forces will bring benevolent rule and relief aid to them and liberate them from war and disaster, but now the first thing <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to check the records for the numbers of troops and military equipment you've obtained. Is this what the people in this province expect of you?" [...] Those present at the scene were all startled by Cui Yan's response.

2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E

2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E
