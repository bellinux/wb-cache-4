500|$|The rock critic Robert Christgau {{considers}} Berry [...] "the {{greatest of}} the rock and rollers", while John Lennon said, [...] "if you tried to give rock and roll another name, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'Chuck Berry'." [...] Ted Nugent said, [...] "If you don't know every Chuck Berry lick, you can't play rock guitar." [...] Bob Dylan called Berry [...] "the Shakespeare of rock 'n' roll". Springsteen tweeted, [...] "Chuck Berry was rock's greatest practitioner, guitarist, and the greatest pure rock 'n' roll writer who ever lived." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] was raved {{by music}} critics. John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} the song as [...] "really big. Like R. Kelly's [...] "I Believe I Can Fly" [...] big. Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok {{you get the}} picture. If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then {{that would be too}} simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Vanderbank, [...] "even {{if he is}} he won't be the man to what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> 'vent' <b>it</b> on her. He'll seek compensations {{elsewhere}} and won't mind any ridicule--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the most}} {{astonishing}} story. A miracle, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Makes <b>you</b> believe in Fate {{and all that}} kind of thing. A week ago I was on the Subway in New York...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, that's another matter--a mere trifle, but {{the sort}} of thing you take an {{interest}} in--queer, you know, and what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> freakish. <b>It</b> {{has nothing to do with}} the main fact--can't have, on the face of it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I asked," [...] Lord Armley continued, [...] "whether {{you were}} an Englishman, for two reasons. One was--well, perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> curiosity; the other because, {{if you are an}} Englishman, Mr. Foley and I are going to make a strong and I hope {{successful}} appeal to your patriotism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I suppose <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that. You wouldn't {{think so}} {{to look at}} me, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides. Everybody has forgot about me and John. I'd {{forgotten}} myself. But it all {{came back to me}} when I saw Gilbert last Sunday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{tell you}} all about that," [...] he said, [...] "It's the most {{astonishing}} story. A miracle, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Makes <b>you</b> believe in Fate and all that sort of thing. A week ago I was on the Subway in New York...." ...|$|R
5000|$|Limoges {{is north}} of Exit 79 on Trans-Canada Highway 417. The village is {{situated}} between {{the towns of}} Casselman and Embrun and close to Larose Forest. Many parking lots to access the forest {{can be reached by}} driving through Limoges. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> even <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the gateway to Larose Forest when coming in from Ottawa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Kendricks!" [...] she {{repeated}} thoughtfully. [...] "Yes; {{in that sense}} I suppose <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> him poor. <b>It</b> isn't an equal thing as far as nature, as character, goes. But isn't it always dreadful to see two people who have {{made up their minds}} to get married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, I was stunned; partly {{with this}} unlooked-for stupidity on his part, {{and partly because}} his fellows so manifestly sided with him and were of his mind--if <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> mind.

6000|$|... "Well, not exactly," [...] said Adrian, highly pleased, {{although}} to {{tell the}} truth he could not recollect upon what occasion the fair Isabella had favoured him with her kind glances. [...] "Yet I suppose that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> so, an idealised love-letter, a letter in which ardent and distant yet tender admiration is wrapt with the veil of verse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The way is {{over the}} water, of course," [...] said the hotel-keeper. [...] "For people like you, three days in a good, big boat is nothing. It's {{no more than a}} little outing, a bit of a change. At this season the Java Sea is a pond. I have an excellent, safe boat--a ship's life-boat--carry thirty, let alone three, and a child could handle her. You wouldn't get a wet face {{at this time of the}} year. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a pleasure-trip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I'm used to it; and I'd {{rather have}} him {{so than the}} other way. When I call him a failure, I mean to the world he's a failure; he isn't to me. I don't know as I want him {{different}} much different, anyway. I have to scold him some, snarl at him, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> even <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> but I reckon I'd do that just the same, if he was different--it's my make. But I'm a good deal less snarly and more contented when he's a failure than I am when he isn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now listen, {{dear old}} soul. You've {{got the story}} all wrong. As a matter of fact, jolly old Benham told me himself {{that he has the}} {{greatest}} esteem and respect for Percy, and wouldn't have kicked him for the world. And, you know it was more a sort of push than a kick. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a light shove. The fact is, it was beastly dark in the theatre, and he was legging it sideways for some reason or other, no doubt with the best motives, and unfortunately he happened to stub his toe on the poor old bean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{first there}} were only nine of them adventurous sparks, then, just {{a day or two}} before the sailing date, he turned up. Heard of it somehow, somewhere--I would say from some woman, if I didn't know him as I do. He would give any woman a ten-mile berth. He can't stand them. Or maybe in a flash bar. Or maybe in one of them grand clubs in Pall Mall. Anyway, the agent netted him in all right--cash down, and only about four and twenty hours for him to get ready; but he didn't miss his ship. Not he! <b>You</b> <b>might</b> have <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a pier-head jump--for a gentleman. I saw him come along. Know the West India Docks, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strivers, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> in English. In the Vaterland {{those who}} seek for higher and better things--for liberty, and {{to be rid of}} oppression--are so called. That is why we fought in '48 and lost. And that is why we came here, to the Republic. Ach! I fear I will never be the great lawyer--but the striver, yes, always. We must fight once more to be rid of the black monster that sucks the blood of freedom--vampire. Is it not so in English?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{habit of}} a realist {{to find things}} the reverse of their {{appearance}} inclined him to put every statement in a paradox. A certain habit of antagonism defaced his earlier writings,--a trick of rhetoric not quite outgrown in his later, of substituting for the obvious word and thought its diametrical opposite. He praised wild mountains and winter forests for their domestic air, in snow and ice he would find sultriness, and commended the wilderness for resembling Rome and Paris. [...] "It was so dry, that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> wet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{placed him}} on my shoulder, and just then several Huns began firing at us. One bullet grazed my side, {{giving me a}} deep scratch, and another went through the cloth of Spell's coat. I {{stumbled}} down into a shell crater with the man and had all I could do to drag him and myself out. Then I plunged forward again, {{and just as the}} Huns let out several more shots, both of us stumbled down into the trench, and the rescue, if <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> such, was over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The thought," [...] said Uncle Chris, [...] "came {{to me this}} morning, as I read {{my morning}} paper while breakfasting. It has grown and {{developed}} during the day. At this moment <b>you</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>call</b> <b>it</b> an obsession. I am very fond of America. I spent several happy years there. On that occasion I set sail for the land of promise, I admit, somewhat reluctantly. Of my own free will I might never have made the expedition. But the general sentiment seemed so strongly in favour of my doing so that I yielded to what I <b>might</b> <b>call</b> a public demand. The willing hands for my nearest and dearest were behind me, pushing, and I did not resist them. I have never regretted it. America {{is a part of}} every young man's education. You ought to go there, Freddie." ...|$|R
60|$|The driver {{never said}} a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father Maher. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again {{continuing}} their tête-à-tête (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled {{with a number of}} other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>call</b> <b>it</b> in the sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car.|$|R
500|$|The song {{received}} strongly positive {{responses from}} critics, {{and it was}} frequently cited as {{the highlight of the}} album. Phil Sutcliffe in Sounds magazine said the song was [...] "so honest <b>you</b> <b>might</b> even risk <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> truth". Music website AllMusic called [...] "Biko" [...] a [...] "stunning achievement for its time", and {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's odd that such a bleak song can sound so freeing and liberating". Writing in 2013, Mark Pedelty would say that [...] "Biko" [...] "stood out for its unusual instrumentation (bagpipes and synthesizer), haunting vocals, and funerary chant," [...] and credited Gabriel with doing a [...] "masterful job of creating catalytic imagery and getting out of the way". Music scholar Michael Drewett wrote that the lyrics skillfully engaged the listener by moving from a specific story to a call for action.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Dave Dyer snapped, [...] "Honest? Do {{you call}} it honest to hold us up for every cent of pay they can get? I can't say that I've had any of them steal {{anything}} (though <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> stealing to eat so much that a roast of beef hardly lasts three days), but just the same I don't intend to let them think they can put anything over on ME! I always make them pack and unpack their trunks down-stairs, right under my eyes, and then I know they aren't being tempted to dishonesty by any slackness on MY part!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{broke the}} news to Ethelbertha, and we agreed {{to spend the day}} on shore. Harwich is not a merry town, towards evening <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> dull. We had some tea and {{watercress}} at Dovercourt, and then returned to the quay to look for Captain Goyles and the boat. We waited an hour for him. When he came he was more cheerful than we were; if he had not told me himself that he never drank anything but one glass of hot grog before turning in for the night, I should have said he was drunk.|$|E
6000|$|He bent a wide, anxious, inquiring smile upon March, who suggested, lazily: [...] "You {{might call}} it 'The Round-Robin'. That would express the central idea of irresponsibility. As I understand, {{everybody}} is to share the profits and be exempt from the losses. Or, if I'm wrong, and the reverse is true, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'The Army of Martyrs'. Come, that sounds attractive, Fulkerson! Or {{what do you think}} of 'The Fifth Wheel'? That would forestall the criticism that there are too many literary periodicals already. Or, if you want to put forward the idea of complete independence, you could call it 'The Free Lance'; or--" ...|$|E
5000|$|John Crace of The Guardian {{thought that}} Heston's Fantastical Food was too similar to his {{previous}} Channel 4 outings, describing {{him as a}} [...] "flatscreen one-trick wonder". He felt that the show had been padded out from twenty {{minutes to an hour}} and found it conceited that Blumenthal was doing something useful. Tim Dowling reviewed the second episode, also for The Guardian saying that [...] "Heston's mission suffered from a woolliness of intent that made it hard to justify the grandeur of the project". Benji Wilson of The Daily Telegraph gave the show 2/5 stars, and said that the [...] "show is messy and mildly repellent because it asks us to take food, both the cooking and the eating of it, seriously, yet it does so with a series of glib stunts". The Metro was equally critical in its review, saying that it [...] "came across as a self-indulgent game", and that it [...] "was more of a bizarre bid to get in the Guinness World Records book than anything <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> cooking". However <b>it</b> described the Christmas episode as something which [...] "promises to be fun".|$|R
60|$|The new {{arrangement}} was quite to my liking. The whole schooner had been overhauled; six berths {{had been made}} astern out {{of what had been}} the after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. It had been originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till <b>you</b> <b>might</b> almost have <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a round-house. Very low it was still, of course; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful as to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had not long the benefit of his opinion.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after its}} release, {{a copy of}} [...] "Biko" [...] was seized by South African customs and {{submitted}} to the Directorate of Publications, which banned the song and the album on which it featured for being critical of apartheid, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> [...] "harmful {{to the security of}} the State." [...] Thus, though the song achieved enduring popularity outside South Africa, it did not have a presence within the country. [...] The song received strongly positive responses from critics, and it was frequently cited as the highlight of the album. Phil Sutcliffe in Sounds magazine said the song was [...] "so honest <b>you</b> <b>might</b> even risk <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> truth."

6000|$|... "When you get {{it built}} away out," [...] said Madam Rachel, [...] "there will be quite a whirlpool; <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the Maelstrom. There, you see, Caleb can have a little harbour {{up there on the}} shore, and one of you can go out {{to the end of the}} mole, and put a little ship into the water, and the eddy will carry it round to him. Then he can take out the cargo, and put in a new one, and then set the ship in the water, and the current will carry it back again, round on the other side of the whirlpool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you didn't dig {{any of that}} coal yourself. Yet you {{forced it}} up four dollars a ton and {{made a lot of}} money. That was your business. You made the poor people pay more for their coal. You played fair, as you said, but you put your hands down into all their pockets and took their money away from them. I know. I burn a grate fire in my sitting-room at Berkeley. And instead of eleven dollars a ton for Rock Wells, I paid fifteen dollars that winter. You robbed me of four dollars. I could stand it. But there were {{thousands}} of the very poor who could not stand it. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> legal gambling, but to me it was downright robbery." ...|$|E
60|$|Another man, to whom I did not talk, {{sticks in}} my memory. He {{had for years}} and years {{inspected}} trains {{at the head of a}} heavyish grade in the mountains--though not half so steep as the Hex[4]--where all brakes are jammed home, and the cars slither warily for ten miles. Tire-troubles there would be inconvenient, so he, as the best man, is given the heaviest job--monotony and responsibility combined. He did me the honour of wanting to speak to me, but first he inspected his train--on all fours with a hammer. By the time he was satisfied of the integrity of the underpinnings it was time for us to go; and all that I got was a friendly wave of the hand--a master craftsman's sign, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
