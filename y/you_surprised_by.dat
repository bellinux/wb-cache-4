[...] "Could you not {{suppose that}} I {{wanted to give}} <b>you</b> a <b>surprise,</b> <b>by</b> shewing <b>you</b> how curiously she has been surrounded by houses since you last saw her.

6000|$|DEAR MARY,--I do {{not know}} whether <b>you</b> are <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> [...] what Mr Whittlestaff has done; but I am,--so much so that [...] I hardly know how to write to you on the matter.

Nor do I know as yet whether you are aware of [...] the business which has brought Mr Whittlestaff to town.|$|R

60|$|<b>You</b> <b>surprise</b> me <b>by</b> supposing {{that there}} is ever latent a defiant and roused {{expression}} in the undersigned lamb! Apart from this singular delusion of yours, and wholly unaccountable departure from your usual accuracy in all things, your satisfaction with the portrait is {{a great pleasure to}} me. It has received every conceivable pains at Frith's hands, and ought on his account to be good. It is a little too much (to my thinking) as if my next-door neighbour were my deadly foe, uninsured, and I had just received tidings of his house being afire; otherwise very good.|$|R

'My love,' Fanny began, 'our {{characters}} and {{points of view}} are sufficiently different (kiss me again, my darling), {{to make it very}} probable that I shall <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> <b>by</b> what I am going to say.

50|$|There is no {{tributary}} to {{the lake}} and whilst walking along its shores <b>you</b> may be <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> finding the lake both sides of you, realizing, that the holes between the rocks lying around the lake are filled with water.

"My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "Mr. Ablewhite's conduct has {{naturally}} shocked you, {{and taken}} <b>you</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> If {{it was worth}} while to contest the question with such a man, we might soon show him {{that he is not}} to have things all his own way.

[...] "They expected to take <b>you</b> entirely <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> Now that they have failed in doing so, they will wait until morning to reconnoitre, and decide on the best points of attack. Besides, no doubt they have marched far, and {{are in need of}} rest before renewing the assault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did not you? I did for you. But that is {{one great}} {{difference}} between us. Compliments always take <b>you</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person." ...|$|R

It sounds to me a bogus notion, got up to put the screw on <b>you,</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> I'll tell <b>you</b> what I'll do. I'll go down to the shop tomorrow morning, see the woman, and extract the truth if possible, and I fully expect that the story will shrink up to nothing." ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{people think}} that soft-ware quality assurance(SQA) is a mystifying or a dull subject. I have had many experi-ences that have brought this to my atten-tion. The most {{frequently}} recurring one is when friends or acquaintances ask what I do for a living. Usually, I respond by saying that I am a software engineer. This response results in two types of reactions. The first type is, “Wow, that’s interesting. So, how about this weather we’ve been having? ” The second is more rare {{and a little more}} difficult to answer: “Does that mean <b>you</b> write software?” <b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> their interest, I respond, “Well, actually I used to write software...|$|R
50|$|What takes <b>you</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> is {{the sheer}} {{efficacy}} of the time-tested technique of hull construction, achieved solely using local carpentry tools. Wood, bound together, makes the keel waterproof. This makes the Uru a marvel in handcrafting. The hull and the frame are made in a building yard while fitment of engine and customisation are done elsewhere. On completion, the Uru is launched on the river by Mopla-Khalasis (after the Arabic word for dockyard workers), who employ the age-old pulley-wheel mechanism to roll the boat {{on a bed of}} logs to float it out.|$|R

You know perfectly well you didn't do it for that; but at the time my question took <b>you</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> and <b>you</b> felt you ought to have something to look like a motive. Really you conducted researches because you had to. It's your twist." ...|$|R
60|$|At present these burning bushes stand chiefly {{along the}} edge of the meadows, or I {{distinguish}} them afar on the hillsides here and there. Sometimes you will see many small ones in a swamp turned quite crimson when all other trees around are still perfectly green, and the former appear so much the brighter for it. They take <b>you</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> as <b>you</b> are going by on one side, across the fields, thus early in the season, as if it were some gay encampment of the red men, or other foresters, of whose arrival you had not heard.|$|R
5000|$|Reggie Edwards of The Front Row Report {{states that}} the album [...] "opens with a three song knockout" [...] that [...] "will calm you {{to the point that}} when the title track kicks in.....it takes <b>you</b> {{completely}} <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> before going back to the acoustic". Edwards {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Broken Bones and Skeletons" [...] is [...] "one of the more emotional tracks Danielsen has written in awhile".

5000|$|Jaleesa M. Jones from USA Today {{felt the}} song {{sounded like a}} ‘40s-era, juke-joint-in-the-middle-of-the-Louisiana-bayou bastion of R&B goodness. [...] The Verge author Jamieson Cox {{considered}} [...] "Beggin & Pleadin" [...] a [...] "grainy, lusty bit of blues that perfectly suits her rusty alto," [...] further writing that the song it [...] "might take <b>you</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> R&B doesn’t get much more rough or wounded." [...] Writing for Billboard magazine, Adelle Platon rated [...] "Beggin & Pleadin" [...] three-and-a-half stars out of five.
