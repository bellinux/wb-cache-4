2500|$|You have, as {{you have}} {{proposed}} and {{as the president has}} commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children. You're also talking about the government picking up {{a big part of the}} catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> you can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper two percent. You heard the president say earlier tonight that it's going to cost a whole lot more money than that. I'd just ask you, where are you going to get the money? ...|$|E
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. Remember, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{you will}} make any {{sacrifice}} to save George's life.|$|E
60|$|Gons. I {{will believe}} what both of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>That</b> Honoria, and Angelina, Both equally are fair.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I <b>had</b> read it {{a hundred}} and fifty times," [...] {{returned}} Lumley, [...] "you would have been still under the mark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> before, Jim," [...] Reuben said. [...] "We {{would have}} kept {{together}} and have galloped on, and taken our chance of finding them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is true," [...] said his wife, {{coloring}} a little. [...] "Does thee think I would doubt anything thee told me? If <b>thee</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Abraham <b>had</b> a Quaker cook, I would have believed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I don't {{see that}} it makes any difference. He isn't my husband. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{yourself}} very often, Mrs. Bonteen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> before, {{there is}} no use of repeating it, Captain Ponsberry. We will take command of the vessel at once." ...|$|E
60|$|NAPOLEON (turning on {{his heel}} in disgust and irritably {{resuming}} his march to and fro). Yes: <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> more than once already.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} her," [...] said Mrs. Prime, now {{speaking}} out, [...] "that I saw you standing alone an hour since with that young man,--in the churchyard. And yet <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{he was to}} have been away in Exeter!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Major Ogilvy!' exclaimed the sergeant, {{in a more}} respectful voice. 'If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> your permit {{was from}} Major Ogilvy {{it would have been}} another thing, but you did rave of admirals and commodores, and God knows what other outlandish talk!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what next. As so much has been told me, and as <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I might ask <b>you,</b> I <b>have</b> come to <b>you,</b> yourself. I shall believe your own story more {{thoroughly}} from yourself than from any other teller." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall see, sir. Anyhow, I am glad <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> because now, {{whatever}} you may feel, you {{will keep your}} impatience to yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not before <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{you have}} forgiven me!" [...] he entreated as he {{clung to her}} white draperies with a passionate gesture of appeal.|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not}} {{addressed}} to me. I am not {{in the habit of}} reading other people's letters. (He again offers the packet.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... “If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> with {{a purpose}} I wouldn’t {{have been in the}} least sorry for you,” she <b>said.</b> “It would <b>have</b> been cheap, but that’s just why I know you didn’t. Still, are you quite sure there is nothing you long for over there? I mean, of course, in England.” ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [now deeply wounded] Stealing! <b>You</b> shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> Eliza. That shows a want of feeling.|$|R
5000|$|In an August 2014 NPR interview, Shaver <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he shot Coker {{because he}} was [...] "Such a bully" [...] and that [...] "I hit him right between {{a mother and a}} fucker. That was the end of that. He dropped his weapons and said, 'I'm sorry.' And I <b>said,</b> 'Well, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> inside, {{there would have been no}} problem.' [...] " ...|$|R
60|$|Oddly enough, I {{encountered}} neither. But when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{you have}} said everything, for in every other way the conditions could scarcely have been fouler.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Augustus!' said Miss Pecksniff, {{in a low}} voice. 'I verily believe <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> fifty {{thousand}} times, in my hearing. What a Prose you are!' ...|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST. You are horribly wilful. I {{insist on}} your {{discussing}} this matter with me. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the Greeks were {{a nation of}} art-critics. What art-criticism have they left us? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he won't, Carrie. Your uncle {{wants the}} boy to be a gentleman, and {{a man of the}} world. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> a year ago, I would have agreed with you; but we know him better, now, and I will be bound he will like him to see as much life as he can, during this time. He has sent him out into the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> something--something <b>that</b> {{surprises me}} from you, and hurts me. I wish {{to know whether}} you say it from yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s a very {{extraordinary}} thing, we two {{coming together}} like this,” {{she said with}} conviction. “You coming in without knowing I was here and then {{telling me that you}} can’t very well go out of the room. That sounds funny. I wouldn’t have been angry if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn’t. It would have hurt me. But nobody ever paid much attention to my feelings. Why do you smile like this?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Irene, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> many times, yet {{always have}} denied me a reason. I've {{a right to}} know, to understand, to feel and prove my fortitude if I have it. Give me a reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{speak to}} you like this," [...] the girl went on, [...] "but it's because I feel from what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> you know and love America. And I think I can help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must rouse yourself," [...] I said; [...] "something must be {{done and}} you must give me leave to act. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> that man killed your sister, and I believe it--that he will kill you, and I believe that." ...|$|E
60|$|ANN. [suddenly {{losing her}} courage, with an anguish {{that she does}} not conceal] No. We are awake; and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> no: <b>that</b> is all.|$|R
60|$|CHR. Then said Christian, I {{perceive}} not yet, by what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>that</b> {{this is my}} way to {{the desired}} haven[96] (Jer. 2:6).|$|R
6000|$|... "You are strangely humble to-night, Monsieur. It is unwonted in you, and {{for once}} you wrong yourself. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> not <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I am forgiven." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> before. But do you {{not think}} {{that you would be}} far wiser, instead of {{directing}} your undivided attention to my unworthy self, to turn your thoughts a little to one whom, believe me, you have far greater cause to fear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a bit. You do not {{understand}} me yet, I see. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> my views are peculiar. What if I have taken the peculiar view that I was bound to tell Marian this before proposing to her, and have actually told her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will never}} refuse it again. You shall have it now, tomorrow, next day, any {{day that you}} will ask it. Oh, Agatha! my brain is so turned by what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> I could almost go on my knees to beg him to accept it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> all <b>that</b> {{there is}} to be said." [...] Then Mr. O'Mahony got up from his chair as though to show Mr. Moss out of the room.|$|R
60|$|JOANNE. Are {{you being}} funny, Mr. Purdie? You know quite well {{that there are}} not any trees for miles around. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{yourself}} <b>that</b> it is the one blot on the landscape.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{tell you}} Monsieur de Ferrières'! But only because I believe from what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> just <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he {{will turn out}} to have some right to the treasure." ...|$|R
