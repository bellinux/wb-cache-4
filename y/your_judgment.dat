500|$|He {{served in}} New York during the American War of Independence. While William was in America, George Washington {{approved}} {{a plot to}} kidnap him, writing: [...] "The spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in your plan for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the Prince William Henry and Admiral Digby merits applause; and you have my authority to make the attempt in any manner, and at such a time, as <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> may direct. I am fully persuaded, that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince or Admiral..." [...] The plot {{did not come to}} fruition; the British heard of it and assigned guards to William, who had up till then walked around New York unescorted.|$|E
500|$|The State Department {{appeared}} {{to not be}} well-informed about the action, as Ball cabled Lodge {{a few hours after}} the coup started: [...] "We have so little info on motivations and other factors involved in current crisis that we leave to <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> how to handle. Meantime we trust you will make very clear that we {{had nothing to do with}} coup. If you consider it advisable and possible there would seem to us to be merit in preserving Minh as head of Government since he appears to have best potentialities for rallying support of people." [...] The Pentagon had opposed the removal of Diệm and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Khánh later reflected: [...] "Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked what}} the secret was to aiming, Ellin responded: [...] "I would say that aim is {{basically}} trial and error and instinct, using <b>your</b> <b>judgment.</b> I may look at the path from the pocket through the object ball, but I hardly do that anymore. You develop an instinct for aiming from playing all the time".|$|E

6000|$|Mabel smiled. [...] "Oh, well, I expect <b>your</b> <b>judgment's</b> biased, Bob. But {{let me go}} on, {{although}} it's rather awkward ground. Wyndham has charm, he's picturesque; {{something of}} the gentleman-adventurer type. I think that's what I mean." ...|$|R
2500|$|Socrates, {{rather than}} simply listing reasons as Lysias had done, begins by {{explaining}} that while all men desire beauty, some are in love and some are not. We are all ruled, he says, by two principles: one is our inborn desire for pleasure, {{and the other is}} our acquired judgment that pursues what is best (237d). Following <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> is [...] "being in your right mind", while following desire towards pleasure without reason is [...] "outrage" [...] (hubris).|$|E
2500|$|I {{am asking}} you to go because of my desire {{to have the best}} {{possible}} on-the-spot appraisal of the military and paramilitary effort to defeat the Viet Cong[...] [...] [...] The events in South Vietnam since May have now raised serious questions both about the present prospects for success against the Viet Cong and still more about the future effectiveness of this effort unless there can be important political improvement in the country. It is in this context that I now need your appraisal of the situation. If the prognosis in <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> is not hopeful, I would like your views on what action must be taken by the South Vietnamese Government and what steps our Government should take to lead the Vietnamese to that action.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{upcoming}} attack, Meade {{was concerned that}} the corps of Wright and Smith would not be sufficient, so he attempted to convince Warren to send reinforcements. He wrote to the V Corps commander, [...] "Generals Wright and Smith will attack this evening. It is very desirable you should join this attack, unless in <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> it is impracticable." [...] Warren decided to send the division of Brig. Gen. Henry H. Lockwood, which began to march at 6 p.m., but no adequate reconnaissance of the road network had been conducted and Lockwood {{was not able to}} reach the impending battle in time to make a difference. Meade was also concerned about his left flank, which was not anchored on the Chickahominy and was potentially threatened by Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry. He ordered Phil Sheridan to send scouting parties into the area, but Sheridan resisted, telling Meade that {{it would be impossible to}} move his men before dark.|$|E

2500|$|... ”Your letter {{has filled}} me at once with sorrow and with joy. With sorrow at the sufferings {{you have to}} endure {{not only from the}} pagans, but also from Christians; with gladness at the {{conversion}} of the Northmen, who once revelled in human blood, but who now, by your words, rejoice that they are redeemed by the life-giving blood of Christ. For this we thank God, and implore Him to strengthen them in the faith. As to how far, inasmuch as they are uncultured, and but novices in the faith, they are to be subjected to severe canonical penances for their relapsing, killing of priests, and sacrificing to idols, we leave to <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> to decide, as no one will know better than you the manners and customs of this people. You will, of course, understand well enough that it will not be advisable to treat them with the severity required by the canons, lest, thinking they {{will never be able to}} bear the unaccustomed burdens, they return to their old errors.” ...|$|E
