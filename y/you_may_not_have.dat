[...] GameSpot echoed {{criticism of the}} [...] "lack of visual variety." [...] IGN added that [...] "the world map and dungeons are crying for more detail." [...] Despite this, Destructoid allowed that [...] "the colorful clothing helps offset the game's otherwise limited palette." [...] IGN disliked the fact that [...] "large difficulty spikes are interjected every now and then" [...] and [...] "Resonance of Fate is built for those that enjoy the grind." [...] In contrast, the GameSpot reviewer liked {{this aspect of the}} game, [...] "You need to use every trick you have learned, and a few <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> even realized yet, to tackle these treacherous monsters, but there is nothing quite as sweet as toppling something that has tormented you for so long." ...|$|E

The first [...] "ramp-up" [...] event was a shareholder open day on 18 July 2006, the second an open training session for 20,000 selected club members held two days later. The third event was Dennis Bergkamp's testimonial match against Ajax on 22 July 2006. The Emirates Stadium was officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 26 October 2006; his wife Queen Elizabeth II had suffered a back injury {{and was unable to}} carry out her duty. Prince Philip quipped to the crowd, [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> my wife, but you've got the second-most experienced plaque unveiler in the world." [...] The royal visit echoed the attendance of the Queen's uncle, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) at the official opening of Highbury's West Stand in 1932. As a result of the change of plan, the Queen extended to the club the honour of inviting the chairman, manager and first team to join her for afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. Held on on 15 February 2007, the engagement marked the first time a football club had been invited to the palace for such an event.|$|E

He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more {{importantly}} marked." ...|$|E

[...] "I {{look forward to a}} world without the Java plugin (and to not having to remind readers about quarterly patch updates) but it will probably be years before various versions of this plugin are mostly removed from end-user systems worldwide."" [...] "Once promising, it has outlived its usefulness in the browser, and has become a nightmare that delights cyber-criminals at the expense of computer users." [...] "I think everyone should uninstall Java from all their PCs and Macs, and then think carefully about whether they need to add it back. If you are a typical home user, you can probably do without it. If you are a business user, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E
