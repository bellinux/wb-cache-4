Rooted in Southern hip hop, {{it contains a}} bounce and bass-heavy sound with dense TR 808-driven basslines, live instrumentation, and backing vocalists. Music writer Greg Kot calls it [...] "a state-of-the-art Southern-fried party-funk album" [...] and notes its bass-heavy sound as [...] "full of surface charm, the type of music {{that is designed to}} sound big in a club, the soundtrack for a night of excess. But there’s very little conventional about these beats".|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} criticized {{for the absence of}} story line by critics such as Laura Brooks of 'TeenToday', who [...] {{described}} the video as [...] " [...] to show off her lovely hair and her thighs" [...] that [...] "also features David Guetta who appears to have remembered at several points throughout the video that he's left his iron on dashes off to remedy the situation." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic agreed, calling the clip [...] "dopey ... with guys who forgot to wash the home dye out of their hair" [...] (sic) and the dancing was on-par with sci-fi film The Matrix Reloaded. However she did say that [...] "It's a high-concept understanding of the dance floor, even if it's not my preferred interpretation of that space. If love and shaking it are war, Kelly seems like she'd be a pretty decent person to have boss <b>you</b> <b>around</b> in both." [...] Meanwhile Sound Savvy said [...] "There's some nice moves and Kelly sports some sexy looks for the clip. 'Commander' has received CRAZY airplay and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive for this track. I kinda dig the video, but I would've liked more choreography." ...|$|E
500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking <b>you</b> <b>around</b> here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E

According to author Jason Bailey, [...] "Quentin {{thought it would be}} funny to have this casual {{observer}} who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive <b>you</b> <b>around</b> to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke. It was the only time I didn't feel like the odd one out over there." ...|$|E

The eastern one, with 37 arches, is called [...] "20 de Noviembre" [...] or [...] "Constitución"; the southern one, with 44 arches, is called [...] "Madero" [...] and the western one, with 35 arches, is called [...] "Reforma". [...] There are four additional arches {{at the entrance to}} Avenida Independencia.
