25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix {{has come}} and gone in recent years, but none of the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. If you had a Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> your entry and have a go. This led to some wonderful events and the chance to see unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing a great job in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E

When first watching the Persona 4 anime, Elliot Page from UK Anime Network noted that although Yu was not a silent character as in the video game, he had little dialogue and the pacing managed {{to make up for}} it. In a later review, Andy Hanley from the same site said he liked how the protagonist was handled, as the staff used his [...] "blank state" [...] to create comedic interactions. Briana Lawrence from the Fandom Post shared similar feelings, stating that the staff [...] "somehow managed to give a silent protagonist a personality that's not only believable, but likable." [...] Lawrence appreciated how the character was developed across the series thanks to all the bonds he forms into a [...] "snarky, lovable main character who can keep a straight face while being kicked off a cliff." [...] While also commenting how Yu manages to reinforce both the comical and [...] "spooky" [...] elements of the plot, Blu-ray's Jeffrey Kauffman noted he [...] "remains something of a cipher throughout the series" [...] with the possibility of having the viewer relate with him.|$|E

On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> money out of it.

500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer even trying to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E

[...] Frederick {{had previously}} defeated Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), seizing from her {{the territory of}} Silesia; and had successfully defended his conquest in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Van Swieten was ambassador during the First Partition of Poland (1772), in which much of the territory of this nation was annexed by the more powerful neighboring empires of Austria, Russia, and Prussia. [...] Austria rather unrealistically wanted Silesia (and other territories) back {{as part of the}} terms of the partition.

[...] Van Swieten shifted the negotiations to his backup plan and the Partition went forward with Silesia remaining Prussian.|$|E
2500|$|Though it is {{intuitively}} {{clear what}} supervenience is, formally specifying {{what it means}} involves a complex technical apparatus and a family of related but subtly different definitions. Most definitions involve comparisons of objects for indiscernibility. According to one standard definition, a set of properties A (e.g. mental properties) supervenes {{on a set of}} properties B (e.g. neural properties), if and only if any two objects x and y which share all properties in B (are [...] "B-indiscernible") must also share all properties in A (are [...] "A-indiscernible"). The intuitive idea is that if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a physical copy of a person, you'd also be making a psychological copy of that person. The reverse does not hold; two people could be in the same mental state, but that mental state could be supported by different brain states (the same mental state could be [...] "multiply realizable" [...] by different brain states). The properties in B are called the base properties (or sometimes subjacent or subvenient properties), and the properties in A are called the supervenient properties.|$|E
2500|$|The four color theorem was proven in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. It was {{the first}} major theorem to be proved using a computer.

(If they did appear, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a smaller counter-example.) Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand [...] Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain [...]|$|E
