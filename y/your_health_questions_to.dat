30|$|Domains {{with the}} highest quality were “Scope and Purpose” and “Clarity of Presentation”; both scored over 80 %. This finding is {{comparable}} to different previous guideline evaluation studies with the AGREE II instrument, regardless of the topic [18 – 21]. The reason for such high scores regardless of the topic is not clear [18]. This may be attributable {{to the fact that}} both domains 1 and 3 contain fundamental elements that cannot be easily omitted, such as guideline objectives, the <b>health</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> deal with and the population to whom the guideline is applied.|$|R

40|$|Data {{from the}} UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) {{are used to}} examine two methodological issues in the {{analysis}} of the relationship between age and work-related health. First, the LFS is unusual in that it asks work-related <b>health</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> those who are not currently employed. This facilitates a more representative analysis than that which is constrained to focus only on those currently in work. Second, information in the LFS facilitates a comparison of work-related health problems that stem from current employment to a more encompassing measure that includes those related to a former job. We find that accounting for each of these sources of bias increases the age work-related health risk gradient, and suggest that ignoring such effects will underestimate the work-related health implications of current policies to extend working lives...|$|R
40|$|AIM/BACKGROUND: To {{describe}} the two-stage prioritization process {{being used by}} the UK National Institute for Health Research's Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for the South-West Peninsula (or PenCLAHRC) - a joint health service and university partnership and reflect on implications for the wider context of priority setting in health-care research. METHOD: PenCLAHRC's process establishes the priorities of Stakeholders including service users across a regional health system for locally relevant health services research and implementation. <b>Health</b> research <b>questions</b> are collected from clinicians, academics and service users in Devon and Cornwall (UK) using a web-based question formulation tool. There is a two-stage prioritization process which uses explicit criteria and a wide Stakeholder group, including service users to identify important research <b>questions</b> relevant <b>to</b> the south-west peninsula locality. RESULTS: To date, a wide variety of health research topics have been prioritized by the PenCLAHRC Stakeholders. The research agenda reflects the interests of academics, clinicians and service users in the local area. Potential challenges to implementation of the process include time constraints, variable quality of questions (including the language of research) and initiating and maintaining engagement in the process. Shared prioritization of local health research needs can be achieved between Stakeholders {{from a wide range of}} perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: The processes developed have been successful and, with minor changes, will continue to be used during subsequent rounds of prioritization. Engagement of Stakeholders in establishing a research agenda encourages the most relevant <b>health</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> be asked and may improve implementation of research findings and take up by service users...|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{uses the}} World Health Survey (WHS)-SAGE Wave 1 survey (2007 to 2009) in India 4 covering six states 5, namely Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam. The data collected included self-reported assessments of health linked to anchoring vignettes, which are hypothetical stories that describe the health problems of third parties in several health domains. This data has information of both “subjective” and “objective” measures of identical <b>health</b> <b>questions</b> in addition <b>to</b> the responses on vignettes.|$|R
50|$|Self-rated health {{measures}} the present general health and gives answer choices, typically structured like a Likert Scale. The self-rated <b>health</b> <b>question</b> may take different forms. It may be formulated as “in general, {{would you say}} that you health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” as the first question in the SF-36 questionnaire. It may also be formulated as “In general, how would you rate <b>your</b> <b>health</b> today,” with the possible choices being “very good” (1), “good” (2), “moderate” (3), “bad” (4) or “very bad” (5)” as used by the World <b>Health</b> Organization. All <b>questions</b> do not necessarily have five answer choices; it can be more or less.|$|R

The inadequacy of respondent reports concerning ill health conditions, as a substitute for medical diagnoses, has been amply demonstrated.

40|$|The {{surveillance}} of congenital anomalies serves two main purposes: {{to facilitate the}} identification of teratogenic (malformation causing) exposures and {{to assess the impact}} of primary prevention and prenatal screening policy and practice at a population level. EUROCAT, the European network of population based registers for the epidemiological {{surveillance of}} congenital anomalies, now covers 1. 2 million births per year, a quarter of births in Europe. The added value of European collaboration is particularly great for congenital anomalies, coming from the opportunity to pool data, to compare data between regions and countries, to give a common response <b>to</b> European public <b>health</b> <b>questions,</b> and <b>to</b> share expertise and resources, including computing tools. EUROCAT provides essential epidemiological information on congenital anomalies in Europe, facilitates the early warning of teratogenic exposures, evaluates the effectiveness of primary prevention, assesses the impact of developments in prenatal screening, acts as an information and resource centre regarding clusters, provides a ready collaborative network and infrastructure for research, and acts as a catalyst for the setting up of registries throughout Europe...|$|R

40|$|A toolkit is a {{collection}} of materials {{that can be used to}} help you to manage <b>your</b> <b>health</b> and keep track of important information regarding sickle cell disease (SCD). The Living Well With Sickle Cell Disease: Self-Care Toolkit has multiple uses. It is designed to help you and your caregivers with management of your disease, medical care, services, and health providers. The toolkit also will help communication between the many health providers and service providers that are involved with patient care. Because many doctors are not familiar with SCD, it is very important for you to take an active role in managing your own care. To make important decisions, you need to know about SCD, understand your treatment options, and then make the best possible choices for <b>your</b> <b>health.</b> Using the tools provided in this toolkit will help you to monitor <b>your</b> <b>health</b> care and manage your disease. Putting together a care notebook or binder that you can take with you wherever and whenever (for example doctor 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s appointments, emergency room visits, vacation, and the workplace) you need it will help you organize all of your SCD-related medical information in one place so that you can keep track of information over time.

40|$|Introduction Health care {{facilities}} in resource-limited settings {{are faced with}} numerous challenges including high patient loads and shortage of trained health workers. However, there still remains a dearth of scientific evidence to assess and address issues associated with stress and burnout among health workers providing HIV care. Methods An annual assessment was conducted using a site capacity assessment tool to evaluate {{the quality of care}} at 18 HIV <b>health</b> facilities. <b>Questions</b> <b>to</b> determine stress management and HIV care among health workers were graded from 0 – 5 (lowest to highest score). Data on performance of health facilities were summarized on an excel sheet. Results Majority of the health facilities (67 %) did not have polices or practices in place to relieve stress faced by staff in providing care for persons with HIV/AIDS. Less than half of the health facilities (44. 4 %) had policies on PEP, confidential HIV testing and counseling as well as referral for care and treatment for staff that are found to be HIV positive. Conclusion Evaluating and addressing issues associated with stress, burnout, as well as providing HIV care services among health workers in HIV settings is imperative for provision of good quality of care...|$|R

40|$|Background. The Expanded Program on Immunization Contact Method (EPI-CM) is a {{proposed}} monitoring and program management tool for developing countries. The method involves health workers tallying responses <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> about <b>health</b> behaviors during routine immunizations and providing targeted counseling. We evaluated whether asking caretakers about health behaviors during EPI visits led {{to changes in}} those behaviors. Methods. We worked in 2 districts in Mali: an intervention district where during immunization visits workers asked about 4 health behaviors related to bed net use, fever, respiratory disease, and diarrhea, and a control district where workers conducted routine immunization activities without <b>health</b> behavior <b>questions.</b> <b>To</b> evaluate the effect of EPI-CM, we conducted a cross-sectional household survey at baseline and 1 year postintervention. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare between districts the change over 1 year in 4 health behaviors: use of insecticide-treated nets, appropriate fever treatment, care-seeking for respiratory complaints, and appropriate diarrhea treatment. Results. There {{were no significant differences}} between the 2 districts in the change in the 4 health behaviors when controlling for age, sex, maternal education and occupation, immunization history, and wealth. Conclusions. We found no evidence that EPI-CM increases healthy behaviors. Further evaluation of other potential benefits and costs of EPI-CM is warranted...|$|R
