The ensuing album was [...] "a record's worth of moody and atmospheric tunes". As {{a nod to the}} moods created by the album, Champion has compared the song lyrics to the 1972 song [...] "Perfect Day" [...] by American rock singer-songwriter Lou Reed, stating that the [...] "lyrics are beautiful and they're really, really happy, but the music is really, really sad.

Gehn's {{theme is}} only heard in its complete form {{near the end}} of the game, but portions of the melody can be heard throughout Riven, highlighting his control of the Age. Miller tried to let the environment dictate the resulting sound in order to make the music as immersive as possible. He blended live instrumentation with synthesizers: [...] "By mixing and matching conventional instrumentation, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> an odd, interesting mood," [...] Miller said.

Firstly, Adam would have to appear uncomfortable in the situation which could anger gay right groups, etc." [...] Muhney also approved of the decision not to show the sex scene, saying, [...] "or me, the way it was done was tasteful and it almost makes the audience wonder what exactly happened. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> that in your head and try to interpret it by how the characters reacted afterwards." ...|$|E

[...] In response, Palahniuk (who had never responded to a review before) sent an angry e-mail to Salon's Letters section. Palahniuk observed [...] "Until <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> something that captivates people, I'd invite you to just shut up. It's easy to attack and destroy an act of creation.

2500|$|Lighting {{challenges}} were abound for Greenberg {{as most of}} {{the film}} took place at night. One of the simplest techniques for lighting employed by Greenberg was using a car's headlights to dramatically produce a scene of terror. Greenberg explained, [...] "We had a scene on Zuma Beach where the bad guys are dragging somebody into the ocean. I wanted to have a very hard, but very natural, and strong look. So, I used the car headlights. It was nice because everything behind the villains fell into darkness. It had a surrealistic look." [...] Greenberg also remarked how he had a close working relationship with DeLuxe lab in getting the correct color for the extensive night shooting in the film by bluntly saying, [...] "In a movie like this I wanted the blacks to be very black, so I worked closely with DeLuxe lab ..." [...] He felt the daily challenges of night shooting visibly enhanced the appeal of Alien Nation by figuratively mentioning, [...] "as a cameraman, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> a lot more at night.

When discussing the additional power of the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, John Vignocchi stated [...] "I’d say, specifically related to Xbox One, the graphical prowess of that system is incredible. So, we’re looking at {{what we can do}} to make sure the game looks incredible on [...] From a features perspective, I’d say the thing we’re most excited about is that players are going to be able to create Toy Boxes now that are much, much larger than they were before," [...] and [...] "In terms of what we're doing with , we're planning on making use of the graphical prowess of those machines — they can pump out some amazing-looking graphics. In addition to that, what we're planning on doing is taking advantage of the overall memory footprint. In Disney Infinity there were certain platforms that were constrained by the amount of RAM, so people couldn't truly build the toy box of their dreams. We've optimized the engine to allow the last-gen, PS3 and 360, to still build compelling Toy Box levels, but with Xbox One and PS4, the sky's the limit." [...] The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 {{versions of}} the game are more advanced than the others, as executive producer John Vignocchi said [...] "one of the most unique features of Disney Infinity 2.0 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, just because of the memory footprint of those systems, is that the size of the toy boxes <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>create</b> are just gigantic." [...] The game engine is improved and expanded.|$|E
