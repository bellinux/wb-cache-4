"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching.</b> Both of you." ...|$|E

The veteran newsreader {{stepped down from}} his role as anchor after more than 30 years at ITN, but {{said he had no}} plans to retire completely from television. At the end of the final programme, he signed off with the words: That brings to an end my association with the news at 10.30.

5000|$|The same morning, {{its social}} media presences were removed (the network's Facebook {{had not been}} updated since September 2015), and the website {{redirected}} to the USA Network site without any notice. The network's last programming day consisted of a full-series marathon of Syfy's Continuum, a final sign of its later channel drift. Following the end credits, a slide was shown, with the Cloo logo and the words [...] "GOOD NIGHT!" [...] underneath, along with [...] "Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> Cloo", the NBC Universal logo, {{and the name of}} the satellite that provided Cloo's broadcast (AMC 10, Transponder 7) in between 2 NBC logos, along with the common NBC off-air audio test using the network's trademark chimes. The end of Cloo was coincidental with another Comcast announcement that the female-focused Oxygen would switch fully to a true crime focus the same day within the coming months.|$|E

Over the next few months I'll be receiving treatments for Hodgkins Lymphoma. My prognosis is very good and I should be just fine on the other side. But I may not be here some days and if I am here I may not be my super perky self and definitely my hair style will change. If you happen to be going through this at this time in your life, or maybe you have a friend or family member going through it right now, I wanted to share this with you in hopes that we can help each other. Thanks for listening and as always, we thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching.</b> We can’t do this without you and I mean it. I'll see you real soon." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{were several}} items that overran into other shows and series; {{the first was}} the [...] "lady who comes down at the end" [...] (Janet Webb) who, despite having no {{involvement}} in the 50-minute programme would stride onto the stage {{at the very end of}} the show (after all the guest stars had taken their curtain-call) and take a bow. In later series, this was accompanied by her following speech: [...] "I'd like to thank all of <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> me and my little show here tonight; if you've enjoyed it, then it's all been worthwhile. So, until we meet again, goodbye - and I love you all!" [...] after which she would be showered with gifts of champagne, boxes of chocolates, etc. Her presence was never explained on the programme. In one episode she [...] "marries" [...] Arthur Lowe who claims he only agreed to appear on the understanding he could meet her. She does also appear in one of Ern's plays with Robert Morley as [...] "Tutantessie" [...] a clear reference to comedian Tessie O'Shea who went by the name [...] "Two-Ton Tessie".|$|E

40|$|Isolation {{of cells}} from the primary source is a {{necessary}} step in many more complex protocols. Miltenyi offers kits to isolate cells from several organisms including humans, non-human primates, rat and, as we describe here, mice. Magnetic bead-based cell separation allows for either positive selection (or cell depletion) as well as negative selection. Here, we demonstrate negative selection of untouched or na ve CD 4 + helper T cells. Using this standard protocol we typically purify cells that are ≥ 96 % pure CD 4 +/CD 3 +. This protocol is {{used in conjunction with}} the protocol Dissection and 2 -Photon Imaging of Peripheral Lymph Nodes in Mice published in issue 7 of JoVE, for purification of T cells and other cell types to adoptively transfer for imaging purposes. Although we did not demonstrate FACS analysis in this protocol video, it is highly recommended to check the overall purity of isolated cells using the appropriate antibodies via FACS. In addition, we demonstrate the non-sterile method of T cell isolation. If sterile cells are needed for your particular end-user application, be sure to do all of the demonstrated procedures in the tissue culture hood under standard sterile conditions. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>watching</b> and good luck with your own experiments...|$|E

6000|$|The lot of {{the actual}} war-correspondents was still worse. It was useless for them to explain that the fog was too thick {{to give them a}} chance.
