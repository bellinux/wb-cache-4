In {{the era of the}} Sanhedrin transgressing any one of six of the Ten Commandments theoretically carried the death penalty, the exceptions being the First Commandment, honouring <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> mother, saying God's name in vain, and coveting, though this was rarely enforced due to a large number of stringent evidentiary requirements imposed by the oral law.|$|E
500|$|Oliver {{was born}} Bronwyn Gooda on 22 February 1959, in Gum Flat, west of Inverell in New South Wales. Her parents were Milton, a farmer turned greenkeeper, and Wendy, {{who worked in}} a pharmacy. Her {{creativity}} was nurtured from a young age. Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, {{who went on to}} become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study. As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. When she told her parents of her plans, her mother replied, [...] "Darling, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> I are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed." [...] A rift subsequently developed between her and her family that resulted in her having no contact with them for 25 years.|$|E

Budi Subanar, a lecturer on theology at Sanata Dharma University, during this period one of the teachers taught the Fourth Commandment, [...] "Honour <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you.", as relating not only to one's birth father and mother, but all who had come before; this left {{the students}} with nationalistic tendencies. On another occasion, a visit by a Capuchin missionary– who was physically {{quite different from the}} Jesuit teachers– led Soegija to consider becoming a priest, an idea which his parents accepted. In 1915 Soegija finished his education at Xaverius, but stayed on as a teacher. The following year he joined the on-site seminary, one of three native Indonesians who entered the seminary that year. He graduated in 1919, having studied French, Latin, Greek, and literature.|$|E

[...] At 10 AM on 9 May 1915 Cros' brigade advanced in conjunction with the division's 1st Brigade, a French Foreign Legion unit led by Colonel Pein. [...] The five-hour preliminary bombardment was largely ineffective and the division took heavy casualties in reaching the German lines, [...] distant. [...] However they managed to push the Germans out and some units even reached the villages of Vimy and Givenchy-en-Gohelle. [...] The next morning, hit by their own artillery and under German counter-attack, the French were forced to withdraw to their own lines in the course of which Cros was killed. [...] Cros was one of almost 2,000 men of the Moroccan division killed in that action, as was fellow brigade commander Colonel Pein.|$|E

2500|$|Noting that [...] (20:12 in NJSP) commands, [...] "Honor <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> your mother," [...] and [...] directs, [...] "Honor the Lord {{with your}} substance," [...] the Rabbis {{taught in a}} Baraita that Scripture thus likens the honor due to parents to that due to God. Similarly, as [...] commands, [...] "You shall fear <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> mother," [...] and [...] commands, [...] "The Lord your God you shall fear and you shall serve," [...] Scripture likens the fear of parents to the fear of God. And as [...] commands, [...] "He that curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death," [...] and [...] commands, [...] "Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin," [...] Scripture likens cursing parents to cursing God. But the Baraita conceded that with respect to {{striking}} (which [...] addresses with regard to parents), that it is certainly impossible (with respect to God). The Baraita concluded that these comparisons between parents and God are only logical, since the three (God, the mother, and the father) are partners in creation of the child. For the Rabbis taught in a Baraita {{that there are three}} partners {{in the creation of a}} person – God, the father, and the mother. When one honors one's father and mother, God considers it as if God had dwelt among them and they had honored God. And a Tanna taught before Rav Nachman that when one vexes one's father and mother, God considers it right not to dwell among them, for had God dwelt among them, they would have vexed God.|$|E

The Ilkhanate army managed to reach Damascus {{by the end of}} December 1299. Ibn Taymiyyah went with a delegation of Islamic scholars to talk to Ghazan Khan, who was the Khan of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Iran, to plead clemency and to stop his attack on the Muslims. It is reported that none of the scholars said anything to the Khan except Ibn Taymiyyah who said: [...] "You claim that you are Muslim and you have with you Mu'adhdhins, Muftis, Imams and Shaykhs but you invaded us and reached our country for what? While <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> your grandfather, Hulagu were non-believers, they did not attack and they kept their promise. But you promised and broke your promise." [...] By early January 1300 the Mongol allies, the Armenians and Georgians, had caused widespread damage to Damascus and they had taken Syrian prisoners. The Mongols effectively occupied Damascus for the first four months of 1303. Most of the military had fled the city, including most of the civilians. Ibn Taymiyyah however, stayed {{and was one of the}} leaders of the resistance inside Damascus and he went to speak directily to the Mongol Ilkhan Mahmud Ghazan and his vizier Rashid al-Din Tabib. He sought the release of Muslim and dhimmi prisoners which the Mongols had taken in Syria, and after discussion, secured their release.|$|E

As Pradyumna is the preceptor of Aniruddha, of Abhimanyu, of Sunitha, and of Bhanu; so he is the preceptor and the refuge of your sons also! And a good preceptor, would unceasingly give them lessons in the wielding of maces and swords and bucklers, in missiles and in the arts of driving cars and of riding horses, being valiant. And he, Pradyumna, the son of Rukmini, having bestowed a very good training upon them, and having taught them the art of using various weapons in a proper way, takes satisfaction at the valorous deeds of your sons, and of Abhimanyu. O daughter of Drupada! And when your son goes out, in pursuit of (out-door) sports, each one of them is followed thither by cars and horses and vehicles and elephants.’ ...|$|E
