500|$|Discussing {{plans for}} the season, Morgan noted that [...] "the Millennium Group is a much deeper organization" [...] than seen in the first season, adding that [...] "they're {{considering}} [...] for {{a candidate for the}} group (and) trying to show him that at the millennium there's going to be an event - either fire and brimstone or harmonic convergence". Wong spoke about how the character of Catherine Black changed, saying [...] "there's a different relationship between Frank and his family this season because of the separation ... I think that will not only bring some kind of heartfelt drama but humor into it". Wong also stated [...] "we don't want to have the audience expect to see a serial killer every week. ... We would like to make it so that it's a surprise to them, just like it is a surprise when <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> <b>The</b> X-Files".|$|E

After {{learning about the}} toxic leaks in the building, in which Frank, Toofer, and Lutz need to strip down, Frank says [...] "So much of my life was wasted creating hats!" [...] This is a reference to Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank in the show and {{who is known for}} his trademark trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character. When Liz tells Floyd that she saw him on The Today Show, on which she learned he is getting married, Floyd says [...] "Dammit!

Liz reveals that she once participated in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted playing a woman who is strangled on a toilet. Jenna and Tracy, who are having strange dreams about Kenneth, decide they [...] "have to Elm Street this. We have to go to sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams!" [...] This references the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, in which the movie's main character—Freddy Krueger—stalks and kills his victims in their dreams.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} that appeared in Cinefantastique, Argento noted that the film was intended as near-science fiction, taking place [...] "about five or more years in the future... Tenebrae occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people {{with the result that}} the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has happened to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants to remember... It isn't exactly my Blade Runner, of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow. If <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> film with this perspective in mind, it will become very apparent." [...] Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city, fifteen years in the future, and that the disaster the city's inhabitants were striving to forget was an atomic bomb blast. Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science-fictional concept [...] "isn't apparent at all" [...] and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film. The film critic and author Kim Newman countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia, Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen. Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento's intention did come across in these scenes, and Newman cites the on-screen use a videophone as an attempt by Argento to place Tenebrae in the near future.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E

I think when <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before." ...|$|E

2500|$|Indiana players wear {{warm-up pants}} that are striped red and white, like the stripes of a candy cane. They were first {{worn by the}} team in the 1970s under head coach Bob Knight. At {{the time they were}} in keeping with the fashion trends of the 1970s, but despite {{changing}} styles they have since become an iconic part of playing for Indiana. IU star guard Steve Alford said, [...] "As you watch television and <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> IU games, that's the first thing you saw, was the team run out in the candy stripes. So when you finally got to put those on, those are pretty special." [...] Rusty Stillions, Director of Indiana's Equipment Operations, said the pants were originally available only for team members. However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events. Beginning in 2014, during Hoosier Hysteria, former IU basketball players have presented to the new players their first pair of candy striped pants. This practice symbolizes a [...] "passing-of-the-torch" [...] and carrying on the rich tradition and responsibilities of playing for Indiana University.|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced {{on location}} in Paris and depicted Victor Manzon's backstory. The sequence filmed in Jerusalem was realized with cooperation of Israeli security forces who portrayed themselves in the pursuit scenes. The mock explosion {{that occurred during the}} Jerusalem scenes had such power that it broke a window of the city's mayor's house, which was located [...] away. The detonation was controlled by Nick Dimitri, a stuntman portraying an Israeli soldier, who positioned himself too close to explosives which resulted in injuries. However, after an hour the director ordered a second take, being adamant about the previous accident. Dimitri praised Friedkin's craftmanship by saying that [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> movie and everything gets obliterated, you can't even tell if it's the first or second take". Moreover, during the realization of the sequence, an actual bombing took place in the vicinity, which prompted Friedkin to capture additional footage which in his opinion added [...] "a documentary reality". The fourth prologue vignette, taking place in Elizabeth, New Jersey, contains a scene involving a car crash. It took twelve takes and approximately ten days to achieve what Friedkin intended. The director recalls the sequence as seemingly [...] "impossible to shoot", having involved several stuntmen from New York, the crew wrecked seven vehicles {{over the course of a}} week, without satisfying the director's intents. Friedkin then put himself in the passenger seat to evaluate the negative aspects of the scene's execution. [...] The director became fed up with the situation and decided to listen to David Salven, the line producer, who suggested that they employ a well-known specialist, Joie Chitwood Jr., whom Friedkin described as [...] "short, stocky, part Indian, self-assured, and fearless". After Friedkin supplied him with all the necessary information about the set's infrastracture, Chitwood meticulously analyzed the surroundings himself, and ordered the special effects technicians to construct a forty-feet long slanted ramp which would allow him to [...] "drive the car at top speed on two wheels, flip it in midair, and crash into a fire hydrant". The construction took three days, and the stunt was successful during its very first take.|$|E
