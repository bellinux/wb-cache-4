One of these forms is x G ! y, where the input [...] output tuple (x; y) is the available information, and G represents the process determining the mapping from x to <b>y.</b> <b>Various</b> models, y = f(x), of G can be constructed using the information from the (x; y) tuples. In general, and for real-world problems, it is not reasonable to expect the exact representation of G to be found (i. e. a formula that is correct for all possible (x; y)). The modeling procedure involves finding a satisfactory set of basis functions, their combination, a coding for (x; y) and then to adjust all free parameters in an approximation process, to construct a final model. The approximation process can bring the accuracy of the model to a certain level, after which it becomes increasingly expensive to improve further.

Post-Soviet space {{is one of the}} most interesting cases for b/order studies, because of the complex re-territorialization processes that have taken place there since 1990 s along with deep economic and political transformations. In Georgia b/ordering processes are affected b y countr y -specific features (such as small size, geopolitical characteristics) and general region-wide forces (its strong European integration aspirations, Russia’s dominant role in the region). The anal ysis of the formal institutional basis for Georgia’s cooperation with these important economic partners and the dynamics of economic activities (cross-border flows of goods and production factors) enable to assess the role of b/orders, recent developments in b/ordering and their economic consequences. The research shows that in Georgia b/orders are under the influence of alternative external economic integration forces (from EU and Russia) and the process of internalization of the external influences by the private agents and the government, as well as their readiness, involvement and cooperation during b/order related reforms. </p...|$|E

Based on this, we synthesize a vertically composition-controlled (VCC) Mo 1 -x W x S 2 multilayer using five continuous super-cycles with different cycle ratios for each super-cycle. Angle-resolved X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, Raman and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer results reveal that a VCC Mo 1 -x W x S 2 multilayer has different vertical composition and broadband light absorption with strong interlayer coupling within a VCC Mo 1 -x W x S 2 multilayer. Further, we demonstrate that a VCC Mo 1 -x W x S 2 multilayer photodetector generates three to four times greater photocurrent than MoS 2 -and WS 2 -based devices, owing to the broadband light absorption. &# 169; 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limitedopen 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is to solve, in {{integers}} X and <b>Y,</b> <b>various</b> equations {{of the form}} [equation] where d and N are given square free integers. The work stems from two papers by J. H. E. Cohn in which the equations [equation] are solved for certain values of d. It {{is well known that}} the solutions of X 2 -dY 2 = 4, and those of X 2 -dY 2 = - 4 where such solutions exist, may be expressed in terms of the least positive solutions of these equations. Solutions of the equations [equations] may now be sought among those of x 2 -dY 2 = + 1,+ 4. Extensive work in this direction has been done by W. Ljunggren working in the quadratic field R(d 2) and other allied algebraic fields. His methods are powerful but deep and complicated. It is possible to show that the solutions of the equations X 2 for sequences which satisfy a three-term recurrence relation. By applying the elementary theory of quadratic residues to these equations Cohn has solved the equations and for those d for which either of the equations has solutions (X,Y) for which X and Y are both odd. This thesis extends Cohn's work, Using similar methods, to solve the equations and for the same values of d as above and any given integer N. A few limited results are given for other values of d. L. J. Mordell has given simple conditions under which the equation can have no solutions. A theorem of a similar type concerning the equations x 4 -dY 2 = 1, 4 is proved. Finally the results proved in this thesis are compared with those of Cohn, Ljunggren and Mordell. <p...|$|E
