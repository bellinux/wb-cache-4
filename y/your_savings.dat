If the money is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the person has to be offered at least $105 in one year so that two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 today or receiving $105 in one year). This is because if you have cash of $100 today and deposit in <b>your</b> <b>savings</b> account, you will have $105 in one year.|$|E

And I can't ask my father for the money: he would not give me a farthing. And my uncle gave me a hundred a little while ago. So what can I do?

I took <b>your</b> <b>savings</b> for reasons of my own; and you have shipped here to-day to murder me on the voyage. But I recognized you before I engaged you: and I have left word at Milwaukee that if anything happens to me on this journey, you two have a grudge against me, and must be hanged for it. I've taken care that if this scow comes into any port along the lakes without me aboard, you two are to be promptly arrested." [...] (This was false, of course; but to Captain Pierpoint a small matter like that was a mere trifle.) [...] "And I've shipped myself along with you, just to show you I'm not afraid of you. But if either of you disobeys my orders in anything for one minute, I shoot at once, and no jury in Canada or the States will touch a hair of my head for doing it. I'm a respectable shipowner and grain merchant, you're a pair of disreputable skulking miners, pretending to be sailors, and you've shipped aboard here on purpose to murder and rob me. If you shoot me, it's murder: if I shoot you, it's justifiable homicide. Now, boys, do you understand that?" ...|$|E

50|$|Comparing the two options, {{the first}} one allows {{reducing}} the interest by $10,000 while the second gives $7,000. Therefore, putting money in an offset account allows saving more money by reducing interest than any interest earned in <b>your</b> <b>savings</b> account. In some countries like Australia, government bodies like the ATO will also tax people on any interest they earn from savings, so this will actually reduce <b>your</b> <b>savings</b> furthermore.|$|E
5000|$|Reinforcing loop - A {{reinforcing}} loop {{is a type}} of a feedback loop, where {{a positive}} increase of variable A causes an increase in variable B, which then in turn causes a positive increase in variable A. The behavior of such system in time is an exponential increase in both variables A and B. As an example, consider the behavior of a long-term bank savings account. As <b>your</b> <b>savings</b> accumulate, the more interest per time period you receive, further increasing the balance on <b>your</b> <b>savings</b> account. This is the crowning principle of retirement planning schemes, such as the American 401k pension system. In many cases however, there is a balancing loop to prevent the reinforcing behavior from occurring indefinitely.|$|E
