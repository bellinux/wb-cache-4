The agents learn from Modell's physical therapist that the Little Sisters of Charity, {{who try to}} visit all the hospitalized inmates, have been seeing Modell. Modell calls the prison and talks to Mulder, who refuses to listen. The call is traced to a sports shop in Occoquan, Virginia where a Carbo-Bar wrapper is left on the counter.

40|$|This {{research}} maps {{a six-year}} journey of my {{experience as an}} English teacher for <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> detention. In the detention classroom, I experienced a wide gap between the institutional demands of detention, rehabilitation, and education {{on the one hand}} and the educational experiences of students on the other. The study employs post-feminist and poststructural reading practices to examine historical discourses constitutive of detention and its impact on the education of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> detention. Using post-critical autoethnography, I present my understanding of the life-stories of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> detention to attend to my troubling awareness that students’ life-stories are neither acknowledged, nor are they condoned in detention, rehabilitation, and education. Students’ lived experiences trouble my own life-stories on multiple levels. Students’ autobiographical writing complicates simplistic understandings of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> detention as a naturalized, gendered, and universal category. The research suggests an epistemological shift <b>in</b> the way <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> detention are understood; a shift that calls into question all forms of centeredness, essentialism, and universality that engender exclusion. A shift such as this does not claim any epistemological or ontological primacy; rather, it offers space for rethinking the life-stories of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> detention differently, therefore, re-envisioning education in detention. ...|$|R

Soon after, Javed also must marry for his father's happiness. Aradhana comes to the wedding to see him one last time. During the vows, Javed realises Aradhana is wearing a widow's clothes and stops the wedding, insisting on marrying Aradhana.|$|E
5|$|There {{was nothing}} to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat's arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he {{received}} £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was {{the largest number of}} separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.|$|E

25|$|Depictions of bondage in art may be erotic, {{in which}} case they follow a heteronormative model and tend to depict a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> danger and fear. Bizarre was a fetish and bondage {{magazine}} published between 1946–1959 by bondage artist John Willie. It included drawings and photographs using professional bondage models in bondage or sadomasochistic scenes. Sweet Gwendoline was the main female character in his works, published largely in the 1950s and 60's, and possibly the most famous bondage icon after Bettie Page. She was repeatedly depicted as the stereotypical naïve blonde damsel in distress.|$|E

Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman {{remained}} his lover for over fifteen years and gave birth to his son Adeodatus, who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries. In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress.

25|$|Less {{than two}} months after the murder of Dawn Basom, on June 9, three teenage boys {{discovered}} a partially nude body of a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> a field close to an abandoned farmhouse on North Territorial Road. The victim had received multiple slash and stab wounds to the body (including two stab wounds which had pierced her heart), and a gunshot wound to the forehead before her neck had been cut through to the spine. The victim's right thumb had also received a gunshot wound, suggesting the woman had instinctively raised her hand to protect herself before her killer had fired the gun at point-blank range. She had also been raped, although the pathologist was unable to determine whether this act had occurred before or after death. Sections of her clothing were scattered around her body, although one of her shoes was missing.|$|E
