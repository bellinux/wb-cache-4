2500|$|Broken Morning (2003) {{was based}} on Chiori Miyagawa's {{interviews}} with Texas death row inmates. She interviewed not only inmates, but also the guards, family members, and victims surrounding the Huntsville State Prison. It premiered at the HERE Arts Center. Nytheater.com praised the work, “Broken Morning is compelling storytelling of the highest order; it will cause <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions, to challenge your assumptions, and to reconsider what you thought you knew about fundamental social issues.” ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{prospective}} memory; event-based and time based. [...] Event-based prospective memory is when an environmental cue prompts you to carry out a task. [...] An example is when seeing a friend reminds <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him a question. In contrast, time-based prospective memory occurs when you remember to carry out a task at a specific time. [...] An example of this is remembering to phone your sister on her birthday. [...] Time-based prospective memory is more difficult than event-based prospective memory because there is no environmental cue prompting one to remember to carry out the task at that specific time.|$|E
2500|$|Berlusconi owns via Mediaset 3 of 7 {{national}} TV channels: (Canale 5, Italia 1, and Rete 4). [...] In 2002, Luciano Violante, {{a prominent}} {{member of the}} Left, {{said in a speech}} in Parliament: [...] "Honourable Anedda, I invite <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed— that TV stations would not be touched. He knows it and the Honourable Letta knows it." [...] The authors of the book Inciucio cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the Constitutional Court of Italy that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.|$|E
