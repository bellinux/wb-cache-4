5|$|The {{progressive}} {{movement in}} the United States was at its height during the early 20th century.

2500|$|Levin {{describes}} {{the stages of}} the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and his dissociation from the love triangle. As the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> departs,the poet {{will have a chance}} to rekindle his love with the Dark Lady:"the fair <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is fulfilled in his marriage, creating the possibility, however remote, that the speaker, in the absence of his young rival, will be granted restorative sexual relations with the mistress". The question of who is being loved by whom within the love triangle is quite controversial. Levin states that the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and the poet are competing for the Dark Lady's affection. Sauer, on the other hand, claims that there is a connection between the love of the Dark lady for the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and the love of the poet for the Dark Lady and the <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> Sonnet 154 addresses the love that the poet has for this <b>young</b> <b>man</b> in which the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> becomes the Dark Lady's fixture of desire. Sauer states that the Dark Lady may have stolen this <b>young</b> <b>man</b> away from the poet as the [...] " [...] <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> or Lovely boy becomes the subject of desire for the Dark Lady, too, and the poet feels increasingly alienated as the Dark Lady 'steals' the Fair <b>Young</b> <b>Man</b> from him". Levin on the other hands states that the poet feels that the Dark lady may have run off with the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and left him with his desire for her that is unfulfilled [...] "for the poet, the Dark Lady becomes the occasion for fiction making: she becomes the emblem of unchecked desire, passion, and frustration, but also a symbol of mystery".|$|R

5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E
50|$|A game {{is usually}} {{conducted}} as follows. A <b>young</b> <b>man</b> on horseback waits at a starting line. A young woman, also mounted, starts her horse galloping from a given distance behind the <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> When the <b>young</b> woman passes the <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> he may start his horse galloping. The two race towards a finish line some distance ahead. If the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> {{is able to}} catch up to the young woman before they reach the finish line, he may reach out to her and steal a kiss, which constitutes victory. However, if the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> has not caught up to the young woman by the time they reach the finish line, the young woman turns around and chases the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> back to the starting line. If she is in range of the <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> she may use her whip to beat him, which signifies a victory for her.|$|R

The <b>young</b> <b>man</b> tended to him so well that he soon got well and, in gratitude, promised his daughter in marriage to the <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> As soon as they returned to the village, the headman went back on his promise, asking the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> to produce a witness in support of his claim.|$|R
