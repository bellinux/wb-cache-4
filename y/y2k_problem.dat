5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted <b>Y2K</b> <b>problem</b> causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E
25|$|The {{company did}} not exist anymore when the Year 2000 problem, {{also known as the}} <b>Y2K</b> <b>problem</b> or {{millennium}} bug, made headline news. Fortunately PCBoard only had a few minor problems with the year 2000 (and 2001) and fixes were made available by several individuals.|$|E
25|$|Although {{only two}} digits are {{allocated}} {{for the birth}} year in the Bulgarian national identification number, the year 1900 problem and subsequently the <b>Y2K</b> <b>problem</b> were addressed {{by the use of}} unused values above 12 in the month range. For all persons born before 1900, the month is stored as the calendar month plus 20, and for all persons born after 1999, the month is stored as the calendar month plus 40.|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil {{explains}} that in 1999 computers {{are essential to}} most facets of life, yet he predicts no major disruption related to the then-pending <b>Y2K</b> <b>problem.</b> He says computers are narrow-minded and brittle so far, but suggests in specific domains they are showing signs of intelligence. As examples Kurzweil cites computer generated or assisted music, and tools for the automatic or semi-automatic production of literature or poetry. He shows examples of paintings by AARON as programmed by Harold Cohen which can be automatically created. Kurzweil reviews some of his predictions from The Age of Intelligent Machines and various past presentations, and is very pleased with his record. Finally he predicts a new Luddite movement as intelligent machines take away jobs, although he predicts {{a net gain of}} new and better jobs.|$|E
500|$|On December 31, 1999, Quahog {{prepares for}} New Year's Day (which {{is the last}} New Year's Day of the {{millennium}}), and the family has been invited to Joe's millennium party. At a store, {{a man in a}} chicken suit asks Peter if he wants a coupon, but Peter refuses, recalling the time he got a bad coupon from Ernie the Giant Chicken and started a massive fistfight. The man then warns Peter that the world will end because of the <b>Y2K</b> <b>problem,</b> so Peter locks himself and the family in their basement in hazmat suits. Just after midnight, the Y2K bug hits, causing a worldwide nuclear attack The Griffins remain unharmed, and as they look for survivors, they discover that Joe has been melted into his driveway, his son Kevin has been vaporized, and Quagmire and Cleveland have been stitched together and are now called [...] "Clevemire" [...] (or [...] "Quagland"), and Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons have eaten Tricia Takanawa. Starving, Peter immediately eats all the dehydrated meals, without adding water. Peter recalls that the snack food Twinkies are the only food that can survive a nuclear holocaust, so the family travels to Natick, Massachusetts, in hopes that the Twinkie factory has survived.|$|E

5000|$|The county {{became a}} {{destination}} for {{those involved in the}} counterculture during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly those who wanted to live in closer contact with nature. [...] In the late 1990s, the Rivendell community was established by a group of Christians so they could practice a lifestyle consistent with their Reformed Churches' interpretations of the Bible and also, in part, to be better isolated from possible societal disruptions caused by the <b>Y2K</b> computer <b>problem.</b> Most of the original members of this community have moved on.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Y2K</b> date <b>problem</b> hit Blue Wave, like so {{many other}} programs. The Blue Wave Reader that the end users use to read their mail {{exhibited}} the problem by the addition of a numerical digit leading the TO: name in the header. The Blue Wave Door on the BBS' exhibited the problem by creating three digit years where there should have been a two digit year. Several fixes not directly related to Blue Wave were created but they worked on the actual messages after they had been imported into the local message bases.|$|R
2500|$|The Year 2000 problem, {{also known}} as the <b>Y2K</b> <b>problem,</b> the Millennium bug, the Y2K bug, or Y2K, is a class of {{computer}} bugs related to the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates beginning in the year 2000. [...] Problems were anticipated, and arose, because twentieth-century software often represented the four-digit year with only the final two digits—making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.

500|$|On December 31, 1999, Dick Clark {{is celebrating}} New Year's Rockin' Eve in Springfield. Homer, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's Y2K {{compliance}} officer, declares that he fixed {{all the possible}} <b>Y2K</b> <b>problems</b> at the plant, including the computers. Unfortunately, Homer forgot to fix his own computer, {{and in the process}} sends a virus across the world. Chaos ensues, and widespread looting begins. Krusty's malfunctioning pacemaker apparently kills him in front of the family. Bart tearfully mourns his hero, but he perks up, after finding a note. The letter in Krusty's pocket states that a rocket (codenamed Exodus) is being populated with humanity's [...] "best and brightest", and will be launched in order to preserve human civilization on Mars. When they reach the shuttle, Homer fails to bluff his way on board by claiming to be the famous pianist from the film Shine but the armed guard recognizes Lisa as the ship's designated proofreader. Lisa is only able to take one parent with her, and quickly chooses Marge. Homer and Bart find a second, unguarded rocket and board just before it launches. They quickly notice that the spaceliner is filled with such notoriously obnoxious and mediocre celebrities as radio psychologist Dr. Laura, film director Spike Lee, skating champion Tonya Harding, former vice president Dan Quayle, grunge rock singer Courtney Love, politician Ross Perot, civil rights activist Al Sharpton, actor Tom Arnold, MTV VJ Pauly Shore, and actress/talk show host Rosie O'Donnell. Although the craft is headed directly for the sun, Homer and Bart eject themselves from the spacecraft and die of explosive decompression, to their relief.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the year}} 2000 <b>problem</b> (<b>Y2K)</b> was the focus of {{significant}} COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.|$|R

5000|$|In 1991, AT&T Corporation briefly owned NCR. During {{the same}} period, {{companies}} found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed {{at a fraction}} of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time. Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by personal computers. Consequently, demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government. In the early 1990s, there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks. InfoWorld's Stewart Alsop famously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996; in 1993, he cited Cheryl Currid, a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe [...] "will stop working on December 31, 1999", a reference to the anticipated Year 2000 <b>problem</b> (<b>Y2K).</b>|$|R
