6000|$|... "I {{think it}} {{a shame that}} you have not spoken to your wife for fifteen years. How do <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it?</b> How do you justify it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This mode of {{acquisition}} {{of new ideas}} was quite too much for Julius and Charlie, who both exploded; but Frank retained composure enough to ask, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> in person?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But why didn't <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all {{to me at}} {{the very}} first?" [...] I exclaimed, all tremulous. [...] "When you met me at Quebec, I mean--why didn't you tell me then? Did you and Elsie come there on purpose to meet me?" ...|$|E
60|$|CRAVEN. Well, yes <b>it</b> did. But <b>you</b> <b>explained</b> <b>it.</b> And now really, Charteris, I {{must say}} your {{explanation}} was in shocking bad taste before Julia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious! And {{that must}} be the ghost the natives believe in," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>explained</b> <b>it.</b> I can tell you I was startled." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. <b>You</b> <b>explained</b> how <b>it</b> came about. You did {{not tell}} {{me that it is}} still going on [She sits].|$|R
6000|$|... "Try? We'll do it! Now, Betts, <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> to both. You {{can do it}} {{smoother}} than I, {{and telling}} them is really the finest point of our little plot. I'll help the good work along afterwards. He'll be out presently. Nail him at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|He shook hands, but did {{not offer}} any further conversation. [...] "What a {{wonderful}} place!" [...] she said, looking round, {{with a view to}} making herself agreeable by taking an interest in everything. [...] "Wont <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all to me? To begin with, what is electricity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course that}} makes a difference," [...] Ralph agreed; [...] "it {{certainly}} didn't seem nice that Mabel and I, who are no relation by blood to Mr. Penfold, should come into the property that his sisters expected would be theirs. But, of course, now <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it,</b> it is different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humphrey, <b>you</b> must <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> to us. I am so {{interested}} in gardens I'm {{going to have one}} if Electrics increase their dividend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} {{right not to}} embarrass yourself," [...] she said, when I {{explained}} to her my immediate circumstances; [...] "but why did you make papa an offer which you cannot perform? He must remain here now till he hears from England. Had <b>you</b> <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> all at first, the ten napoleons would have carried us to Milan." [...] This was all true, and yet I thought it hard upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Holiday recreation, {{to which}} you can just condescend. I say, Phoebe, I have a great curiosity to {{understand}} the Zend. I wish <b>you</b> would <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{variegated}} thing, woman, sir," [...] remarked Quick, who was watching. (I {{think he}} meant to say [...] "variable.") [...] "This one, for instance, comes up that passage like a tired horse--shuffle, shuffle, shuffle--for I could hear the heels of her slippers on the floor. But now she goes out like a buck seeking its mate--head in air and hoof lifted. How do <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it,</b> Doctor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what are}} you doing here?" [...] I asked. [...] "It has been long years since you {{revisited}} Earth, and never before in the trappings of Mars. Lord! but it is good to see you--and not a day older in appearance than when you trotted me on your knee in my babyhood. How do <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it,</b> John Carter, Warlord of Mars, or do you try to explain it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Q. Will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> further?--A. Faith, at first, perhaps {{may have}} its {{excellency}} lie in view only, that is, in seeing where justification and salvation is; {{after that it}} may step a degree higher, {{and be able to}} say, it may be, or who can tell but I may obtain this salvation? again, it may perhaps go yet a step higher and arrive to some short and transient assurance (Heb 11:13; Joel 2:13,14; Zeph 2:3; Psa 30:7).[16] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am told, sir, {{that you}} are the bearer of a {{despatch}} from the Spanish general, Romana. Before I open <b>it,</b> will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> how <b>it</b> was that you came to be with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What IS the use {{of repeating}} all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle interrupted, 'if <b>you</b> don't <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> as <b>you</b> go on? It's {{by far the most}} {{confusing}} thing I ever heard!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{she replied}} gravely. [...] "But why have <b>you</b> not <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> to Bickley?" [...] Then waving {{her hand to}} show that she wished for no answer, she went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure thing. My landlady down Fratton way {{had some}} inquiries, and when I {{heard of it}} I guessed {{it was time for}} me to hustle. But what I want to know, mister, is how the coppers know these things? Steiner is the fifth man you've lost since I signed on with you, and I know the name of the sixth if I don't get a move on. How do <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it,</b> and ain't you ashamed to see your men go down like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "I {{always did}} justice to your good-heartedness, Allen; you're {{perfectly}} lovely that way; and I {{know that you}} would be sorry if you knew you had wounded my feelings, however accidentally." [...] She droops her head so as to catch a sidelong glimpse of his face, and sighs, while she nervously pinches the top of her parasol, resting the point on the floor. Mr. Richards makes no answer. [...] "That about the cigar-case might have been a mistake; I saw that myself, and, as <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it,</b> why, it was certainly very kind and very creditable to--to your thoughtfulness. It WAS thoughtful!" ...|$|E
60|$|So ends my story--or {{rather the}} story I have pieced {{together}} from information of a contradictory nature received. Whatever {{you make of}} it; whether with the Doctor <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> away; or whether with Professor Littlecherry, LL.D., F.R.S., you believe the world not altogether explored and mapped, {{the fact remains that}} Malvina of Brittany has passed away. To the younger Mrs. Raffleton, listening on the Sussex Downs to dull, distant sounds that make her heart beat, and very nervous of telegraph boys, has come already some of the disadvantages attendant on her new rank of womanhood. And yet one gathers, looking down into those strange deep eyes, that she would not change anything about her, even if now she could.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have found}} {{one thing that}} bothered us," [...] said Dick. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> can <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> In a locker we found a picture of Harold Bird and also {{a picture of his}} father." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [R.C.] No, dear Lord Augustus, <b>you</b> can't <b>explain</b> anything. <b>It</b> is your chief charm.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he knows}} that it is I who insist upon marrying <b>you!</b> I <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> all to him--how I had asked you. Of course he did not understand. He thinks, I suppose, that it is simply an infatuation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, John," [...] she exclaimed, {{her eyes}} lighting, [...] "I can believe that! How {{beautiful}} a thought! I see {{now what is}} meant when {{it is said that}} man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. That is the hourly guidance which is independent of the law. And how terrible to think that all the spiritual beauty of such a religion should have been hardened into chapter and verse and regulation. You have put into language what I think of Mr. Bentley,--that has acts are sacraments.... It is so simple when <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> this way. And yet I can see why it was said, too, that we must become as children to understand it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Explain! How can <b>you</b> <b>explain?</b> <b>It</b> is {{impossible}} to explain. I saw you {{with my own eyes}} making an exhibition of yourself with a horrible creature in salmon-pink. I'm not asking you who she is. I'm not questioning you about your relations with her at all. I don't care who she was. The mere fact that you were at a public restaurant with a person of that kind is enough. No doubt you think I am making a great deal of fuss about a very ordinary thing. You consider that it is a man's privilege to do these things, if he can do them without being found out. But it ended everything so far as I am concerned. Am I unreasonable? I don't think so. You steal off to America, thinking I am in England, and behave like this. How could you do that if you really loved me? It's the deceit of it that hurts me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{took her}} to the sofa: we sat side by side. She put her arm round my waist, and laid her head on my shoulder. Again the faint smile flickered like a dying light on her lovely face; wan and wasted, yet still beautiful--still the Virgin's face in Raphael's picture. [...] "We are a strange pair," [...] she said, with a {{momentary}} flash of her old irresistible humour. [...] "You are my bitterest enemy, and you burst out crying over me the moment we meet. I have been shockingly treated by you--and I have got my arm round your waist and my head on your shoulder, and I wouldn't let go of you for the world!" [...] Her face saddened again; her voice suddenly altered its tone. [...] "Tell me," [...] she went on, [...] "how is it that appearances were so terribly against you? Oscar satisfied me, at Ramsgate, that I ought to give you up, that I ought never to see you again. I took his view--there is no denying it, my dear--I agreed with him in detesting you, for a little while. But, when the blindness came back, I could keep it up no longer. Little by little, as the light died out, my heart would turn to you again. When I heard your letter read, when I knew that you were near me--it was just like the old times; I was mad to see you. And here I am--satisfied, before <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> to me, that you have been the victim of some terrible mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My son Nigel is all right, sir, {{and so is}} {{your man}} Moses. Make your mind easy--an' pray don't speak while I'm working at <b>you.</b> I'll <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all in good time. Stay, I'll {{be with you in}} a moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite an {{interesting}} game," [...] said Bayliss. [...] "But I find, now that <b>you</b> have <b>explained</b> <b>it,</b> sir, {{that it is}} familiar to me, though I have always known it under another name. It is played {{a great deal in}} this country." ...|$|R
3000|$|The tightrope {{walk for}} {{economic}} policy advisors in communicating with policymakers are well summarised {{by the following}} two well-known statements attributed to Albert Einstein: “If <b>you</b> can’t <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> simply, <b>you</b> don’t understand it well enough” and “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|The {{saying was}} in popular usage prior to 1912, {{as it appears}} in the {{transcript}} of the Titanic Inquiry: [...] 6341. Then was it that watertight door, which {{you see on the}} plan is in the alleyway, which is in front of your room? - I am not sure, but I think it is No. 23 door.6342. I do not know their numbers, but was it the one just forward of your room? - Yes, in the alleyway.6343. And you actually saw them doing that? - Yes, they were working on it.6344. You are quite right; it is No. 23 door? - We used to call it the skidoo door, on account of the number. That is how I remember the number.6345. (The Commissioner.) I do not understand that? - It is an American joke.6346. Will <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it?</b> - I could not explain it, my Lord.6347. (The Solicitor-General.) At any rate it connects No. 23 with something about skidoo? - Yes.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{commercial}} {{aired in}} September 1988; the voice-over narration began with: [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it?</b> A woman in Wisconsin {{is doing the}} dishes, while suddenly she has a feeling that her daughter has been just been in an accident. She gets a desperate phone call and finds out her feeling has just become true. How can you explain that various {{people around the world}} - who had never met before - had encounters with beings from outer space and their descriptions of the creature match almost exactly (sketch art of grey aliens appear on screen during this narration)? That's why Time Life books presents a remarkable new series, Mysteries of the Unknown, which takes a clear and comprehensive look at our own untapped capabilities. Maybe no one can explain these things but they can no longer be ignored. How can you explain this? Four men enter a ring of trees and without warning one is grabbed by an unseen force, lifted five feet in the air, and suspended for thirty seconds." [...] Images of Stonehenge and a picture of bloody hands on a window are shown.|$|E
5000|$|Exhausted and depressed, Buchman {{took his}} doctor's {{advice of a}} long holiday abroad. Still in turmoil over his hospice resignation, Buchman {{attended}} the 1908 Keswick Convention hoping to meet the renowned Quaker-influenced, Baptist evangelist F. B. Meyer (1847-1929) who he believed {{might be able to}} help him. Meyer was not there, but in a small half-empty chapel he listened to Jessie Penn-Lewis preach on the Cross of Christ, which led to a religious experience."I thought of those six men back in Philadelphia who I felt had wronged me. They probably had, but I'd got so mixed up in the wrong that I was the seventh wrong man.... I began to see myself as God saw me, which was a very different picture than the one I had of myself. I don't know how <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it,</b> I can only tell you I sat there and realized how my sin, my pride, my selfishness and my ill-will, had eclipsed me from God in Christ.... I was the center of my own life. That big 'I' had to be crossed out. I saw my resentments against those men standing out like tombstones in my heart. I asked God to change me and He told me to put things right with them. It produced in me a vibrant feeling, as though a strong current of life had suddenly been poured into me and afterwards a dazed sense of a great spiritual shaking-up." [...] Buchman wrote six letters of apology to the board members asking their forgiveness for harboring ill will. Buchman regarded this as a foundation experience and in later years frequently referred to it with his followers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope it'll all go smooth, I'm sure,' said Nidderdale. 'Thank you; I'm ever so much {{obliged to}} <b>you,</b> and I'll <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all to Carbury.' ...|$|R
60|$|So {{there we}} are with the human body. There must have been, and must be a central god in the machine of each animate corpus. The little soul of the beetle makes the beetle toddle. The little soul of the homo sapiens sets him on his two feet. Don't ask me to define the soul. You might as well ask a bicycle to define the young damsel who so whimsically and so god-like pedals her way along the highroad. A young lady skeltering off on her bicycle to meet her young man--why, what could the bicycle make of such a mystery, if <b>you</b> <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> till doomsday. Yet the bicycle wouldn't be {{spinning}} from Streatham to Croydon by itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{there has}} been no quarrel. I cannot <b>explain</b> to <b>you</b> now why I make this request; but to <b>you</b> I will <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> before I go." ...|$|R
