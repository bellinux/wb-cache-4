5|$|Do {{you know}} how to write a song? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> writing? If you're going to write for records, it goes like this: A, B, C, B, C, C. I don't know what you're doing. You're doing A, D, F, G, B, D, C. You don't know how to write a song... Have you ever listened to pop music? Have you ever heard any rock-and-roll music... You should go downstairs when you leave here... and buy some rock-and-roll records.|$|E
500|$|Author Brandon Friedman, also {{a combat}} veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at VetVoice: [...] "The Hurt Locker is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will {{certainly}} keep most viewers {{on the edges}} of their seats. But if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me." [...] Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying [...] "in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up. We can cover more ground that way.|$|E
2500|$|Gerson Saines brought Grandin {{to observe}} {{the last day of}} shooting, which was a scene {{involving}} a cattle dip tank that Grandin had designed. Although Grandin said that she tried to stay away from Danes to avoid impinging on her performance, she was quite concerned about the proper construction of the tank and about the breed of cattle being used in the scene. [...] "I thought, we can't have a silly thing like that City Slickers movie, where they had Holstein cattle out there," [...] Grandin said. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> cattle, you'd know that was stupid." [...] She said watching Danes on the monitors was [...] "like going back in a weird time machine to the '60s." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I had {{intended}} to ask if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> him when {{the beginning of this}} carnage drove him and everything else out of my mind. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> where he is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Dr. May {{always comes}} {{to see the}} matches,' said Leonard. 'You will, won't you now, Miss May? I didn't think <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> cricket, {{but it will be}} all the better now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wade {{could only}} stare vacantly, hopelessly. After a pause the man {{continued}} {{in a less}} aggressive manner and more confidential tone, which, however, only increased her terror. [...] "I ain't sayin' that <b>YOU</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> this, ma'am, and whatever other folks might say when THEY know of it, I'll allers say that you didn't." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, she {{ran for the}} 14th District seat in the Ohio Senate {{to replace}} Senate President Doug White, who was retiring. The Senate seat {{included}} Clermont, Brown, Adams and Scioto counties and part of Lawrence County. Her opponent for the Republican nomination was Tom Niehaus, a fellow member of the Ohio House from New Richmond whose 88th District represented the half of Clermont County outside her district plus Brown and Adams Counties to the east. Schmidt told the Enquirer [...] "The fear {{from many of the}} people I meet is that because the next senator will come from Clermont County, they will be underrepresented. But if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> me, I don't under-represent anybody." [...] She also said she worried about the state budget: [...] "We do have a history of overspending in Ohio. But it's not just recent history. It's a 40-year-old habit." [...] The Enquirer was dismayed by advertisements from the Ohio Taxpayers Association [...] "twisting the two candidates' voting records to Schmidt's advantage" [...] and endorsed Niehaus.|$|E
2500|$|Ricky Bell sat out {{the game}} with a {{shoulder}} injury, and Darryl Carlton left the game early. Tampa Bay quarterbacks were sacked ten times (still a team record as of 2009), and threw three interceptions. Eddie Brown's 11 punt returns set an NFL single-game record, also still standing. John McKay reacted angrily to Washington tackle Bill Brundige's postgame remarks that McKay's USC offense wouldn’t work in the NFL. McKay called Brundige an [...] "idiot" [...] and a [...] "dumb tackle", and pointed out that the Redskins scored their first touchdown from the same formation. He then told reporters, [...] "none of <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> football", and chided them for asking why the Buccaneers were having trouble moving the ball, when they knew that several starters were out with injuries. The Tampa Bay defense held Washington to ten points, despite the Redskins’ eight possessions in Buccaneer territory. Washington players described it as {{among the best in the}} league, and coach George Allen said it was [...] "of championship caliber". [...] The 18th consecutive loss tied the Buccaneers with the 1972–1973 Houston Oilers for the third longest NFL losing streak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> {{the hunting}} in that direction?" [...] {{questioned}} Randy, pointing {{to where the}} old Parkingham house was located.|$|E
6000|$|... "But none of <b>you</b> fellows <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the business," [...] said Harry. [...] "Kate and I got up the company, and we needn't {{have had}} a Board of Directors at all, if we hadn't wanted to. If any of <b>you</b> boys had <b>known</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> {{telegraphs}} we would have given you an office." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. PEARCE. Why not! But <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> her. What {{about her}} parents? She may be married.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{must have}} had a wagon to take away all the old man says he has lost," [...] Teddy's {{informant}} added, as the story was concluded, [...] "and because of that the justice refused to issue a warrant for the man who slept at the hotel last night. Of course the idea that <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it was all in that old fool's eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{generally}} do guess {{as much as}} that, when young gentlemen find young ladies divine. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Miss Dormer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So are you--to-morrow, by {{the first}} train. I wonder how soon we can get married. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> special licenses?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good! Good!" [...] whispered Lingard, excitedly, off {{his guard}} for once. Then--"How the devil do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jethro Bass lives there, doesn't he" [...] said Mr. Duncan, with a laugh. [...] "But I suppose <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> politics." ...|$|R
6000|$|Devine laughed. [...] "Now, if you {{had told}} me <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> engineering, <b>you</b> would have given {{yourself}} away. Have {{you never heard of}} an aerial tramway? It's quite simple--a steel rope set up tight, a winch for hauling, and a trolley. With that working, and a skid-slide up the gully, one could send over the props we want without much difficulty. It would be cheaper than buying off the timber-righters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was struck}} {{when he saw}} me--said I was {{somebody}} else with my mustache shaved off, and a lot more. He finally told me about you, and said you {{had told him about}} a crazy nurse and a lost child, and so I made up my mind to find you, if I could, and see if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> my past." [...] Dave's lips began to quiver again. [...] "Can you tell me anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam Rover!" [...] exclaimed the girl. [...] "And Will Jackson! Whatever {{brought you}} here? Where is Songbird--do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't think <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it,' said Mrs. Frost, 'but there, that's {{the last}} I shall say. You'll forgive your old aunt.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was {{corresponding}} with another! I {{dare say}} she was; {{with half a}} dozen at once. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it, Miss Gaunt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trouble with}} you people is <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> any other city. You {{come in here}} from Oshkosh and Kalamazoo, and Okookono--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Because I am {{very fond}} of them. But O! I forgot what we are to pretend. No, <b>you</b> needn’t <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> them; never mind.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, Eva; you {{are only}} a child! <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> these things," [...] said Marie; [...] "besides, your talking makes my head ache." ...|$|R
6000|$|What about Harper's Ferry? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it? How {{certain is}} your {{information}} about Bragg {{being in the}} valley of the Shenandoah? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> this Chilian business?” Lord Cochrane asked Stephen as {{they walked}} up and down the deck {{together}} on the following morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe you're {{just the}} man I want to see," [...] I said. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Holtzmann's private {{affairs in the}} East?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Alton, [...] "you will by and by, and I'm {{going to}} buy three or four new saw-fixings to-day. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> bookkeeping, Charley?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see as it matters," [...] she answered, puzzled. [...] "He didn't come, and <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> him. But, of course, if {{you want}} me to say nothing--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see,"--still {{under her}} pretty eyelids, and the tender {{promise of a}} smile parting her little mouth,--"I'm believing that you tell the truth when you say <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From the Old Country," [...] he {{said with}} a laugh, [...] "and a bit high-handed, but there's sand in him. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Allenwood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, for you; do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the negro, {{apparently}} a cripple, aboard here? Is he, {{or is he}} not, what he seems to be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} {{you can give me}} a piece of information," [...] I said to the landlord. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the Count Salvi-Scarabelli?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care much}} about Peterson and McGlow," [...] he said. [...] "They are tough customers. I would rather have heard from Peabody, Dickson, and Fearwell. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MABEL CHILTERN. You silly Arthur! If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>about</b> [...] . <b>anything,</b> {{which you}} don’t, <b>you</b> would <b>know</b> that I adore you.

I have been going about {{for the last six}} months telling the whole of society that I adore you. I wonder you consent to have anything to say to me. I have no character left at all. At least, I feel so happy that I am quite sure I have no character left at all.|$|R
6000|$|Northwick had {{apparently}} not expected this; but he let {{no more than}} the fact appear. He kept silent for a time; then he said, [...] "And <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the way they're living?" ...|$|R
