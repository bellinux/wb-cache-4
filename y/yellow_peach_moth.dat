40|$|Suitability {{of plant}} tissues as food for insects varies from plant to plant. In {{lepidopteran}} insects, fitness is largely {{dependent on the}} host-finding ability of the females. Existing {{studies have suggested that}} polyphagous lepidopterans preferentially select certain host plant species for oviposition. However, the mechanisms for host recognition and selection have not been fully elucidated. For the polyphagous <b>yellow</b> <b>peach</b> <b>moth</b> Conogethes punctiferalis, we explored the effect of chestnut cultivar on the performance and fitness and addressed the mechanisms of plant-volatile-mediated host recognition. By carrying out laboratory experiments and field investigation on four chestnut Castanea mollissima cultivars (Huaihuang, Huaijiu, Yanhong, and Shisheng), we found that C. punctiferalis females preferentially select Huaijiu for oviposition and infestation, and caterpillars fed on Huaijiu achieved slightly greater fitness than those fed on the other three chestnut cultivars, indicating that Huaijiu was a better suitable host for C. punctiferalis. Plant volatiles played important roles in host recognition by C. punctiferalis. All seven chestnut volatile compounds, α-pinene, camphene, β-thujene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, 3 -carene, and nonanal, could trigger EAG responses in C. punctiferalis. The ubiquitous plant terpenoids, α-pinene, camphene and β-pinene, and their specific combination at concentrations and proportions similar to the emissions from the four chestnut cultivars, was sufficient to elicit host recognition behavior of female C. punctiferalis. Nonanal and a mixture containing nonanal, that mimicked the emission of C. punctiferalis infested chestnut fruits, caused avoidance response. The outcome demonstrates the effects of chestnut cultivars on the performance of C. punctiferalis and reveals the preference-performance relationship between C. punctiferalis adults and their offspring. The observed olfactory plasticity in the plant-volatile-mediated host recognition may be important for the forming of the relationship between <b>yellow</b> <b>peach</b> <b>moth</b> and chestnuts since it allows the polyphagous herbivores to adjust to variation in volatile emission from their host plants...|$|E
40|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>peach</b> <b>moth</b> (YPM), Conogethes punctiferalis (Guenée), is a {{multivoltine}} {{insect pest}} of crops and fruits. Antennal-expressed receptors {{are important for}} insects to detect olfactory cues for host finding, mate attraction and oviposition site selection. However, few olfactory related genes were reported in YPM until now. In the present study, we sequenced and characterized the antennal transcriptomes {{of male and female}} YPM. In total, 15 putative odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 46 putative odorant receptors (ORs) and 7 putative ionotropic receptors (IRs) were annotated and identified as olfactory-related genes of C. punctiferalis. Further analysis of RT-qPCR revealed that all these olfactory genes are primarily or uniquely expressed in male and female antennae. Among which, 3 OBPs (OBP 4, OBP 8 and PBP 2) and 4 ORs (OR 22, OR 26, OR 44 and OR 46) were specially expressed in male antennae, whereas 4 ORs (OR 5, OR 16, OR 25 and OR 42) were primarily expressed in female antennae. The predicted protein sequences were compared with homologs in other lepidopteran species and model insects, which showed high sequence homologies between C. punctiferalis and O. furnacalis.

40|$|The {{non-polar}} {{components of}} female body wax and pheromone gland extracts of the <b>yellow</b> <b>peach</b> <b>moth</b> synergistically enhanced male behavioral responses from close to pheromone sources in wind tunnel tests when mixed with an aldehyde pheromone blend. When the non-polar fractions (NPFs) of female body wax were further separated by column chromatography, synergistic activities {{were found in}} the 3 and 50 % ether in hexane fractions, and they additively increased male responses. The main components of the first fraction were (Z) - 9 -tricosene, (Z) - 9 -pentacosene, (Z) - 9 -heptacosene, (Z) - 9 -nonacosene and (Z) - 9 -hentriacontene. Only (Z) - 9 -heptacosene showed a significant synergistic effect in enhancing male responses, but the other components had no effect. A mixture of the five monoenyl hydrocarbons lost activity at lower doses than 5 ng. Natural ratios of these hydrocarbons in the female body wax and pheromone gland extracts were similar, but the amount of (Z) - 9 -heptacosene in the female body wax was significantly higher than in the pheromone gland extracts. We conclude that (Z) - 9 -heptacosene increases male responses to aldehyde pheromones, and unknown component(s) in the 50 % ether in the hexane fraction are required for full synergistic enhancement by the NPFs of the female body wax and the pheromone gland extracts...|$|E

In this study, the contents of internal quality with different maturity differ greatly; Total Sugar Content (TSC) is 3. 828 - 26. 37 %, Total Acid Content (TAC) is 0. 383 - 0. 961 %, Soluble Solids Content (SSC) is 9. 1 - 12. 9 ° Brix and water content is 81. 211 - 90. 752 %. We analyzed the correlation between TSC, TAC, SSC and water content and the two indices of spectral data. These were the reciprocal-logarithm-transformed reflectance (log (1 /R)) and the first-order derivative of reciprocal-logarithm-transformed reflectance (dlog (1 /R)). The results showed that the spectra of <b>yellow</b> <b>peach</b> had common spectral characteristics and the pattern of the absorption curves was similar to that for other fruits. The first-order derivative of reciprocal-logarithm-transformed reflectance (dlog (1 /R)) showed stronger correlation for some wavelengths. These wavelengths with stronger correlation were selected for the sensitive wavelengths and were used for the model calibration based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). TSC, TAC, SSC and water content of <b>yellow</b> <b>peach</b> were predicted at each sampling point using the multiple line models. Overall, although the TAC determination still needs to be improved, the determination of TSC, SSC and water content in <b>yellow</b> <b>peach</b> fruits by ASD near-infrared spectral analysis (350 - 2500 nm) was still successful (R 2 > 0. 61) and the corresponding RMSEs of 2. 32, 0. 44 and 0. 85 %, respectively, showing that the spectroscopy has the ability to rapidly and non-destructively determine the internal quality of <b>yellow</b> <b>peach...</b>|$|R
40|$|Four trienyl hydrocarbons, (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9) -tricosatriene (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 23 :HC), (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9) -pentacosatriene (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 25 :HC), (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9) -heptacosatriene (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 27 :HC), and (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9) -nonacosatriene (Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 29 :HC) were {{identified}} in a non-polar fraction of the body wax {{of male and female}} <b>yellow</b> <b>peach</b> <b>moth,</b> Conogethes punctiferalis. The relative amounts and ratios of these hydrocarbons differed between sexes. In females, the ratios in body wax and pheromone gland extracts were similar, with lesser amounts found in gland extracts. Synergistic effects of these hydrocarbons when added to the known aldehyde pheromone components were assessed in wind tunnel tests. A blend of (E) - 10 -hexadecenal (E 10 - 16 : Ald) and (Z) - 10 -hexadecenal (Z 10 - 16 : Ald) elicited upwind flight and orientation of males to the pheromone source, but arriving males did not remain close to source for very long. Among the hydrocarbons identified, only Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 23 :HC enhanced the activity of the aldehyde blend by increasing the time spent close to the source and the number of source contacts. Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 23 :HC and (Z 9) -heptacosene (Z 9 - 27 :HC) also increased close-range responses to the aldehyde blend. The activity of the aldehyde blend plus these two hydrocarbons was similar to that of crude pheromone extract. Positive dose-response relationships between the aldehyde blend and two hydrocarbon mixtures were found. The lowest doses that elicited synergism were 10 − 1 female equivalents (of body wax extracts) for the two hydrocarbons, and 10 − 2 female equivalents for the total unsaturated hydrocarbon mixture...|$|E
