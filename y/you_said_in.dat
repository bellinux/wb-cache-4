Then he turned his face and marked out another spot on the floor, after which he started to cry and say: [...] "O Allah! Indeed, <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> Your Book [...] "Verily, Allah forgives not that {{partners}} should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives everything else to whom He wills" [...] Therefore, O Allah, make me amongst those You will forgive".|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E

6000|$|Soames, whose {{good sense}} applauded his sister's acumen, said grudgingly: [...] "Well, I'll go round. Have <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} <b>in</b> Park Lane?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] <b>said</b> Mr. Heard, <b>in</b> quieter tones; [...] "I {{dare you}} to come along to the harbor and jump in, just as you are, where <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> jumped <b>in</b> after me. They'll soon see who's telling the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Try us and see," [...] said Tom. Then {{he raised}} his voice. [...] "Harris, bring up that brace of pistols <b>you</b> <b>said</b> were <b>in</b> the locker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, Kenneth, I cannot stay long--I {{shall be}} missed. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your letter {{that you had}} {{something}} important to talk of. What is it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me {{what is it}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> {{that famous}} letter which so upset Mrs Fyne, and caused little Fyne to {{interfere}} in this offensive manner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I feel as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your letter, Frank. There IS {{something}} tragic in it. It {{will be with}} me for ever. All {{the future}} will arrange itself round that little ring.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, Hawkswing, {{what was}} the name o' the rascally trader <b>you</b> <b>said</b> was <b>in</b> charge o' this fort when you lived here?" [...] asked Redhand.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘We {{will take}} one more turn before going in,’ said Mr. Crisparkle, ‘for I {{want to ask you}} a question. When <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were <b>in</b> a changed mind {{concerning}} me, you spoke, not only for yourself, but for your sister too?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{smile with}} which he met this appeal was not, {{it was to be}} feared, robust. [...] "What haven't <b>you,</b> love, <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing. But I {{know how}} I was myself when I was a girl. I used almost {{to die of}} hunger for {{something}} to happen. Can you remember just what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your letter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{memory of}} what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the garden is better than yours," [...] she {{reminded}} him. [...] "You said 'Happen what may in the interval, I trust the future.' Do you feel the same trust still?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And that's a fine {{thing to}} do, and manly too,' said Nicholas, 'though it's {{not exactly what}} we {{understand}} by [...] "coming Yorkshire over us" [...] in London. Miss Squeers is stopping with you, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your note.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} grandmother, [...] "I {{do not think}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it <b>in</b> a fretful or {{impatient}} spirit; but I thought that this story of Samuel would help to keep you patient and contented." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>in</b> 1917," [...] was the dry reminder. [...] "I did {{not come}} here, however, to talk world {{politics}} with you. Those things for the moment are finished. I came in answer to your summons." ...|$|R
60|$|Tow. <b>You</b> have <b>said</b> all <b>in</b> that, my Isabinda, if {{she still}} be so.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{your love}} {{was a great}} love; there was none greater," [...] she continued; [...] "or so <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the rose garden. Yet it is not fine enough, large enough, to forgive me here, crying now at your feet?" ...|$|E
60|$|NED. [Earnestly.] Loretta is an exception, I confess. She is {{all that}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your letter. She is a little fairy, an angel. I never dreamed of {{anything}} like her. It is remarkable to find such a woman in this age.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so are you," [...] Julia {{retorted}} swiftly. [...] "What was it <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> Chicago {{about the}} phrase-makers?--the Socialism that {{flourished in the}} study while women and children starved in the streets? Those are the sort {{of things that we}} remember, Aaron and I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} about the compass; <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it was <b>in</b> a nice little box. They use things like that on small yachts and boats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, it's all right, uncle, when we're {{going to}} be married so soon," [...] said Gideon. [...] "You know <b>you</b> <b>said</b> so {{yourself}} <b>in</b> the houseboat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let it rest at that. I'll bear what <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> mind, {{and maybe}} some day I'll come back to it. I expect you meant kindly by {{speaking}} to me like this. Now I'll be getting home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't resign myself. I shall do what I can against it. What is {{the good}} of calling the people's wickedness Providence? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your letter it was Mr. Lassman's fault we had lost our money. Has he run away with it all?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seems as}} if I must have been insane when I wrote that speech and saw no harm in it, no disrespect toward those men whom I reverenced so much. And what shame I brought upon you, after what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> {{introducing}} me! It burns me like fire to think of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's your story--and you've {{been trying}} to lay the thing at my door. But I shan't stand it--not me," [...] stormed Haskett. [...] "I heard what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your sleep, and so did Cal Blinker. If anybody is guilty, it is you!" [...] And he pointed his long, bony finger full in Walter's face.|$|E
50|$|Folks {{will perform}} their second Camp Fire event in Sapporo on September 20, {{alongside}} bands Asobius and <b>You</b> <b>Said</b> Something. <b>In</b> December, they will extend Camp Fire to have concerts in Osaka and Tokyo, {{as well as}} holding their first solo concert on December 23 in Sapporo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Part of what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> was <b>in</b> the {{following}} words: `Mark what I say. I will sell this knoll to your father, and give {{my daughter to}} you, when you take that house, and with your own unaided hands {{place it on the}} top of this knoll!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish it, {{because it}} would have made what I was going to propose much easier to do than it is now. Indeed I will not propose it, {{although}} I came on purpose, after what <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your frankness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Roland. I {{could tell}} you the stocks to which they belonged, but not the numbers. And, so far as I know, there is but one way of doing so besides that of obtaining the list {{from one of the}} directors, which, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your letter Mr. Fernlea thinks would be {{dangerous}} to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (with an embarrassed laugh). Thanks. Well, I've {{certainly}} {{told you}} all of them. You're the only one---- (He stops and abruptly changes the subject.) <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> your note that you had something important to tell me. (He sits down beside her, crossing his legs.) Is it about your interview with Old Mrs. Grundy this afternoon? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't you remember, ma'am? We walked {{some way}} {{together}} towards Overcombe {{earlier in the}} summer.' Matilda looked more closely, and perceived that the speaker was Derriman, in plain clothes. He continued, 'You {{are one of the}} ladies of the theatre, I know. May I ask why <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> such a queer way that you loved that couple?' ...|$|E
6000|$|You proceed, saying, 'It is my liberty, as well {{as others}} into whose hands it falls, to weigh what <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> truth's balance, and if it be found too light, to reject it whether you will or no.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Ellison, {{we shall}} be obliged if you will enter the witness box again. In your former evidence, Mr. Ellison, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>in</b> any way {{relating}} to the prisoner; but it now seems you had a previous acquaintance with him. Will you tell the court what it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I told Ana aught {{that he did}} not know? Did not Ana {{hear the}} last words <b>you</b> <b>said</b> to me <b>in</b> the temple of Amon at Tanis?" ...|$|R
