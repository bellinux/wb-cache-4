And power." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E

500|$|Paul's sixteenth CD, The Day After Everything Changed, was {{released}} on January 12, 2010. Rather than work with a record label, Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation. [...] Although Paul wasn't sure {{what to expect when}} the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian Bush that includes a duet on the track, [...] "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan support inspired him to make [...] "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: [...] "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture." [...] In her review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said that the CD is [...] "a masterwork filled with the best music and lyrics of his career." ...|$|E
500|$|Stewart, {{who earned}} $270,136 for the victory, {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the season, and his first at Talladega Superspeedway, {{in front of a}} crowd of 145,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim McCanlies {{was hired}} to write the script, though Bird was {{somewhat}} displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies {{decided to have a}} brief scene displaying his survival, stating, [...] "You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back." [...] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. [...] "didn't have time to mess with us" [...] as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as [...] "paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling." [...] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, [...] "I want to tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He’s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he’s developed The Iron Giant. I can’t stop thinking about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Weber {{complained of}} both the control exerted by {{consolidated}} studios, {{as well as the}} ever more strenuous censorship of the Hays Code: [...] "I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ... The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you can pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne.

[...] Politically, Baker has expressed disdain for both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, saying in 1998: [...] "When the Conservatives were in I cannot tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I hated them. But I realise how shallow I am because I now hate the Labour Party as much." ...|$|E

But in the end we'll be under 50. We'll be one disc." [...] Meyer also spoke {{of what it is}} like to work with the PlayStation platform stating [...] "I think it really helps. It's not even about sales. It's about what we can push on the platform and how far we can take it. I'm sure you'll hear this from every other Sony developer but you know, I can't tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we've been able to optimise Cell and you know, the amount of content we can put on Blu-ray." ...|$|E

2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E
2500|$|Edmund Burke, an English {{political}} thinker, {{was impressed}} by the work of Barruel in uncovering a connection between the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. Burke wrote a letter to Barruel and expressed his admiration. He wrote, [...] "I cannot easily express to <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I am instructed and delighted by the first volume of your History of Jacobinism." [...] He praised [...] "the whole of the wonderful narrative" [...] for being supported by documents and proofs with [...] "the most judicial regularity and exactness." [...] At the end of the letter Burke added: [...] "I forgot to say, that I have known myself, personally, five of your principal conspirators; and I can undertake to say from my own certain knowledge, that {{as far back as the}} year 1773, they were busy in the plot you have so well described, and in the manner, and on the principle you have so truly represented. To this I can speak as a witness." [...] Burkes own works were also filled with references to the philosophe sect and a dislike for their fanaticism, atheism and perversion of public morals.|$|E

2500|$|Another Spanish businessman, who {{supervised}} ABM's {{operations in}} Equatorial Guinea from 1995 to 1997, said Teodorín [...] "would call {{us to come}} to his office, which meant wearing a suit and tie.

We had to flee the country. He was demanding millions. The only ones who stayed were those who paid him." [...] Yet another Spanish firm, which was forced to work with a local company on whose board of directors Teodorin sat, [...] "had to pay commissions at every stage of the way" [...] and was confronted [...] "with permits and other obstacles"; after the firm had filled a warehouse with timber, one member of the firm was arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of rape, apparently a standard way of treating foreign businesspeople.
