However, she was fired from the tour by Jackson's manager after an incident {{during one of the}} performances in which she approached Jackson and kissed him onstage.|$|E

500|$|... "You Rock My World" [...] was {{performed}} twice live during the [...] performed in late 2001. In the second concert, {{he was joined}} by Usher and Chris Tucker at the end, who danced with him. It was the only full song from Invincible that Jackson had performed live. The song was set to be performed in his This Is It concerts on certain days replacing The Way <b>You</b> <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel,</b> but he died before the concerts took place.|$|E

500|$|The first {{recording}} {{that would}} feature on His Band and the Street Choir was [...] "I've Been Working", an out-take from the Astral Weeks sessions in 1968 and the Moondance sessions in 1969. The final version produced on His Band and the Street Choir is upbeat and shows {{the influence of}} James Brown. Morrison notably sings the line [...] "Woman, woman, woman, <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> alright" [...] in unison with the horn section, which Jon Landau describes as [...] "breathtaking".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Speechless" [...] deal with being lost for words because of love. The song opens with Jackson's singing acappella: [...] "Your love is magical, that's how I feel, but I have not the words here to explain", which Rick de Yampert of The Daytona Beach News-Journal felt the singer [...] " [...] sweetly". The chorus {{includes}} the lines, [...] "Speechless, speechless, that's how <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel.</b> Though I'm with you, I am {{far away and}} nothing is for real." [...] A second acappella verse bookends the track.|$|E
500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in {{love with}} is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, if only for a moment, that Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> could <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> {{personal}} interest in brickbats or--or spiders," [...] she said, with a quaint, relaxing smile. [...] "You were born to be a preacher, not a soldier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{him to do}} what I want now, {{not what}} he wants me. That's the only way when you love. Oh, don't smile like that, please; <b>you</b> do <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so--uncertain." ...|$|R

500|$|The remixes were premiered by Warner Bros. Records at the 2003 Winter Music Conference in Miami, where Peter Rauhofer, Rosario and Blow-Up {{played their}} remixes of [...] "Love Profusion". Blow-Up also debuted {{their own version}} of [...] "Good Boys" [...] (2003) by Blondie, and remixes of Madonna's {{previous}} single, [...] "Hollywood". An extended version of the [...] "Love Profusion" [...] remix, titled [...] "Headcleanr Rock Mix", was also included on Madonna's remix album Remixed & Revisited (2003). Michael Paoletta of Billboard named the remix (along with the [...] "Mount Sims Old School Mix" [...] of [...] "Nobody Knows Me") as the highlight of Remixed and Revisited, calling it [...] "a new-wave-styled-rock tune", a [...] "blast of fresh air" [...] and an [...] "essential listening experience". John Payne from LA Weekly compares the lyrics of the song ("Only <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> good") with the cautionary lyrics of [...] "X-Static Process", in which the protagonist loses herself in her lover's ego. The [...] "Headcleanr Rock Mix" [...] was included on the setlist during the rehearsals of Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately not included in the show.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] {{talks about}} the {{inability}} to fight what the heart wants, {{even if it is}} wrong. Beyoncé prostrates herself at the mercy of an indifferent love interest, telling him that she would rather die young than to live her life without him. Beyoncé also sings about leaving a legacy as she shows her [...] "epic" [...] neediness to her love interest, as stated by Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club. The music stays soft in the first verse, where Beyoncé likens her romantic interest to American actor James Dean, [...] "You're my James Dean / <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like I'm seventeen". She also relates about how good girls often fall for bad boys; she affirms that [...] "bad boy" [...] she loves, [...] "drive too fast" [...] and [...] "smoke too much". During the chorus, Beyoncé projects the image of a woman, who wants to love and be loved regardless of what others may say, [...] "I'd rather die young / Than live my life without you / Rather not live at all". As the song progresses, Beyoncé references [...] "some deeper emotional fires burning" [...] as she sings, [...] "Nobody understands what we've been through".|$|E
2500|$|The direct-to-video children's film The Wiggles: <b>You</b> <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> Like Dancing! {{includes}} a video {{for the song}} [...] "Shimmy Shake" [...] which depicts the group appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show. Paul Paddick portrayed Sullivan for the video.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will. It's {{because it}} <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> happy--it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> more than happy--to be with <b>you.</b> It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> {{comfortable}}. <b>You</b> know how selfish men are? If a man feels comfortable {{all over with}} certain people, he'll bore them to death, just like a dog. <b>You</b> always <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> as if pleasant {{things were going to}} happen to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|ELLIE. I don't {{understand}} how that can be. Are <b>you</b> trying to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> that I {{need not be}} grateful to you, so that I may choose freely? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For goodness' sake, old man, don't keep {{calling me}} 'Your Highness.' It may {{be fun to}} <b>you,</b> but it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> a perfect ass. Let me get into the thing gradually." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Michael Bearden, a {{film and}} music {{producer}} {{who worked on}} the concerts playing keyboard and acting as the concert's musical director, the setlist for the concerts was never finalized prior to Jackson's death. Most of the songs due to be featured in the concerts were showcased in Michael Jackson's This Is It, while the inclusion of several other songs were confirmed in the film's DVD special features. The songs showcased in the film included Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Jam, They Don't Care About Us, Human Nature, Smooth Criminal, The Way <b>You</b> <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel,</b> a medley of Jackson 5 songs including I Want You Back, The Love You Save, and I'll Be There, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Thriller, Beat It, Black or White, Earth Song, Billie Jean, Man in the Mirror, and Heal the World. Meanwhile, it was later confirmed that Stranger in Moscow, You Are Not Alone, You Rock My World, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, Rock With You, Dirty Diana, Dangerous, Bad, We Are the World, and Will You Be There were also being prepared for the concerts. In an interview with Larry King, Lady Gaga revealed that she was to perform a song called [...] "Pictures" [...] as the opening act for the concerts.|$|E

6000|$|... "I feel it, as <b>you</b> always <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> everything, {{just as you}} do; so that I know {{ten miles}} off how you feel! But do you remember," [...] she asked, [...] "apropos of great gold cups, the {{beautiful}} one, the real one, that I offered you so long ago and that you wouldn't have? Just before your marriage"--she brought it back to him: [...] "the gilded crystal bowl in the little Bloomsbury shop." ...|$|R
500|$|The arena rock chorus {{consist of}} the line, [...] ""Somethin' 'bout <b>you</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like a {{dangerous}} woman", with Grande repeating the phrase's {{beginning at the}} end of each line. The refrain is backed by distorted synths and the guitar riff present during the first verse. Following the second chorus, Grande sings the hook, [...] "All girls wanna be like that/Bad girls underneath, like that/You know how I'm feeling inside" [...] accompanied by an electronic riff reminiscent of trap music. A reviewer from Sputnikmusic noted that the track's lyrics are [...] "a cross between sexually charged and fully empowering." [...] Commenting about the lyrical content of [...] "Dangerous Woman", Grande stated: [...] "This song is about an empowered woman who meets another person that brings out a different side of her. It's her decision to put her fears aside and explore these new feelings. It's about letting someone into your life in an intimate and vulnerable way and not letting that take away from your independence and strength." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{people always}} sigh {{like that when}} they get to be sixteen?" [...] asked Jimmy curiously. [...] "You didn't sigh like that when you were only fifteen, Theodora. I wish <b>you</b> wouldn't. It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> funny--and it's not a nice kind of funniness either." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, Mary," [...] said Una, {{pushing a}} tender arm over Mary's uncompromising back, [...] "don't talk like that. I DO like you ever so much. And <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{right down}} {{pleased to meet}} you, Mistress Blythe; and I hope you'll be as happy as the first bride was who came here. I can't wish you no better than THAT. But your husband doesn't {{introduce}} me jest exactly right. 'Captain Jim' is my week-a-day name and {{you might as well}} begin as you're sartain to end up--calling me that. You sartainly are a nice little bride, Mistress Blythe. Looking at <b>you</b> sorter <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> that I've jest been married myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's it; you've hit it exactly. <b>You</b> always <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> better. I {{can rely}} on you. It's awkward {{soundings}} but you'll see me through it. We'll defeat him yet.... I may be an utterly worthless devil, but I'm not a brawler.... I told him so at breakfast. I said, [...] "Doctor, I detest brawling, but if ever you allow that girl to be insulted again as Clements insulted her, I will break your neck with my own hands." [...] You think I was right?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you</b> that <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> very ungrateful and unkind. I wish I {{could answer}} {{you as you}} want me to for, indeed, dear Mac, I'm very fond of you in my own way," [...] and Rose looked up with such tender pity and frank affection in her face, it was no wonder the poor fellow caught at a ray of hope and, {{brightening}} suddenly, said in his own odd way: [...] "Couldn't you take me on trial while you are waiting for a true hero? It may be years before you find him; meantime, you could be practicing on me in ways that would be useful when you get him." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{question}} wounded me. [...] "My dear uncle," [...] I exclaimed, [...] "I {{know you}} do not intend it, but <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> unwelcome. Come down and let me in, I beg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred! <b>You</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> as I {{have not}} felt these twelve months. If Saul {{could have had}} you for his David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised {{without the aid of}} the harp." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "In a sense, perhaps," [...] Dick answered. [...] "Still, that's {{no reason}} {{you should be}} bored for my entertainment." [...] He paused and resumed: [...] "I'm {{grateful}} because you mean to be kind, as you were the night I met you first at the tent. Although you had heard my story, I saw <b>you</b> wanted to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> I was being given a fresh start." ...|$|R
