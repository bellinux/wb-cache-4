5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
25|$|Watching Shastri bat is like {{admiring the}} Qutub Minar; tall, timeless, solid. You admire {{it for the}} virtues, not for its style. For nine hours and 21 minutes, he chiselled away the England attack and the {{sculpture}} that he left behind represented perseverance and craft. There was the usual stoic, expressionless face under the helmet, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the determination in {{his eyes as he}} planted himself at the wicket, struck root and bore fruit.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E

500|$|In Rego Park in 1958, a young Art Spiegelman {{complains}} to {{his father}} that his friends have left him behind. [...] His father responds in broken English, [...] "Friends? Your friends?

500|$|The lyrics in {{the song}} are cryptic; The ending lines of the third verse emphasise in belief and assurance: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it then you'd understand/ah, {{when you see it}} then you'll understand," [...] and [...] "Some things you have to believe/others are puzzles puzzling me." [...] The fourth line in the second verse alludes to {{discovering}} your place in the world: [...] "How long am I gonna stand/with my head stuck under the sand." ...|$|E

500|$|J. P. Davis was {{inspired}} to write the script after observing an older trainer working with a young boxer in a Brooklyn gym: [...] "I watched the guy spar. You could tell he wasn't going anywhere, but you could never convince the trainer. He's almost a caretaker. He's watching out for you completely. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the devotion involved." [...] Drawing upon material originally created for his critically acclaimed one-man off-Broadway show [...] "Dreamer Awakens," [...] Davis completed the script in 1999 and moved to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|... "She {{was unhappy}} with the whole damn thing, so I went in and {{sweetened}} {{up a lot of}} music for her, adding some guitars to 'Lucky Star', some voices, some magic. [...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, you know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went out the front door and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|Soul {{music is}} a {{combination}} of R and gospel that began in the late 1950s in the United States. Soul music is characterized by its use of gospel techniques with a greater emphasis on vocalists, and the use of secular themes. The 1950s recordings of Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and James Brown are commonly considered the beginnings of soul music. Solomon Burke's early recordings for Atlantic Records codified the style, and as Peter Guralnick writes, [...] "it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> anything resembling a movement".|$|E
500|$|University of Missouri Tigers coach Tim Jamieson {{spotted him}} in a summer league, and {{convinced}} him to head east for his junior year. Jamieson said, [...] "I saw him take ground balls and thought, defensively, he was as good a middle infielder as I had ever seen. As for his bat, I didn't really care." [...] While there, Kinsler had a [...]335 batting average, [...]416 on-base percentage, and [...]536 slugging percentage, with 16 steals in 17 attempts. He {{was named to the}} All-Big 12 Conference second team. Jamieson noted, [...] "From the day Ian stepped through the doors here, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it on his face: He was on a mission." ...|$|E
500|$|Welles {{was just}} as heavily made up as young Kane as he was for old Kane, and he often arrived on the set at 2:30a.m. Application of the sculptural make-up for the oldest {{incarnation}} of the character took three-and-a-half hours. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast and stomach. [...] "In the film and production photographs, {{you can see that}} Kane had a belly that overhung," [...] Seiderman said. [...] "That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way." ...|$|E

500|$|Before 1909, Barcelona {{played in}} various stadiums, {{none of which}} were owned by the club. On 14 March 1909, the club moved to the Camp de la Indústria which had a {{capacity}} of 6,000 people, {{and it was the}} first ground owned by the club. Barcelona moved to Les Corts in 1922, which had an initial capacity of 20,000, which was later enlarged 3-fold to 60,000. The top-row of Les Corts was the origin of the nickname culer, derived from the Catalan cul (...) , as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand. The English author, Phil Ball, notes that [...] "all <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was row upon row of bums".|$|E
500|$|When mature, Chicado V stood [...] tall. She was a brown mare, with a {{connected}} star, stripe, and snip on {{her face}} as her only markings, or identifying marks. [...] Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels, had the care of ChicadoV after she was born, and said of her that she [...] "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke." [...] When she stood in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said {{she looked like a}} rabbit, because [...] "she had big ears and that's all <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> she was so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E
500|$|... "It was {{actually}} really freezing cold [...] <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> your breath. And I {{was in the}} rain for {{only a short time}} – my whole band was out there for an hour-and-a-half. It was {{one of the hardest things}} I've ever had to do on a shoot. But it went by so quickly. I had a body suit on underneath my clothes, so there's a little fun fact for you. I was trying not to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I was really in that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to get all that emotion off my chest." ...|$|E

500|$|During spring {{training}} before the 1928 season, Lajoie {{commented on the}} 1927 New York Yankees. [...] "Of course, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a lot of loafing going on but if that club is {{the greatest of all}} times, you just know that {{we had a lot of}} clubs in my time who were world champions and didn't know it." [...] He died in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1959, at the age of 84 from complications associated with pneumonia. He had fallen in the autumn of 1958 and fractured his arm. His wife had died earlier in 1951. In 1999, he ranked number 29 on The Sporting News list of the [...] "100 Greatest Baseball Players", and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.|$|E
500|$|After {{viewing the}} pilots, CBS {{executives}} immediately signed the 30-minute show to its fall 1954 schedule. Pal retired after filming the two pilots, and his son, Lassie Junior (who {{was three years}} old and had been in training for a couple of years), stepped into the television role. [...] Pal would come to the show's studio home at Stage One of KTTV in Los Angeles every day with his son during filming. [...] He had a bed behind the set, and was respectfully termed The Old Man. [...] Series star Tommy Rettig later recalled, [...] "When Rudd would ask Lassie, Jr. to do something, if you were behind the set, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> The Old Man get up from his bed and go through the routine back there." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore {{said he had}} a {{great fear}} of heights, and to do the {{climbing}} in Greece, he resorted to moderate drinking to calm his nerves. Later in that same sequence, Rick Sylvester, a stuntman who had previously performed the pre-credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me, undertook the stunt of Bond falling {{off the side of the}} cliff. The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him: [...] "From where we were , <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the local cemetery; and the box [...] looked like a casket. You didn't need to be an English major to connect the dots." [...] The stunt went off without a problem.|$|E
