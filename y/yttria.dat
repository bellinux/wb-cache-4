5|$|In 1787, Carl Axel Arrhenius {{found a new}} mineral near Ytterby in Sweden {{and named}} it ytterbite, after the village. Johan Gadolin {{discovered}} yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and Anders Gustaf Ekeberg named the new oxide <b>yttria.</b> Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by Friedrich Wöhler.|$|E
5|$|Boisbaudran {{named his}} element samaria after the mineral samarskite, {{which in turn}} honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as the Chief of Staff of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the {{brothers}} Gustav Rose and Heinrich Rose, to study the mineral samples from the Urals. In this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person. Later the name samaria used by Boisbaudran was transformed into samarium, to conform with other element names, and samaria nowadays is sometimes {{used to refer to}} samarium oxide, by analogy with <b>yttria,</b> zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol Sm was suggested for samarium; however an alternative Sa was frequently used instead until the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Thus by 1803 {{there were}} two known rare-earth elements, yttrium and cerium, {{although}} it took another 30 years for researchers to determine that other elements were contained in the two ores ceria and <b>yttria</b> (the similarity of the rare-earth metals' chemical properties made their separation difficult).|$|E
25|$|Further spectroscopic {{analysis}} between 1886 and 1901 of samaria, <b>yttria,</b> and samarskite by William Crookes, Lecoq de Boisbaudran and Eugène-Anatole Demarçay yielded several new spectroscopic lines that indicated {{the existence of}} an unknown element. The fractional crystallization of the oxides then yielded europium in 1901.|$|E
25|$|Nils Johan Berlin and Marc Delafontaine tried also to {{separate}} the crude <b>yttria</b> and found the same substances that Mosander obtained, but Berlin named (1860) the substance giving pink salts erbium, and Delafontaine named the substance with the yellow peroxide terbium. This confusion led to several false claims of new elements, such as the mosandrium of J. Lawrence Smith, or the philippium and decipium of Delafontaine.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{lanthanide}} contraction, yttrium, {{which is}} trivalent, is of similar ionic size as dysprosium and its lanthanide neighbors. Due {{to the relatively}} gradual decrease in ionic size with increasing atomic number, the rare-earth elements have always been difficult to separate. Even with eons of geological time, geochemical separation of the lanthanides has only rarely progressed much farther than a broad separation between light versus heavy lanthanides, otherwise known as the cerium and yttrium earths. This geochemical divide {{is reflected in the}} first two rare earths that were discovered, <b>yttria</b> in 1794 and ceria in 1803. As originally found, each comprised the entire mixture of the associated earths. Rare-earth minerals, as found, usually are dominated by one group or the other, depending on which size range best fits the structural lattice.|$|E
500|$|In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander {{found that}} samples of <b>yttria</b> {{contained}} three oxides: white yttrium oxide (<b>yttria),</b> yellow terbium oxide (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored erbium oxide (called 'terbia' at the time). A fourth oxide, ytterbium oxide, was isolated in 1878 by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac. New elements were later isolated {{from each of}} those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry where they were found (see ytterbium, terbium, and erbium). In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in [...] "Gadolin's yttria". Since <b>yttria</b> {{was found to be}} a mineral and not an oxide, Martin Heinrich Klaproth renamed it gadolinite in honor of Gadolin.|$|E
500|$|As a {{trivalent}} transition metal, yttrium forms various inorganic compounds, {{generally in}} the oxidation state of +3, by giving up {{all three of}} its valence electrons. A good example is yttrium(III) oxide (...) , also known as <b>yttria,</b> a six-coordinate white solid.|$|E

The single crystals of doped YAG are normally produced by the Czochralski process.|$|E
500|$|In a 1798 paper read {{before the}} Institut de France, Vauquelin {{reported}} that he found a new [...] "earth" [...] by dissolving aluminium hydroxide from emerald and beryl in an additional alkali. The editors of the journal Annales de Chimie et de Physique named the new earth [...] "glucine" [...] for the sweet taste {{of some of its}} compounds. Klaproth preferred the name [...] "beryllina" [...] {{due to the fact that}} <b>yttria</b> also formed sweet salts. [...] The name [...] "beryllium" [...] was first used by Wöhler in 1828.|$|E
500|$|Johan Gadolin at the University of Åbo {{identified}} a new oxide (or [...] "earth") in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794. Anders Gustaf Ekeberg confirmed the identification in 1797 and named the new oxide <b>yttria.</b> In the decades after Antoine Lavoisier developed {{the first modern}} definition of chemical elements, {{it was believed that}} earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been yttrium.|$|E
500|$|Yttrium {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a large variety of synthetic garnets, and <b>yttria</b> is used to make yttrium iron garnets ( [...] , also [...] "YIG"), which are very effective microwave filters. Yttrium, iron, aluminium, and gadolinium garnets (e.g. Y3(Fe,Al)5O12 and Y3(Fe,Ga)5O12) have important magnetic properties. YIG is also very efficient as an acoustic energy transmitter and transducer. Yttrium aluminium garnet ( [...] or YAG) has a hardness of 8.5 and is also used as a gemstone in jewelry (simulated diamond). Cerium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Ce) crystals are used as phosphors to make white LEDs.|$|E
500|$|The red {{component}} of color television cathode ray tubes is typically emitted from an <b>yttria</b> (...) or yttrium oxide sulfide (...) host lattice doped with europium (III) cation (Eu3+) phosphors. The red color itself is emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects {{energy from the}} electron gun and passes it to the phosphor. Yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different lanthanide cations. Tb3+ {{can be used as}} a doping agent to produce green luminescence. As such yttrium compounds such as yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) are useful for phosphors and are an important {{component of}} white LED light bulbs.|$|E
500|$|In 1787, Swedish {{part-time}} chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a {{heavy black}} rock near the Swedish village of Ytterby, Sweden (part of the Stockholm Archipelago). Thinking {{that it was}} an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten, he named it ytterbite. Finnish scientist Johan Gadolin identified a new oxide or [...] "earth" [...] in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794; in 1797, the new oxide was named <b>yttria.</b> In the decades after French scientist Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been yttrium. Until the early 1920s, the chemical symbol [...] "Yt" [...] was used for the element, after which [...] "Y" [...] came into common use. Yttrium metal was first isolated in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler heated anhydrous yttrium(III) chloride with potassium to form metallic yttrium and potassium chloride.|$|E
2500|$|In 1842 Mosander also {{separated}} the <b>yttria</b> into three oxides: pure <b>yttria,</b> terbia and erbia (all {{the names are}} derived from the town name [...] "Ytterby"). The earth giving pink salts he called terbium; the one that yielded yellow peroxide he called erbium.|$|E
2500|$|Arrhenius's [...] "ytterbite" [...] reached Johan Gadolin, a Royal Academy of Turku professor, and his {{analysis}} yielded an unknown oxide (earth) {{that he called}} <b>yttria.</b> Anders Gustav Ekeberg isolated beryllium from the gadolinite but failed to recognize other elements that the ore contained. After this discovery in 1794 a mineral from Bastnäs near Riddarhyttan, Sweden, which {{was believed to be}} an iron–tungsten mineral, was re-examined by Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger. In 1803 they obtained a white oxide and called it ceria. Martin Heinrich Klaproth independently discovered the same oxide and called it ochroia.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{elements}} which were discovered {{as a consequence}} of the lengthy analysis and breakdown of the ore Gadolinite. [...] As the ore was progressively analysed further, the residue was given the label thence ceria and thence lanthana and onwards to <b>yttria,</b> erbia, and terbia. [...] The list by date includes Cerium 58, Lanthanum 57, Erbium 68, Terbium 65, Yttrium 39, Ytterbium 70, Holmium 67, Thulium 69, Scandium 21, Praseodymium 59, Neodymium 60 and Dysprosium 66. [...] Several of these new elements were either discovered or isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in the 1830s and 1840s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lanthanide}} contraction {{is responsible for}} the great geochemical divide that splits the lanthanides into light and heavy-lanthanide enriched minerals, the latter being almost inevitably associated with and dominated by yttrium. This divide is reflected in the first two [...] "rare earths" [...] that were discovered: <b>yttria</b> (1794) and ceria (1803). The geochemical divide has put more of the light lanthanides in the Earth's crust, but more of the heavy members in the Earth's mantle. The result is that although large rich ore-bodies are found that are enriched in the light lanthanides, correspondingly large ore-bodies for the heavy members are few. The principal ores are monazite and bastnäsite. Monazite sands usually contain all the lanthanide elements, but the heavier elements are lacking in bastnäsite. The lanthanides obey the Oddo-Harkins rule – odd-numbered elements are less abundant than their even-numbered neighbors.|$|E
50|$|The {{first full}} scale missile domes of {{transparent}} <b>yttria</b> manufactured from nanoscale ceramic powders {{were developed in}} the 1980s under Navy funding. Raytheon perfected and characterized its undoped polycrystalline <b>yttria,</b> while lanthana-doped <b>yttria</b> was similarly developed by GTE Labs. The two versions had comparable IR transmittance, fracture toughness, and thermal expansion, while the undoped version exhibited twice the value of thermal conductivity.|$|E
5000|$|In 1842 Mosander also {{separated}} the <b>yttria</b> into three oxides: pure <b>yttria,</b> terbia and erbia (all {{the names are}} derived from the town name [...] "Ytterby"). The earth giving pink salts he called terbium; the one that yielded yellow peroxide he called erbium.|$|E
50|$|Renewed {{interest}} in <b>yttria</b> windows and domes has prompted efforts to enhance mechanical properties by using nanoscale materials with submicrometer or nanosized grains. In one study, three vendors {{were selected to}} provide nanoscale powders for testing and evaluation, and they were compared to a conventional (5 μm) <b>yttria</b> powder previously used to prepare transparent <b>yttria.</b> While all of the nanopowders evaluated had impurity levels that were too high to allow processing to full transparency, 2 of them were processed to theoretical density and moderate transparency.
