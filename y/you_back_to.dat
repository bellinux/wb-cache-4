Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. Press Gang, possibly the best show in the world.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not take <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles {{for the sake of}} puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E
500|$|The {{hidden track}} [...] "Honey" [...] is a percussive, lighthearted love song that {{contains}} a sample of singer Nancy Wilson's 1978 song [...] "I'm in Love". The track opens with a reprise of [...] "Amerykahn Promise", with an announcer saying, [...] "We hope you enjoyed your journey and now we’re putting control of <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> you", and a countdown leading to [...] "Honey". According to Badu, the song is about [...] "a lover, a fictitious character named Slim, who I'm chasing." [...] Allmusic's Andy Kellman commented that the song is included as an unlisted track as [...] "it doesn't fit into the album's fabric, what with its drifting, deeply sweetened, synth-squish-and-string-drift groove." ...|$|E
500|$|The fourth track, [...] "Electric", is an {{electronic}} funk song with elements of reggae music. The title track holds a [...] "convinced relativism", according to Robert Christgau, while [...] "Main Thing", {{a cover of}} Shot's 1986 single, explores deep house, disco and funk genres. The ninth track, [...] "Giving You Back", is a piano ballad that addresses Robyn's abortion as she sings [...] "I'm giving <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{where you came from}} but I'm not forgetting who you are". David Schmader of The Stranger opined that it features a directness that is [...] "unprecedented in pop", and compared its piano elements to those found in Braxton's work. The following track, [...] "88 Days", lyrically reflects on the abortion while showcasing a pop and R sound. The thirteenth and final track, [...] "Universal Woman", for which Robyn received sole writing credit, exhibits both intelligence and emotional authority, according to Bjurman.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But I always thought I was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E

2500|$|About the performance-capture process Singer stated, [...] "It's fascinating... It takes <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> play-acting {{as a kid}} in {{your living}} room because you are running around and having to imagine that you are in Gantua and imagine that there are these weapons and all these giant things. But there's nothing when you are there other than {{styrofoam}} and blocks. It forces the actors to regress to when they would play-act as kids or do minimalist theatre. But in that way it's fascinating - I can see why Robert Zemeckis and James Cameron have started to shoot pictures this way".|$|E

Without getting into doctrine, without getting too deep, it is possible to have walked with God and to fall away and still belong to God".|$|E

It's more like a mask over disfigurement, for there is hardly any scope for satire in a narrative riddled with superfluous acts of a star who has begun {{to show signs of}} insecurity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Let me take <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the winter}} of 1938: then as a young man, full of hope and {{ambition}} to play cricket for my county, I travelled from my place {{of work in the}} City of London to a sports complex at Leytonstone where Jack O'Connor and Stan Nichols looked after the cricketing side of the organisation. Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county. It was, in effect, a planned exercise, designed to make things happen, which continued right through to the spring of 1939 when I was finally invited to a trial at Woodford Wells. The planned exercise worked! ...|$|E
2500|$|Music in {{the film}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Bill Graham from Collider.com praised them for their variations to the tempo and tone, memorable lyrics, and [...] "blending old with new," [...] However, he also stated that [...] "the film’s constant mixture of tones can feel a bit off-putting for some." [...] Roth Cornet from ScreenRant was positive towards them, saying that [...] "Alan Menken’s music is as catchy, uplifting and effecting as one would expect." [...] Scott of The New York Times positively reviewed the music, saying that it [...] "takes <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a charmed world of swoony longing and sprightly mischief," [...] with a slick and efficient atmosphere and grace notes of self-conscious classicism. Corliss from Time was also positive to the songs, noting that though [...] "don't sound on first hearing like top-drawer Menken," [...] the songs still [...] "smoothly fill their functions." [...] He described the opener, [...] "When Will My Life Begin?," [...] as the [...] "heroine's 'I wanna' song," [...] a Disney tradition that stretches back to Snow White's [...] "Some Day My Prince Will Come." [...] "I See the Light" [...] was described as [...] "a generically tuneful love ballad, which {{is sure to be}} nominated for a Best Song Oscar." ...|$|E
