40|$|ABSTRACT: Air–sea {{interaction}} {{in the region}} of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) is studied using Granger causality (GC) as a measure of directional coupling. Calculation of the area weighted connectivity indicates that the SACZ region is the one with largest mutual air–sea connectivity in the south Atlantic basin during summertime. Focusing on the leading mode of daily coupled variability, GC allows distinguishing four regimes characterized by different coupling: there are <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the forcing is mainly directed from the atmosphere to the ocean, <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the ocean forces the atmosphere, <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the influence is mutual and <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the coupling is not significant. A composite analysis shows that ocean-driven events have atmospheric anomalies that develop first and are strongest over the ocean, while in events without coupling anomalies develop from the continent where they are strongest and have smaller oceanic extension.

Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives.
