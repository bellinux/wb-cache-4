According to Daniels, drama lessons at O-levels {{gave him a}} voice, and when he attended sixth form studies at Stratford College between 1980 and 1982, doing A-levels in theatre studies and English literature, he attended Royal Shakespeare Company performances. A fellow student recalled that Daniels, whom he knew as Dave, [...] "was very serious about his work, and struck me as incredibly intelligent... <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> sense his mind was working; the cogs were ticking over". Daniels subsequently trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) for three years.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with music historian Peter Guralnick, Charles further elaborated on his understanding, stating [...] "You take country music, you take black music, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> same goddamn thing exactly." [...] While Modern Sounds features mostly covers of country and western music standards, its sound and musical style are marked by the heavy rhythm and blues influence of Charles's playing. A considerable amount of the material's melancholy lyrics and words are backed by piano and orchestral arrangements that are rooted in jazz, as well as West Coast and Charles's style of piano blues. Charles {{has said that the}} country album was [...] "completely different from rhythm and blues".|$|E

500|$|In 1966 Drake {{enrolled}} at a tutorial college in Five Ways, Birmingham, {{from where he}} won a scholarship to study English literature at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. He delayed attendance to spend six months at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, beginning in February 1967, where he began to practise guitar in earnest. To earn money, he would often busk with friends in the town centre. Drake began to smoke cannabis, and that spring he travelled with friends to Morocco, where, according to travelling companion Richard Charkin, [...] "that was where <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> best pot". He most likely began using LSD while in Aix, and lyrics written during this period—in particular for the song [...] "Clothes of Sand"—are suggestive of an interest in hallucinogens.|$|E

[...] In an interview with Rap-Up, when talking about the video portraying him as a heartbreaker, Cruz said [...] "No, not really. I suppose maybe 20%. It was more of just playing a character and having fun, just going out there and making a real cool, fun, cocky video. Not everyone has seen the whole plot of the video, but it's actually myself and my girlfriend both going out with the intention of breaking everyone's hearts." ...|$|E

[...] "Second Coming" [...] {{continues}} on the theme of religion: [...] "...have no other gods before me/ I'm the light/ The devil's getting smarter all the time" [...] The track developed from one of Cooper's lyrical fragments—"Time is getting closer/ I read it on a poster"—and is set to a delicate piano by Ezrin.|$|E

[...] This comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fund-raising capabilities; it later took second place on Time magazine's list of Top 10 Campaign Gaffes for 2007. Biden had earlier been criticized in July 2006 for a remark he made about his support among Indian Americans: [...] "I've had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking." [...] Biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatory.|$|E

[...] While Alma has been compared to the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining."

[...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville. We finished [...] in the spring, but I don't run good there -- but this is my hardest place. It's a tough place."

500|$|Alexander Derek Dougan {{was born}} in Belfast on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan. His father worked at Belfast docks. His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for Linfield, and two of Sandy's {{brothers}} also played {{for some of the}} leading clubs in Belfast. As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street. His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that [...] "on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> money from". As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys. He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams. He instead joined Distillery in 1953. Manager Jimmy McIntosh handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0–0 Irish Cup first [...] round draw with Glentoran. Maurice Tadman, who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.|$|E
500|$|On January 31, 2007, Biden {{took his}} first steps into the presidential campaign, but his {{comments}} about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden {{was quoted in the}} New York Observer as saying: [...] "I mean, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] The audio of the interview, posted on the Observers website, reportedly includes a significant pause after [...] "African-American" [...] which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening: [...] "Look, the other part of this thing that got me in trouble is using the word clean. I should have said fresh." [...] Some media observers labeled Biden's announcement a [...] "launch pad disaster." [...] Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward [...] "Senator Biden...assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted. He was serious and contrite. To me, this was a gaffe, not a statement about his philosophy or ideology." ...|$|E
500|$|The track {{has drawn}} {{comparisons}} to {{the style of}} 808s & Heartbreak, a studio album by rapper Kanye West noted for its jarring use of auto-tune. West has often been noted as an influence by Ocean. Ology writer Terron R. Moore mused that unlike West, Ocean was [...] "an inherently sad guy" [...] and that feeling of inner loss and hopelessness appears on every track on the album, even when he's supposed to be singing about the [...] "Sweet Life". He noted a hidden sense of despair on the song, not immediately apparent on first listen. The song also contains parallels to Ocean's own musical career, where Ocean recognizes that an album is much like a relationship: [...] "the main track, the single, often {{is not the best}} choice." [...] While singles are generally regarded as an album's best song, Ocean remarks that sometimes the most obvious decision holds more subtly. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard mused that Ocean took on the role of a [...] "captain" [...] on the track, prodding the privileged to reach for more by unraveling their lavish realities; [...] "Why see the world, when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> beach?" [...] he asks rhetorically. Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail stated that the track depicts dislocated lives of easy pleasure, of [...] "keepin’ it surreal" [...] with pills and sunshine, in music that’s supposedly all about feeling good.|$|E

500|$|The cabinet for {{the game}} was {{designed}} by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. His designed featured a joystick for each player, which was encased in a pink dome that the player would rest their hands on to control the joysticks, meant to resemble breasts. Faraco later acknowledged that [...] "they didn't have bumps on them or anything, but {{the way they were}} the size of grapefruits next to each other, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> impression of what they were supposed to be." [...] Atari's second engineer, Don Lange, who assisted with the game, has also stated that the design was intentional on the part of Faraco, who fellow Atari designer Regan Chang has claimed [...] "had some really far out ideas". According to rumor, Faraco got the idea from a joke that joysticks resembled phalluses, and that Atari should make a game with female controls. Like Faraco's initial design for Space Race, which was changed due to its expense after a few dozen units, the joysticks for Gotcha were changed to standard ones shortly into the production run prior to the October 1973 release. The design did inspire the advertising flyer {{for the game}}, however, which features a man chasing a woman in a nightdress with the initial design of the cabinet behind them. The final cabinet stands over 5 feet tall and weighs nearly 200 pounds. The breast-like controllers reappeared in yellow in prototype versions of the 1974 Touch Me arcade game, but were not used in production.|$|E
500|$|Barrett did not {{contribute}} material to the band after A Saucerful of Secrets was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, only one, [...] "Jugband Blues", {{made it to the}} band's second album; one, [...] "Apples and Oranges", became a less-than-successful single; and two others, [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man", were never officially released until 2016 in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set, as they were deemed too dark and unsettling. Feeling guilty for ousting their friend, the members of Pink Floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Rick Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, Wright had the awful job of telling Barrett that he was going out to buy cigarettes while he went off to play a gig. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down between his fingers (an incident later referenced in Pink Floyd's The Wall). Emerging from catatonia and unaware that {{a long period of time}} had elapsed, Barrett would ask, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> cigarettes?". Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, in the reception area, waiting to be invited in. He also showed up to a few gigs and glared at Gilmour. Barrett played slide guitar on [...] "Remember a Day" [...] (which had been first attempted during the Piper sessions), and also played on [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". On 6 April 1968, the group officially announced Barrett was no longer a member, the same day the band's contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated as the record label. Considering Barrett to be the musical brains of the band, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett.|$|E

In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E
