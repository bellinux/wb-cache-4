500|$|The deaths led to {{a crisis}} for the {{government}} of Northern Ireland with calls for increased security measures. Ian Paisley demanded the Stormont Government's resignation, saying [...] "We can no longer tolerate your weakness. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> before the whole land is deluged {{with the blood of}} innocent men and women." [...] On 12 March, 4,000 shipyard workers took to the streets of Belfast to demand internment. The Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Chichester-Clark flew to London to request more troops, and when the numbers were not what he wanted, he resigned. On 23 March 1971, Brian Faulkner was elected Ulster Unionist Party leader and was appointed Prime Minister the same day.|$|E
500|$|At {{his meeting}} with Mulgrave, Cochrane was asked to explain a plan of attack on Basque Roads which he had drawn up some years previously. Cochrane enthusiastically {{described}} his intention to use fireships and massive floating bombs to destroy a fleet anchored in the roads. When he had finished, Mulgrave announced that the plan was going ahead and that Cochrane was to command it. Cochrane was in poor health, and under no illusions about Mulgrave's intentions: should the attack fail Cochrane would be blamed and his political career damaged. In addition, Cochrane was also {{well aware of the}} fury this decision would provoke in the naval hierarchy; the appointment of a relatively junior officer in command of such an important operation was calculated to cause offense. Cochrane refused, even though Mulgrave pleaded that he had been the only officer to present a practical plan for attacking Allemand's fleet. Again Cochrane refused the command, but the following day Mulgrave issued a direct order: [...] "My Lord <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>go.</b> The board cannot listen to further refusal or delay. Rejoin your frigate at once." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{country where}} {{resources}} were scarce and tropical disease was rampant, Barotseland offered comparatively few economic {{opportunities for the}} Company and little incentive for white immigration. The main objective of Lochner's expedition was all along to clear a path towards Katanga, a mineral-rich area further north, where Msiri ruled the Yeke Kingdom. Katanga was also coveted by {{the owner of the}} Congo Free State, King Leopold II of the Belgians, whose representatives Rhodes hoped to beat there. [...] "I want you to get Msiri's," [...] Rhodes told one of his agents, Joseph Thomson; [...] "I mean Katanga ... <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> and get Katanga." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Katanga, the Nyamwezi trader Msiri {{had seized}} power around 1860, {{expanding}} his empire {{to cover a}} large part of the Luapula valley. By the time of Delcommune's expedition his rule had greatly contracted, but both the Belgians in the free State and the British in Southern Africa were determined to fully control the mineral-rich area of Katanga. Msiri refused to make any formal treaty with either power. Cecil Rhodes had told an agent of the British South Africa Company [...] "I want you to get Msiri's. I mean Katanga... <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> and get Katanga". A small force of Belgians from an expedition led by Paul Le Marinel had been allowed to establish a post near to Msiri's capital early in 1891.|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophy}} of parkour {{has been compared}} to that of martial arts. In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: [...] "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?". In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. [...] "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed {{and you are going to}} sweat like never before." [...] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: [...] "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Snepp {{knew that}} Hood and Washington [...] "are not exactly A-1 citizens" [...] yet {{he decided to}} use their {{testimony}} as a key component in the conviction of the Charlotte Three. The credibility given to Washington and his statements about Grant and the Charlotte Three were not questioned during the trial, but should have been. He was the [...] "prime suspect in five murders in the Charlotte area" [...] and yet his testimony was used to put men with clean criminal backgrounds in jail. With crime rates rising, famed philosopher Angela Davis's publicized fight with the FBI, George Jackson's [...] "meteoric rise to militant fame as…Black Party Minister of Defense", and the University of Wisconsin's math building bombing, the crimes of Washington were overlooked. They were not taken seriously enough since the aforementioned crimes were politically motivated, however Washington's were not, and as put by the District Attorney Tom Moore; [...] "sometimes <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> to hell to get the devil". Washington {{was said to have}} used [...] "heroin, LSD, and large quantities of alcohol and marijuana" [...] which cast considerable doubt on his credibility.|$|E
