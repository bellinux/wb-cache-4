On set #1, write your five most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your five most valued possessions; on set #3, write your five most loved people. Then “lose” them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> them all.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between both managers was evidently hostile to begin with. Ferguson noted that Wenger {{was the only}} manager he came across in the league not to share a drink with after matches – an English football [...] "tradition". In a joint interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, Wenger said his discourtesy was mistaken for mistrust and managers [...] "cannot be completely friendly and open up." [...] When asked {{if this was the}} reason he avoided the post-match drink, he replied: [...] "Most of the time, yes. What can you say if you have won? And if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> all {{you want to do is}} get home and prepare for the next game." ...|$|E
500|$|David Julyan {{composed}} the film's synthesized score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as Vangelis's Blade Runner and Hans Zimmer's The Thin Red Line. While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds {{to differentiate between}} the color and black-and-white scenes: [...] "brooding and classical" [...] themes in the former, and [...] "oppressive and rumbly noise" [...] in the latter. Since he describes the entire score as [...] "Leonard's theme", Julyan says, [...] "The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But {{a sense of loss}} you feel {{but at the same time}} you don't know what it is <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost,</b> a sense of being adrift." [...] Initially, Nolan wanted to use Radiohead's [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights. Instead, David Bowie's [...] "Something in the Air" [...] is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of [...] "Treefingers", is included on the film's soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

The women exit, but Florinda leaves Belvile with a jewel (most likely a locket of some sort) so that he [...] "may repent the {{opportunity}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> by your modesty." [...] Belvile recognizes Florinda’s picture in the locket and resolves to rescue her that night, with Willmore and Frederick's help.|$|E

2500|$|For example, Saint-Exupéry {{tells of}} a fox meeting the young prince during his travels on Earth. The story's essence is {{contained}} in the fox saying that [...] "One sees clearly only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eye." [...] Other key morals articulated by the fox are: [...] "You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed," [...] and [...] "It is the time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> for your rose that makes your rose so important." [...] The fox's messages are arguably the book's most famous quotations because they deal with human relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Ewell led his corps in the May 1864 Battle of the Wilderness and {{performed}} well, enjoying the rare circumstance of a slight numerical superiority over the Union corps that attacked him. In the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Lee {{felt compelled to}} lead {{the defense of the}} [...] "Mule Shoe" [...] on May 12 personally because of Ewell's indecision and inaction. At one point Ewell began hysterically berating some of his fleeing soldiers and beating them over the back with his sword. Lee reined in his enraged lieutenant, saying sharply, [...] "General Ewell, you must restrain yourself; how can you expect to control these men when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> control of yourself? If you cannot repress your excitement, you had better retire." [...] Ewell's behavior on this occasion undoubtedly was the source of a statement made by Lee to his secretary, William Allan, after the war that on May 12 he [...] "found Ewell perfectly prostrated by the misfortune of the morning, and too much overwhelmed to be efficient." [...] In the final combat at Spotsylvania, on May 19, 1864, Ewell ordered an attack on the Union left flank at the Harris Farm, which had little effect beyond delaying Grant for a day, at the cost of 900 casualties, about one-sixth of his remaining force.|$|E
