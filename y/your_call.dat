500|$|Christopher John Farley of Time {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} the album ranged from being [...] "relaxing" [...] to [...] "cathartic", and [...] "these vocals {{from one of the}} best country singers linger in the mind". The album's preceding singles—"The Heart Won't Lie" [...] (a duet with then-labelmate Vince Gill) and [...] "Take It Back"—were Top 10 hits on the Billboard country chart, reaching No. 1 and No. 5 respectively. Like its preceding album, It's <b>Your</b> <b>Call</b> sold over a million copies, eventually certifying by the RIAA in sales of double-platinum.|$|E
500|$|McEntire's {{music has}} been {{described}} to not only be built upon traditional country music, but also expand into the genres of Country pop, Mainstream pop, Soul, and R. At times, her music has often been criticized for moving away from traditional country music. Many music critics have often called her music to be [...] "melodramatic", [...] "formulaic", and [...] "bombastic", particularly after her 1988 album Reba. Studio releases such as Sweet Sixteen, Rumor Has It, It's <b>Your</b> <b>Call,</b> and Starting Over have often been described by these terms.|$|E
5000|$|As Buehrle {{exited the}} field after the eighth inning, White Sox {{broadcaster}} Ken Harrelson exclaimed, “Call <b>your</b> sons! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> daughters! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> friends! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> neighbors! Mark Buehrle has a perfect game {{going into the}} ninth!” ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, when Mark Buehrle was {{pitching}} {{his perfect}} game, as he exited the field after the eighth inning, White Sox broadcaster Ken Harrelson exclaimed, [...] "Call <b>your</b> sons! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> daughters! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> friends! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> neighbors! Mark Buehrle has a perfect game {{going into the}} ninth!" [...] Buehrle retired the side in the ninth to complete the perfect game.|$|R

500|$|Another dispute {{occurred}} between TLC and Rolston {{was over the}} choice of clothing. The director was interested in [...] "tight and sexy" [...] lingerie looks for them while they only liked baggy, tomboy clothes. Combining the two, he finally gave out {{the idea of the}} girls wearing the silk pajamas with each custom-made cost more than 1,000. Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to wake up at like 5 in the morning for <b>your</b> <b>call</b> time. So when we did that part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, we were so tired. But sometimes that ends up being your best shots." [...] Eventually, she praised Rolston's final product for the group as [...] "excellent" [...] while Lopes said that after two failed ones, the director finally gave them a [...] "real video." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1992, McEntire's seventeenth studio album, It's <b>Your</b> <b>Call,</b> was released. It {{became her}} first album to peak within the Billboard 200 Top 10, {{reaching}} No. 8. McEntire {{commented that the}} record was a [...] "second chapter" [...] to For My Broken Heart, while music reviewers such as Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly disagreed, writing, [...] "In truth, it isn't nearly as pessimistic as its predecessor—and unfortunately it isn't anywhere as involving." [...] Nash called the album's title track—which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart—"one of those moment-of-truth sagas at which McEntire excels. In the song, a wife answers the phone to find her husband's girlfriend {{on the other end}} and seizes the opportunity not only to inform her mate that she knows of his affair but to give him the ultimatum of choosing between the two. She's not the only one who's waitin' on the line, she sings, handing her husband the phone. It's your call." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liddle {{responded by}} saying:So, Crispin Blunt MP feels hurt because laws proscribing [...] (or 'poppers') would criminalise the entire gay community. ...

2500|$|Lyrically, the band's {{style has}} been {{described}} as coming from [...] "the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre." [...] Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On [...] "My Baby's Taking Me Home" [...] off Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, [...] "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: [...] "Your call is very important to us. [...] Please hold" [...] which is then sung with some additional words: [...] "At first she said <b>your</b> <b>call</b> is very important to us, then she said please, please hold." [...] The only other lyrics in the song are [...] "Red light", [...] "Green light", [...] "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" [...] and [...] "Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.|$|E
5000|$|Harrelson's emotive and {{particularly}} distinctive call of Mark Buehrle's perfect game on July 23, 2009, was also notable. As Buehrle exited the field after the eighth inning, he exclaimed, [...] "Call <b>your</b> sons! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> daughters! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> friends! <b>Call</b> <b>your</b> neighbors! Mark Buehrle has a perfect game {{going into the}} ninth!" [...] Also, as the final ground ball of the game rolled towards the White Sox shortstop Alexei Ramírez, Harrelson called out [...] "Alexei?!" [...] (Harrelson often refers to the White Sox players by their first names.) As Ramirez completed the throw to the first baseman Josh Fields, Harrelson shouted [...] "Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! History!" ...|$|R

2500|$|The drink Slusho! {{served as}} part of the viral {{marketing}} campaign. The drink had already appeared in producer Abrams' previous creation, the TV series Alias. Websites for Slusho! and Taguruato were launched to add to the mythology of Cloverfield. The Japanese phone number in the Tagruato website did work, but only played recorded messages. For example, one of the messages was: [...] "Thank you for calling Tagruato. Due to high call volumes, <b>your</b> <b>call</b> has been transferred to an automated answering service. There are no updates at this time. After the tone, please leave a message, and one of our associates will find you as soon as possible". A building bearing the company logo for Tagruato can also be seen in the TV spot of the 2009 Star Trek film, and Uhura orders a Slusho! during the bar scene. When Cloverfield was hosted at Comic-Con 2007, gray Slusho! T-shirts were distributed to attendees. Fans who had registered at the Slusho! website received e-mails of fictional sonar images before the film's release that showed a deep-sea creature heading toward Manhattan. Fans who ordered merchandise received pieces of torn Tagruato documents and Japanese newspapers along with their products. Slusho! has also appeared in Fringe and Heroes.|$|E
