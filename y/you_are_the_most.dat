500|$|After his wife's death, PedroI {{realized}} how miserably he had treated her, and {{his relationship with}} Domitila began to crumble. Maria Leopoldina, unlike his mistress, was popular, honest and loved him without expecting anything in return. The Emperor greatly missed her, and even his obsession with Domitila failed to overcome his sense of loss and regret. One day Domitila found him weeping {{on the floor and}} embracing a portrait of his deceased wife, whose sad-looking ghost PedroI claimed to have seen. Later on, the Emperor left the bed he shared with Domitila and shouted: [...] "Get off of me! I know I live an unworthy life of a sovereign. The thought of the Empress does not leave me." [...] He did not forget his children, orphaned of their mother, and was observed {{on more than one occasion}} holding his son, the young Pedro, in his arms and saying: [...] "Poor boy, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unhappy prince in the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks {{states that}} in Judaism humility is an {{appreciation}} of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues. [...] It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher. [...] Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness one is and what one can achieve. [...] Rabbi Pini Dunner discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important. [...] In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, [...] "And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man {{on the face of}} the earth." [...] How is it possible to be humble and write <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater. [...] It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.|$|E
