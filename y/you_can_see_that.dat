And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That {{was a very different}} depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E

It has conducted several raids on migrant workers accused of not living at their employer's residence. However, Robert Godden of Amnesty Asia-Pacific said: [...] "The specifics, {{many of the}} factors leading to the abuse , {{can be applied to}} thousands of migrant domestic workers: underpayment, restrictions on movement; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was heavily indebted by the illegal recruitment fees charged by the agency, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she didn't know how to access justice."

The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast and stomach. [...] "In the film and production photographs, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Kane had a belly that overhung," [...] Seiderman said. [...] "That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You could see how Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body.

In her own contemporaneous diary entry dated 15 January 1993, Fraser described herself more as Pinter's [...] literary midwife. Indeed, she told Billington that [...] "other people [...] had a shaping influence on [...] politics" [...] and attributed changes in his writing and political views to a change from [...] "an unhappy, complicated personal life... to a happy, uncomplicated personal life", so that [...] "a side of Harold which had always been there was somehow released.

Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John —and I think you get it as soon as they come into the room, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they work together". Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson, and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that Matt Smith was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too [...] "barmy", as the producers required someone [...] "straighter" [...] for Watson. Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who.|$|E

500|$|In early 2011, Cooder was {{inspired}} to write the song [...] "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently {{the rest of the}} album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, [...] "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. I read this pretty regularly, and when I saw this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'" [...] He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, [...] "What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft." ...|$|E

[...] Men and women restrict food intake in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively-thin body; in extreme cases, this leads to eating disorders. Psychiatrist Thomas Holbrook cited a recent Canadian study indicating that as many as one in six people with eating disorders are men.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} cooking vessels before the {{development}} of pottery is minimal due to the limited archaeological evidence.

Harvard University archaeologist Ofer Bar-Yosef reported that [...] "When you look at the pots, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they were in a fire." [...] It is also possible to extrapolate likely developments based on methods used by latter peoples. Among the first of the techniques believed to be used by stone age civilizations were improvements to basic roasting. In addition to exposing food to direct heat from either an open fire or hot embers it is possible to cover the food with clay or large leaves before roasting to preserve moisture in the cooked result. Examples of similar techniques are still in use in many modern cuisines.|$|E

[...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern.

2500|$|Milošević {{was criticized}} by opponents, who claimed {{he and his}} allies were {{attempting}} to strengthen the position of Serbs in Yugoslavia {{at the expense of}} Kosovo Albanians and other nationalities, a policy they accused of being nationalist, which was a taboo in the Yugoslav Communist system and effectively a political crime, as nationalism was identified as a violation of the Yugoslav Communists' commitment to Brotherhood and Unity. Milošević always denied allegations that he was a nationalist or that he exploited Serbian nationalism in his rise to power. In a 1995 interview with TIME, he defended himself from these accusations by claiming he stood for every nationality in Yugoslavia, (though he notably made no direct or indirect mention of Macedonians or Montenegrins who are often seen by nationalist Serbs as being Serbs by ethnic heritage): [...] "All my speeches up to '89 were published in my book. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there was no nationalism in those speeches. We were explaining why we think it is good to preserve Yugoslavia for all Serbs, all Croats, all Muslims and all Slovenians as our joint country. Nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Lam, {{chairman}} of Media Asia {{and of the}} Hong Kong Tourism Board, said: [...] "The fact that the film got the prize is a tragedy for Hong Kong's movie industry [...] politics has kidnapped the profession and politicised film-awarding events." [...] Lam added that, from a film investor's perspective: [...] "The movie did not possess the qualities of best film, as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it was not nominated for best actress or best actor awards, nor was it a blockbuster." [...] Crucindo Hung, former {{chairman of}} the Federation of Motion Film Producers of Hong Kong, criticised the award as [...] "an out-of-your-mind and outrageous decision." [...] Lam further defended his remark from criticism, but earned further rebuke to his statement implying that a wonton noodles shop ought never {{to be able to be}} voted the best restaurant in Hong Kong. Some members of the Chamber of Films said that they would submit a proposal to the Hong Kong Film Awards Association to change the voting mechanism of the awards. [...] Daniel Lam, Chamber of Films member and owner of Universe Films, whose film Little Big Master lost out to Ten Years, said that current voting mechanism [...] "can be easily manipulated to produce an irrational result".|$|E
