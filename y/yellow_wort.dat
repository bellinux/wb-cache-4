40|$|In vitro {{root culture}} of <b>yellow</b> <b>wort</b> (Blackstonia perfoliata (L.) Huds.) was {{initiated}} on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. In {{the presence of}} benzylaminopurine (BAP) numerous adventitious buds formed, which developed into shoots. Presence of indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) in media significantly decreased number of buds, but increased development of lateral roots. On hormone-free medium shoots successfully rooted and developed flowers and viable seeds that formed another generation. Shoot cultures of B. perfoliata inoculated with suspension of Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain A 4 M 70 GUS developed hairy roots at 3 weeks and they were cultured on hormone-free MS medium. Spontaneous shoot regeneration occurred in 3 clones...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{analysis}} of secondary metabolites of gentiopicrin, swertiamarin, and sweroside in shoot and root cultures of <b>yellow</b> <b>wort</b> (Blackstonia perfoliata), which were initiated from seeds, grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Shoot cultures of B. perfoliata were inoculated with suspension of Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain A 4 M 70 GUS and hairy roots appeared at the infected sites after 3 wk of inoculation. Tips of adventitious roots of B. perfoliata were grown on hormone-free MS medium and three clones of the transformed roots regenerated shoots spontaneously. Gentiopicrin, swertiamarin, and sweroside were detected in both roots and shoots of B. perfoliata in vitro and in vivo, but gentiopicrin {{was found to be}} the major compound. The concentration of growth regulator in the medium affected the production of secoiridoids in B. perfoliata in vitro, where the level of gentiopicrin was higher in plants grown in the presence of indole- 3 -butyric acid, but the presence of 6 -benzylaminopurine was inhibitory to secoiridoid production...|$|E

60|$|I decline the task; I am {{not going}} to try to {{estimate}} either the eighteen of England or the sixty of the States. It is enough to speak about three living poets, in addition to those masters treated of in my last letter. Two of the three you will have guessed at--Mr. Swinburne and Mr. William Morris. The third, I dare say, you do not know even by name. I think he is not one of the English eighteen--Mr. Robert Bridges. His muse has followed the epicurean maxim, and chosen the shadowy path, fallentis semita vitae, where the dew lies longest on the grass, and the red rowan berries droop in autumn above the <b>yellow</b> St. John's <b>wort.</b> But you will find her all the fresher for her country ways.|$|R
