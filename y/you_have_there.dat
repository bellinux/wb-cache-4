2500|$|I would {{propose that}} {{the subject of the}} {{ministry}} of this house, as long as this platform shall stand, and as long as this house shall be frequented by worshippers, shall be the person of Jesus Christ. I am never ashamed to avow myself a Calvinist, although I claim to be rather a Calvinist according to Calvin, than after the modern debased fashion. [...] I do not hesitate to take the name of Baptist. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> (pointing to the baptistry) substantial evidence that I am not ashamed of that ordinance of our Lord Jesus Christ; but if I am asked to say what is my creed, I think I must reply: [...] "It is Jesus Christ." [...] My venerable predecessor, Dr. Gill, has left a body of divinity admirable and excellent in its way; but the body of divinity to which I would pin and bind myself for ever, God helping me, is not his system of divinity or any other human treatise, but Christ Jesus, who is the sum and substance of the gospel; who is in himself all theology, the incarnation of every precious truth, the all-glorious personal embodiment of the way, the truth, and the life.|$|E
60|$|MACAIRE (touching {{him on the}} breast). <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> thirty {{thousand}} francs.|$|E
6000|$|I said: [...] "That brand-new, patent, {{revolution}} in cycling, record-breaking, Tomfoolishness, {{whatever it may}} be, the advertisement of which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> in your hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible! {{and with}} such an opening as <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>there!</b> <b>You</b> must excuse me; but my opinion of your {{prudence}} must not be so rudely shaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>have</b> denied <b>there</b> is a purgatory, [...] Therefore that gate is closed; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> denied [...] <b>There</b> is a heaven, {{and so that}} gate is closed.|$|R
6000|$|LYDIA [Rising.] Then, sir, {{let me tell}} you, the {{interest}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>there</b> was acquired by a mean, unmanly imposition, and deserves the punishment of fraud.--What, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been treating me like a child!--humouring my romance! and laughing, I suppose, at your success! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{on earth}} {{could you have}} stood for Loughton? What {{interest}} would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there?</b> You could not even have found an elector to propose you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{honor and}} my life, if you will," [...] Bellamy {{answered}} earnestly. [...] "That is no copy which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there.</b> On the contrary, the handwriting is the handwriting of the Chancellor himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} {{make up your mind}} at once to give her some other present; for not one morsel of my hair shall <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> <b>There</b> now! {{what do you think of}} that?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ninja Turtle Juice: These {{were just}} like normal boxes of juice (like Hi-C) {{but they had}} artwork of the {{different}} turtles based on what flavor <b>you</b> <b>had.</b> <b>There</b> was Leonardo's Citrus Cooler, Raphael's Primo Punch, Michelangelo's Outrageous Orange, and Donatello's Rad Grape.|$|R
50|$|It {{was officially}} reopened 6 June 1978 by Princess Anne who was “impressed and delighted” and said “…what an {{improvement}} {{on the old}} place. All <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>there</b> {{was the smell of}} gas.” Inside she met with “…City Council leader Coun. Jack Green…” and unveiled a plaque in the foyer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You might assert," [...] he said, [...] "that {{your father}} had taken service with some rajah on the plain, and that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>there</b> {{learned to speak}} the language. In this way, <b>you</b> would avoid <b>having</b> to answer any {{difficult}} questions regarding your native place; but as to that, you can get up something of the geography before you leave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{the least}} in the world, Conway. I don't suppose Desmond has any fancy for {{tramping}} among the hills, and if <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> <b>there</b> is no reason in the world why you should not go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavens and earth!--I hope you're {{not going}} to let her quarrel with you, are you? Has there been {{anything}} between <b>you?</b> <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> been any words between you and Lord Cashel? Why don't you tell me, Frank, when you know how anxious I am?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... --We're {{as old as}} we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And {{just finish}} what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> and we'll have another. Here, Tim or Tom or {{whatever}} your name is, give us the same again here. By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's that son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man than he is {{any day of the}} week.|$|E
60|$|ERNEST. Stop a moment. It {{seems to}} me that in {{everything}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> said <b>there</b> is something radically immoral.|$|R
60|$|THE MAN. I ask {{three hundred}} crowns. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> read <b>there</b> That no mere lapse of days can make me yours.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who drove you! Drink {{and your}} evil temper drove you to it. You {{wanted to marry}} me--me who never gave you a word of encouragement; who knew you au fond, who knew that {{you were at the}} best an idle, {{worthless}} scamp, and would never <b>have</b> married <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>there</b> been no other living man in the universe. But enough. I have said what I came to say, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> best take warning. Come, father, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> stood this fellow's friend, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been wrong, but you know him now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{and he put}} {{the other}} hand so that he {{completely}} encircled the little slim waist, [...] "I do quite believe that Mr. Wardour taught you all the good <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> <b>There</b> is nothing I am so glad of as that you love and reverence him as he deserves--as far as such a child can do. I hope you always will, and that your gratitude will increase with your knowledge of the sacrifices that he made for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} hint that the colored cravats {{would be so}} bungling as to lose, and the dark cravats so dextrous as to cheat?--Sour imaginations, my dear sir. Dismiss them. To little purpose have you read the Ode <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there.</b> Years and experience, I trust, have not {{sophisticated}} you. A fresh and liberal construction would teach us to regard those four players--indeed, this whole cabin-full of players--as playing at games in which every player plays fair, and not a player but shall win." ...|$|E
60|$|Let us take an instance--the most noble {{with which}} I am acquainted, the Cathedral of Chartres. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> the most splendid {{coloured}} glass, and the richest sculpture, and the grandest proportions of building, united {{to produce a}} sensation of pleasure and awe. We profess that this is to honour the Deity; or, in other words, that it is pleasing to Him that we should delight our eyes with blue and golden colours, and solemnise our spirits {{by the sight of}} large stones laid one on another, and ingeniously carved.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>there</b> when certain persons {{swore that}} before twelve months were passed, Captain Ussher should {{be under the}} sod?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can do as you like, Ruth; but the {{probability}} is that you will faint before <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>there</b> five minutes." ...|$|R
5000|$|How do <b>you</b> know that? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> been <b>there</b> to see? And if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been <b>there</b> to see, and {{had seen}} none, that would not prove that there were none ... And {{no one has a}} right to say that no water babies exist till they have seen no water babies existing, which is quite a {{different}} thing, mind, from not seeing water babies.|$|R
6000|$|AMERICAN. Well, {{just watch}} my {{gestures}}. I was saying [He {{points to the}} LITTLE MAN, then makes gestures of flying] you have an angel from heaven there. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> a man in whom Gawd [He points upward] takes {{quite an amount of}} stock. You have no call to arrest him. [He makes the gesture of arrest] No, Sir. Providence has acted pretty mean, loading off that baby on him. [He makes the motion of dandling] The little man has a heart of gold. [He points to his heart, and takes out a gold coin.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You ain't a partner, and I don't {{know what}} {{business}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there.</b> But every one was helping themselves except me. I {{was going to}} the wall. I have always been going to the wall. Well; when Brisket was off, I took up with Robinson again. I always liked him the best, only I never thought of my own likings. I wasn't that selfish. I took up with Robinson again; but I wasn't going to be any man's wife, if he couldn't put a roof over my head. Well, father, you know what was said then, and now you're going back from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The first Chauffeur was Bill, {{a common}} fellow, as I said before," [...] {{the old man}} expounded; [...] "but his wife was a lady, a great lady. Before the Scarlet Death she was the wife of Van Worden. He was President of the Board of Industrial Magnates, {{and was one of}} the dozen men who ruled America. He was worth one billion, eight hundred {{millions}} of dollars--coins like <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> in your pouch, Edwin. And then came the Scarlet Death, and his wife became the wife of Bill, the first Chauffeur. He used to beat her, too. I have seen it myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> me <b>there,</b> Miss Von Taer. And what do I {{know about}} society? Just nothing at all. It's {{out of my}} line entirely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{helped you}} to escape," [...] Macheson said, [...] "but I {{did not know}} what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done. <b>There</b> is another matter. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to go away from here quietly and swear never to molest----" ...|$|R
60|$|Lau. Then I {{would advise}} you to go thither again, {{and look for the}} wit which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> left <b>there,</b> for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> brought very little along with you. Your voice, methinks, too, is much altered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which, {{in great}} trouble such {{as she has}} passed, is a blessed state, O Allan. Bethink <b>you,</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> not been days, aye and months, {{in your own life}} when you would have rejoiced to sleep in mindlessness? And should we not, perchance, be happier, all of us, if like the beasts we could not remember, foreknow and understand? Oh! men talk of Heaven, but believe me, the real Heaven is one of dreamless sleep, since life and wakefulness, however high their scale and on {{whatever}} star, mean struggle, which being so oft mistaken, must breed sorrow--or remorse that spoils all. Come now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a member," [...] Selingman went on, [...] "of {{the extreme}} revolutionary party, a party pledged {{to stop at}} nothing, to drive your country's enemies across her borders. Very well, listen to me. The pardon which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> is granted to you without any promise having been asked for or given in return. It is I alone who dictate terms to you. Your country's position, her wrongs, and the abuses of the present form of government, can only be brought before the notice of Europe in one way. You are pledged to do that. All that I require of you is that you keep your pledge." ...|$|E
60|$|There are {{the makings}} of a very fine creed about Mormonism. To begin with, the Church is rather more {{absolute}} than that of Rome. Drop the polygamy plank in the platform, {{but on the other hand}} deal lightly with certain forms of excess. Keep the quality of the recruits down to a low mental level and see that the best of the agricultural science available is in the hands of the Elders, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>there</b> a first-class engine for pioneer work. The tawdry mysticism and the borrowings from Freemasonry serve the low-caste Swede and the Dane, the Welshman and the Cornish cottar, just as well as a highly organised Heaven.|$|E
2500|$|<b>You</b> <b>have</b> said <b>there</b> was a, quote, [...] "miscalculation of {{what the}} {{conditions}} would be in postwar Iraq." [...] What was the miscalculation, and how did it happen? ...|$|R
60|$|DEARTH (with the sad {{smile of}} the disillusioned). <b>You</b> <b>have</b> me <b>there.</b> After which brief, but pleasant, little connubial chat, he pursued his dishonoured {{way into the}} garden.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mind, don't {{be foolish}} {{enough to say that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> escaped; <b>there</b> is not the least {{occasion}} for that; that would make the case a great deal worse." ...|$|R
