500|$|Emile Rafael {{directed}} the official music video for [...] "Trouble", with cinematography by Charlie Herranz. During {{an interview with}} Elle, Kills talked on the concept she went with for the visual. Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England {{at the age of}} 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt [...] "closer to betterness" [...] in parties, where she was exposed to recreational drugs. She started to consume them and she felt better with them for [...] "a few short hours". [...] "They make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>better,</b> so the minute the high wears off you want more. But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. [...] "More happiness, more power or freedom or love if you know that it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [...] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad—much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." [...] She further explained that she wanted to create an [...] "honest video that showed both [...] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire." [...] The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' Vevo and YouTube accounts.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>better...</b> All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{family was}} {{by his side}} {{at the time of}} his death. His good friend Burt Reynolds made a {{statement}} to the Los Angeles Times, saying: [...] "As you get older and start to lose people you love, you think about it more, and I was dreading this moment. Dom always made <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> when he was around, and there will never be another like him." [...] Mel Brooks also made a statement to the same paper, telling them that DeLuise [...] "created so much joy and laughter on the set that you couldn’t get your work done. So every time I made a movie with Dom, I would plan another two days on the schedule just for laughter. It's a sad day. It's hard to think of this life and this world without him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Heat Is On {{is notable}} for its two radio singles, the album's angry funk opener [...] "Fight the Power (Part 1 & 2)" [...] and the melodic soul ballad [...] "For the Love of You (Part 1 & 2)". One critic cited the former song as the Isley Brothers' [...] "most overtly {{political}} tune to date". According to writer Colin Larkin, the album's contrasting sides, with one side comprising uptempo funk {{and the other}} comprising a suite of smooth soul, represent [...] "the pinnacle of both genres". Side one's closer, [...] "Hope <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Better</b> Love (Part 1 & 2)", contrasts both of the styles, as it contains melodic verses and a forceful chorus. Songs from The Heat Is On, including [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and [...] "For the Love of You", were sampled extensively by the following generation of hip hop artists, including Slick Rick, Common, and Masta Ace.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Carnally, {{coming up}} at that moment. [...] "I stopped behind {{to talk to one}} of the boys and as I didn't know what you were doing I couldn't warn <b>you.</b> You'll <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> presently." ...|$|R

5000|$|During an {{interview}} with Pitchfork, Lauren Mayberry said of the song: “Leave a Trace” is the middle finger mic-drop. It’s about that point where you’re like, “There’s no point having this conversation anyways: There will be no resolve, I won’t <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> about it, <b>you</b> won’t <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> about it, no outcome from this will actually change my reality.” It makes me <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> to write about that—I’ve done something constructive with it. You don’t put that on other people, you put that into what you do. That’s always the way I’ve written lyrics. My ex-partners are not friends with me, but I’m OK with that.|$|R

The following day, Sulkin deleted the joke and apologized, saying the post was insensitive and that he had not realized the extent and severity of the disaster.|$|R
