50|$|The <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> may lay from 20 to {{more than}} 80 eggs. It nests at night and during the morning.|$|R
50|$|The Suzhou Zoo is a zoo in Suzhou, China. In 2015, {{a female}} <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> was artificially inseminated {{at the zoo}} {{in an attempt to}} save the species from extinction.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the very large and exceptionally rare <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> several smaller turtle species {{are found in the}} Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan's box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese stripe-necked <b>turtle</b> and Chinese <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> which all are considered threatened.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Rafetus swinhoei [...] ) is an {{extremely}} rare species of <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> found in China. It {{is also known as}} the Red River giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> Shanghai <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> or Swinhoe’s <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle.</b> In Chinese, it is known as the speckled <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chinese: 斑鱉; Pinyin: bān bīe). Only three living individuals are known (a fourth having been reported dead in January 2016), and it is listed as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List. It is hoped that a pair at Suzhou Zoo in China will breed.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{species of}} mammals and 15 {{species of birds}} were named after Swinhoe, {{including}} Swinhoe's storm-petrel, which he first described himself in 1867. Also, four species of reptiles are named in his honor: Gekko swinhonis, Japalura swinhonis, Rhabdophis swinhonis, and the <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Rafetus swinhoei [...] ), a specimen of which John Edward Gray received from Swinhoe in 1873.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> is on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} due to habitat loss, hunting for subsistence and local consumption, {{and the use of the}} carapace and bones in alternative medicine. Skulls are often kept as trophies. A recent plan to build hydropower cascade of 12 dams on the Red River in China may flood all of its habitat and change the ecosystem of lower Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{reports that}} it can grow up to 1.8 m in length and is the world's largest extant {{freshwater}} turtle, this maximum size and title is murky at best. Apparently the largest specimen carapace length, 129 cm, known is considered suspect and the heaviest specimen known (weighing approximately 250 kg was actually a misidentified <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle.</b> A more realistic range of carapace length for this species is reportedly 70 to 100 cm {{and it is one}} of about a half-dozen giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> from three genera that reach exceptionally large sizes, i.e. in excess of 100 kg in mass.|$|R
50|$|The Hoàn Kiếm turtle (Rafetus leloii) was a {{controversial}} taxon of turtle from Southeast Asia, found in Hoàn Kiếm Lake in Hanoi, Vietnam. Although some Vietnamese biologists assert that R. leloii {{is a distinct}} species from the <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> Rafetus swinhoei, {{of which there are}} only three living specimens left in the world, most authorities classify it as synonymous with the latter species. If the two taxa are to be considered distinct, R. leloii may be considered extinct.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> {{has been}} known to inhabit the Yangtze River and Lake Tai, {{situated}} on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, in eastern China, and Gejiu, Yuanyang, Jianshui and Honghe in Yunnan Province in southern China. The last known specimen caught in the wild in China was in 1998 in the Red River between Yuanyang and Jianshui; it was then released. Only three living specimens are known, one at Dong Mo Lake Son Tay in Hanoi, Vietnam, (taxonomy questioned) and two in Suzhou zoo in China.|$|R
5000|$|The {{placement}} of the related or conspecific Hoan Kiem turtle, Rafetus leloii, remains poorly known and controversial. Most herpetologists accept R. leloii is a junior synonym of the <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> though some Vietnamese biologists, such as Ha Dinh Duc, who first described R. leloii, and Le Tran Binh, assert R. leloii to be distinct. Le points out genetic differences, as well as differences in morphology. However, Farkas et al. repeated their 2003 conclusion in 2011, attributing differences between specimens to age, and {{pointed out that the}} genetic sequences used were never sent to GenBank. They also criticized the fact that Le et al. violated ICZN Code by renaming the species from R. leloii to R. vietnamensis on the grounds of [...] "appropriateness".|$|R
50|$|The <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> {{is noted}} for its deep head with a pig-like snout and dorsally placed eyes. This {{critically}} endangered species holds the title of being the largest freshwater turtle in the world. It measures over 100 cm in overall length and to 70 cm in width, and can easily weigh up to 70 - 100 kg. The average size of large turtle specimens (i.e. turtles weighing over 10 kg) that could be collected in the Yangtze River per one study was 25 kg, although not all specimens were definitively identified as Rafetus. Its carapace, or shell, can grow larger than 50 cm, with the largest shell that could be found having measured 86 cm in length. However, along the curve carapace lengths of up to 106 cm have been reported {{and it is possible}} for the largest specimens (largely reported in Vietnam) to have weighed up 220 to 247.5 kg. Its head can measure over 20 cm in length and 10 cm in width. The male is generally smaller than the female and has a longer, larger tail.|$|R
50|$|Most {{authorities}} classify leloii as {{a junior}} synonym of the <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> based a study by Farkas et al. However, some Vietnamese biologists, such as Hà Đình Đức, who first described leloii, and Le Tran Binh, insist that the two turtles {{are not the same}} species. Le points out genetic differences as well as differences in morphology, re-describing the Hoan Kiem turtle as Rafetus vietnamensis. However, Farkas et al. repeated their 2003 conclusion in 2011, stating that differences between specimens may be due to age. They also pointed out that Le et al. did not adequately describe their methods for DNA sequencing, and that the genetic sequences used were never sent to GenBank. They also criticized the fact that Le et al. violated ICZN Code by renaming the species from leloii to vietnamensis on the grounds of “appropriateness”. Another genetic analysis was purportedly when the turtle was rescued and cleaned, which allegedly showed it to be female and distinct from the R. swinhoei of China and Đồng Mô, Vietnam. However, the results were not formally announced or ever published in a peer-reviewed research article, and some skepticism has been cast on the results.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{commercial}} {{use of the}} river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze River dolphin), Chinese alligator, <b>Yangtze</b> giant <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze River dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance. In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a baiji. However, as {{there have been no}} confirmed sightings since 2004, the baiji is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time. [...] "Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins". It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.|$|R

50|$|Indian narrow-headed <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chitra indica) {{also known}} as small-headed <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> is an {{endangered}} species of <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> found in rivers of South Asia. It is very large and feeds on fish, frogs, crustaceans and molluscs, which it ambushes. In the past it was included in Chitra chitra; a species restricted to Southeast Asia using current taxonomy.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Nilssonia gangetica), or Ganges <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{a species}} of <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> found in South Asia in rivers such as the Ganges, Indus and Mahanadi.

50|$|Pelodiscus maackii, {{commonly}} known as the Amur <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> or the northern Chinese <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> is a species of turtle found in the Russian Far East, northeastern China, and Korea.|$|R
50|$|Smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> may {{be easily}} {{confused}} with the spiny <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Apalone spinifera), as {{the differences between the}} two species are subtle. Spiny <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> have a rough carapace with spines along the front edge while, as the name implies, smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> lack such spines. Additionally, the white chin and throat of the smooth softshell are unmarked, compared to the splotchy chin and throat of the spiny softshell. A. mutica is the only species of North American softshell with round nostrils; all other species have ridges on the nasal septum which make the nostrils C-shaped.|$|R
5000|$|The African <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> or Nile <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Trionyx triunguis) {{is a large}} {{species of}} turtle from fresh-water and {{brackish}} habitats in Africa (larger parts of East, West and Middle Africa) and the Near East (Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey). It is the only extant species from the genus Trionyx, {{but in the past}} many other <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> were placed in this genus; they have now been moved to various other genera. Despite the name [...] "African softshell turtle", {{it is not the only}} species or genus of <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> in Africa (the genera Cyclanorbis and Cycloderma are also African).|$|R
50|$|The black <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> or Bostami turtle (Nilssonia nigricans, {{previously}} {{placed in}} genus Aspideretes) is {{a species of}} freshwater turtle found in India (Assam) and Bangladesh (Chittagong and Sylhet). It was long believed to be inbred individuals of the Ganges <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (A. gangeticus or N. gangeticus) or the Indian peacock <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (A. hurum or N. hurum), but while it is a close relative of the latter, it is a distinct species.|$|R
