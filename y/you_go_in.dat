5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{planned for}} the fourth series of The Sarah Jane Adventures, it would have seen many {{children}} avoiding a strange street next to Bannerman Road, called Sally Lane, after hearing an urban legand which states if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the street, she will eat you alive. Sarah Jane and the gang investigate, and find a twelve-year-old girl, who was trapped in the street for years by an evil spirit, called the 'Trickster's Triangle'.|$|E
25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E

2500|$|Soomekh became {{close with}} Lionsgate after {{appearing}} in their film Crash (2004) {{and they wanted}} her in their next big film. Not a fan of horror films she found the role challenging. [...] "I had nightmares the first month I was on set. We were shooting it for two months. People say because you're an actor it's {{not a big deal}} because <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there and it's fake or whatever. But what they don't understand is that it's actually the opposite because, as an actor, when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there you have to believe it's real to make your performance real. You have to get lost in the mindframe of this character", she said.|$|E
2500|$|To play at Minton’s you couldn’t {{just walk}} in and grab a bass. They made <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a back room or a kitchen and call a few tunes. They did it to me too. They said, “Can you play ‘Perdido’? Can you play ‘Body and Soul’?” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Cure of a {{bleeding}} woman miracle appears in , [...] and , {{along with the}} miracle of the Daughter of Jairus. The Gospels state that while heading to Jairus' house Jesus was approached {{by a woman who}} had been suffering from bleeding for 12 years, and that she touched Jesus' cloak (fringes of his garment) and was instantly healed. Jesus turned about and, when the woman came forward, said [...] "Daughter, your faith has healed <b>you,</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> peace".|$|E
2500|$|At once Jesus {{realized}} that power {{had gone out}} from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?” [...] “You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ” But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.Then the woman, knowing {{what had happened to}} her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. [...] He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed <b>you.</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> peace and be freed from your suffering.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Sean Penn has said, [...] "The {{screenplay}} is {{the most}} magnificent one that I've ever read but I couldn't find that same emotion on screen. ... A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact." [...] He further clarified his reservations about the film by adding, [...] "But it's a film I recommend, as long as <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> without any preconceived ideas. It's up to each person {{to find their own}} personal, emotional or spiritual connection to it. Those that do generally emerge very moved." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jewish Theological Seminary, JTS, is {{the primary}} {{educational}} and religious center of Conservative Judaism. The single largest physical addition to JTS {{came in the form}} of seventeen-foot wrought iron gates. The beautifully constructed gates led to the main entrance through a large vaulted passageway to the entire group of buildings. In a 1930s guidebook, it is written about the Seminary, [...] "Be sure to notice the main gate to the seminary as <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in.</b> It is hand-wrought iron and the whole design is symbolic." [...] These gates were presented on September 26, 1934, by Mrs. Frieda and Mr. Felix M. Warburg in memory of her parents, Jacob H. and Therese Schiff.|$|E
2500|$|Phyllis cannot {{decide whether}} {{she ought to}} marry Tolloller or Mountararat, and so she leaves the choice up to them. Tolloller tells Mountararat that his family's {{tradition}} would require the two Earls to duel to the death if the latter were to claim Phyllis. The two decide that their friendship {{is more important than}} love and renounce their claims to her ("Though p'r'aps I may incur thy blame"). The Lord Chancellor arrives dressed for bed and describes a nightmare caused by his unrequited love for Phyllis ("Love, unrequited, robs me of my rest"). The two peers try to cheer him up and urge him to make another effort to persuade himself to award Phyllis to ... himself ("If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> you're sure to win").|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for Lopez told People magazine that Lopez was not replacing Paula Abdul on the eighth season of American Idol because she would be busy promoting her film, The Back-up Plan {{as well as her}} new album. Both projects were slated for a January 2010 release, despite Lopez previously stating that she was aiming for the end of 2009. However during an interview with KTU Mornings, Lopez revealed that both the album and film were being pushed back to April 2010. Rap-Up magazine would later confirm that the album and film were being released together in cross-promotion of each other. However this date appeared unlikely when, backstage at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, she said [...] "I'm working on my album that will be out... hopefully this year, we'll see if I get it done... You know how it is, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> your there non-stop, you leave it alone for a minute and you come back– you're like, okay, this is what I need." ...|$|E
2500|$|Familiar {{to viewers}} was Jim Rockford's gold Pontiac Firebird Esprit car. One oft-recurring {{element of the}} show was the famous [...] "Jim Rockford turn-around" [...] (also known as a J-turn or a [...] "moonshiner's turn" [...] - {{commonly}} employed as an evasive driving technique taught to Secret Service). [...] Garner explained the move in his 2011 autobiography The Garner Files: [...] "When you are going straight in reverse about 35 miles an hour, you come off the gas pedal, go hard left, and pull on the emergency brake. [...] That locks the wheels and throws the front end around. [...] Then you release everything, hit the gas, and off <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction." [...] James Garner stated in a Season One DVD interview that he performed this stunt {{for the duration of}} the series. The car's license plate was 853 OKG, although the plate in some early episodes displayed the number 835 OKG. Garner writes in his autobiography that he believes that the letters OKG stood for [...] "Oklahoma Garner" [...] but that he does not know the origin of the numbers 853.|$|E
2500|$|Rooney explained: [...] "We {{had changed}} the sound of Jennifer Lopez [...] and we didn't have {{anything}} else on the [...] album we could release as a single. We had to do another remix to keep the momentum going." [...] Then-upcoming artist Ashanti dropped by Irv Gotti's studio in New York. She recalled: [...] "Everyone was there and Ja [...] {{was on the floor}} playing video games, and they had the beat playing in the background. Chris Gotti, Irv Gotti's brother, said 'Ja's supposed to be writing this record for J-Lo, but it doesn't look like he's going to be doing anything tonight. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there and see what's happening?' So that's exactly what I did." [...] Ashanti wrote two verses and recorded a demo for the new version of [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] for Lopez. Gotti and 7 flew out to Los Angeles on September 10, 2001 to record the song with Lopez. The song was due to be recorded the following day, but was postponed due to the September 11 attacks. When work resumed on the song, Gotti called Ashanti from Los Angeles asking her to write another verse for the song. She recalled: [...] "I had to write it over the phone and two-way Irv the lyrics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you must," [...] I said. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> there <b>in</b> {{the spirit}} the greater need for <b>you</b> to <b>go</b> there <b>in</b> the flesh. <b>Go</b> to your sister's room once more, {{and see the}} window--I nearly fell out of it myself.

6000|$|Then King Meliadus {{looked upon}} Tristram and loved him very dearly, and he said: [...] "Tristram, thou hast assuredly {{a very great}} heart to {{undertake}} this adventure, which {{no one else will}} essay.
