6000|$|By {{this time}} our author {{has got the}} thing into his system: or, rather, he has worked so hard that he feels he cannot abandon the venture now. He hunts for another manager who wants {{something}} musical, and at length finds one. The only proviso is that this manager does not need a piece built around two stars, but one suited {{to the needs of}} Jasper Cutup, the well-known comedian, whom he has under contract. The personality of Jasper is familiar to the author, so he works for a month or two and remoulds the play to fit him. With the script under his arm he staggers to the manager's office. The manager reads the script--smiles--chuckles--thoroughly enjoys it. Then a cloud passes athwart his brow. [...] "There's only one thing the matter with this piece," [...] he says. [...] "You seem to have written it to star a comedian." [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> it for Jasper Cutup," [...] gasps the author, supporting himself against the water-cooler. [...] "Well, yes, that is so," [...] replies the manager. [...] "I remember I did want a piece for him then, but he's gone and signed up with K. and Lee. What I wish you would do is to take this script and twist it to be a vehicle for Pansy Glucose." ...|$|E
40|$|A Polish patient {{well known}} to the team was {{admitted}} with a manic relapse of bipolar affective disorder. Early on in his admission he attended an art group and there he wrote, with a bright red felt tip pen, the following poem: It continued. We came for lunch. They had horses and guns. But {{there was only one}} entrance and exit. They gave me a black quadrangle. It contained your God. You shot my cohort. 300 people. I was rather upset. You were polite. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> gold. I gave you Ashurst [psychiatric intensive care unit] sized room of gold. You melted did. You hated my 12 wives. You were scared of my army. You played poor chess and I learned Spanish in a week. You sentenced me to death for treason and polygamy. Oh yeah! And incest (whatever that is). Now I am at the airport with my blue and red Adidas back and my Wilson tennis racquet. “Please stop at the Marriott ” I tell him. YOU SHOULD HAVE KILLED ME WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE!!! What are you doing, brother? At the time he was unable to explain what his poem meant due to his prominent flight of ideas, pressure of speech and grandiose delusions. Each of these features, unique to mania, is apparent in the prose. The disjointed sentence structure highlights the racing thoughts and tangentiality of formal thought disorder. The content is both grandiose and paranoid in nature with hypersexual and hyper-religious elements. The presentation is bright and showy, similar to the way many patients with mania present themselves. A week later, and in a less manic state, he approached me stating: “That poem I showed you, I realised it needed a little editing. It only makes sense if you believe you’re the reincarnation of Emperor Atahualpa”. I rushed to Wikipedia, 1 and indeed that was the case...|$|E

40|$|Translation begins] Darling- Rather {{my darling}} Lieutenant Just arrived home from New York. I’m so glad you’re a Lieutenant! But, honey, there’s one thing. We’ve {{got to get}} married down there. I have a funny feeling about that darling + I {{honestly}} {{think it would be}} much better for everyone if we were married down here. Here {{are a few of the}} reasons. First, I know you want to get married on the day you graduate. 2. I want to get married on the day you graduate 3. We’re going down to see you graduate anyway. 4. Mother will have a two week vacation if we go down. I we don’t then she’ll work herself into a complete collapse rushing around making plans for the wedding + the reception. 5. it’s much less expensive this way. 6. I want to get married down there in the army chapel. 7. Mother wants to see the south. She’s never been there + this will be the only chance she has. 8. Mother + I had a real long talk + she said no matter what she + Hilda + I were going down south to see you graduate + get married. 9. Oh, honey, I can’t remember the other reasons now but please darling, let’s get married down there. I want it that way + I’m sure you do too- no matter what you may say. Oh, about the night letter. That might be slightly confusing because I added a few sentences in there. Mother wrote, “Wedding plans unchanged- leaving March 7 th”. And the reason I wrote as you probably gathered. Oh, honey, I’m so glad that you are a Lieutenant. You’re going to be the handsomest officer. Really, though, honey, the only thing to do is have the wedding down there. Please, honey, it means so much to me. I’d be broken hearted if you said you didn’t want to get married down there. Really, I would. I’ve counted on it so, Judd. You don’t know how much it means to me. I’m so sorry that I wasn’t here when you called honey. I’m so upset about now. You haven’t any idea how much we’ve all counted on this. Judd, honey, what has happened that made you change your mind. Golly, darling, have you forgotten you said you were going to marry me March 11 th- I haven’t. Honey, it would be so unreasonable to have it at home. Hilda + mother + I are so excited about the trip + getting married down there. If you could have seen how disappointed we all were you never would have suggested it. No, honey, it would be awful to have the wedding here. I was so disappointed. I was sure they were fooling when they told me that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to get married home. Honey, I know you don’t- you just can’t. Honey, it’s awfully late. I hope you call tomorrow. I’ll send this air mail special. Hope you get it soon. Honey, you couldn’t mean it when you said you didn’t want us to come down to see you graduate. Getting your wings means more to you than anything else and, honey, I want to be with you then. It’s the most important moment in your life and, honey, please don’t say you don’t want me to be there. I love you so, my darling. I mean sir- should I be more formal now, Lieutenant? Goodnight, darling, I love you with all my heart. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Thursday My Darling, Hope {{that this}} doesn’t get too blurred. But I just washed {{my hair and}} it’s {{dripping}} all over the place. Your letter came that you wrote last Sunday. Golly, honey, I hope March 11 th isn’t rainy too. My hair will look horid [sic] if it does. Right now I’m half listening to Suspense- very confusing. I always pick the nicest atmosphere to write to you, honey- very romantic! I guess that the train is just as slow as the bus, honey. We’ll stay in Atlanta Thursday night probably. So it’s hard to get hotel rooms, huh, honey? Well- that’s a minor detail, we can always find a nice park bench someplace. Honey, that’s the way I always wear my hair- parted {{on the side and}} flat on top- [?] when you were home, that’s the only time I changed it. Everyone else likes it this way, honey. Listen, Judson Clark- will you please answer my question about the Scotch? First- how many bottles {{do you want me to}} buy? And which is better- Pinch bottle or Johnny Walker? You’ve been avoiding my question about Steve. Is there anything wrong between you and sweetie? You never mention him? I’ve been asking and asking you if he was going to be able to arrive by two and if he was very far away. Those are the only two questions that I can think of off hand but if you don’t answer me so help me there’ll be a private war. Especially about the Scotch. Where are the other places that are more convenient? We should go to Mexico or someplace on the way. Of course Mexico is probably millions of miles away. But, how long will we be able to stay wherever we go? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to go swimming but I don’t know. If we don’t have more than four or five days it wouldn’t make much difference to me- Remember? Yes, I guess I want you to be boss- I don’t know whether you will be or not. I’ve got a pretty strong mind of my own- All right so you’ll be an officer. There are plenty of other officers- and and [sic] you’ll take orders when necessary! So I’ll be a Colonel! I’m glad that you’re getting the rings. I’d never get it done. Never have time to look. If you like them, honey, I’m sure I will- You have such good taste. You’ll always have to buy my jewelry. Well, I wasn’t exactly trying to discourage you, honey, just sorta preparing you and letting you know what you’re getting in for. But, honey, we’ve got to eat. Golly, I just hate to think of what’s going to happen. You’re going to be awfully hungry. I hope after we’ve been married a while you still feel the same way. I’m not worrying at all about it but everyone else is- All you hear is “Poor Juddie”- Everyone is sure that I’m going to starve you to death or something horrible. Probably kill you from cooking- I’m definitely not the domestic type. Which is the best Johnny Walker, red or black? Well, honey all the articles I’ve read in magazines say that religion is terribly important and since we’re not religious, honey, I was wondering what would happen. I’m not worrying about it at all. I just thought you might like to worry about it. Everyone else seems to think things like that are important. Golly, honey, when we get married it will be the first time I’ve been in a church all this year! That’s awful. Yes, honey, I’m sure it will work out fine- But the experts all disagree. We’ll show them. Well, you see, I read anything that comes along + lately they’re publishing lots of stuff on war marriages and what makes them last + not last. I agree about the only way we can find out if it will work is by trying it. I’m not worried in the least but I want you to be sure that you’ve considered all angles. What a waste of time! Why can’t March hurry. Gee, honey, the way time drags you’d thing we had all year or something. Oh, happy day- (day after Valentine’s day but we got paid today. Tomorrow at noon I’ll take my huge check over to the bank. Hope they have enough money to cover it. (Is that what they do with checks?) Someone’s singing “There Goes That Song Again”. Gee, I miss you so, honey. Golly the time’s getting shorter. Only 24 more days now and we’ll be married, honey. As you’ve probably gathered by now I’m in a very wacky mood and if this letter makes sense it’s purely coincidental. Remember that night at Split Rock when you were getting decoldized- (new word!) Woody and Steve were ready to murder me- I always get wacky at the most inappropriate times. Golly, hone in eleven more days I’ll be all finished working. That’s eleven weekdays. Weekends don’t count. There are times when I dislike everything about that place but then other times I don’t mind it at all. I still feel real patriotic and everything. I don’t know whether I’ll be able to go back to modeling again. It’s so unessential. “To Have And Have Not” is at the movies this weekend. I can hardly wait to see it. Lauren Bacall is in it. I like her a lot. Won’t be able to see it until Monday night though. Tomorrow night I’m not going out. I’ll be a good little girl and write to you for a change. Forgot to buy some envelopes again. Oh well, maybe tomorrow I’ll remember. Gee, honey, I wish these 24 days would hurry. Have you found out about when the graduation dance will be? Can you get Charlotte a date? I should carry a pad + pencil around with me always so that when I think of something to ask you I could write it down and then remember- whenever I begin to write, always forget. Let’s see honey, what else was there that I wanted to ask you. Oh, how many hours have you flown now? Are ya still ahead of everyone? Are you still highest in your class or don’t you know? Gee, in about 14 more days you should know what you’re going to be. That’s 10 days before graduation. I’ll probably have pneumonia if I don’t dry my hair soon. It’s still all wet. Gee, honey, it will be so queer to be married. Since I’ve never been married before, I think it will be queer anyway. But being married to you will be wonderful, darling. Last Sunday seems months away. This week went so fast in a way but in another way it seems as if it had been going on forever. Oh, tomorrow’s Friday- I like Fridays. Honey, will we go on our honeymoon right after we’re married or what? Do you get the 15 days right away. No, don’t tell me that. But where are we going? Let’s not go where it’s rainy- that would be very wetish and – wait a minute- that wouldn’t be so bad- It would be very romantic. Remember that day we walked in the rain, honey. That sure was a long time ago. Well, my darling, I guess I’d better dry my hair and take a bath and get to bed. I love you more than anything else in the world. You’re so sweet, honey, how can anyone be so wonderful. Well, honey, until we’re together again, I’ll love you, Always, Dottie P. S. Please answer my questions!!! [Translation ends...|$|E

A/C Judson ClarkSqdrn 5, Class 45 -ACadet DetachmentStewart FieldNewburgh, New York [Transcription begins]:Monday Dearest Judson, Well, I’m at work now. We’re {{not doing}} much of {{anything}} right now so I {{decided it was time}} to write you. We’re all freezing to death now. This really is Penumonia [sic] Alley. All of us have neat colds. Everyone is blowing at the same time. It’s all very exciting. What a place. We’re all half asleep and look like death warmed over. Well, did you get back to camp all right? I sure hated to see you leave yesterday. By now, you’ve had a chance to talk to Steve. Please tell me what he had to say about Woody. You’re so mean. I know darn well he tells you exactly what happened. Have you heard any more about where you may be sent? They just can’t send you too far away. There aren’t any fields near here, are there? I wish they’d decide to keep you here for Advanced. Won’t it be neat for Bobby when Ace gets home. I’ll bet she’ll be in a fog too. Golly, honey, I wish you’d get seven days off. You’ll know by Christmas where you’re going for Advanced, won’t you? Maybe you’ll be able to get home longer with a delay. Oh, well, I can dream. It’s awfully hard to write here. I meant to send you the clipping from the papers but I forgot to put it in your letter this morning. I hope I can remember tonight. Gee, it seemed so queer to get up this morning 2 ̆ 6 catch a train. I would have loved to just stay in bed. Golly, I’m tired. Shouldn’t be because I had over ten hours of sleep last night. I love you so, honey. It seems years since yesterday when I saw you. What are we going to do without the car. That’s a major catastrophe, too. What will we do. I’m sure Daddy will never lend anyone his car, especially not you. Remember he was in the back seat that day when you drove to New York 2 ̆ 6 just missed a couple of trucks. Well, I won’t say anything to him but I’m sure you won’t get it. Honey, I’m so lonesome. I love you so 2 ̆ 6 miss you awfully when I get in one of my moods. We’re both moody but you’re usually in a pretty good mood. If we do have a fight, it should be a real bitter one because we both have terrific tempers. I can’t imagine being mad at you though. I wonder if we’ll get real mad at each other, honey. I just can’t imagine us saying mean things to each other. I haven’t really seen you very angry but I can guess what you’d be like. I hope we both don’t get in one of those fighting moods at the same time. Gee, I love you honey. It’s time for lunch 2 ̆ 6 I have to go to Macy’s 2 ̆ 6 half a dozen places to try to get some Christmas shopping done. Hello, darling, I’m home now. Just finished cutting some more pictures out of the Pelham Sun. Lord, it seems endless. Daddy must have bought every copy they printed this week. I still have a stack to cut out but I’ll do that tomorrow. I didn’t do a darned thing tonight 2 ̆ 6 it’s almost nine o’clock already. There were half a million things that needed to be done to[o]. Well, maybe tomorrow night I’ll get to them. Golly, honey, I love you so. I got home tonight and wasn’t expecting a letter from you because you said you hadn’t written on Friday. Then I was so surprised because there was a letter you’d written on Thursday. It was a wonderful surprise, honey—I love your letters 2 ̆ 6 you, too. Guess what—I got paid for last Friday (the day after I sprained my ankle.) They made a mistake and I’m very happy about the whole thing. I’m broke already. Can’t hold on to my money at all. That’s going to help a lot, huh. Oh, so far they haven’t said anything about whether I’m fired or not. I’m happy though. If they do fire me, then I’ll just have to look for another job. Hope they wait until the Spring stock comes in so that I can get the dresses I want. Honey, about our honeymoon— I just hate the cold. I’m never healthy when it’s winter and not happy at all. I’d hate to stay where it’s cold during our honeymoon and it is warm in Flordia [sic] during March!! There are some places where it isn’t but near the coast it is warm. It begins to warm up in January 2 ̆ 6 February. I knew you weren’t right. Maybe you are partly right because there are a few places where it’s not to[o] hot but that’s inland. When we first talked about it <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to go South 2 ̆ 6 swim 2 ̆ 6 play tennis 2 ̆ 6 ride, remember? That’s what I’d like to do, really. What made you decide on going North? There’s another thing I’d like to speak to you about. All week long, honey, I ask you questions in my letters and then you write back and don’t answer any of them. Please, darling, write me and answer all the questions that I’ve been asking you!!!! Right now the only thing I could find was the article in the Pelham Sun and you have that don’t you, hon? I’ll send it to you anyhow. Gee, honey, I wish you could be home every night and that there wasn’t a war. It would be wonderful to see you all the time. Gee, I love you. Darling, you’re just everything I’ve ever wanted in a fellow. Guess I’ve told you that about ten or 15 thousand times but you’re so sweet and thoughtful. Did you go on that Cross Country trip yet? Please be careful, honey. I wish that I knew how to fly. It must be wonderful. Golly, honey—that AT- 6 at the Air Show was nice. It looked so complicated—You’re wonderful. What do you think you’ll fly in advanced? You want to fly a B- 24, don’t you? How is Steve? I still have to write that note to him. I’ll try to do it tomorrow. Whenever I plan to do something, it never comes out right. I keep forgetting to write to him. I love you so, my darling. Every moment I’m away from you seems like a million years. You’re so sweet and I love you so. Wish that I could write more, hon, but it’s getting pretty late and I have loads of things I should do. Oh, what the heck, I’ll do them tomorrow. Trish [?] was cutting her hair this afternoon and that reminded me that mine needed it. I cornered Corinne and she cut my hair. It feels much better now. Corinne’s so lucky. She’s going down to Flordia [sic] to be with her husband. I wish I could go someplace to be with you 2 ̆ 6 we were married. Gee, honey, March doesn’t seem to be getting any nearer. Do you remember Maryalyce Hurley—Well, she was in our class 2 ̆ 6 was one of my friends. She’s a swell kid 2 ̆ 6 wants to meet you. I told her we’d stop over for a few minutes soon. Everyone wants to see you. She knows you vaguely but not well. Darling, I love you so—This is awful. I do wish we could be together more 2 ̆ 6 longer. Days without you are so long but when you’re home on weekends, time passes so darned fast. I’ll bet Bobby is awfully happy now. It must be real nice to have something like that to look forward to. I wish we could be married by Christmas so that we’d have those couple of days together. Oh, well, I guess it’s best this way. Honey, I never can say anything to you when we’re together that I should say. There really are loads of things that we should talk about before we’re married but I never can think of a darned thing except that I love you. There are so many things we should get settled before you go but I never remember—Gee, I love you. Well darling, I really have to go to bed now. Have to unbandage my ankle 2 ̆ 6 take a bath. What a life. Gee, I love you so. Please try to write every night, honey. I love you so. Letters from you are so cheerfulish. I do love you so and you’re so wonderful. Say hello to Steve and tell him that if he’s patient I’ll write pretty soon. I love you so, my darling. Please write soon 2 ̆ 6 be good. I love you, my darling. You’re the sweetest 2 ̆ 6 wonderfulist person in the world. I love you. All my love,Dottie P. S. Did you think of a song yet, darling?

To-night as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> did not <b>want</b> me any more and I was tired, I went to bed early and had a dream. I dreamed that we were once more in the shrubbery, as happened some years ago, and that the little African gent who shot like a book, was showing us the traces of those two black men, just as he did when they tried to steal her ladyship. Then in my dream I seemed to go back to bed and that beastly snake which we found lying under the parcel in the road seemed to follow me.

Well, I’ll try to, anyway right now I’m {{off to a good}} start. It’s just about quarter after one and you left about a half hour ago. How’s that? Don’t ask me what took me so long. Dick Tracey, natch. The {{pictures}} we took today should be back by this coming weekend, maybe. I’ve got them all ready to mail and now if I only don’t forget to mail them. Golly. I’m so sleepy it’s pitiful. This won’t be a very long letter because I have to leave soon for Woody’s house. That should be great. I’ll probably sit and yawn in people’s faces all afternoon. I’m sure they’ll enjoy that lots. Every weekend seems to go so fast now. Golly. The week seems to have gotten a couple of extra days thrown in somewhere just to make it longer. I sure hope this week goes faster than next week did. Do you have much trouble reading my letters? I just glanced back at what I wrote 2 ̆ 6 Lord, how anyone can ever read it is beyond me. Maybe it’s because I’m so tired that I scribble. Anyway that’s a pretty good excuse. Did Tom, that’s his name isn’t it?, have a nice time Saturday night? They were lucky to catch us when we were going into the Rodeo. I had forgotten all about the bag. It’s too bad that you were disappointed in the Rodeo. I liked it a lot. It was so different from anything I had ever seen before. Those poor little calves. I felt so sorry for them when they mooed 2 ̆ 6 had their necks practically broken in half. The way they dug the spurs into the horses really discusted [sic] me. How can people be so cruel to poor animals. No wonder they buck. This Saturday I’ll go riding, I think. That should really be good. If I get sore it will be awful if we go to that broadcast. We’d have to go some place where there was standing room only. Did Tom get tickets? Do you know what we both forgot to do? Call the Island 2 ̆ 6 see if it’s still open. If it is from now on your name will be mud. Oh, the battle of the baritones is over. He just said something about the king. Frankie, sings “something or other”—(new song). Maybe he was talking about something else but that’s the station. (The song was “I Could Make You Care. ”) Does baritone have two “rr’s. ” It looks peculiar. Hope that you don’t have to fly next Saturday. It doesn’t take very long for you to get home does it. Oh, here’s the final score. Frank Sinatra— 3, 440, 672 2 ̆ 6 Bing— 3, 400, 410 or something like that. He said it so fast 2 ̆ 6 I never could write numbers. (Claude Thornhill is playing “Where or When. ”) (Do you like him?) How did you do in that instrument check? I hope it was real easy 2 ̆ 6 you passed easily. When is your 40 hour check? I hope that isn’t on a Monday, too. Well, hon, it’s time for me to go over to see Woody. This is a screwy letter but all my letter[s] are crazy. Please write soon 2 ̆ 6 I’ll answer all your letters 2 ̆ 6 write as often as you do, o. k. ? Lots of love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|R

My uncle, the doctor one, was just {{up to look}} at my stupid leg 2 ̆ 6 said to keep off it all day 2 ̆ 6 as much as {{possible}} tomorrow 2 ̆ 6 until the swelling goes down. It’s discusting [sic]! Why does everything have to happen to me! Honey, I’ve been writing letters to more people this morning telling them that we’re engaged. Oh, Bill still hasn’t received the letter because I got a letter from him yesterday 2 ̆ 6 I know he hasn’t or if he has he’s doing a darned good job of pretending he has[n’t]. I’m in bed now and will probably be here {{for the rest of the}} week. Darling—Jean Molberg just called me 2 ̆ 6 asked me if it were true. She was all excited 2 ̆ 6 couldn’t believe it. She said that she had just gotten a letter from Dudley Nash so I got his address in case you didn’t have it. I can’t remember whether you said you were writing him or not but here it is anyway. Dudley Nash, M. M. M. 3 /cU. S. S. L. C. I. (L 517) c/o Fleet Post OfficeNew York, New York If you haven’t written him, honey, try to right away if you want to tell him. Jean said she’d wait a few days before she wrote 2 ̆ 6 told him so that you’d have a chance to tell him first. I thought you’d probably like to write him 2 ̆ 6 be the first to tell him if you haven’t already. Well, honey, so long again. I love you very much. You’re the most wonderful person in the world and I love you more than anything or anyone that ever existed. You’re all I want in the world. I love you so. Monday Dearest Judson— Golly, honey, you wanted me to stay home from work to write you a real long letter. Well, I did stay home from work but it’s almost quarter after seven now and I haven’t written at all. Time just flew today. I don’t know where it went. Honestly, I had every intention of writing you a real huge letter but didn’t get around to it. Darling, I’ve been thinking about you all day, every second. I’ve never felt like this before. There were quite a few time[s] when I thought that I was in love but I know now that this is the first time I’ve ever been in love. I feel all shaky sometimes when I think about you. I still haven’t gotten over the way I felt Saturday and Friday night. Can’t understand it. Last night at about two I was lying in bed thinking of you 2 ̆ 6 listening to the radio. They played one song that is really swell—I’m not sure what the name of it was but it was something about “I hadn’t met you” or something like that. Maybe they’ll play it before I finish writing to you. Anyway, you’ve probably heard it. I can remember almost all the words except the title. Today Bobbie brought the picture up to the Standard Star and I phoned in the announcement. They’ll send it to the Daily August 2 ̆ 6 Grandmaw took another one to the Pelham Sun. They probably won’t be in the papers until Thursday or Friday. The telephone’s been wringing all night. Everyone’s been calling up to let us know how their hangovers are. Oh, after you left millions of people had come. It was quite a mad house. Honey, I was so lonesome. When you called up it was such a nice surprise, honey. Golly, it was good to hear your voice again. Everyone was telling me how cute you were 2 ̆ 6 how lucky I was 2 ̆ 6 how happy I looked 2 ̆ 6 how wonderful you were. Golly, hon, I wish you could have stayed. I wanted to be alone with you so much. Remember when we went upstairs just before you left. Daddy was looking all over the place for us—of all times for him to pick, honestly! So of course everyone knew where we were. That was almost so well planned, too. When I called up Ginny today to tell her that I wouldn’t be in for a few days, she was so nice. Said not to worry about work 2 ̆ 6 to be sure 2 ̆ 6 stay home until it was all better. I hope that by Wednesday I’ll be able to go again. It’s so annoying to have to lie in bed all day. Last night the darned ankle was all swollen again 2 ̆ 6 so I decided to be a good little girl 2 ̆ 6 stay home. I’m afraid that if I don’t keep entirely off it, that it won’t be healed by next weekend 2 ̆ 6 that would break my heart. If there’s any swelling at all, I won’t go to work so don’t worry, darling. I just remembered the name of that song—“I Didn’t Know About You. ” Have you heard it? It reminds me so much of you. You’ve changed me a lot, honey. Was thinking of that today. I’m so afraid that I’ll do something to hurt you, though. You’re so sweet and thoughtful. I love you so. Honey, I wish that I could tell you how much I love you. There just doesn’t seem to be any way to showing you how I feel or telling you how deeply I love you. You write the most wonderful letters, honey. I wish I could say the right thing all the time the way you do. Your letters are just like you and they always say just what I like to hear—(experience, no doubt). Today looked like a beautiful day. What I could see of it between the slats of my Venitian [sic] blinds. Did you go on the cross-country yet? Hope that the weather is nice all week and that they let you off for a long time Christmas. Honey, when do you find out how long they’re going to give you? If it’s not too long, darling, I’m going to take some time off from work. It’s a shame that my ankle couldn’t wait until after Christmas. Gee, I love you so. Everything seemed to change so suddenly, honey, Friday night. Before we seemed to be more or less kidding around all the time 2 ̆ 6 then all of a sudden, everything was different. It’s a good thing that it happened, I guess. It had to sooner or later. And I think that it’s a good thing in a way that you’re leaving on the 28 th. Have you heard anything about where they’ll send you? It would be marvelous if they sent you someplace where you could get home every weekend or kept you at Stewart for the rest of your training. Darling, we were so lucky to have so much time together but I’d still like to have more. I hope when you get your wings that you have a long, long leave so that we can be married 2 ̆ 6 together for as long as possible. You’ll get 15 weeks more training, honey, won’t you after you graduate? Woody is going to try to come over tonight. I hope she can because then I’ll be able to talk about how wonderful you are to her. How is Steve? If Woody doesn’t come over tonight, I’ll answer his letter. He’s a very nice fellow. Did Gini go up yesterday? They’re playing “Silver Wings in the Moonlight. ” That should be more popular with so many Air Corps fellows around. I meant to tell you—Mary Smith got tight last night. She could hardly walk but she was so funny. Carol had to practically carry her home. The worst part was that she was going to Jim’s house for dinner. That should have been something. Darling, I love you so. That seems to be the only thing I can think of to say. There should be some other way to say it but somehow that’s all I can think of. This week will probably go fast for me because I’ll be in bed most of it and if I do go to work it will be such a surprise when Saturday comes. Darling—what do you want for Christmas? I know one thing I’m giving you but it’s only a small thing 2 ̆ 6 just sorta something extra. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> a pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set but not what kind. I don’t know anything about pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil sets so tell me more about what kind 2 ̆ 6 color 2 ̆ 6 everything! Tell me some more things because a pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set is the most unromantic thing I can think of. It’s so practical, too. Honey, I think we’ll be so happy when we’re married. I know I won’t be completely happy until we are. Wonder if we’ll always hate crowds as much. Hon, it’s getting worse 2 ̆ 6 worse, as far as I’m concerned. I don’t even know anybody else exists when you’re around except that they occasionally interrupt 2 ̆ 6 bother us. I love you so, honey. I just want to be with you, honey, forever. What time will we have to start, darling, to get up to the air show in time? I’d love to see you fly but it will be nicer to have you with me during the show, you can be with me can’t you? I wish we were married now, darling 2 ̆ 6 there wasn’t a war 2 ̆ 6 we could be together. Did Steve get Woody’s letter yet? How does he feel? What’s going to happen if Gini invites herself up for next weekend? That would be cozy. Gee, honey, it sure was good to be with you for a whole day. This was a wonderful weekend. Are you very tired, darling. I feel so much in love. You should feel pretty beat after carrying me around last weekend. Do you know that when you went down to the station everyone was watching you carry me. When I got back they all had something to say about how cute it was, and what good practice you were getting. All my relatives are crazy about you. They think you’re wonderful. When they say that one of my friends (boys anyway) is swell, that really means something. Frenchy thought I was very lucky. Boy, did he get tight! Everyone did. Charlotte, Muriel, Ronnie 2 ̆ 6 I were up in my bedroom listening to the radio because we were sober 2 ̆ 6 they were getting a little wild down stairs. I sure wish you could have been there, darling. It would have been so perfect. Golly, I was so surprised. In a way I was in such a daze that I just didn’t know what was going on. That’s love. Honey, I love you so. Much more than I did last weekend. Every weekend seems to be the same—I love you so much more than the weekend before last. This just can’t go on much longer darling. Well, honey, I’ll write again tomorrow. I love you very, very, much. You’re marvelous—I love you so. All my love—Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
