[...] But so heterodox an opinion only irritated his antagonist the more, especially as he noticed that the handsome woman in the back seat appeared to be interested in the conversation, and even sympathetic with Demorest. The man was in the main a good-natured fellow and loyal to his friends; but this did not preclude any virulent criticism of others, {{and for a moment he}} hated this bronze-faced stranger, and even saw blemishes in the handsome woman's beauty. [...] "That may be <b>YOUR</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Eastern man," [...] he said bluntly, [...] "but I kin tell ye that Californy ain't run on those lines. No, sir." [...] Nevertheless, his curiosity got the better of his ill humor, and as the coach at last pulled up at the cross-road for Demorest to descend he smiled affably at his departing companion.|$|R

50|$|The Bioscleave House is {{the first}} {{architectural}} project that the Reversible Destiny Foundation completed in the United States. Its construction spanned almost a decade, encountering obstacles from its initial funder, and ultimately cost over two million dollars. The house has four rooms, a free-form living space and walls made of various materials, such as metal and translucent polycarbonate. There are no internal doors.Think about a room that has levels {{that make you feel}} like you're two places at once. That violates <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what <b>a</b> room should be, and by changing <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how architecture should work, you may be changing <b>your</b> <b>ideas</b> about how life should work.

500|$|Although Shields feared a {{critical}} panning, reviews of Loveless were almost unanimously favourable. [...] "An album without parallel", wrote Andrew Perry in Select. [...] "Its creative inspiration defies belief. Though 'To Here Knows When' is pretty well the weirdest {{track of the}} eleven, that glorious distortion gives <b>a</b> fair signal <b>of</b> what to expect – the unexpected. Everything you hear confounds <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how <b>a</b> pop song should be played, arranged and produced." [...] "The instrumental 'Touched' is especially startling", noted Martin Aston in Q, [...] "like a drunken fight between a syrupy Disney soundtrack and an Eastern mantra. All in all, Loveless amounts to <b>a</b> virtual reinvention <b>of</b> the guitar." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Then," [...] {{observed}} Elizabeth, [...] "you must comprehend a {{great deal}} in <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accomplished woman.""Yes, I do comprehend {{a great deal}} in it.""Oh! certainly," [...] cried his Darcy's faithful assistant Bingley, [...] "no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have <b>a</b> thorough knowledge <b>of</b> music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.""All this she must possess," [...] added Darcy, [...] "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.""I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any." [...] — Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (1813) Compared to other early 19th-century novels, Austen's have little narrative or scenic description—they contain much more dialogue, whether spoken between characters, written as free indirect speech, or represented through letters. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, which began as an epistolary novel, letters play a decisive role in the protagonist's education and the opening chapters are theatrical in tone. Austen's conversations contain many short sentences, question and answer pairs, and rapid exchanges between characters, most memorable perhaps in the witty repartee between Elizabeth and Darcy.|$|R
6000|$|Then it {{came over}} {{me that she had}} made a great effort for me--made it with <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> nobleness--and that I owed her a compensation. Each time I saw her after this I {{wondered}} what the compensation could be. I couldn't go on doing the wrong thing to oblige them. Oh it WAS the wrong thing, the stamp of the work for which they sat--Hawley was not the only person to say it now. I sent in <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> the drawings I had made for [...] "Rutland Ramsay," [...] and I received a warning that was more to the point than Hawley's. The artistic adviser of the house for which I was working was of opinion that many of my illustrations were not what had been looked for. Most of these illustrations were the subjects in which the Monarchs had figured. Without going into the question of what HAD been looked for, I had {{to face the fact that}} at this rate I shouldn't get the other books to do. I hurled myself in despair on Miss Churm--I put her through all her paces. I not only adopted Oronte publicly as my hero, but one morning when the Major looked in to see if I didn't require him to finish a CHEAPSIDE figure for which he had begun to sit the week before, I told him I had changed my mind--I'd do the drawing from my man. At this my visitor turned pale and stood looking at me. [...] "Is HE <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> English gentleman?" [...] he asked.|$|R

This week, too, I was shooting at Saxthorpe, and I had also several other engagements of a pleasant nature.

5000|$|After Mimoun {{arrived back}} {{home from the}} 1956 Melbourne Olympics, he mooted the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{creating}} <b>a</b> world-class sports training center in France. In order {{to take advantage of}} better training facilities, he had to train overseas, especially in Sweden, for some of his running events. That was something that annoyed him and therefore he felt that it was necessary to build such a sports training center. Mimoun attempted to seek government funding to build it. After several failed attempts in previous years, he received a telephone call from Jacques Chirac to meet him in the Hôtel Matignon. During that meeting in 1967, Chirac, who was then a senior civil servant working as Prime Minister Georges Pompidou's technical adviser, told Mimoun, [...] "I have followed your entire (running) career and I like <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> creating <b>a</b> (sports) training center in Corrèze." [...] The following day, Mimoun was received by the Sports Minister François Missoffe in his office and informed by him that government funding for the sports training center had been approved. The sports training center - initially named Centre national d'entraînement sportif - located in the Corrèze village of Bugeat, was later renamed Espace 1000 Sources. Right after Mimoun's funeral in July 2013, the sports training center was rechristened Centre sportif Alain Mimoun ...|$|R
5000|$|Thorm Geier of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} show a [...] "B-" [...] and said, [...] "Part {{of the problem}} with Catch Me If You Can is Terrence McNally's book, which is oddly paced and curiously structured. When Abagnale is arrested by the feds in the opening scene, he takes the {{opportunity}} to tell his own story from the beginning in the style <b>of</b> <b>a</b> '60s TV show. Why a TV show and not a Broadway play? I have no idea. Perhaps composer Marc Shaiman is just accustomed to the idiom since '60s TV factored so largely in his Tony-winning hit Hairspray. Shaiman has also conceived the music as <b>a</b> pastiche <b>of</b> early '60s musical styles, all of them curiously pre-rock. Unfortunately, this makes the score seem even more old-fashioned than some of the musicals genuinely from that era (like the current hit revival How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying). Under the direction of Jack O'Brien, though, Catch Me If You Can moves mostly in fits and starts. But the creators of Catch Me If You Can have rigged the game against them.

[...] It was true the question had been asked; it was true, alas! that I had answered; and now here was my reply, or some strange hash of it, gibbeted in the cold publicity of type. I thanked God that my French fellow-students were ignorant of English; but when I thought of the British--of Myner (for instance) or the Stennises--I think I could have fallen on Pinkerton and beat him.|$|E

Then practically, as you examine plants in detail, ask first respecting them: What kind of root have they? Is it large or small in proportion to their bulk, {{and why is it}} so? What soil does it like, and what properties does it acquire from it? The endeavour to answer these questions will soon lead you to a rational inquiry into the plant's history. You will first ascertain what rock or earth it delights in, and what climate and circumstances; then you will see how its root is fitted to sustain it mechanically under given pressures and violences, and to find for it the necessary sustenance under given difficulties of famine or drought. Lastly you will consider what chemical actions appear to be going on in the root, or its store; what processes there are, and elements, which give pungency to the radish, flavour to the onion, or sweetness to the liquorice; and of what service each root may be made capable under cultivation, and by proper subsequent treatment, either to animals or men.|$|R
