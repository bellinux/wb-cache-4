25|$|The basic {{requirements}} build upon {{the first step}} in the pyramid: physiology. If there are deficits on this level, all behavior will be oriented to satisfy this deficit. Essentially, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> slept or eaten adequately, you won't be interested in your self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.|$|E

'It is a King cobra, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> killed it' replied Eha. The snake was put in a crate and sent to the BNHS with the note 'It may not survive the journey.

500|$|When Nixon {{resigned}} on August 9, 1974, Ford {{assumed the}} presidency, {{making him the}} only person to assume the presidency without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office. Immediately after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: [...] "I am acutely aware that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> elected me as your president by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers." [...] He went on to state: ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{critical}} letter, Mrs Beeton's sister Mrs Henrietta Mary Pourtois English advised her that [...] "Cookery is a Science {{that is only}} learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> had. Therefore my advice would be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and Heaven knows {{there is a great}} variety for you to choose from." [...] The recipes were largely copied from the most successful cookery books of the day, the copying in some cases acknowledged in the text. The [...] "variety" [...] included Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families and her The English Bread–Book, Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper, Marie-Antoine Carême's Le Pâtissier royal parisien, Louis Eustache Ude's The French Cook, Alexis Soyer's The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère and The Pantropheon, Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, Maria Eliza Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli.|$|E
500|$|Sakimoto composes {{his music}} by playing the pieces [...] "briefly on the piano", and then {{working on a}} {{computer}} for more detailed arrangements. The style of Sakimoto's compositions is mostly orchestral; he creates the orchestral sound by playing the music through a sequencer instead of using a real orchestra due to the high cost. When composing a soundtrack for a video game, Sakimoto first sits down with the director or producer {{of the game and}} works out what emotions they want the game to evoke in the player, and after making a demo for them, sets out to create music that fits that feeling. He claims that his style of composition does not change when he works on non-game works such as anime series, saying that only the tone of the pieces is different. He attributes any changes in his style over the years to his desire to constantly keep growing and learning new styles and techniques, saying that if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> moved forward in your skill and style over time, [...] "you've wasted your time".|$|E
500|$|Though {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy was {{reluctant}} to return after completing his three-episode commitment on the show that had ended with the season's tenth episode, he returned for the season finale when the producers [...] "essentially called him up and pleaded". They discussed their plans for the character, and [...] "told him {{it was a story}} we couldn't tell without him." [...] He [...] "graciously agreed." [...] "Over There" [...] marked Nimoy's longest appearance on Fringe, a longer and [...] "much more involv" [...] shoot of roughly seven days was required. Despite Leonard Nimoy's planned exit from the show, the show's producers have said that nothing is final in the Fringe world. Pinkner commented that Nimoy's retirement from acting obviously hinders his character's possible return but, [...] "if Leonard chooses to come back, there is a story in place that we'd love to tell." [...] Wyman elaborated that [...] "I think it's fair to say that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> experienced the last of William Bell". When the producers told Nimoy their ideas for Bell's storyline in the third season, he returned for some brief voice and animation work in the episode [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide".|$|E

500|$|Mahler made {{arrangements}} with the impresario Emil Gutmann for the symphony to be premiered in Munich {{in the autumn}} of 1910. He soon regretted this involvement, writing of his fears that Gutmann would turn the performance into [...] "a catastrophic Barnum and Bailey show". Preparations began early in the year, with the selection of choirs from the choral societies of Munich, Leipzig and Vienna. The Munich Zentral-Singschule provided 350 students for the children's choir. Meanwhile, Bruno Walter, Mahler's assistant at the Vienna Hofoper, was responsible for the recruitment and preparation of the eight soloists. Through the spring and summer these forces prepared in their home towns, before assembling in Munich early in September for three full days of final rehearsals under Mahler. His youthful assistant Otto Klemperer remarked later on the many small changes that Mahler made to the score during rehearsal: [...] "He always wanted more clarity, more sound, more dynamic contrast. At one point during rehearsals he turned to us and said, 'If, after my death, something doesn't sound right, then change it. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> only a right but a duty to do so.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E
500|$|When Chen quit Maxis to re-join Thatgamecompany, {{he did so}} {{knowing that}} it would mean taking less pay and having a less stable career. He felt, though, that it was {{important}} to the industry and medium as a whole to create games that provoked different emotional responses in the player than just excitement or fear. While Chen is not opposed to making action games, and his company has made internal [...] "exciting" [...] games that were well received at Sony, he feels that there is no point to Thatgamecompany commercially producing games like that instead of working for existing game developers, as they would not be making anything new that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio. Similarly, Chen does not intend for Thatgamecompany to make [...] "big budget blockbuster games", as the pressure on profits that entails would stifle the innovation that he wants Thatgamecompany to focus on. Chen believes that for video games to become a mature medium like film, the industry as a whole needs to create a wide range of emotional responses to their games, similar to how film has thriller, romance, and comedy genres based on the emotions they provoke. He feels that there are only three ways for video games to impact adults in the same way they do children: [...] "intellectually, whereby the work reveals a new perspective about the world that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> seen before," [...] by [...] "emotionally touching someone," [...] and [...] "by creating a social environment where the intellectual or emotional stimulation could happen from other people." ...|$|E

500|$|A billionaire socialite who dedicates {{himself to}} {{protecting}} Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked vigilante who is hailed as its [...] "Dark Knight" [...] at night. Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{coping with}} the loss of her child, Isabella {{continued}} to work at The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. Although she was not a regular cook, she and Samuel obtained recipes from other sources. A request to receive the readers' own recipes led to over 2,000 being sent in, which were selected and edited by the Beetons. Published works were also copied, largely unattributed to any of the sources. These included Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families, Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper, Marie-Antoine Carême's Le Pâtissier royal parisien, Louis Eustache Ude's The French Cook, Alexis Soyer's The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère and The Pantropheon, Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, Maria Eliza Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli. Suzanne Daly and Ross G. Forman, in their examination of Victorian cooking culture, consider that the plagiarism makes it [...] "an important index of mid-Victorian and middle-class society" [...] because the production of the text from its own readers ensures that it is a reflection of what was actually being cooked and eaten at the time. In copying the recipes of others, Isabella was following the recommendation given to her by Henrietta English, a family friend, who wrote that [...] "Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> had.
