5000|$|According {{to music}} journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, the name Johnny Diesel was either from Lizotte's {{days as a}} petrol {{dispenser}} or from a corruption of John Dalzell's name being misapplied {{to him as the}} lead singer.

[...] "John had one kid and another on the way," [...] Mark explains. [...] "A friend of ours used to refer to them as 'Johnny Diesel and his little injectors'; I thought it was funny.

'I'm going to put an ad in the paper, does this nameless band have a name?' I told her we were 'Johnny Diesel and the Injectors'. It was just a joke. I wanted it to appear in the newspaper to amuse John Dalzall but the name stuck. When we got to Sydney, our Management said, 'Everyone will think you're Johnny Diesel.

40|$|A {{fast track}} to {{employment}} and profit? CUE: When a country finds it has {{a high rate of}} unemployment among its young people, what can it do? Some governments offer free training, or subsidise credit for small businesses. Our next report comes from Zimbabwe, where some young people have benefited from the ?Fast Track? land resettlement programme. Sylvia Jiyane met two young men who received land under the programme, and are now {{trying to make a living}} from agriculture. She was keen to know whether simply giving young people a piece of land had enabled them to earn a living, or whether they needed more help to set up a successful farming business. IN:		?In the programme today ? OUT:		? I am Sylvia Jiyane. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 14 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And Sylvia was reporting from Zimbabwe on the government?s ?Fast track? land resettlement programme. Transcript Jiyane	In the programme today, I will be talking to two youths who are engaged in agricultural activities in Mashonaland West Province, North West of Harare in Zimbabwe. The youth were recently resettled under the government's fast track resettlement programme. Chitumbura	My name is Japson Chitumbura. I was resettled here in Mapinga in October. Jiyane	So what crops have you grown this year? Chitumbura	This year I have grown quite a lot of crops, such as maize, groundnuts, beans, Soya-beans and so forth. Jiyane	What other plans do you have? Chitumbura	I need to keep chickens, if my crops are well. Jiyane	Besides being resettled on this piece of land did you get any assistance from government? Chitumbura	No assistance. Jiyane	What assistance were you looking forward to? Chitumbura	They have to help us because our crops are now becoming yellowish, because of shortage of fertilizer. Jiyane	And now that you have got a piece of land and you are already working on that piece of land, would you encourage other youth like you to venture into agriculture? Chitumbura	Yes I would like to encourage other youth to practice agriculture. Jiyane	Now here is what another youth in agriculture had to say about his new vocation. Gawani	My name is Patrick Gawani; I'm staying in Banket that's where I got my land from Government from the fast track. Jiyane	What crops did you grow this season? Gawani	Especially maize, groundnuts and paprika. Jiyane	Looking at your crops, we?ve been going through the farm, there is quite a lot of green. At what condition exactly are they? Gawani	Now we think it?s alright, because in the middle of this month rains had almost gone, but now I can see the crop, they are getting well. Jiyane	Besides this piece of land did you get any form of assistance from either government or anywhere? Gawani	You know the government only gave us these seeds, but now we are just waiting for them to assist us with fertilizer, again. Jiyane	You seem to be doing very well, your crops look quite OK. Do you have any other projects in the pipeline that you would want to do in the next season besides just growing crops? Gawani	We were planning to have the range of cattle, even chicken projects, so that we will not have to wait for only ploughing or doing farming. Jiyane	The projects that you are mentioning require quite a lot of finance. How are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about getting finance for those projects? Gawani	We want the government to help us. Even the donors who can come and help us to have that money to start those projects. Jiyane	I certainly hope that all other youths in other parts of the world, benefited from our discussion with the two youths in this programme. The prime lesson for youths is that white collar employment is not the only way to earn a living. Engaging in properly planned agricultural activities is a good vehicle of improving one?s life, especially in this critical time of economic stagnation, all over the world. Till we meet again in the next programme, I am Sylvia Jiyane. End of tape. The ?Fast Track? programme in Zimbabwe has redistributed land to landless people, in order to give them the opportunity to make a living from agriculture. This report features two young recipients of land, who describe the difficulties they have faced, and the potential they see for their future as farmers...|$|E

5000|$|After 50 Cent was {{discovered}} by rapper Eminem in 2002, he flew to Los Angeles where he was introduced to record producer Dr. Dre.

So pick one of these and make a couple of singles or something.' The very first time he heard rap on 'In Da Club' he said, 'Yo, I didn't think <b>you</b> was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there with it, but, you know, it works.' He was probably thinking of going in a different direction with that song. Then he expanded it into a hit record.|$|R

I think that for me, {{it was the first}} time I ever kind of noticed that in myself, like when you are curious about something you know might be bad for you, but you know that <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for it anyway because if you don't, you'll have greater regrets about not seeing where that would go, but I think that for me it all went along with this record that was pushing boundaries, like the sound of this record pushes boundaries, it was writing about something I hadn't written before." ...|$|R

5000|$|He was a {{reporter}} for The Sun before joining The Sunday People, under editor Neil Wallis. He moved to the News of the World in June 2001, under editor Rebekah Brooks (then Rebekah Wade) but was sacked in 2005 by then editor Andy Coulson for drink and drug problems. He said in regard to his drug taking while employed by the News of the World, [...] "I was paid <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and take drugs with rock stars - get drunk with them, take pills with them, take cocaine with them. It was so competitive. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{beyond the call of}} duty. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do things that no sane man would do. Youre in a machine." [...] He claims to have often taken [...] "three grammes of cocaine a day, spending about £1,000 a week" [...] and would drink Jack Daniels, and then would snort a line of cocaine as part of a [...] "rock stars breakfast".

You've got a charming young body and you've no soul, and that's such a {{fascinating}} combination. If you had a soul you would either dislike or worship me, and I'd much rather have things as they are. And now <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> a step beyond that, and other people will applaud you and {{say that you are}} wonderful, and invite you to eat with them and motor with them and yacht with them. As soon as that begins to happen, Ronnie, {{a lot of other things}} will come to an end. Of course I've always known that you don't really care for me, but as soon as the world knows it you are irrevocably damaged as a plaything. That is the great secret that binds us together, the knowledge that we have no real affection for one another. And this afternoon every one will know that you are a great artist, and no great artist was ever a great lover." ...|$|R
5000|$|During one {{recording}} session, Mike Rutherford first {{created the}} main riff {{of the song}} he called [...] "Heavy A Flat", to which Phil Collins suddenly improvised [...] "I Can't Dance!" [...] The riff was actually inspired by a Levi Strauss & Co. TV commercial (in the studio, the song was created under the working title [...] "Blue Jeans") using The Clash song [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go". Originally the band {{did not think of}} it as anything more than a joke, because the song was too simple, too bluesy and completely unlike Genesis' style. Tony Banks said in an interview [...] "It was one of those bits <b>you</b> thought was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> nowhere. It sounded fun, but wasn't really special".|$|R
5000|$|Tom Brooke, who portrays Fiore, {{spoke of}} the story {{progression}} as being the thing which excites him the most, with Brooke stating, [...] "...

I've {{seen a lot of}} elements in this show that other shows have, but they’re not used in the way that we use them. Nobody’s got a vampire like our vampire." [...] Joseph Gilgun, who portrays Cassidy, spoke about his character's encounter with Jesse in [...] "The Possibilities", [...] "Cassidy's someone you can go too. He's not gonna judge you 'cos he's nuts, who is he to judge? I think Cassidy see's Jesse's power as being an opportunity." ...|$|R
6000|$|George Ritchie was {{the other}} pilot's cub. He was having good times now; for his boss, George Ealer, was as {{kindhearted}} as Brown wasn't. Ritchie had steeled for Brown the season before; consequently he knew exactly how to entertain himself and plague me, all by the one operation. Whenever I took the wheel {{for a moment on}} Ealer's watch, Ritchie would sit back on the bench and play Brown, with continual ejaculations of 'Snatch her! snatch her! Derndest mud-cat I ever saw!' 'Here! Where <b>you</b> <b>going</b> NOW? <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> run over that snag?' 'Pull her DOWN! Don't you hear me? Pull her DOWN!' 'There she goes! JUST as I expected!

5000|$|Walter Hill {{admitted}} {{there were}} [...] "some difficult moments" [...] {{arising out of}} changing the story from a film to a mini series.I think the arguments came about because nobody {{wanted to make it}} something other than what it was. We all understood that if this thing was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be any good, you needed to stick with what had made it good up to that point and try to develop that further rather than to introduce some entirely new format and style. But at the same time <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to change it because if <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> from the 125 page script to the 160 pages or whatever I certainly felt that a few more narrative events might not be a bad idea. I thought we had plenty of sitting around the fire and talking things over. Duvall requested that they restore some of the previous focus: [...] "And I said, 'You'd better get it back to the way it was,' and they began to rewrite and we rewrote. We had to because it was going off in the wrong direction," [...] said Duvall, explaining that the altered script had a new and, to him, unwarranted emphasis on [...] "gunfights" [...] and other [...] "very obvious, melodramatic" [...] plot devices. [...] "We had {{to get back to the}} way Alan Geoffrion wrote it. So when we got it back, I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> work Monday morning." ...|$|R

If <b>you</b> don't, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after the authorities responsible." [...] Tensions rose in advance of the referendum, with a group of 40 armed men taking over the Caracas city hall, to which an opposition mayor had been elected in November, and declaring the building [...] "recovered for the revolution". Tear gas was also thrown at the compound of the papal nuncio, who had granted asylum to an anti-Chávez student leader accused of sexual assault; and an anti-Chávez student leader's car was burned.|$|R

Johnston fell in love with the Chief Waubojeeg's daughter, but the Chief was skeptical of white men. He initially refused when Johnston asked for his daughter in marriage, saying: [...] "White Man, I have noticed your behaviour, it has been correct; but, White Man, your colour is deceitful.
