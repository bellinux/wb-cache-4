500|$|The pianist Pascal Rogé commented in 1999 {{that both}} sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: [...] "You must accept him as a whole. If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale {{photocopy}} of what he really is." [...] Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was [...] "healthy, clear and robust – music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav".|$|E
500|$|The final {{movement}} of the mass begins with an introduction {{that is similar to}} that to the [...] "Crucifixus". The piano then begins another ostinato pattern as the base for expressive melodies by the contralto soloist, repeating many times [...] "Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis" [...] (Lamb of God, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> the sins of the world, have mercy). After an extended cadence the choir sings a capella, twice and very simply: [...] "Dona nobis pacem" [...] (Give us peace). This process is repeated in different harmony, and once more in a major mode, leading to an intense request for peace of the soloist and the choir together. Then the movement returns to the introduction, with its soft chords interrupted by rests, and ends with a few strong hammered chords.|$|E

When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E

500|$|Taare Zameen Par {{received}} several positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha {{suggests that the}} film is [...] "a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its [...] "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." [...] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film [...] "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [...] a film full of substance!" [...] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a [...] "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine," [...] and is [...] "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; {{this is a little}} twinkling star of a movie." [...] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, [...] "Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." [...] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, [...] "Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked Taare Zameen Par. I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2013 {{he again}} {{suggested}} that African Americans possess a [...] "slick" [...] style of boxing which {{is superior to}} other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). [...] "The great Sugar Ray Leonard, right now, if he was boxing, {{the way that they}} want you to fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson – the great Robinson – would be boring today…Because the feeders of the people that buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it.

Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [...] to the customers. The customers will drink anything that you give them if it's promoted right…But when <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> the skill and <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> the slick, and <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick. And I'm talking about black fighters. Yes, I said it", said Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{step that}} was symbolically {{important}} {{in view of the}} council's prohibition of depicting Christ as a Lamb, Sergius introduced into the liturgy the chant [...] "Lamb of God, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>away</b> the sins of the world, have mercy on us" [...] at the breaking of the Host during Mass, and restored the damaged facade mosaic in the atrium of Saint Peter's that depicted the Worship of the Lamb. The Agnus Dei would have been chanted in both Greek and Latin during this period, {{in the same manner as}} the other liturgical changes of Sergius.|$|E
