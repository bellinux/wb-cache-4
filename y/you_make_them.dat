[...] Captain Pratt told Luther: “My boy, you are going away from us to work for this school. [...] Go and do your best.

2500|$|The Fu Zi {{mentioned}} that someone, who lived {{around the same}} time as Xun You, once asked if there were any virtuous junzis in their time. He received an answer as follows, [...] "The benevolence of Lord Prefect Xun (Yu) and the intelligence of Military Adviser Xun (<b>You)</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> worthy of being called virtuous junzis of our time. Lord Prefect Xun is benevolent and virtuous, he displays wisdom in recommending talents, his personal conduct is flawless, and he is capable of adapting his strategies to suit changes. Meng Ke once said, 'It is a rule that a true royal sovereign should arise in the course of five hundred years, and that during that time there should be men illustrious in their generation.' Lord Prefect Xun is one of such men. As Taizu once said, 'Lord Prefect Xun provides advice and doesn't stop providing advice; Military Adviser Xun eliminates evil and doesn't stop eliminating evil.'" ...|$|E

Thus, when in [...] God told Moses [...] "see that <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> after their pattern," [...] Moses complained that he was not God that {{he should be able to}} make one exactly like the pattern.

Thus God told Moses that if he would make below a replica of that which was above, God would cause God's Shechinah to dwell among the people.|$|E

Wanamaker's was the first {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and do your best. The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing.

[...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on the way to work. At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E
