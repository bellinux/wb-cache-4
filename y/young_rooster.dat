40|$|In mammals {{the length}} of {{daylight}} has an oscillatory influence on semen production. It is known that in mammalian males highest semen output occurs mainly in spring and fall. It is possible that there is the same pattern in rooster semen production despite the anatomic differences regarding the testis location and, obviously local temperature. Considering these facts the present trial {{was set up in}} order to reveal effects of prolonged daylight – photo stimulation – on semen production in <b>young</b> <b>roosters.</b> All <b>young</b> <b>roosters</b> in the trial were divided in 3 groups, according to the age when photo stimulating schedule started. Photo stimulation was performed by moving <b>young</b> <b>roosters</b> from an 8 h/day light to 14 h / day light. Attempts of collecting semen up to the age of 20 weeks have failed showing relationship between body general development and semen output. Under prolonged light semen parameters as volume, motility and concentration changed from one week to the other. However, light is not the single factor inducing sexual maturity of the genital tract, but it could be used in <b>young</b> <b>roosters</b> in order to stimulate feed intake and thus overall body growth and development...|$|R

40|$|The stapedius muscle {{activity}} {{associated with}} vocalization was analyzed in <b>young</b> and adult <b>roosters.</b> Our {{results show that}} remarkable differences {{in the behavior of}} vocalization-related stapedius muscle activity exist between these two ages. Unlike <b>young</b> <b>roosters,</b> electrical stimulation in the midbrain of adult cocks yields vocalizations associated with stapedius muscle EMG responses that always show a higher threshold and a longer latency than those of the vocalization induced. Moreover, the maximal amplitude of the stapedius muscleEMG response is consistently lower than that detected in <b>young</b> <b>roosters,</b> {{despite the fact that the}} maximal vocalization amplitude of the adult birds is much higher. Onthewholeourresultsdemonstrate thatvocalization-relatedstapediusmuscleactivityisstronglyreducedinadulthood. Thepossibility that stapedius muscle may play a role during the vocal development was verified by comparing the crow of normal roosters with that of cocks from which the stapedius muscle had been removed shortly after hatching. Strong differences exist in the amplitude/frequency distribution of the crowing of normal and stapedectomized roosters, suggesting that the stapedius muscle exerts an important role in auditory feedback modulation, and that this feedback is used for normal vocal development...|$|R

50|$|When {{the rooster}} mates with the hen, sperm enter the hen's oviduct and are stored within sperm storage glands. These glands can store {{more than half}} a million sperm, and sperm can remain viable for up to 3 weeks. However, a hen will have maximum {{fertility}} for only about 3 to 4 days after one mating. Therefore, the male-to-female ratio in a flock must be enough to ensure mating of every hen every 3 days or so.

40|$|A Fsample {{of young}} 60 hens and 40 roosters of Rhode Island breed were divided in groups L 1, L 2 and L 3. Individuals in group L 1 were {{transferred}} {{at the age}} of 16 weeks from 8 h light/ day to 16 h light/ day and fed with a normal adult poultry feed. The same switch was performed with groups L 2 and L 3 {{at the age of}} 18 and respectively 20 weeks. Modifications of the sexual traits were recorded including: phenotype, weight and length of the genital tract, laying intensity, average egg weight and semen parameters. Furthermore, blood samples were analysed for FSH and LH. From photo stimulated roosters -kept under an 8 h light/ day programme at the age of 18, 22 and 24 weeks- histology samples from testis and deferens ducts were analysed. In young hens reproductive parameters are influenced both by light length and the age when this photo stimulation occur. All data shows that starting photo stimulation at 18 weeks has positive effects on the egg production in the analysed population. In <b>young</b> <b>roosters</b> inducing sexual stimulation before the age of 20 weeks will prolong the time length to typical reproductive activity and also will affect the semen quality. Thus, it seems that age is more important for <b>young</b> <b>roosters</b> in achieving reproductive maturity than in young hens. Therefore, inducing early sexual development is rather detrimental for males...|$|R

40|$|Contents: Age {{negatively}} affects {{reproductive success}} of broiler breeder flocks. One {{of the main}} hormones involved in the change of fertility with the age is testosterone (TT). The introduction of young males at later production stages of broiler flocks is known as spiking {{and is expected to}} reduce the fertility decline with age. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of injection of different levels of TT and the effect of spiking on reproductive fitness of broiler breeder flocks. Two experiments were conducted on Ross 308 breeder flocks for 10 weeks (41 - 50 weeks of age). The experiment 1 included a control and three treatments corresponding to three doses of TT (0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 cc), while the experiment 2 included a control and one treatment corresponding to spiking. The lower dose of TT (0. 1 cc) and the spiking clearly slowed down the decline in hatchability. Therefore, either the external administration of TT to the males when the natural concentration of TT starts to decline or spiking the breeder flock with <b>young</b> <b>roosters</b> could contribute to improve reproductive success in later stages of the production cycle in broiler breeder flocks.

5000|$|Sarhul {{is of the}} {{important}} culture of asur tribe. it was celebrated during spring season and the Saal trees get new flowers on their branches. It is a worship of the village deity who {{is considered to be}} the protector of the tribes. People sing and dance a lot when the new flowers appear. The deities are worshiped with saal flowers. The village priest or Pahan fasts for a couple of days. In the early morning he takes a bath and puts on new a dhoti made of virgin cotton (kachha dhaga). The previous evening, the Pahan takes three new earthen pots and fills them with fresh water; the next morning he observes these earthen pots and water level inside. If the water level decreases he predicts that there would be famine or less rain, and if the water level is normal, that is the signal of a good rain. Before pooja starts, the wife of the Pahan washes his feet and gets blessings from him.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for 40 years that {{oestrogens}} stimulate phospholipid metabolism in roosters. We have investigated in vivo the mechanism for this effect. <b>Young</b> <b>roosters</b> were injected daily with 1 mg of diethylstilboestrol for 1 [...] 3 days. At 4 h after the last injection, 30 microCi of [Me- 3 H]choline was injected into the portal vein. At periods up to 3 min the livers were freeze-clamped and choline and its metabolites were extracted and resolved by t. l. c. Hormone treatment in the first 2 days resulted in a 2 -fold increase in phosphorylation of [Me- 3 H]choline and a decrease in the oxidation of [Me- 3 H]choline to [3 H]betaine. The concentrations of phosphocholine in liver were increased 2 -fold during the first 2 days concomitant with a 2 -fold increase in the rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. After 3 days of hormone treatment, many of the above effects were reversed and the rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis decreased to approx. 60 % of the control value. The results suggest that the initial hormone treatments activate choline kinase within 4 h and, thereby, divert choline form oxidation to betaine. The resulting increased phosphocholine concentrations cause an increase in the activity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, which results in a doubling of the rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. After 3 days of hormone treatment, the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine is decreased, most likely by an effect on the cytidylyltransferase reaction...|$|R

Defesa: Palotina, 15 / 09 / 2014 Inclui referênciasÁrea de concentração : Produção animalResumo: Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o efeito da suplementação dietética de antioxidantes sobre características espermáticas de galos reprodutores de frango de corte. Foram realizados três experimentos. No primeiro, foram utilizados 12 galos Cobb de 50 semanas de idade distribuídos aleatoriamente em um delineamento inteiramente casualizado com 2 tratamentos e 6 repetições. Amostras de sêmen foram coletadas pelo método de massagem {{abdominal}} para avaliação de volume seminal, concentração, motilidade, vigor e morfologia espermática. Às 68 semanas de idade, amostras de testículo foram coletadas para determinação da morfometria tubular dos testículos e para análise da proliferação celular no epitélio germinativo pela técnica do PCNA. A morfometria de testículos, cristas e barbelas também foram analisadas. Os dados foram submetidos à análise estatística utilizando-se o programa Statistical Analysis System com nível de 5 % de significância. Houve efeito positivo (p 0, 05) da suplementação do blend de antioxidantes na dieta dos reprodutores sobre o ganho de peso e o peso de peito da progênie aos 7 dias de idade. A contagem e diâmetro da fibra muscular não diferiu (p> 0, 05) entre a progênie oriunda de galos suplementados ou não. A conversão alimentar e ganho de peso na fase de 14 - 35 dias foram melhores (p 0, 05) {{from the}} breeder male antioxidant supplementation on the 7 day progeny gain of weight and chest weight. The muscular fiber counting and diameter did not differed (p> 0, 05) between the progeny {{derived from the}} supplemented roosters and the control one. The feed conversion and gain of weight of the progeny between the 14 and 35 days of age were better (p< 0, 05) to the progeny derived from the supplemented males. At the third experiment, 24 Cobb roosters were used, 12 with 25 weeks of age and 12 with 50 weeks of age and distributed in a totally casual delineation in factorial system 2 x 2 (ages and diets) adding 4 treatments and 6 repetitions of 1 bird each. The lycopene were provided at 72 ppm (Lycopene 10 %, Roche Vitamins). After 12 weeks of supplementation, the semen was collected by abdominal massage mthod. The semen analysis, semen volume, spermatic concentration and motility were made right after the collect. All the roosters were euthanized in order to testicle, comb, dewlaps and chest measurement and weighing. Fragments from the testicles were fixed, paraffin blocked, cut and put on marked blades to mitosis cells detection by immunohistochemistry technique. The comb length and width from the <b>younger</b> <b>roosters</b> were bigger (p< 0, 05) compared to the older roosters, independently from the lycopene added to the diet. The same result was observed to testicle weight, length and thickness. In the interaction unfolding of age and treatment, {{it was observed that}} the inclusion of lycopene increased (p< 0, 05) the weight of the 50 week age roosters. The lycopene added to the diet, independently from the males' age increased the number of positive-PCNA cells in the testicles. The using of specific diets to male is highly viable, not only by the well-known benefits about nutrition requirements on eclodibility and fertility, but also to make possible the use of additives, once the volume of feed for the male is smaller than the female feed.
