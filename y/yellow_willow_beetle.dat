50|$|The blue <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is found}} on aspen and various willow (Salix) species in fens, carrs and on river banks, but also often in willow short {{rotation}} coppice in agricultural landscapes. It often aggregates on host plants. On Salix cinerea, it prefers and is more common on female than male trees despite higher egg predation exerted by Anthocoris nemorum on the former. It is univoltine in Sweden but can produce multiple generations per year {{in other parts of}} its distribution range. Proliferation of larvae and egg production varies with vegetation. It overwinters under lichens on trees and under tree bark. Predators of blue <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> eggs are the common flowerbug (Anthocoris nemorum) and Orthotylus marginalis, and the adult is a vessel for larval development for the parasitoid wasp Perilitus brevicollis.|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the potential {{effects of climate}} change on the sub-alpine <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle,</b> the cold tolerance strategy and mechanisms involved in cold tolerance were investigated for all life stages. Microhabitat choice and microclimate temperatures within each microhabitat were related to median lethal temperature for each life stage. Summer active and quiescent adults are freeze tolerant, eggs and pupae are freeze avoidant and all larval stages are chill susceptible. Quiescent adults accumulated the highest concentration of glycerol (~ 24 mM) and haemolymph osmolality (875 mOsm). Haemolymph from pupae had angular crystals suggestive of antifreeze agent activity, but this was absent in the haemolymph of other life stages. Quiescent adults must move to a thermally buffered microhabitat in the soil to survive the winter in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Low temperatures beyond the limits of the cold tolerance of the <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> occur often at the mid-willow, but the quiescent adults are protected from these cold exposures in the soil beneath the willow. Overall, the <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> uses both behavioural avoidance strategies and physiological mechanisms to survive cold exposures in its habitat...|$|R

40|$|Plant sex {{effects on}} herbivores are well studied, but {{little is known}} about these effects on predators and predator-herbivore dynamics. Here we take a {{holistic}} approach to study, simultaneously, plant sex effects on herbivore and predator preference and performance, as well as population densities and predation pressure in the field. For dioecious Salix cinerea (grey willow) we found that male plants represented higher host plant quality than females for an omnivorous predator (Anthocoris nemorum, common flower bug), while host plant quality for its herbivorous prey (Phratora vulgatissima, blue <b>willow</b> <b>beetle)</b> was not sex-biased. The herbivore strongly preferred the host plant sex (female) that was suboptimal for the predator, which in turn followed its prey to female plants, leading to plant-sex-biased predation. These results provide new insight into the far-reaching effects of plant sex on insect communities, and open up novel opportunities for improving biocontrol of the herbivore in Salix short rotation coppice...|$|R

Willow species included in the research were: S. lemmonii (Lemmon willow), S. scouleriana (Scouler willow), S. boothii (Booth willow), S. geyeriana (Geyer willow), S. exigua (coyote willow), S. lasiandra (whiplash willow), and S. lutea (<b>yellow</b> <b>willow).</b> The habitat parameters measured were: height and distance of willow individual from stream channel bankfull elevation, stream channel slope, entrenchment ratio, width-to-depth ratio, watershed elevation, valley azimuth, valley width, soil rock size distribution, soil texture, and winter air temperature. Logistic regression models were built to describe probabilities of occurrence for five out of the seven willow species based on the habitat data collected. Multi-response permutation procedures were performed to describe differences between respective willow habitats. Booth and Geyer willow habitats were best described by watershed elevation as these species dominated the research stream channel’s upper reaches. Whiplash willow habitat was best described by stream channel entrenchment and width-to-depth ratio as this species occurred, on average, in habitats with high stream channel entrenchment and width-to-depth ratios.

40|$|The {{quicksand}} {{phenomenon is}} one of the big factors of desertification. This report introduced straw net method which {{is one of}} the effective methods for stabilizing quick-sands. This method is to cover the sand dune with straw nets with square circumference of about 1 m. Height of straw fence is about 10 - 20 cm from soil surface and the depth is about 10 - 30 cm. Grass seeds are sprayed after construction of the nets. In some cases, young trees such as pine and <b>yellow</b> <b>willow</b> are planted. At first this method was adopted as the way of protecting a road, a railway from the flow dune in Horquin arid land. Nowadays this method has become popular and widely used for the fixation of the flow sand and for recovering the vegatation, in arid area China. The merits of straw nets on protecting desertification can be pointed as follows. First, the flow sand can be stabilized by the wind-proof effects. Second, the natural material of straw which are an agricultural by-product can be produced in the farm village in the spot. Third, the technique to construct nets is easy. Fourth, the prompt effect afterestablishment can be expected. Fifth, grass and trees are fixed at the short time by harvesting the snow and rainfall as natural water to the root zone. The new evaluation of straw nets is effects on the microclimate modification such as lowering air temperature, increasing the air humidity and lowering soil temperature.

40|$|The {{natural enemies}} attacking eggs (and young larvae) of the <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima were {{identified}} in the field. Three heteropterans were common natural enemies. The mirid Orthotylus marginalis was the most abundant and had an intermediate consumption rate in the lab, whereas the mirid Closterotomus fulvomaculatus was the least abundant but had the high-est consumption rate. The anthocorid Anthocoris nemorum was intermediate in abundance but had the lowest consumption rate. However, the experimental situation (in petridish or on shoot) affected the ranking of the predators and illustrates behavioral differences. The anthocorid was very mobile and could be characterized as a “run and eat ” predator, whereas the mirids were less mobile and behaved to a “find and stay ” principle.

40|$|Group {{formation}} reduces individual predation risk {{when the}} proportion of prey taken per predator encounter declines faster than the increase in group encounter rate (a ack-abatement). Despite a ack-abatement being {{an important component of}} group formation ecology, several key aspects have not been empirically studied, that is, interactions with the hunting mode of the predator and how these relationships are modi ed by local habitat quality. In 79 cage trials, we examined individual egg predation risk in di erent-sized egg clutches from the blue <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima for two predators with di erent hunting modes (consumption of full group [Orthotylus marginalis] vs. part group [Anthocoris nemorum]). Because these predators also take nutrients from plant sap, we could examine how the quality of alternative food sources (high- vs. low-quality host plant sap) in uenced a ack-abatement pa erns in the presence of di erent hunting strategies. For the O. marginalis predator, individual egg predation risk was largely independent of group size. For A. nemorum, egg predation risk clearly declined with increasing group size. However, approximately one-third of the grouping bene t was lost to an increase in group detectability. There were clear di erences in a ack-abatement pa erns between plants with high- vs. low-quality sap. When O. marginalis was the predator, there was no clear change in a ack-abatement in relation to host plant quality. However, for A. nemorum there was a clear reduction in overall predation risk and a stronger a ack-abatement pa ern with increasing group size when plant sap quality increased. This implies that the relative bene ts of prey grouping behavior for any species might show diurnal or seasonal changes as other aspects of resource/habitat quality change for the focal predator. Modulation of a ack-abatement by bo om-up e ects such as plant-based food resources is yet to be incorporated into general theory, despite the ubiquity of omnivorous predators and with omnivory being important for shaping food webs, ecosystem functions, and in biological control. Thus, ongoing re nement of a ack- abatement theory by focusing on bo om-up vs. top-down processes could have signi cant impacts on many important contemporary elds of study...|$|R

It has been suggested that aggregation {{behavior of}} the blue <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima is mediated by both host plant odor and by odor released by the beetles. Previous studies show that the beetles respond to plant odors according to their prior host plant experiences. Here, we analyzed the effect of the host plant species on odor released and perceived by adult P.  vulgatissima. The major difference between the odor of beetles feeding on salicin-rich and salicin-poor host plants was the presence of salicylaldehyde in the odor of the former, where both males and females released this compound. Electrophysiological studies showed that the intensity of responses to single components of odor released by beetles was sex specific and dependent on the host plant species with which the beetles were fed. Finally, behavioral studies revealed that males feeding on salicin-rich willows were attracted by salicylaldehyde, whereas females did not respond behaviorally to this compound, despite showin...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, it {{had been}} thought that humid {{catchment}} woody plants transpired primarily mobile soil water that would otherwise flow to streams or recharge groundwater. However, several recent {{studies have suggested that}} trees in seasonally-dry humid catchments use primarily tightly-bound, immobile soil water that does not fully mix with new precipitation or participate in translatory flow. McDonnell (2014) called this existence of two, hydrologically-distinct, water pools “the two water worlds hypothesis. ” This ecohydrological behavior has important implications for understanding a wide range of catchment processes, including the spatial and temporal variability of evapotranspiration and nutrient cycling, and our abilities to accurately model those processes. Yet, similar studies have not been conducted in drier environments. This study aims to improve our understanding of semi-arid woody plant root water sources. Isotopic analyses were conducted on the xylem water of nine common semi-arid woody plant species, in conjunction with bulk soil water, groundwater, and streamwater samples. The isotopic concentrations of plant xylem water and potential root water sources were plotted in dual-isotope space and qualitatively assessed. Additionally, the SISUS model was used to computationally characterize all feasible water source contributions to each plant individual. In total, 112 out of 121 plant samples had isotope values indicative of use of at least fractional immobile soil water use. These findings were consistent, regardless of plant species, geographic location, or time of sample collection. Nevertheless, some <b>Yellow</b> <b>willow,</b> Fire willow, Chokecherry, Rabbitbrush, Douglas-fir, and Ponderosa pine individuals plotted between immobile and mobile water sources, and were modeled to use greater than 30 % mobile water sources (groundwater and streamwater) in the late growing season. Additionally, median modeled use of mobile water sources increased for each field site between July and September, indicating that many plants may have actively rooted to groundwater as the soil column dried significantly below the permanent wilting point. Therefore, we accept the two water worlds hypothesis in terms of immobile soil water use, regardless of mobile soil water availability. However, we also acknowledge that many semi-arid woody plants also use mobile groundwater and streamwater sources...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{fossil fuel}} prices, energy {{security}} and adherence to existing European Union (EU) climate/energy policies means that Ireland must look towards {{alternative energy sources}} to meet future demand. Woody biomass {{in the form of}} short rotation coppice willow (SRCW) is considered a viable option. SRCW is vulnerable to damage by a range of diseases and pests however. The blue (Phratora vulgatissima) and brown (Galerucella lineola) <b>willow</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are identified economically as two of the most damaging insect pests of SRCW in Ireland. Policies which mandate levels of renewable energy use, to mitigate future climate change, fail to consider adaptation in the energy sector under increased levels of pestilence due to projected changes in the climate system. The effects of abiotic and biotic factors, mainly temperature and photoperiod, but also host plant, on beetle development were investigated. Constant temperature experiments showed that development time for all assessed life-cycle stages decreased as temperature increased. P. vulgatissima oviposition period and total fecundity were influenced by temperature also. Development was not found to vary considerably when P. vulgatissima larvae were reared on different host plant varieties (Tora, Resolution, Tordis and Inger) across a similar range of constant temperatures. A critical daylength (CDL) for P. vulgatissima facultative reproduction was calculated. The relationship between temperature and P. vulgatissima and G. lineola life-cycle stage development was represented by applying criteria satisfying non-linear deterministic and stochastic functions to development rates and development time distributions respectively. A combined phenology/voltinism model was constructed incorporating a Salix. viminalis degree-day budburst model, the temperature-dependent development rate and temperature-independent time distribution functions, and information regarding the reproductive diapause inducing CDL. Using observed temperature and statistically downscaled climate scenarios derived from different global climate models (GCMs) forced with different emission scenarios, model results suggested important spatio-temporal changes in the life cycle and voltinism of P. vulgatissima, including two annual generations for 5 % and 50 % beetle emergence proportions (E. P) at all observed locations nationally by the 2050 s and three annual generations for 5 % E. P for a percentage of years at certain inland and south-westerly observed locations by the 2080 s.

40|$|Published by the Indian Academy of SciencesThe {{heat shock}} {{response}} {{is a critical}} mechanism by which organisms buffer effects of variable and unpredictable environmental temperatures. Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) increases survival after exposure to stressful conditions in nature, although benefi ts of Hsp expression are often balanced by costs to growth and reproductive success. Hsp-assisted folding of variant polypeptides may prevent development of unfi t phenotypes; thus, some differences in Hsp expression among natural populations of ectotherms {{may be due to}} interactions between enzyme variants (allozymes) and Hsps. In the Sierra <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Chrysomela aeneicollis, which lives in highly variable thermal habitats at the southern edge of their range in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, California, allele frequencies at the enzyme locus phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) vary across a climatic latitudinal gradient. PGI allozymes differ in kinetic properties, and expression of a 70 kDa Hsp differs between populations, along elevation gradients, and among PGI genotypes. Differences in Hsp 70 expression among PGI genotypes correspond to differences in thermal tolerance and traits important for reproductive success, such as running speed, survival and fecundity. Thus, differential Hsp expression among genotypes may allow functionally important genetic variation to persist, allowing populations to respond effectively to environmental chang...|$|R
40|$|Gregarious organisms need {{to handle}} the {{trade-off}} between increasing food competition and {{the positive effects of}} group living, and this is particularly important for ovipositing females. We hypothesized that insect females consider how many conspecifics previously visited a host plant. In a no-choice assay, we show that the gregarious blue <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> (Phratora vulgatissima) laid the most eggs and the largest clutches on plants where a sequence of few individual females was released, compared to plants where one or many different females were repeatedly released. Therefore, this species is more sensitive to the indirectly perceived number of conspecifics than the directly perceived number of eggs on a plant. We further hypothesized that females adjust their own intra-plant egg clutch distribution to that of conspecifics and discovered a new behavioral component, i. e., the modulation of distances between clutches. Females adjusted these distances in ways indicating the use of spatial memory, because the largest distance increases were observed on plants with their own clutches, compared to plants with clutches from conspecifics. However, adjustment of aggregation level and distance between clutches occurred only on a suitable, and not on an unsuitable, Salix genotype.

The number of larvae pupating was much greater in the moist sand and wet sand treatments than in the dry sand treatment. Pupal survival, as measured by the proportion of adults successfully emerging, was greater in the moist treatment than in the wet or dry treatments. Thus, overall pupation success (number of adults successfully emerging) was greater in the moist treatment than in the wet treatment and greater in the wet treatment than in the dry treatment. To examine the effect of soil moisture on choice of pupation site, we provided the larvae with a choice of two soil moistures in each pupation chamber. More larvae chose wet over dry conditions and more chose moist over dry conditions, but larvae did not discriminate between moist and wet conditions. The improved pupation in areas with higher soil moisture is consistent with the field distribution pattern of greater beetle densities on dunes with greater soil moisture...|$|R
