40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are the most promising bacteria among the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR); which may be used as biofertilizers for plant growth and nutrient use efficiency. Moreover, these soil micro-organisms {{play a significant role in}} regulating the dynamics of organic matter decomposition and the availability of plant nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and other nutrients. Through this study, the management of nutrient use efficiency by the application of PSB was targeted in order to make the applied nutrients more available to the plants in the rice (Oryza sativa) and <b>yardlong</b> <b>bean</b> (Vigna unguiculata) cultivation. Results have shown that the treatments with PSB alone or in the form of consortia of compatible strains with or without the external application of chemical NPK gave more germination index (G. I.) from 2. 5 to 5 in rice and 2. 7 to 4. 8 in bean seeds. They also showed a higher growth in both shoot and root length and a higher biomass as compared to the control. This gives us an idea about the potentiality of these PSB strains and their application in rice and <b>yardlong</b> <b>bean</b> cultivation to get a better harvest index. Their use will also possibly reduce the nutrient runoff or leaching and increase in the use efficiency of the applied fertilizers. Thus, we can conclude that the NPK uptake and management can be improved by the use of PSB in rice and <b>yardlong</b> <b>bean</b> cultivation, and their application may be much more beneficial in the agricultural field...|$|R

40|$|The {{vegetable}} leafminer Liriomyza sativae is {{an economically}} important pest {{of a wide}} variety of vegetable and ornamental crops in tropical Asian countries, but information on the relative abundance of the leafminer and its parasitoids is still limited. Field surveys were conducted through the year (from June 2005 to June 2006) in three commercial vegetable fields in Ho Chi Minh City, southern Vietnam with the aim at monitoring the relative abundance of the leafminer and its parasitoids. Both adult and larva L. sativae were present in the vegetable fields throughout the year. The abundance of L. sativae on <b>yardlong</b> <b>bean</b> and kidney bean was relatively low in the beginning of growing seasons but the infestation became more serious in the end of the seasons.
