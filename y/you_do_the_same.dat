500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its depth. IGN's Doug Perry called GoldenEye 007 an immersive game which [...] "blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship". Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age {{remarked that}} players have [...] "a bit of freedom {{as to what}} they want to do in any given situation, and what order the directives are completed in". Reviewers also enjoyed the wide variety of weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they make the game stay [...] "fresh by never having <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing twice". The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim's earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter [...] Game Revolution credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that GoldenEye 007 [...] "takes it for granted that you have already seen the movie" [...] and that players may get stuck due to the game's lack of orientation. At the time, the multiplayer mode was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, [...] "edging Mario Kart 64 by a hair" [...] according to IGN. Edge called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice.|$|E

60|$|If {{has been}} said that Stephen Dallison, when unable to get his golf on Saturdays, went to his club, and read reviews. The two forms of exercise, in fact, were very similar: in playing golf you went round and round; in reading reviews <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> for in course of time you were assured of coming to {{articles}} that, nullified articles already read. In both forms of sport the balance was preserved which keeps a man both sound and young.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1581, Yelena {{was found}} to be pregnant. However, on 15 November, the Tsar became {{offended}} because she was supposedly wearing immodest clothing and he began to beat her.

Then if you had casts of those statues, you would necessarily have those casts placed exactly in the same position as the original statues--it involves the buildings surrounding them and the elevation--it involves the whole architecture.|$|E
