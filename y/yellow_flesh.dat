5|$|In {{the genus}} Boletus, B.auripes is {{classified}} in section Appendiculati. Species {{in this section}} are characterized by having a dry cap with a surface texture ranging from smooth to somewhat , <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh,</b> a reticulate stem, and a mild taste. Other North American boletes in this section include Boletus speciosus and Boletus regius.|$|E
5|$|Other species within Mutabiles include X.campanelloides, {{which can}} be {{differentiated}} by {{the shape of the}} thin-walled caulocystidia and <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh</b> in the stem. X.cornui grows in softwood forests with Sphagnum moss. Both the cap and the top of stem sport yellow grains. X.fraxinophila produces larger mushrooms and has yellow gills. X.parvibulbosa, while potentially featuring similar caulocystidia to X.setulipes, has a bitter or sour taste.|$|E
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh</b> {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E

This research was an experimental study using two factor of completely randomized design (CDR).

Inoculation used streak plate method which incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours.

Another European species, Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus, has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap. The Chinese species Neoboletus sinensis, originally described as a form of S.luridus, can be most reliably distinguished from the latter by its larger spores, which have been reported to be as large as 12–17 by 5.5–7μm. Fruit bodies closely resembling S.luridus have been recorded in Australia, though renamed Boletus barragensis as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family Myrtaceae.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1898. Peck collected the type specimen in Port Jefferson, New York. In 1945, Rolf Singer proposed the variety Boletus auripes var. aureissimus {{as a new}} combination of the name Ceriomyces aureissimus described by William Alphonso Murrill in 1938; this taxon is now regarded as a distinct species under the name Boletus aureissimus. In 1936, Wally Snell reported finding a specimen of Boletus crassipes, another species described by Peck from Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. Snell suggested that although B.crassipes might be a valid species distinguished from B.auripes by a deeper brown cap color, <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh</b> that does not fade to white, and a stem with a more orange-yellow color and more extensive reticulation, he conceded {{that it was not}} clear that the morphological characteristics between the two did not overlap, and that further collections would be needed to clarify any differences between them. A couple of years later, he was more convinced of his stance and considered the two conspecific. The taxonomic authorities Index Fungorum and MycoBank, however, do not recognize this putative synonymy.|$|E

40|$|Custard {{powder and}} salad cream are two food {{products}} commercially manufactured using different quantities of corn starch. This study aimed at determining the physicochemical properties of some starches extracted from some white and yellow root cassava varieties. The prospective {{applicability of the}} cassava starches in custard powder and salad cream production was also determined. The physical, chemical and functional properties of eight cassava starches were determined using standard analytical procedures. Sensory acceptability of the products was also determined using untrained consumer group. Products made from corn starch were used as the reference samples. The physical, chemical and functional properties of the cassava starches varied significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). The results of multivariate data analysis (principal component and cluster analyses) showed {{that it was difficult}} to completely discriminate starches from the <b>yellow</b> <b>fleshed</b> and white fleshed cassava roots.

Starch powder dispersibility was found to have significant influence (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) on the sensory acceptability of the two products. However, starch from a <b>yellow</b> <b>fleshed</b> root (TMS 01 / 1368) was the most preferred for salad cream making while starch from a white fleshed root (TMS 30572) was the most preferred for making custard powder.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract <b>Yellow</b> <b>fleshed</b> potatoes contain {{significant amounts of}} lutein and zeaxanthin but the bioaccessibility of potato carotenoids {{has not yet been}} investigated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the in vitro bioaccessibility of carotenoids provided by potato. Lutein and zeaxanthin con-centrations of boiled, freeze dried and milled samples of seven <b>yellow</b> <b>fleshed</b> potato accessions were determined by HPLC before and after different steps (gastric, duodenal and micellar phase) of in vitro digestion. The gastric and duodenal diges-tive stability of lutein and zeaxanthin in boiled tubers of the different accessions ranged from 70 to 95 % while the effi-ciency of micellarization ranged from 33 to 71 % for lutein and from 51 to 71 % for zeaxanthin. For all accessions, amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin after micellarization were significantly lower than the original amount found in the boiled samples. The accession 701862 showed the highest bioaccessible lutein concentration (280 μg/ 100 g, FW) and the accessions 703566 and 704218 showed the highest bioac-cessible zeaxanthin concentration (above 600 μg/ 100 g, FW). Considering the mean potato intake in the Andes (500 g per day), the accession 701862 provides 14 % of the lutein intake suggested for health benefits and the accessions 703566 and 704218 provide 50 % more than the suggested zeaxanthin intake...|$|R

40|$|Potatoes are {{referred}} to as a good source of antioxidants like ascorbic acid (AA), carotenoids and polyphenols, however there is scarce information regarding the antioxidant concentration in cooked potatoes. In this study, the effect of cooking on the concentrations of ascorbic acid, carotenoids, total phenolic and total anthocyanins of diverse varieties were evaluated by spectrophotometry and HPLC. Cooking significantly reduced the AA concentration of all the varieties with boiling reducing the AA concentration to a lesser degree than either baking or microwaving. One hundred g of boiled potatoes of the variety 704393 could provide between 17 and 20 % of the RDA of AA. Comparison of the carotenoid compositions of raw and cooked tubers of some varieties revealed that cooking significantly reduced the violaxanthin and antheraxanthin concentration of all the varieties. However the lutein and zeaxanthin concentration of cooked tubers of some of the varieties evaluated was higher than in raw tubers. One hundred grams of the cooked <b>yellow</b> <b>fleshed</b> varieties provide a significant amount of zeaxanthin (above 500 ug) to the human diet. The total phenolic and total anthoacyanin concentrations of the pink and purple fleshed varieties evaluated were higher in cooked than raw potatoes.
