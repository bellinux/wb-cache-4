500|$|Their first gig was {{arranged}} by Matlock, who was studying at Saint Martins College. The band {{played at the}} school on 6 November 1975, {{in support of a}} pub rock group called Bazooka Joe, arranging to use their amps and drums. The Sex Pistols performed several cover songs, including the Who's [...] "Substitute", the Small Faces' [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do About It", [...] "(Don't <b>you</b> <b>Give</b> <b>Me)</b> No Lip" [...] by Dave Berry, and [...] "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone", made famous by the Monkees; according to observers, they were unexceptional musically aside from being extremely loud. Before the Pistols could play the few original songs they had written to date, Bazooka Joe pulled the plugs as they saw their gear being trashed. A brief physical altercation between members of the two bands took place on stage.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about getting [...] "the rules {{straight}} on a budding relationship: Slow down and don't say you love me until <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> some time {{and get to know}} me." [...] According to musicologist Jon Mikkel Broch Ålvik, [...] "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] is the [...] "thinking person's teen pop." [...] Ålvik rejects a superficial interpretation that the lyrics are a [...] "moralistic message of abstinence", arguing instead that M2M [...] "signal a stance that sounds considered and assured rather than prudish" [...] and that {{the song is}} a statement of [...] "burgeoning agency." [...] The song has been described as bubblegum pop music with similar lyrical qualities to songs by girl groups of the 1960s, while also having more influence from rock and singer-songwriter genres than was typical for other teen pop songs of the late 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert {{was known}} for being {{sometimes}} prickly. [...] Aware of this general impression, he claimed that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> your attention", the misanthrope's song from Princess Ida, was a satiric self-reference, saying: [...] "I thought it my duty {{to live up to}} my reputation." [...] However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. [...] Actress May Fortescue recalled, [...] "His kindness was extraordinary. [...] On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether they were pretty or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful. [...] For money as money he cared less than nothing. [...] Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend."

500|$|On December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a {{personal}} friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: [...] "I think {{the state of our}} coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. [...] Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens to give us a coinage which would have some beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will I assure <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E
500|$|The track {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Ken Barnes of USA Today described the song {{as being a}} [...] "hopelessly sappy ballad oozing with fuzzy sentiments. I'd say it's more like caterpillars." [...] Frank Kogan of The Village Voice, citing the lyrics, [...] "I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true/Oh baby <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> butterflies" [...] wrote [...] "so, would he give her, like, caterpillars in exchange? birds?" [...] and added that what grabs his attention about a song like [...] "Butterflies" [...] is not the [...] "melody but the weirdly ringing wrench-against-faucet clang on the backbeat." [...] Christie Leo of the New Straits Times gave the track a more positive review, calling the song a [...] "luxuriant" [...] ballad. Pop music critic Robert Hilburn, writing for the Los Angeles Times, described [...] "Butterflies", and another song from Invincible ("Speechless"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". A journalist of the same publication felt that track was about romantic [...] "jitters".|$|E

500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
500|$|The Alden Tavern is {{well known}} for being the site of the horsewhipping of a captive General Richard Prescott, {{commander}} of the British troops of Rhode Island, by the tavern's owner Captain Alden. Several days after Prescott's capture, he was escorted to General George Washington's headquarters, but on the trip came to dine at Alden's tavern. Several books detail different accounts and portrayals of the exchanges which led to Prescott's whipping, all involving the Prescott being served [...] "the common dish of corn and beans" [...] and throwing the food on the floor. Three of Benson Lossing's books recount this tale, in The Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution Volume 1 (1852), Our Countrymen (1855) and Lives of Celebrated Americans: Comprising Biographies of Three Hundred and Forty Eminent Persons (1869). It also appears in similar wording in The Boys of '76: A History of the Battles of the Revolution by Charles Coffin in 1876, with Prescott's line being: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the pigs' feed". The story has persisted and a fictional account was referenced in 2010 in Martha Finley's Elsie Yachting with the Raymonds.|$|E

Do you love me?" [...] She affirms, and {{he asks for}} another chance. The video {{transitions}} to Swift sitting {{on the living room}} floor, next to a fireplace. She performs as she flashbacks to memories with Colletti. The two frolic on a brown couch and play with a deck of cards. The video then transitions to Swift and her friend having lunch at a restaurant, where Swift's friend informs her of Colletti's betrayal. The two converse and, then, Swift is seen walking on the streets during nighttime. She sees Colletti arriving at a house with groceries and, after staring at each other, a redheaded woman walks out of the house. In a panic, Swift runs away and the video transcends to the phone call, which commenced {{in the beginning of the}} video, with Colletti repeating, [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> another chance?" [...] A rapid flashback of cut-scenes is played and, after its conclusion, Swift denies his request, hangs up, and cries. Cut-scenes feature Swift and Colletti frolicking, Swift walking in the streets, and her sitting beside the fireplace. To date, the video has over 124 million views on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|According to Lewis, {{the song}} was conceptualised when the singer was {{experiencing}} a stressful time in her personal life when she visited her friend and co-writer of the song, Ryan Tedder in Denver, Colorado. The aim of the trip was to visit Tedder and his family, as well as conceive ideas and themes for material to be included on Glassheart. Lewis stated {{that she did not}} want to sing a ballad which would make her [...] "more sad", therefore they decided to work on an upbeat dance song instead. She asked Tedder: [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a song where I can just dance and jump around?", to which he replied [...] "What about this?" [...] as he played a beat which Lewis found [...] "hypnotic". Despite being in a raw form, Lewis was impressed with the song's beat, and said [...] "Yes! We have to do this." [...] The collaboration with Tedder marks the third album of Lewis' on which the pair have worked together. They first collaborated on Lewis' debut studio album, Spirit (2007), on the songs [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow". Tedder also co-wrote songs on Lewis' second studio album, Echo (2009), [...] "Happy", [...] "You Don't Care" [...] and [...] "Lost then Found", a collaboration with the group Tedder is a member of, OneRepublic. In addition to the title track on Glassheart, Lewis and Tedder collaborated on the song [...] "Favourite Scar".|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence and Mars {{came from}} musical families. Lawrence grew up {{listening}} to [...] "everything" [...] while Mars was exposed to a diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop and R. Their interest in music started in a very young age; Lawrence started to perform when he was four years old, and Mars started to perform when he was three years old and performed on a more regular basis with his family band by the age of four. In an article by American Songwriter, Lawrence cites acts such as Billy Joel, Elton John and Seal as his biggest influences and inspirations. He was raised listening to acts as Isley Brothers, The Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Stevie Wonder and Billy Joel. Mars, at an early stage of his life, was influenced by R artists such as Keith Sweat, Jodeci and R. Kelly, as well as 1950s rock 'n' roll and Motown. Later, in high school, he began listening to classic rock groups such as The Police, Led Zeppelin and the Beatles. His influences include Billy Joel, Elton John, Prince, The Police, Michael Jackson, Little Richard, and Bob Marley. Mars has stated [...] "Ari {{turned out to be the}} secret ingredient to what me and Phil were doing," [...] explaining, [...] "I'm used to live stuff. So <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a studio with a bunch of live instruments, I can do it. But radio's not playing that stuff."

The three admitted their musical influences also comes from The Beatles, Police, Motown, Earth Wind & Fire, Michael Jackson and Disco.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the book}} Heroism and Gender in War Films (2014), the lyrics of [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] "outline the perfect woman". The phrase [...] "Honor to us all" [...] is {{constantly}} reiterated throughout the song. Its [...] "witty" [...] lyrics are intended to be highly ironic, expressing that a daughter can only honor both herself and her family by marrying, {{as demonstrated by the}} phrase [...] "A girl can bring her family great honor in one way, by striking a good match". Beginning with the line [...] "This is what <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> to work with", the performers then offer an extensive list of examples and qualities required to create an ideal bride, providing both oral and visual examples {{of what it means to}} be a woman, including the lyrics [...] "Wait and see, when we're through, boys will gladly go to war for you" [...] and [...] "With good breeding and a tiny waist you'll bring honor to us all." [...] According to The Criterion: A Journal in English contributor Joshi Aditi, the song also expresses the [...] "inner desire of the male" [...] using the lyrics [...] "Men want girls with good taste, calm, obedient/Who work fast-paced", which is later confirmed in the all-male musical number [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For". The line [...] "scarier than the undertaker, we are meeting our Matchmaker" [...] appears towards the end of the song. Lyrically, [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] also makes heavy use of the literary device alliteration, as heard during its final verse [...] "Destiny, guard our girls/And our future as it fast unfurls/Please look kindly on these cultured pearls/Each a perfect porcelain doll". Thought Catalog contributor Chelsea Fagan felt that the song's lyrics make it appropriate for single women whose loved ones are constantly pressuring them to pursue romantic relationships despite the fact that they would much rather remain single: [...] "the kind of girl who doesn’t need to be put into a tight-waisted outfit to go find herself a husband and pop out a bunch of sword-wielding sons. You’ve got other plans".|$|E
