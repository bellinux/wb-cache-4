40|$|The year 1982 {{marked the}} twenty-fifth {{anniversary of the}} Treaty of Rome, {{creating}} the EEC, and the tenth anniversary <b>of</b> Canada <b>s</b> Third Option, which aimed in part at using the new Europe as a counterweight to American influence. This article attempts, first to set the last ten <b>year</b> <b>s</b> <b>of</b> Canada <b>s</b> European policy {{in the context of}} postwar economic and strategic relationships and, secondly, to evaluate the European aspect of the Third Option and its prospects for the 1980 s. Canada <b>s</b> image <b>of,</b> and policy towards, Western Europe, has always had two distinct elements — economic and strategic - whose interplay describes various phases of the relationship. Until about 1957, the two images were roughly congruent and Canada s economic and military policies mutually reinforcing. A multilateral Atlantic economic community was seen as the underpinning of collective defence. The next fifteen years or so saw the breakup of this patte m, with the emergence of the Community, continued British attempts to join from 1961 on, and the decline in Canadian support for NATO. The birth of the Third Option and the pursuit of the Framework Agreement with the Community saw the gradual revival of Canada's military relationship with Europe, this time in the service of economic diversification and growth. A variety of factors, however - global, European, North American and domestic Canadian - hampered the development of the new link with the Community. Many of these, especially the structural ones underlying the crisis of the world economy and the stagnation of European integration - are likely to persist through the 1980 s. For the next few <b>year</b> <b>s,</b> then, the European option will probably be (a) less communautaire, (b) a less important focus in trade policy relative to other areas, and (c) once more in the service of military and political ends...|$|R

Signatories to the Khartoum Declaration have made the move in an effort to reassure their industrial clients for whom the acacia tree sap is a vital ingredient in the manufacture of soft drinks and cosmetics, amongst other products. In the past two 2 years, world export prices for gum arabic have tripled due to the conflict in Darfur (see Spore 114) and the huge differences in production levels ranging from 100 to 1000 g per tree between regions.

Two models are employed that reflect EPA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> Superfund: a rational threats game-theoretic bargaining model and a discrete choice empirical model. The game theoretic hazardous waste bargaining model produces an elegant and simple decision rule. Using this decision rule, EPA compares the expected transaction costs incurred because of litigation against EPA 2 ̆ 7 s prospects for a court-ordered award. The agency enters into bargaining when the savings from avoiding litigation is equal to the court-ordered award. EPA and the coalition of responsible parties bargain about how to share site clean-up costs (mixed funding) and when successful, enter into a voluntary settlement. The discrete choice empirical analysis reveals that high transaction costs, lengthy delays in site clean-ups and limited enforcement/litigation characterize EPAs <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> CERCLA during the decade ending in 1990. Differences in how EPA implements this legislation across EPA Regions is explored. Compared to the other Eastern EPA Regions, EPA Region 4 is less likely to litigate and more likely to use Superfund monies to clean up hazardous waste sites. ...|$|R
