40|$|PhDIntravascular {{thrombotic}} diseases, arterial thromboembolic and/or venous thromboembolic {{diseases are}} present universally. There is no racial group, population, geographic area, nor age category that is recognized to be exempted from vascular thromboembolic diseases. There is no sex predilection in {{the pathogenesis of}} this disease process in humans. This disease accounts for {{a significant number of}} fatalities annually. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has a reported annual incidence of approximately 1. 6 per 1000 in urban populations. It has been reported that in the society of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the coronary heart diseases risk factors are becoming prevalent. The aim of the present study is to design and synthesize a series of newly modified carbamoylpiperidines as antiplatelet agents. In order to obtain the target compounds many pathways were tried, however, the following routes were found successful and well controlled: 1. The reaction of ethyl nipecotate with benzyl or substituted benzyl halides in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate in absolute ethanol yielded the corresponding ethyl 1 -aralkylnipecotates 35 - 40 (Scheme 2). 2. Hydrolysis of ethyl 1 -aralkylnipecotates using 1 N hydrochloric acid afforded the corresponding 1 -aralkyl nipecotic <b>acid</b> <b>hydrochlorides</b> 41 - 46 (Scheme 2). 3. Reacting 1 -aralkyl nipecotic <b>acid</b> <b>hydrochlorides</b> 41 - 46 with excess thionyl chloride followed by condensation of the obtained acid chlorides with different mono-substituted piperazines in dichloromethane as a solvent yielded N-(1 -aralkyl- 3 -piperidinocarbamoyl) -N'-aralkylpiperazines 47 - 48 (Scheme 2). 4. Treatment of two mole equivalents of ethyl nipecotate with one mole equivalent of α,α'-dibromo-p-xylene in presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate absolute ethanol afforded α,α'-bis-{ 3 -[N'-(aralkyl) -N-piperazinoyl]- 1 - piperidinyl}-p-xylenes 61 - 63 (Scheme 3). Attempts to prepare the target carbamoylpiperidines using nicotinic or nipecotic acid as the starting material were unsuccessful. In the present work, the following new target compounds were prepared and characterized: 1. N-[1 -(3 -(Nitrobenzyl) - 3 -piperidinocarbonyl]-N'-benzylpiperazine (47). 2. N-[1 -(4 -Nitrobenzyl) - 3 -piperidinocarbonyl]-N'-benzylpiperazine (48). 3. N-[1 -(2 -Chlorobenzyl) - 3 -piperidinocarbonyl]-N'-benzylpiperazine (49). 4.

N-[1 -(2 -Chlorobenzyl) - 3 -piperidinocarbonyl]-N'-(4 -fluorophenyl) piperazine (58). The synthesis of these compounds necessitated the preparation of the following starting and intermediate compounds: 1. Ethyl 1 -benzylnipecotate (35). 2.

The analysis of chlorine- 35 / 37 NMR spectra of solid L-tryptophan hydrochloride obtained at two magnetic field strengths yields {{the chlorine}} electric field gradient (EFG) and CS tensors, and their relative orientations. The chlorine CS tensor is also determined for the first time for DL-arginine hydrochloride monohydrate. The drastic influence of 1 H decoupling at 21. 1 T on the spectral features of salts with particularly small 35 Cl quadrupolar coupling constants (CQ) is demonstrated. The chlorine CS tensor spans (¿) of hydrochloride salts of hydrophobic amino acids are found to be larger than those for salts of hydrophilic amino acids. A new combined experimental-theoretical procedure is described in which quantum chemical geometry optimizations of hydrogen-bonded proton positions around the chloride ions in a series of amino <b>acid</b> <b>hydrochlorides</b> are cross-validated against the experimental chlorine EFG and CS tensor data. The conclusion is reached that the relatively computationally inexpensive B 3 LYP/ 3 - 21 G * method provides proton positions which are suitable for subsequent higher-level calculations of the chlorine EFG tensors. The computed value of ¿ is less sensitive to the proton positions. Following this cross-validation procedure, jCQ(35 Cl) j is generally predicted within 15 % of the experimental value for a range of HCl salts.

40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of dipyridamole, {{a poorly}} soluble weak base, was evaluated in 11 healthy, older subjects (≥ 65 years), 6 {{with a low}} fasting gastric pH (control) and 5 with a fasting gastric pH > 5 (achlorhydric), in a randomized, crossover design. Subjects received 50 mg dipyridamole as a single oral dose both with and without pretreatment with 40 mg famotidine (control subjects) or 1360 mg glutamic acid HC 1 (achlorhydric subjects). Gastric pH was monitored by Heidelberg radiotelemetric capsule. Gastric emptying of 99 m Tc-radiolabeled orange juice was measured. Gastric pH {{appeared to be a}} primary determinant in dipyridamole absorption in the elderly. Elevated gastric pH resulted in compromised dipyridamole absorption compared to low-gastric pH conditions in all cases. The administration of glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> to achlorhydric subjects prior to the dose of dipyridamole corrected for the decreased C max and AUC(0 – 36) exhibited in achlorhydric subjects without pretreatment. T max and k a were slower in achlorhydrics, although pretreatment with glutamic acid HC 1 tended to normalize these parameters. Based on these results, it would be beneficial for achlorhydrics to take glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> prior to taking dipyridamole and other medications which need a low gastric pH for complete absorption. The administration of 40 mg famotidine was successful in elevating the gastric pH to > 5 in all subjects and maintained it at > 5 for at least 3 hr in all subjects tested. The lack of differences in C max and AUC(0 – 36) with significant differences in T max and k a indicated that control subjects after treatment with famotidine may serve as an adequate model for achlorhydrics with respect to the extent of absorption, but not with respect to the rate of absorption. Gastric emptying of a nutrient liquid was significantly slower in achlorhydric subjects than in control subjects. Finally, fasting serum gastrin appeared to be a relatively reliable and easy method for screening for achlorhydria in the elderly...|$|R
