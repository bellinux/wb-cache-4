500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping out of the senate race: [...] "This is not the right time for me to run for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being {{able to take care of}} your health." [...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, [...] " [...] {{level of security}} and secrecy that we have all been forced to adopt. I mean, it's really kind of paranoid crazy, but sort of justified. We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes {{and we have to}} be herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas. The security of it is immense. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> freedom is a big challenge." [...] Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes. The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast. Simon Pegg said, [...] "I read [...] with a security guard near me – it's that secretive." [...] The film used the fake working title of Corporate Headquarters. Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit).|$|E
500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{reviews from}} the North American {{leg of the}} tour {{included}} Melissa Ruggierie writing for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution online blog. Ruggierie praised Beyoncé's performance, particularly the strong vocals demonstrated in [...] "1+1" [...] and concluded [...] "watching her command a stadium stage for two hours was another reminder of her limitless ambition". However, {{it was noted that}} Beyoncé did not speak to the crowd very often. After Beyoncé's hometown performance in Houston, Brandon Caldwell of the Houston Press introduced his article stating [...] "Hours after the slaying, the wig snatching, the fitted snatching, the life getting, the boy byes and various curses of shock, amazement and confusion, I stood with a perplexed look on my face. How? How does Beyoncé do this? On this level? With this magnitude?". Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times concluded her positive review of the Pasadena stop of the tour with [...] "Soaking wet and sitting onstage alone, she left the audience with the closing number, [...] "Halo". She'd been baptized and reborn into a less-perfect version of Queen Bey, allowing a more powerful Beyoncé to arise from that imperfection". Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News began his article stating [...] "there were so many moving parts – a tremendous swirl of sharply choreographed dance routines, cool special effects, brilliant fireworks and other tactics for delighting tens of thousands", Harrington noted however that too many snippets of songs rather than their full versions were performed, feeling quality over quantity was missed. The first Canadian show of the tour in Edmonton was performed in cold and rainy conditions, with Beyoncé stating [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> fingers? I can't feel mine" [...] and [...] "I have to say this is the coldest show I've ever done". Despite this, Sandra Sperounes of the Edmonton Journal commented [...] "not even rain or bitter wind could stop our Ms. Flawless, our Survivor, our Queen Bey from dazzling an estimated 40,000 fans at Commonwealth Stadium on a stormy Friday night." [...] Sperounes concluded [...] "the sun was nowhere to be found, but thanks to Bey's brilliant set, the crowd left beaming with giddiness, girl power and generosity".|$|E

[...] as [...] "snippy condescension familiar to anyone experienced in the bickering arts". However, he also said Bland was unnecessarily argumentative. [...] "...ou must always defer meekly to the police. Even when they're acting like bullies, goading you or issuing you preposterous orders like to put out your cigarette as you sit in your own car, don't challenge their authority....Comply. And if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> rights are being violated, take it up later with a judge," [...] Zorn wrote.|$|E
