500|$|It was {{not until}} Wenger's arrival in October 1996 that Arsenal reemerged as a serious league competitor. By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Manchester United amassed their fourth title in five seasons, whereas Arsenal {{finished}} the campaign in third – their highest position since the formation of the Premier League in 1992. During the season, Wenger commented on rule changes which permitted an extension to the league calendar: [...] "It's wrong the programme is extended so Manchester United can rest and win everything." [...] His observation irked Ferguson, who replied: [...] "He has no experience of English football. He has come here from Japan, and now he is telling everyone how to organise our football. Unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the situation and had the experience then he should keep his mouth shut, firmly shut." ...|$|E

Because of the chief's support of the Jacobite rebellion they lost Strathardle in 1765, and have since been held landless in their ancient clan lands.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this ‘researching the researchers’ project were to examine the range of ways that RMIT researchers saw their research activities and to feed the results back into training activities for researchers and research supervisors. The particular aspect of the project reported here is the analysis of what the recipients saw as success in research. What constituted a successful research project? (In each interview the question was framed as follows: ‘Firstly, I would ask {{you to tell me}} about some research that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> engaged <b>in</b> that <b>you</b> view as being successful in some way’. Interviewees were also asked by the interviewer ‘to tell me about some research that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> engaged <b>in</b> that <b>you</b> view as being unsuccessful in some way’.) In earlier chapters, the personal stories of members of the research team described various aspects of the research process. The chapter on phenomenographic research methodology by Gerlese Åkerlind has provided a critical and comprehensive analysis of the method used in this study. In this chapter we will provide a brief summary of the research processes and then {{a detailed description of the}} research outcomes...|$|R
