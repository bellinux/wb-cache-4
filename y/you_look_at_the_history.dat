50|$|According to Kim Taejung {{democracy}} {{is essential to}} the people of South Korea because it gives the people some sense of ownership over their nation. It gives them freedom and motivates them to defend it. Kim Taejung admits that because of Korean's history and culture which was heavily influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, it is difficult for South Korea to adapt to Democracy. Democracy is an idea that was invented by the Western civilization. However, this instrument can be used in South Korea if the people of South Korea want to serve under the principles of democracy which is freedom, justice, and human dignity. Kim Taejung argues that South Korea does yearn for democracy. Even when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the Tonghak Rebellion, this resistance occurred because the peasants wanted equality and less corruption. Even before South Korea became a democratic nation, the people wanted this political government.|$|E
50|$|From {{the early}} 1990s, monetarism and social {{conservatism}} has characterised the Liberal Party's actions in Government and policy development. Former Prime Minister John Howard in a 2005 speech described the modern position:The Liberal Party {{is a broad}} church. You sometimes {{have to get the}} builders in to put in the extra pew {{on both sides of the}} aisle to make sure that everybody is accommodated. But it is a broad church and we should never as members of the Liberal Party of Australia lose sight of the fact that we are the trustees of two great political traditions. We are, of course, the custodian of the classical liberal tradition within our society, Australian Liberals should revere the contribution of John Stuart Mill to political thought. We are also the custodians of the conservative tradition in our community. And if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the Liberal Party it is at its best when it balances and blends those two traditions. Mill and Burke are interwoven into the history and the practice and the experience of our political party.|$|E

That's basically what happened."McGhee wanted to get them in front of as many people as possible, and the strategy worked. [...] "It was pretty simple. The concept was to get all the Troublemakers together, and those people spread the word. We got Brian May to give us some dates, and also some stadium shows with Bon Jovi.

By the mid-nineteenth century, Woonsocket and the Blackstone Valley had grown {{to become one of the}} countrys great textile {{manufacturing}} centers. As the textile industry grew, so did industries related to manufacturing. It is interesting to look at some of these related industries. In transportation, for instance, one of the countrys earliest canals- the Blackstone Canal- was completed in the Blackstone Valley in 1828. As steam power replaced other power sources in the mid-nineteenth century, the Providence & Worcester Railroad replaced the canal in 1846 foreshadowing a trend that would be repeated throughout the country. In public utilities, Woonsocket had one of the countrys earliest high-pressure water systems, gas distribution systems, and electric generation and distribution systems. In many areas, the development of the textile industry also led to the development of other industries in which Woonsocket and the Blackstone Valley became leaders. Today we will talk about one of those industries banking. As Woonsocket grew in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, so did the need for banks to meet the needs of its citizen and industry...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Th. M. (Ethics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. This study {{begins with}} the question: "Is there a place for a Christian ethical code of conduct in the diverse and complex {{business}} world of today?" In chapter 2 I explain the context wherein one should understand this question. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of South Africa {{you will see that}} there was discrimination that took place {{over a long period of}} time on the basis of race, religion and gender and that makes this issue a very sensitive one. The reason why it is so sensitive is if there were to be a Christian ethical code of conduct in the workplace could it lead to discrimination again? That is not allowed to happen under the current Constitution of South Africa. But the other side is also true, if you don?t have a Christian ethical code won?t you loose the beautiful things Scripture gives us on how to treat all people equally and fairly within the workplace? This study will show that according to the Constitution of South Africa it is possible to have a Christian ethical code of conduct as long it does not exclude any employee. In chapter 3 we have a look at Scripture that gives us guidelines on how to treat all people and also people in the workplace. Here are some examples: * the way employees should be handled; * the number of working hours the employees should be working; * the remuneration of the employees – is it fair; * how the Shareholders? / Stakeholders? interests are looked after; * the manner in which the business is being managed; * the Constitutional business environment; * the international law that transcends borders where macrobusinesses do business. In chapter 4 we look at the Christian ethical perspective in the business. We look at the role of the economy and the core values to manage a business. In chapter 5 we end with an example of a workable Christian ethical code of conduct and we compare two large business codes of conduct. Master...|$|E
