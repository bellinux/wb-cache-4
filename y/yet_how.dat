John Keats's 1819 poem Ode to Autumn includes the lines [...] "Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft / The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft".

Alexander Gambotto-Burke of Eurogamer commented that she has a [...] "genuine, albeit twisted maternal" [...] love for the player, her student. In contrast to Darth Malak, the clear villain of the first game, Avellone called Kreia neither [...] "necessarily good or evil"; instead, she merely wants the Exile to grow as a person. Kreia is deliberately complicated in her goals and motivations, giving the character a feel of mystery. IGN's Hilary Goldstein noted this mystery, commenting both on her seemingly dark motives and <b>yet</b> <b>how</b> she appears as the player's [...] "staunchest defender and a true protector".|$|E
500|$|According {{to review}} {{aggregator}} Metacritic, the game received an average review score of 96/100 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, and 94/100 for PlayStation 3. , {{it is one}} of the highest-rated games on Metacritic, tied with a number of other games for the third-highest aggregate score. GameSpy praised BioShock [...] "inescapable atmosphere", and Official Xbox Magazine lauded its [...] "inconceivably great plot" [...] and [...] "stunning soundtrack and audio effects." [...] The gameplay and combat system have been praised for being smooth and open-ended, and elements of the graphics, such as the water, were praised for their quality. It has been noted that the combination of the game's elements [...] "straddles so many entertainment art forms so expertly that it's the best demonstration <b>yet</b> <b>how</b> flexible this medium can be. It's no longer just another shooter wrapped up in a pretty game engine, but a story that exists and unfolds inside the most convincing and elaborate and artistic game world ever conceived." ...|$|E

500|$|The state officially {{labeled the}} All-China Women's Federation an NGO in 1995. <b>Yet</b> <b>how</b> {{applicable}} the term NGO {{is to the}} ACWF has been contested, given the ACWF’s long and continuing relationship with the CPC. Some leaders in the women’s movement opposed the ACWF attending an NGO forum in Manila in 1993 {{because they did not}} believe that it met the criteria of an NGO. Even the ACWF hesitates using the term NGO within China because it has been linked to anti-government groups, although it has embraced the title internationally. International donor agencies generally are more likely to work with NGO's, so the classification of an NGO has helped the ACWF obtain financing from international organizations. [...] Others believe that the ACWF classifies as an NGO because it has separated itself from the government in recent years, and still others believes that ACWF could be classified as a NGO if the definition was broadened. [...] Those is support of this modified stance believe that complete separation from the government would be impossible and harmful to the ACWF. The ACWF continues to have internal and external debates about the NGO title.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the truth}} of the {{accounts}} has been disputed by some historians; in 1984, Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton concluded that there were probably attempts to play organised matches which failed due to the state of the ground, but that the contemporary reports were either hearsay or refer to [...] "kick-about" [...] matches with [...] "made-up footballs" [...] such as a bully-beef tin. Chris Baker, former chairman of The Western Front Association and author of The Truce: The Day the War Stopped is also sceptical, but says that although there is little hard evidence, the most likely place that an organised match could have taken place was near the village of Messines: [...] "There are two references to a game being played on the British side, but nothing from the Germans. If somebody one day found a letter from a German soldier who was in that area, then we would have something credible." [...] In fact, there is a German reference. Leutnant Kurt Zehmisch of Germany's 134th Saxons Infantry Regiment said that the English [...] "brought a soccer ball from their trenches, and pretty soon a lively game ensued. How marvelously wonderful, <b>yet</b> <b>how</b> strange it was". In 2011, Mike Dash concluded that [...] "there is plenty of evidence that football was played that Christmas Day—mostly by men of the same nationality, but in at least three or four places between troops from the opposing armies".|$|E

Peña Nieto denies that he will negotiate with the cartels.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an early}} {{precursor}} {{of his work}} on The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, Darwin turned round the theological idea of Charles Bell that humans were designed to expose their canine teeth when grinning, and explained the expression by shared descent: [...] "no doubt a habit gained by formerly being a baboon with great canine teeth. – Blend this argument with his having canine teeth at all. – This way of viewing the subject important. Laughing modified barking, smiling modified laughing. Barking to tell other animals in associated kinds of good news, discovery of prey, arising no doubt from want of assistance. – crying is a puzzler. – Under {{this point of view}} expression of all animals becomes very curious – a dog snarling in play." [...] Darwin had privately talked with his cousin [...] "Hensleigh Wedgwood about the relationship of humans to animals; [...] "Hensleigh says the love of the deity & thought of him or eternity only difference between the mind of man & animals. – <b>yet</b> <b>how</b> faint in a Fuegian or Australian!"

2500|$|Through their {{interactions}} and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their own faults {{and work to}} correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36: [...] "How despicably have I acted!" [...] she cried; [...] "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! <b>yet,</b> <b>how</b> just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I {{could not have been}} more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of self-reflection—or, at least, are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development. Tanner notes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, [...] "has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects." [...] Mrs. Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don't get married: [...] "The business of her life was to get her daughters married: it's solace was visiting and news." [...] This proves that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of [...] "material objects" [...] and not of her own feelings and emotions.|$|E
2500|$|American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo {{was also}} {{involved}} in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, [...] "Ne-Yo asked me what I wanted to talk about, and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'." [...] The first of these records, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off", was originally {{intended to be a}} single in the US. It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like a job I that I never get a break from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come <b>yet</b> <b>how</b> 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
2500|$|John's [...] "joy {{became more}} {{for him the}} more he was diminished. … This was John, {{and this is how}} the single {{individual}} is to fulfill something similar in lesser situations. If he has first of all learned to deny himself humbly and to master his mind, then joy will also be victorious. But the first must be learned first-later, that which is greater; one is first initiated into the lesser mystery, later into the mystery." [...] Kiedrkegaard says, what about the single individual who wants to be like John? Do we all know how to deny ourseves with humility? He says, Who does not know that things like these have happened and do happen in the world-that someone who once ruled over countries and kingdoms has ceased to rule and is obliged to see a more powerful ruler take his place; that someone who once was hailed with jubilation soon, yes, so soon that the whole things {{seems to have been a}} dream, hears the same jubilation shouting another name, that someone whose commanding figure was familiar to everyone regards himself in the next moment with the anxiety of uncertainty about whether he has lost his mind or the world its memory so that it confused with him someone else; that the master whole pupil only yesterday sat at his feet must bow his shoulders today under the other's advancement; that the businessman who was kind enough to set his servant on his path now sees that his path means the benefactor's downfall; that the girl who once filled her beloved's thoughts now sits and sees his bold ambition pursuing a higher goal; that the singer whose words were on everyone's lips is forgotten today and his songs have been more than replaced; that the orator whose words echoed everywhere must now seek the solitude of the desert if he wants echo; that the friend from youth who was on an equal basis with his fellows now with amazement perceives the distance; that the lowly cottage where the parents lived, where the humble cradle stood, is now collapsing like a recollection that cannot catch up with the mighty. And <b>yet,</b> <b>how</b> strange-if you let your thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you still seem to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.
