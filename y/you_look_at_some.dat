60|$|Crossed {{the fields}} near Brookhouse's villa, and {{came upon a}} long beach,-- at least a mile long, I should think,--terminated by craggy rocks at either end, and backed by a high broken bank, the grassy summit of which, year by year, is {{continually}} breaking away, and precipitated to the bottom. At {{the foot of the}} bank, in some parts, is a vast number of pebbles and paving-stones, rolled up thither by the sea long ago. The beach is of a brown sand, with hardly any pebbles intermixed upon it. When the tide is part way down, there is a margin of several yards from the water's edge, along the whole mile length of the beach, which glistens like a mirror, and reflects objects, and shines bright in the sunshine, the sand being wet to that distance from the water. Above this margin the sand is not wet, and grows less and less damp the farther towards the bank you keep. In some places your footstep is perfectly implanted, showing the whole shape, and the square toe, and every nail in the heel of your boot. Elsewhere, the impression is imperfect, and even when you stamp, you cannot imprint the whole. As you tread, a dry spot flashes around your step, and grows moist as you lift your foot again. Pleasant to pass along this extensive walk, watching the surf-wave;--how sometimes it seems to make a feint of breaking, but dies away ineffectually, merely kissing the strand; then, after many such abortive efforts, it gathers itself, and forms a high wall, and rolls onward, heightening and heightening without foam at the summit of the green line, and at last throws itself fiercely on the beach, with a loud roar, the spray flying above. As you walk along, you are preceded by a flock of twenty or thirty beach birds, which are seeking, I suppose, for food on the margin of the surf, yet seem to be merely sporting, chasing the sea as it retires, and running up before the impending wave. Sometimes they let it bear them off their feet, and float lightly on its breaking summit; sometimes they flutter and seem to rest on the feathery spray. They are little birds with gray backs and snow-white breasts; their images may be seen in the wet sand almost or quite as distinctly as the reality. Their legs are long. As you draw near, they take a flight of a score of yards or more, and then recommence their dalliance with the surf-wave. You may behold their multitudinous little tracks all along your way. Before you reach the end of the beach, you become quite attached to these little sea-birds, and take much interest in their occupations. After passing in one direction, it is pleasant then to retrace your footsteps. Your tracks being all traceable, you may recall the whole mood and occupation of your mind during your first passage. Here you turned somewhat aside to pick up a shell that you saw nearer the water's edge. Here you examined a long sea-weed, and trailed its length after you for a considerable distance. Here the effect of the wide sea struck you suddenly. Here you fronted the ocean, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a sail, distant in the sunny blue. Here <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> plant on the bank. Here some vagary of mind seems to have bewildered you; for your tracks go round and round, and interchange each other without visible reason. Here you picked up pebbles and skipped them upon the water. Here you wrote names and drew faces with a razor sea-shell in the sand.|$|R

40|$|Supporting {{domestic}} producers Cue: In {{many parts of}} Africa, local poultry producers have been swamped by floods of cheap chicken coming in from Europe. In the case of The Gambia, in West Africa, the domestic market has been devastated by meat from Belgium and Holland, which is so cheap that many carcasses are simply dumped unsold. In a liberalised trade environment, {{it may be difficult}} for national governments to protect {{domestic producers}}. However, creating a supportive structure for local industry can at least give it a chance of competing with the European rivals. Mamadi Ceesay is the Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Gambian Department of State for Agriculture, and the author of a recent report on the impact of liberalisation on the poultry industry. He spoke to Ismaila Senghore about how local farmers have been affected by the open market, and how he feels they could be increasing their competitiveness. IN:		?Most of the people who ? OUT:		?Thank you very much, Ismaila. ? DUR?N	 5 ? 07 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That report came from Ismaila Senghore in The Gambia. Transcript Ceesay	Most {{of the people who were}} in the industry by 1996 were out by 2000. Only a few managed to stay. And this was because the market was in glut, because they could afford to bring in products at cheaper price, even though this will take six weeks to reach the Gambia, and this has an effect on the quality. If you have to bring in products for six weeks, the quality is less than if you have it produced in the Gambia. So in terms of those Gambian companies, they are disfavoured, and therefore had it very tough to compete. Senghore	Well Mamadi, I?m a Gambian myself, and I have been into the streets and in the markets, and it appears that in every corner, sometimes we find chicken legs, whole chickens, on sale at very cheap prices. This means definitely, local farmers cannot sell their poultry products. So how far do you think subsidisation of industrialised countries in their agriculture has impacted local farmers? Ceesay	They can afford to bring in products that are even lower than the cost of production here. And because of that, a lot of people in the industry had to go out of business because they had to compete with these people in the same market, and their products are readily available, and they are at a cheaper price. I think the only other option is that people who go for quality go for what is produced locally here, because it is more tasty, and less of the health risk. But these are the problems, because if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the people of low income, they will readily go for a product which is of a lower price and which is readily available in the market. What this does is that the local poultry industry can never flourish, and therefore we have to depend on imports. So we find ourselves in a vicious circle and it is very difficult to escape from it, and therefore the food insecurity situation continues. Senghore	Have <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the basic problems that farmers need to be able to compete with these imports? Ceesay	I think it is to support, particularly the small-scale farmers, through the rehabilitation of the hatcheries, but also through the rehabilitation of the feed industry that we have, in terms of producing local feeds to make sure that is available to farmers. But the other thing one needs to do is step up the surveillance that we have, to make sure that the product that we have are of quality, to ensure that the laboratories that are around have the necessary agents and the equipment so that the population at large is protected. I think that if we provide all this, it will go a long way to providing the environment for the local industry. Because in the state of the liberalised environment, one cannot talk about protection, but one can support the industry and enable it to grow. Senghore	What kind of advice do you think our local farmers can follow, in order to improve the situation? Ceesay	I think the key advice is cost effectiveness. We have to go for products that are locally available: use locally available feed because we have the maize; all we have to do is bring in a few vitamins and other nutrients, and supplement this. We also have to develop the local hatcheries that are available so that we don?t have to import day-old chicks from Europe. And we also have a very good climate, where we can have simple, low-cost housing in which the poultry can be reared. I think using these mechanisms, we can operate and provide enough poultry products for the urban areas and for the families of rural Gambians. Senghore	Mamadi, I do believe you enjoy chicken? Ceesay	Very much thank you. Senghore	Do you foresee us enjoying chicken in the near future as much as we used to do? Ceesay	I think, first we are in a global environment, so we will have just to continue importing chicken. I think this can be complemented by the local industry in providing locally produced chicken, which are more delicious, of course, than the imported one, and I think more and more people are in for quality food. And in the search for quality food, I think people will go in for the local products, at the expense of course, of the imported chicken. Senghore	Well I always go for the local produce, seeing as it is more delicious. Thank you very much Mamadi, it has been a pleasure talking to you, and thank you for the time. Ceesay	Thank you very much, Ismaila. End of track. The Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Gambian Department of State for Agriculture, explains how imported chicken from Europe has affected local poultry production in The Gambia, and how both government supports and changing management by farmers could restore local competitiveness...|$|R
5000|$|When we {{were putting}} it {{together}} {{and trying to figure}} out who Flynn Rider was in this movie, we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> a bunch of different sources ... When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> back <b>at</b> <b>some</b> of the past Disney princes or something, a lot of them are kind of soft and they're not like people we think are that cool, I guess. They're good guys, so I guess we sort of took that to the other extreme. We like cocky, arrogant sort of characters, and I think there were people in our building that were a little worried because we were up in the story room and they were hearing these rumours of, well, it's not a prince, it's a thief, and he's kind of a ladies' man and he's very arrogant ... But, I think the trick is when you're creating a character like that, if you have this cocky character, you have to hit him over the head with a frying pan a dozen times or something, and he needs to kind of pay for being that way. Those characters, if they're done right, can be so funny. On the flip side, if they're not done right, they can be really off putting. Director Nathan Greno on Flynn's conception and subsequent development. Originally, Flynn was conceived as a British farmer named Bastian until his voice actor was finally cast. The directors cited actors Errol Flynn and Gene Kelly, and Star Wars character Han Solo, among several individuals by whom Flynn was inspired. Greno explained that [...] "Having Flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin, especially in contrast to Rapunzel, who is a really smart girl but is just locked away in this tower. So she has a very limited world view and Flynn could complement that as this worldly guy." [...] The film's change in title from Rapunzel to the more gender-neutral Tangled is due in part to Flynn's role and involvement. First observing that the Disney tradition is [...] "to name the movie after the Princess", the directors had initially thought that the film [...] "would be structured like Cinderella where there's Cinderella and then a Prince that pops into the movie once in a while". This changed, however, as Flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character. Howard explained that [...] "When Nathan and I figured out that this film was really about two characters, Flynn and Rapunzel, we knew that changing the title would be a good idea." [...] Meanwhile, the title Tangled summarizes the relationship between protagonists Flynn and Rapunzel, and antagonist Mother Gothel. Additionally, Flynn also narrates the film, providing it with [...] "an ironic counterpoint", according to Children's Literature and Learner Empowerment: Children and Teenagers in English Language Education author Janice Bland. As [...] "an example of first-person voice-over narration", Flynn's narration [...] "compels the viewer to identify empathetically with" [...] Flynn and Rapunzel.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} cover the subject that I have been given, I decided to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> {{agricultural}} trends {{in the state of}} Arkansas and across the North Mississippi Delta. The number of farms has remained about constant across the state while the number of north delta farms has decreased about 15 % in the last five years. However, when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> farm size and irrigated farms, there is a 20 % increase in the North Delta. When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> irrigated acres across the state, there has been a 40 % increase, while the irrigated acres have increased 70 % in the North Delta region. Cotton acreage has done about the same with a 17 % increase in the north delta with little change recorded {{in the rest of the}} state. Also, when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> where the cotton acreage is located in Arkan-sas, one will see that approximately 60 % of the cotton is grown in only 6 counties in the northeast corner of the state (Fig. 1). As one <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the trends in agriculture, I think it is important for researchers to understand where the biggest changes are taking place and where a large percentage of the cotton is grown in the state. I don’t think anyone would argue that the cotton industry is struggling. The big questions are, “what are the problems and what can be done to correct them? ” Cer...|$|R
