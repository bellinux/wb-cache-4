5000|$|On May 21, 2012, the Buffalo Sabres re-signed Sulzer to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} extension worth $725,000. In explaining the extension to media gathered at First Niagara Center, GM Darcy Regier said, “(Sulzer) played very well with Christian (Ehrhoff). And I think the other thing <b>you</b> <b>really</b> notice <b>out</b> there is his composure; his ability to not only break up plays defensively, but to make plays offensively with the patience that he showed. We were pleasantly surprised with his play, and that moved us toward getting him signed.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Bako's 1995 {{performance}} {{earned him}} a promotion to the Southern League's Chattanooga Lookouts, the Reds AA-level affiliate, for 1996, where he was named a Southern League All-Star. He was second on the team in strikeouts (93) and fifth among regulars with a [...]294 batting average. He hit a career-high eight home runs during that season, adding 27 doubles and 48 RBIs in 360 at bats.

He had 78 hits in 321 at-bats. Bako's game management {{earned him a}} reputation, even in the minor leagues. Brett Tomko, who played with Bako in the minors in 1996 {{as a member of}} the Lookouts and in 1997 with Indianapolis, recalled one of their mound conversations:Bako: Are <b>you</b> <b>really</b> trying <b>out</b> here?Tomko: What do you mean?Bako: Because your stuff is horrible today and if you don't try a little harder, you're not going to make it out of this inning.|$|R

Claimed power increased from [...] to , but it was the improved torque that <b>really</b> marked <b>out</b> the <b>more</b> powerful engine, and which enabled the manufacturer, with the larger engined versions, to raise the second gear ratio and the final drive ratio, increasing the vehicle speed per 1,000 rpm from 23 km/h (14.3 mph) to 24.5 km/h (15.2 mph).

5000|$|The album {{received}} generally positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated: [...] "...the musical {{numbers are}} a little awkward, but Estep's words are vicious, cutting, smart, provocative and funny."

[...] Stereo Review wrote: [...] "Estep is <b>really</b> <b>more</b> <b>out</b> of the beatnik performance tradition, and so the music on No More Mister Nice Girl is essentially functional, a post-modern rock equivalent of bongo drums at a poetry reading." ...|$|R
6000|$|Roughly, very roughly, speaking, our destroyers enjoyed {{three phases}} of [...] "prompt decisive action"--the first, {{a period of}} {{daylight}} attacks (from 4 to 6 P.M.) {{such as the one}} I have just described, while the battle was young and the light fairly good on the afternoon of May 31; the second, towards dark, when the light had lessened and the enemy were more uneasy, and, I think, in more scattered formation; the third, when darkness had fallen, and the destroyers had been strung out astern with orders to help the enemy home, which they did all night as opportunity offered. One cannot say whether the day or the night work was the more desperate. From private advices, the young gentlemen concerned seem to have functioned with efficiency either way.

If I over-research then I don’t just have all the facts I need, I have a lot more - and that means I can really choose what I want to include.

5000|$|Singer Pete Murray {{has claimed}} that the album in general is about the [...] "Lo-Pro experience" [...] {{over the last seven}} years since their first album. [...] "Blame Me" [...] and [...] "Early Morning Anger" [...] are both about the {{emotions}} the band felt after being dropped by Geffen Records. Murray said of the songs [...] "When we were on Geffen (where) we had this ‘all star team,' we had all these people working for us. The minute we lost our deal with Geffen, thing changed- my Blackberry used to vibrate non-stop. It was constantly ringing or e-mails were coming in. The minute we were dropped, it went completely dead. I turned off the thing a couple of weeks later. The business is just brutal. When you're hot and there's money around, everybody is right there for you. And, then when things go a little south, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> figure <b>out</b> who your friends are and who your friends are not". [...] The song [...] "Texas" [...] is [...] "sort of a fantasy about revenge...ultimately, it's about picking up and starting over and not necessarily feeling that you have to give anybody a reason. Just basically hitting the ‘reset button,'". [...] "Wasting Away" [...] was about Murray's philosophical thoughts over [...] "wrestling with how much you're sacrificing for a dream or a pursuit in life. Is it worth it in the end...". [...] "All I Have" [...] was inspired about a news story regarding soldiers saying goodbye to their families in order to go off to war in Iraq, and how he felt when he received an email from a friend who was about to do the same".|$|R
5000|$|I {{had this}} idea about making edits {{where all of}} the songs would clock in under 5 minutes each. My {{absolute}} first idea {{was to make a}} radio edit version of the album, where every song would simply be cut at precisely 3:50 or something, except for the track America, in which we instead would add like 10 minutes of commercials after the [...] "We'll be back after this short break!" [...] phrase. But once I was sitting down with the tracks it became sort of a challenge. Some of the songs I prefer in the original version, but some (like Idiocracy and Mrs Modern Mother Mary for instance) <b>really</b> turned <b>out</b> <b>more</b> like I initially intended them to be, and I prefer them. Also, I could use my original idea for an intro to the album - it was scrapped for the official release since I felt it gave away the TPE1 link way too soon. The Slipsync track uses recurring themes, a trademark POS conceptual instrumental passage, and was originally thought as a Japanese bonus track, but then it felt more right on this edited album version, called SCARSICKER.|$|R
