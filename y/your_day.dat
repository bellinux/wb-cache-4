It's nice to have her back—yes, not every J-Lo song was a hit, but we all danced to 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight' back in the day. 'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as [...] "a Tricky and The-Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break. [...] Truth be told, it's not a J.Lo classic to rival 'Play' or 'Love Don't Cost a Thing', and it's about as original as starting <b>your</b> <b>day</b> {{with a bowl of}} Kellogg's Cornflakes, but it does burrow into your brain after a few spins." ...|$|E

It had been many, many years since I had written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared {{the heck out of}} me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment.

2500|$|On {{moving to}} the United States, Hinn {{traveled}} to Orlando, Florida, where he founded the Orlando Christian Center in 1983. Eventually, he began claiming that God was using him as a conduit for healings, and began holding healing services in his church. These new [...] "Miracle Crusades" [...] were soon held at large stadiums and auditoriums across the United States and the world, the first nationally televised service being held in Flint, Michigan, in 1989. During the early 1990s, he launched a new daily talk show called This Is <b>Your</b> <b>Day,</b> which to this day airs clips of supposed miracles from Hinn's Miracle Crusades. The program premiered on the Trinity Broadcasting Network of Paul Crouch, who {{would become one of}} Hinn's most outspoken defenders and allies. Hinn's ministry began to rapidly grow from there, winning praise as well as criticism from fellow Christian leaders. In 1999, he stepped down as pastor of the Orlando Christian Center, moving his ministry's administrative headquarters to Grapevine, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, while hosting This Is <b>Your</b> <b>Day</b> from a television studio in Orange County, California, where he now lives with his family.

2500|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} in {{conducting}} the self-denial required in [...] and [...] one adds {{a little time}} from the surrounding ordinary weekdays to the holy day. [...] Rabbi Ishmael derived this rule from what had been taught in a Baraita: [...] One might read [...] "And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day," [...] literally to mean that one begins fasting the entire day on the ninth day of the month; [...] therefore says, [...] "in the evening." [...] One might read [...] "in the evening" [...] to mean [...] "after dark" [...] (which the Hebrew calendar would reckon {{as part of the}} tenth day); [...] therefore says, [...] "in the ninth day." [...] The Gemara thus concluded that one begins fasting while it is still day on the ninth day, adding some time from the profane day (the ninth) to the holy day (the tenth). [...] The Gemara read the words, [...] "from evening to evening," [...] in [...] to teach that one adds some time to Yom Kippur from both the evening before and the evening after. [...] Because [...] says, [...] "You shall rest," [...] the Gemara applied the rule to Sabbaths as well. [...] Because [...] says [...] "your Sabbath" [...] (<b>your</b> <b>day</b> of rest), the Gemara applied the rule to other Festivals (in addition to Yom Kippur); wherever the law creates an obligation to rest, we add time to that obligation from the surrounding profane days to the holy day. Rabbi Akiva, however, read [...] "And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth day," [...] to teach the lesson learned by Rav Hiyya bar Rav from Difti (that is, Dibtha, below the Tigris, southeast of Babylon). [...] Rav Hiyya bar Rav from Difti taught in a Baraita that [...] says [...] "the ninth day" [...] to indicate that if people eat and drink on the ninth day, then Scripture credits it to them as if they fasted on both the ninth and the tenth days (because [...] calls the eating and drinking on the ninth day [...] "fasting").|$|E
