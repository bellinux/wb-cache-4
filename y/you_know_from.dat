500|$|After the reveal of the film's full cast, many {{outlets and}} fans began {{referring}} to the film as [...] "Avengers 2.5", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, {{and the fact that}} the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier. In response to this, Feige said, [...] "What's fun about Civil War though is, as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people .... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming." [...] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because [...] "there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice," [...] saying Marvel was [...] "saving" [...] the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see [...] "her dynamic with Scott [...] in a way it could play out".|$|E
2500|$|Iago's plan {{appears to}} succeed when Othello kills Desdemona, who is {{innocent}} of Iago's charges. Soon afterwards, however, Emilia brings Iago's treachery to light, and Iago kills {{her in a}} fit of rage before being arrested. He remains famously reticent when pressed for an explanation of his actions before he is arrested: [...] "Demand me nothing. What you know, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>From</b> this time forth I never will speak word." [...] Following Othello's suicide, Cassio, now in charge, condemns Iago to be imprisoned and tortured as punishment for his crimes.|$|E
2500|$|Sibelius, however, was not {{a natural}} teacher. First, he had little {{patience}} for the tedium of pedagogy or the quotidian nature of instruction, resulting in a teaching style that was [...] "too haphazard" [...] and [...] "anything but systematic or disciplined". This {{was not lost on}} Madetoja, who in January 1910 wrote to Kuula in Paris, [...] "Sibelius has been tutoring me. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> your own experience that his tutoring is anything but detailed." [...] That said, Madetoja appears to have found some value in the instruction. He recalled, for example, that Sibelius's method consisted of [...] "short, striking remarks" [...] (for example, [...] "No dead notes. Every note must live"! and [...] "You must jump into the water if you are to learn to swim. You must not be afraid of the difficulty of the task..."), rather than [...] "instruction in the ordinary pedagogic sense".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2007, while {{speaking}} about issuing a draft, McCain said, [...] "One, it's the best military we've ever had, it just isn't big enough. Two, there's {{never been a}} draft that I've ever heard of since World War II that was fair. What we've done is we find rich people find a way out, and lower income people {{are the ones that}} serve. I might consider it, I don't think it's necessary, but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve. But it just doesn't happen. And the other thing is that, because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> here in Brauman, it takes intensive training with the equipment and the technical skills that now our people are required to engage in, that it makes it not conducive to a short term. Now they enlist for 4 years. We used to draft people almost for 2 years or even 18 months so it's much more difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E
