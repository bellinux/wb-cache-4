500|$|For this {{operation}} Model had {{at his disposal}} Sixth SS Panzer Army, Fifth Panzer Army and Seventh Army. These armies, with over 2,000 panzers and 2,000 airplanes [...] represented the last strategic reserve of the crumbling Third Reich. Despite his misgivings, Model threw himself into the task with his usual energy, cracking down on any defeatism he might find. When a staff officer complained about shortages, Model snapped: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> take it from the Americans". When Ludwig Heilmann warned Model that his command 5th Parachute Division was only a Class IV outfit, Model, who by now must have been surfeited with complaints on lack of equipment and insufficient training, merely replied that success would be won by the paratroopers' [...] "usual audacity." [...] He remained acutely aware of both the operation's significance, and its most likely outcome. When Colonel Friedrich August von der Heydte, ordered to lead a parachute drop {{as part of the}} operation, said that the jump had no more than a 10 percent chance of success, he replied: [...] "Well, then it is necessary to make the attempt, since the entire offensive has no more than a 10 percent chance of success. It must be done, since this offensive is the last remaining chance to conclude the war favourably." ...|$|E
2500|$|According {{to court}} records, in 1974 Jackie Presser became deeply {{involved}} in mafia affairs. He allegedly told {{the leaders of the}} Chicago mafia {{that he was willing to}} do them favors in exchange for money and assistance. [...] Jimmy [...] "The Weasel" [...] Fratianno, a former hitman in the Cleveland crime family and later acting head of the Los Angeles crime family, later testified that Chicago crime boss Joseph Aiuppa told him in 1974 that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> from Jackie Presser, he said he'll do it for you." [...] Fratianno also testified that he colluded with Presser to set up a union dental program whose profits were skimmed into Presser's and the Mafia's bank accounts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1896 {{he visited}} London {{for the last}} time to conduct the premiere of his Cello Concerto in B minor by the London Philharmonic. Also in 1896, Brahms tried to persuade Dvořák, who had several children, to move to Vienna. Brahms said he himself had no dependents and [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> my fortune is at your disposal". Clapham writes [...] "Dvořák was deeply moved and tears came to his wife's eyes, but it was quite {{impossible}} for him, a Czech, to contemplate leaving Bohemia." [...] Brahms at the time had not so long left to live, as he died 3 April 1897. Also, Brahms hoped to gain an ally in Vienna to [...] "counterbalance the influence of" [...] Bruckner.|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{thing you}} will not want for some time," [...] she said, [...] "for you do not look as if <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>anything</b> to cheer your soul. Now tell me, young man, is it really the {{engagement}} rapture that has lasted all this time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The shopkeeper bowed. [...] "I {{will make}} enquiries. If <b>you</b> should <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> I sell, señor, perhaps you will {{remember}} that I am an honest man." ...|$|R

2500|$|Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari records {{a number}} of raids against the Byzantine Empire under the period A.H. 49 (9/2/669 - 28/1/670). Though Abu Ayyub was by then an old man, that did not deter him from enlisting. Shortly after {{engaging}} in battle, it is recorded that he fell ill and had to withdraw. Someone asked, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> Abu Ayyub?" [...] To which Abu Ayyub replied, [...] "Convey my salaams (Islamic greeting and farewell) to the Muslim armies and tell them, [...] "Abu Ayyub urges you to penetrate deep into enemy territory, {{as far as you}} can go; and that you should carry him with you, and that you should bury him under your feet at the walls of Constantinople." [...] Whereupon, he passed away. The Muslim army fulfilled his request and pushed back the enemy's forces until they reached the walls of Constantinople where Abu Ayyub was finally interred.|$|E
6000|$|The Clayton girls {{said good-bye}} with pity in their voices, and Rivers sought {{opportunity}} to say, privately: [...] "I {{hate to see}} you back {{out there on the}} border. If <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> let me know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> had <b>needed</b> <b>anything</b> I {{would have}} worked for you," [...] said Deronda, {{conscious}} of disappointed yearning--a shutting out forever from long early vistas of affectionate imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{really should}} have thought, Ada,' Sheila began, then caught back the angry words, and turned and looked over her {{shoulder}} into the room. 'Do you think <b>you</b> will <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> more, Dr Ferguson?' she asked in a sepulchral voice.|$|R
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> not do <b>anything,</b> Andrew. You {{are one of}} the family. You can {{sit with}} us and enjoy yourself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take heart,' she said, 'all {{will now}} go well! Wrap {{yourself}} in this skin, {{and leave the}} palace and {{go as far as}} you can. I will look after you. Your dresses and your jewels shall follow you underground, and if you strike the earth whenever <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> you will have it at once. But go quickly: you have no time to lose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, monsieur. There is a canteen in the courtyard. It is {{open from}} eight till nine {{o'clock in the}} morning, and from five to six in the evening. But you {{are not allowed to}} get things in from the town; but nevertheless--" [...] and he smiled, [...] "--as your comrades are on parole, doubtless, should <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> beyond what is sold in the canteen, it may chance that they may bring you just the things you want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Jill,--I {{think of}} having a Christmas tree so that our invalids can enjoy it, and all your elegant friends are cordially invited. Knowing {{that you would like}} to help, I send some paper for sugar-plum horns and some beads for necklaces. They will {{brighten}} the tree and please the girls for themselves or their dolls. Jack sends you a horn for a pattern, and will you make a ladder-necklace to show him how? Let me know if <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As Morrison biographer Ritchie Yorke {{described}} it, {{the song}} remembered [...] "how {{it was when}} you were a kid and just got stoned from nature and <b>you</b> didn't <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> else". Morrison, in 1985, related the song to a quasi-mystical experience he had as a child: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once a taxicab driver, {{always a}} taxicab driver," [...] Sarah propounded. [...] "Did {{you know that}} that was my profession, Mr. Wingate? If <b>you</b> do <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> {{in the shape of}} a {{comfortable}} conveyance while you are in town, will you remember me? I'll send you a card, if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gregory took an even brutal tone. It {{seemed to}} {{him as if he}} were forced to hurt her feelings. But his words, in spite of his tone, were not brutal; they might have even been thought flattering. [...] "The politeness is in the manner, and <b>you</b> don't <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> but your manner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my son, be {{very careful}} and keep out of danger," [...] said Mr. Dodge to Charley, when the latter was ready to leave. [...] "I shall send old Jed Sanborn up to see you once or twice, and if <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> from here you let him know and he can bring it to you." [...] And then, after a warm {{handshake}} from his father and a kiss from his mother, Snap almost ran from the house, fearful {{that he would be}} late.|$|E
6000|$|... "All is here except food," [...] Chigron said. [...] "That I {{could not}} prepare until I {{knew you were}} coming; but be assured that you shall be served regularly. There is no fear of {{intrusion}} from any employed in the establishment. They have no occasion {{to come out to}} the back of the house, and probably few know of the existence of this tomb. Should I have any ground for believing that there is danger, I will take other measures for your concealment. Should <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> do not hesitate to say so. I owe my position to the patronage of my lord Ameres, and there is nothing I would not do to insure the safety of his son. And now, my lord, I will retire, and will presently send you by a trusty servant the food of which I have no doubt that you stand in need." ...|$|E
5000|$|Terms like Lehrer (teacher) are {{increasingly}} being replaced by abstract or collective nouns such as Lehrkraft (teaching force; faculty). Kellner (waiter) and Kellnerin (waitress) are often transformed into Bedienung (service), which {{can be interpreted as}} having the effect of dehumanising the referent: [...] "Fragen Sie bitte die Bedienung, falls Sie einen Wunsch haben" [...] ("If <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything,</b> ask the service/help").|$|E
5000|$|Alnutt: You don't think <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to do <b>anything</b> {{to prepare}} your team for that? They just lost {{and now they}} have to go into the NCAA tournament? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case, I don't {{know that}} <b>you</b> <b>need</b> say <b>anything</b> to me. Come to the Adelphi {{as soon as}} you can--that's all. I never think myself that a man becomes a bit {{stronger}} after an illness by remaining idle." [...] Then Harry passed on, and felt that he had escaped easily in that interview.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{whatever}} I am, I am {{very different}} from my husband. If you like him, you won't like me. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> n't say <b>anything.</b> Your liking me {{is n't in the}} least necessary!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Langridge {{is working}} with {{newcomer}} artist Bruce Ozella for the series, an artist whose appeal once again rests in evoking the classic Popeye strips of yore. Asked what Ozella's style brings to a series like Popeye, Langridge said simply, [...] "You mean apart from his uncanny ability to draw like E. C. Segar? I'm not sure <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> else!" ...|$|E
50|$|As {{this is a}} market, bargain if {{you like}} to buy more {{expensive}} items!. Kente clothes is a good start, as this is a typical Ghanaian made souvenir. If <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> you haven't been able to find, you can most probably find it at Makola Market: Shoes, towels, sunglasses, beaded jewelry, bags, hats, a water basin, a chair, smoked fish, veggies - anything. Be conscious of your surroundings, hang on to what you are carrying, and have fun.|$|E

5000|$|After a brief {{conversation}} {{over the}} victory, Cindy apologizes to Dennis {{about the things}} she said to him. Dennis assures her that it's alright, as he also hated himself for never being able to help her. He continues to say: [...] "So from now on if <b>you</b> ever <b>need</b> <b>anything</b> from me, <b>you</b> let me know and I'll be there. This time, I promise..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't think <b>you</b> <b>need</b> fear <b>anything</b> of that sort, Major! Besides, {{this is not}} on {{the direct}} line between the Ghauts and the city. And even if they find they cannot push on, I should say our force would be able to secure their retreat. The Mahratta horse {{will never be able to}} break our squares; but of course, in that case we should have to abandon all our baggage and baggage animals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I see you are. I see {{you know}} nothing of the matter. You have only {{knowledge}} enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear, comprehensible, elegant English. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> not say <b>anything</b> more of your ignorance.
