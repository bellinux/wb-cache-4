2500|$|In {{an email}} debate with Carmon, Whitaker asked about MEMRI's November 2000 {{translation}} {{of an interview}} given by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to Al-Ahram al-Arabi. One question asked by the interviewer was: [...] "How {{do you deal with}} the Jews who are besieging al-Aqsa and are scattered around it?" [...] which was translated as: [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Jews?" [...] MEMRI cut out {{the first part of the}} reply and combined it with the answer to the next question, which, Whitaker claimed, made [...] "Arabs look more anti-semitic than they are". Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies as both questions referred to the same subject. [...] Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: [...] "it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake... You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have missed, you have failed to answer." [...] Carmon also accused Whitaker of [...] "using insults rather than evidence" [...] in his criticism of MEMRI.|$|E

What I have a problem with is that there’s a separate thing that has started happening is that the lid has been somewhat lifted for journalists, and so journalists on red carpets will now say, ‘So how do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gender pay gap?’. ‘What? What’s the specific question?’. ‘Well, do you know that you got paid less or more than Michael Fassbender?’. That question? That to me is not very nice. I’m not going to have that conversation with a friend or even a family member, let alone in public. And so what’s happened {{as a result of these}} big very important discussions is that we’re then subjected to a particular line of questioning that being a Brit strikes me as being a little bit vulgar. Why would I stand on a red carpet and talk about how much I get paid?".|$|E

[...] However, Atkins grew nervous that fans would think the towel was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game. Cope agreed to poll players on their view of the towel. Linebacker Jack Ham told Cope, [...] "I think your idea stinks"; Ernie [...] "Fats" [...] Holmes was also against the idea.

The Towel made its debut on December 27, 1975, in a playoff game against the Baltimore Colts. Prior to the game, Cope, whose idea had been mocked by the local Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, watched the gathering fans through his binoculars from the broadcast booth. He saw less than a dozen towels while players were going through pre-game warm-ups. Cope recalls, [...] "Nearing kickoff, the Steelers gathered in their tunnel for introductions, whereupon the crowd exploded - and suddenly, by my estimation, 30,000 Terrible Towels twirled from the fists of fans around the stadium!" [...] The Steelers went on to defeat the Colts 28 - 10. In the following weeks, the team defeated the Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys, to capture the franchise's second consecutive Super Bowl victory. Even while the Steelers struggled through the 1980s, the Towel remained a large part of the franchise. During the Towel's debut game Andy Russell, who had opposed the idea of the Towel, returned a fumble 93‒yards for a touchdown. The play inspired local fan Lisa Benz to write about the Towel, which she later sent to Cope. In part, her poem read: ...|$|E
