5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> but to get them to do what you want.|$|E

25|$|To me {{the ideal}} film— which I've never succeeded in making— {{would be as}} though the reel were behind one's eyes and you were {{projecting}} it yourself, seeing what <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to see.

Everything we do with the camera has physiological and mental significance.|$|E

25|$|Students {{can also}} enter the school at sixth form level, {{though they do}} not have to take a test for this. Instead, places are awarded based on GCSE grades, {{requiring}} at least an A in any subject <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to take, A* in Maths to take Further Maths, and a B in English and Maths if they do not already form part of your offer. Again, at this level places are highly competitive with students applying from all over Birmingham and the surrounding areas. There are approximately 50 external candidates in each year.|$|E
25|$|At 15:00 on Christmas Eve, Sveriges Television airs Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul (From All of Us to All of You), {{commonly}} referred to as Kalle Anka - Donald Duck. (Donald {{is by far the most}} popular Disney cartoon in Sweden.) This one-hour show mostly contains clips from classical Disney films, such as Robin Hood and The Jungle Book (with the song The Bear Necessities), as well as promotional clips for recent Disney films, concluded with the song When <b>You</b> <b>Wish</b> Upon A Star. The show is one of the highest-rated Swedish television programs, only rivalled by international sports events and the Eurovision Song Contest, and most Swedish people can recite much of the show.|$|E

25|$|Two images Henri Bergson gave in {{his essay}} An Introduction to Metaphysics may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the {{absolute}} and the relative. The first image is a city reconstructed with juxtaposed photographs taken from every viewpoint and angle. The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. The {{same goes for the}} experience of reading a single line of Homer. If <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.|$|E
25|$|If <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> you {{may tell}} the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
25|$|The chroniclers of the First Crusade {{documented}} the chance interception {{of a message}} warning the duke of Caesarea of {{the coming of the}} Crusader armies when a carrier pigeon was felled by a hawk over a Crusader military encampment in May 1099. The message, written in Arabic, read as follows:Greetings from the king of Acre to the duke of Caesarea. A generation of dogs, a foolish, headstrong, disorderly race, has gone through my land. If you value your way of life, you and others of the faith should bring harm to them, since you can easily do what <b>you</b> <b>wish.</b> Transmit this message to other cities and strongholds. Carrier pigeons were regularly used in this period. For example, Edward Gibbon notes that during the siege of Acre (1189–1191) by the Crusaders, the inhabitants of the besieged city kept a regular correspondence with the Sultan's forces by way of carrier pigeon.|$|E

25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E

500|$|On October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed {{a lawsuit}} accusing Family Guy of {{infringing}} its copyright on the song [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Wish</b> upon a Star", through a parody song entitled [...] "I Need a Jew" [...] appearing in the episode [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Wish</b> Upon a Weinstein". Bourne Co., which holds the copyright, alleged the parody pairs a [...] "thinly veiled" [...] copy of their music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, and Walter Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages. Bourne argued that [...] "I Need a Jew" [...] uses the copyrighted melody of [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Wish</b> Upon a Star" [...] without commenting on that song, {{and that it was}} therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that Family Guy did not infringe on Bourne's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.|$|E

500|$|The {{score for}} the film was composed, {{conducted}} and produced by John Williams, who had previously worked on Spielberg's Jaws. Williams wrote over 300 examples of the iconic five-tone motif for Close Encounters—the five tones are used by scientists {{to communicate with the}} visiting spaceship as a mathematical language—before Spielberg chose the one incorporated into the film's signature theme. Spielberg called Williams' work [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Wish</b> upon a Star meets science fiction". Incidentally, Williams briefly included the song's signature melody in the score at Spielberg's behest, just before Roy Neary turns to board the mothership. Spielberg initially included Cliff Edwards' original [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Wish</b> upon a Star" [...] from Pinocchio in the closing credits, but after a Dallas preview where several members of the audience audibly snickered at the inclusion, the song was dropped and replaced with Williams' orchestral version of it. The score was recorded at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.|$|E
