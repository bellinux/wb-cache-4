Announced on 7 April, Australia’s new $ 43 billion plan for broadband will deliver 100 Mbits/sec download speeds to 90 % of Australian households within eight years via optical fibre lines running all the way to their homes, schools and workplaces. The network will be built and operated by a new company in which the Commonwealth will be the majority shareholder. Rudd’s new plan replaces the one Labor took to the 2007 election, promising to spend $ 4. 7 billion on a network delivering 12 Mbits/sec to 98 % of the population, which replaced the Coalition’s $ 1 billion plan for improved broadband in non-metropolitan areas. This talk considers the origins of the new plan and asks who will benefit and who will pay for it. This talk was presented on 30 April 2009...|$|E

40|$|Making it to a {{national}} competition is a very exciting time in an amateur athlete’s career. All of the months of training and competition have lead to this one event. With only {{a short period of}} time until the competition (usually two to four weeks) it is often difficult to determine the best course of action for preparing the athlete both physically and mentally. The purpose of the Saskatchewan Sport Science Program is to provide coaches and athletes with access to information in the five sport science disciplines to assist in the preparing the athletes for National level competitions. Please call 1 - 888 - 350 - 5558 if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> questions. The <b>information</b> contained in this pamphlet should assist your preparation not only for Nationals but the regular competitive season as well. Physical Considerations Although it may be tempting to step up strength and conditioning programs prior to Nationals, such a practice may actually decrease performance. It is better to analyze the specific needs of each athlete and identify one or two weaknesses and focus the training effort on those aspects while maintaining other components. Emphasis o...|$|R
