500|$|Over 110 {{developers}} {{worked on}} the game, a number that director Nate Fox considered small. He felt that working with a small team necessitated having a defined vision for the game from the outset, [...] "to answer those first questions about what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> game to be". Sometimes, ideas came about during development {{that would have to}} be thrown out for not fitting with the game's original vision. [...] "We kill our darlings at Sucker Punch. It's not easy; it's necessary", Fox explained. Second Son displays a native resolution of 1080p at 30 frames per second.|$|E
500|$|The Gripen is {{compatible}} {{with a number of}} different armaments, beyond the aircraft's single 27mm Mauser BK-27 cannon (omitted on the two-seat variants), including air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, air-to-ground missiles such as the AGM-65 Maverick, and anti-ship missiles such as the RBS-15. In 2010, the Swedish Air Force's Gripen fleet completed the MS19 upgrade process, enabling compatibility with a range of weapons, including the long-range MBDA Meteor missile, the short-range IRIS-T missile and the GBU-49 laser-guided bomb. Speaking on the Gripen's selection of armaments, Saab's campaign director for India Edvard de la Motte stated that: [...] "If you buy Gripen, select where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> weapons from. [...] Israel, Sweden, Europe, US… South America. [...] It's up to the customer".|$|E
500|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{for the failure of}} Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls [...] "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If you were a little boy, wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> parents to get you one this Christmas?" [...] His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.|$|E

500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E
500|$|His work {{steadily}} {{increased in}} amount and quality throughout the 1920s and '30s. By the 1930s {{he was making}} most of his court appearances in the senior courts such as the High Court of Justice; in 1932 he was advised by his clerk {{that he should not}} be seen in the County Courts, and that he should leave this work for lesser members of the chambers. In 1929 he helped edit several chapters of Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.) and in 1932 acted as a supervising editor for the 9th edition of Bullen & Leake's Precedents for Pleadings in the King's Bench Division. In 1932 he moved to his own set of chambers in Brick Court, and by 1936 he was earning over £3,000 a year. A notable case was L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [...] 2 KB 394, where he successfully argued an exemption clause was incorporated because a contract was signed. This was counter to his work as a judge, where he tried to minimise their impact, but he said that 'If you are an advocate <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> client to win. If you are a judge you don't care who wins exactly. All you are concerned about is justice'.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-June, Smith {{suffered}} a side strain which {{prevented him from}} playing for six weeks. By this point of the season, Smith had experienced success as an opener in the limited-over matches, scoring half centuries in one-day and Twenty20 matches, although his batting average in first-class matches was a disappointing 8.50 from four matches. Moores backed Smith {{to succeed in the}} long form of the game, stating [...] "We've backed Tom to do it because it balances our team and he has shown he is a very good player. I think we've seen that in the one-day stuff. I think Tom is playing well. You judge a player on how he's playing. Tom's developing and learning quickly.

2500|$|According to {{longtime}} Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks, Bulger's {{murder of}} Paul McGonagle's brother {{led directly to}} the Mullin Gang's assassination of his mentor. According to Weeks,"One day while the gang war was still going on, Jimmy was driving down Seventh Street in South Boston when he saw Paulie driving toward him. Jimmy pulled up beside him, window to window, nose to nose, and called his name. As Paulie looked over, Jimmy shot him right between the eyes. Only at that moment, just as he pulled the trigger, Jimmy realized it wasn't Paulie. It was Donald, the most likable of the McGonagle brothers, {{the only one who}} wasn't involved in anything. Jimmy drove straight to Billy O'Sullivan's house on Savin Hill Avenue and told Billy O, who was at the stove cooking, 'I shot the wrong one. I shot Donald.' Billy looked up from the stove and said, 'Don't worry about it. He wasn't healthy anyway. He smoked. He would have gotten lung cancer. How do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> pork chops?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Alstat was {{an early}} {{champion}} {{of the rights of}} women, including their education and their place in academia. In the 1930s, he worked with Trude Weiss-Rosmarin, teaching courses on Jewish History and Modern Jewish Problems at [...] "The School of the Jewish Woman," [...] the institution she created on New York's Upper West Side, under the auspices of Hadassah. Weiss-Rosmarin, and those who worked with her, felt that [...] "Jewish women had been short-changed...and saw education was the remedy." [...] "As an intellectual feminist," [...] Weiss-Rosmarin promoted the study of the liturgy, learning the meaning and history of the prayers, [...] "to stimulate attendance of women at synagogue." [...] Through classes in history, philosophy, customs, and ceremonies, Alstat, along with the other well-known rabbis who taught at this school, helped promote this vision of increased education, not only for the women of that time, but also so that they could help their children. As Weiss-Rosmarin put it, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> children to grow up as educated Jews, you yourself must become educated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sexual morals changed. One notable {{event was}} the {{publication}} of D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover by Penguin Books in 1960. Although first printed in 1928, the release in 1960 of an inexpensive mass-market paperback version prompted a court case. The prosecuting council's question, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> wife or servants to read this book?" [...] highlighted how far society had changed, and how little some people had noticed. The book was seen {{as one of the}} first events in a general relaxation of sexual attitudes. Other elements of the sexual revolution included the development of The Pill, Mary Quant's miniskirt and the 1967 legalisation of homosexuality. There was a rise in the incidence of divorce and abortion, and a resurgence of the women's liberation movement, whose campaigning helped secure the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act in 1975. [...] The Irish Catholics, traditionally the most puritanical of the ethno-religious groups, eased up a little, especially as the membership disregarded the bishops teaching that contraception was sinful.|$|E
2500|$|Rousey {{appeared}} nude on {{the cover}} of ESPN The Magazines 2012 Body Issue and in a pictorial therein. Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of this goes back to advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so just think that one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>your</b> son or daughter, or even your 13-year-old little sister to see, keep that in mind.' So, whatever I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine. These girls {{are going to have to}} explain to their kids one day why mommy's ass and vagina are all over the place."
