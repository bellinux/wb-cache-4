25|$|The chroniclers of the First Crusade {{documented}} the chance interception {{of a message}} warning the duke of Caesarea of {{the coming of the}} Crusader armies when a carrier pigeon was felled by a hawk over a Crusader military encampment in May 1099. The message, written in Arabic, read as follows:Greetings from the king of Acre to the duke of Caesarea. A generation of dogs, a foolish, headstrong, disorderly race, has gone through my land. If you value your way of life, you and others of the faith should bring harm to them, since <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> do what you wish. Transmit this message to other cities and strongholds. Carrier pigeons were regularly used in this period. For example, Edward Gibbon notes that during the siege of Acre (1189–1191) by the Crusaders, the inhabitants of the besieged city kept a regular correspondence with the Sultan's forces by way of carrier pigeon.|$|E

Sweeney's view was shared by Andy Gill from The Independent who also named [...] "Work" [...] the highlight on The New Classic, and said Azalea's double-time delivery was best-employed on the song. HipHopDX's Marcus Dowling wrote that [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "an extraordinarily well-rounded listen" [...] and the [...] "honest and intriguing greatness" [...] of The New Classic. Dowling commented that the line, [...] "No money, no family, 16 in the middle of Miami", provided an [...] "ocean of depth [...] that makes the rest of the album feel like swimming in a kiddie pool". Matt Jost of RapReviews.com concurred, and called the song [...] "the sure winner" [...] and [...] "lyrically most ambitious offering" [...] of the album. Jost opined that the track was [...] "memorable" [...] and its production [...] "cleverly subverts expectations", and explained, [...] "It's when she keeps it simple and relies on her indeed present swagger that the Iggy Azalea character works best". Similarly, Alex Scordelis of Paper described the track as [...] "the cornerstone" [...] of the album and complimented its [...] "insanely catchy chorus". Scordelis believed it marked a heightened evolution in Azalea's growth as a rapper, and stated, [...] " [...] a song <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> imagine Azalea performing for years to come".|$|E

[...] In Australia, National Nine News reported that [...] "New Zealand is questioning pro-whaling support among Pacific Island states with the opposition calling for a rethink of foreign aid." [...] It is expected that more countries in the future will join IWC including some landlocked countries. Currently, there are 8 landlocked IWC members.

2500|$|Their {{opportunity}} came in 211, when Liu Zhang became fearful upon receiving {{news that}} Cao Cao {{was planning to}} attack the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. As Hanzhong Commandery was located strategically at the northern route leading into Yi Province, Liu Zhang would be in great peril if Hanzhong fell into Cao Cao's hands.

[...] Liu Bei accepted Fa Zheng's advice and led his forces into Yi Province, where he met Liu Zhang at Fu County (涪縣; present-day Fucheng District, Mianyang, Sichuan). Liu Bei then led his troops north to Jiameng (葭萌; located about 20 km northeast of present-day Jiange County, Sichuan) before turning south to attack Liu Zhang later.|$|E

He closed by saying, [...] "the rest of 2009 is {{shaping up to be}} All Time Low’s year". Alternative Press, commenting on the album's first single, said [...] "'Weightless' is an insta-classic." [...] However, the reviewer was disappointed in the producers for their use of Auto-Tune, saying [...] "This boy (Gaskarth) can sing, let him already." [...] The article also contradicted AbsolutePunk's view of the song [...] "Too Much", saying it [...] "is a remarkable progression for the quartet: a slow, electronic-tinged number". The Washington Post was also hugely favorable of the album. Reviewer Nancy Dunham said: [...] "The songs on Nothing Personal are what pop-punk is all about -- or should be, anyway." [...] She felt the album [...] "will likely gain the band plenty of media and popular attention" [...] and that [...] "the album's 12 tunes are so jaunty and their lyrics about first love, betrayal and parties so angst-filled <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> imagine them playing in the background of the TV shows The Hills or 90210".|$|E
