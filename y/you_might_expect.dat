25|$|On {{the topic}} of {{predictable}} probabilities, the double-slit experiments are a popular example. Photons are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, {{and the distribution of}} its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but {{there is no way to}} predict where in the resulting interference pattern any individual photon will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use weak measurement to acquire more information without violating the Uncertainty principle).|$|E
25|$|Residential Life at the University of Massachusetts Amherst {{is one of}} {{the largest}} on-campus housing systems in the United States. Over 14,000 {{students}} live in 52 residence halls, while families, staff, and graduate students live in 345 units in two apartment complexes (North Village and Lincoln). The fifty-two residence halls and four undergraduate apartment buildings are grouped into seven separate and very different residential areas: Central, Northeast, Orchard Hill, Southwest, Sylvan, North Apartments, and the recently constructed Commonwealth Honors College Residential Community (CHCRC). Each possesses its own distinctive characteristics, inspired in part by location, in part by architecture, and in part by the different cultural or academic living/learning programs housed within. Each residential area houses classrooms, recreational and social centers, kitchenettes, and cultural centers - in addition to the bedrooms, study areas, laundries, television rooms, and dining facilities <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect.</b> Each also has its own student governing body and is,in effect, a community unto itself. Located in the central corridor of campus, the Honors Community houses undergraduate members of Commonwealth Honors College. In this community, undergraduates, staff, and faculty share an interwoven mix of double, single, suite, and apartment-style living options spread across six halls. This area featured a 24-hour full-service cafe during its first year, but it soon became clear that 24-hour operation was not profitable. The cafe is closed between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. during the school year and closed during the summer. The community includes assembly and workshop rooms, as well as most Honors College programming and staff offices.|$|E

The city embarked on a campaign to capitalize on its connections to KFC and Colonel Sanders, and Sharae Myers, the city's Main Street manager, said of the episode, [...] "One thing I think is great is that Corbin got the recognition: that the mecca for KFC is in Corbin." ...|$|E
500|$|Smoking {{cigarettes}} {{has become}} synonymous with Dot, and Brown {{has suggested that the}} habit is [...] "intrinsic" [...] to the character. Following the 2007 England smoking ban, it was reported in the Daily Mail that the BBC were refusing to prohibit the character from smoking on-screen despite the act being banned in workplaces, as they have [...] "to portray real life– and people smoke". Dot's smoking was criticised by private healthcare company Bupa in 2008, when they rated her television's most unhealthy character. They suggest that, in order to spread a public message, Dot should appear breathless, not with [...] "implausibly good health". They added, [...] "Though Dot Cotton has a smoker's voice– deeper than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect,</b> she {{does not seem to be}} short of breath or wheezy" [...] and that viewers would be influenced by this. However, Dot's smoking has been described by broadcasting watchdogs Ofcom as [...] "justified in the context of the programme as a representation of an East End character" [...] and they therefore stipulate that enforcement of broadcast smoking-sanctions would be unlikely on EastEnders.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} a generally positive reception and holds a 76% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 145 reviews. Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman gave The Young Victoria a B+; he gave praise to Emily Blunt's performance and concluded, [...] "The Young Victoria has a subtler flow than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect,</b> {{and at times}} it's calmer than you may like. Director Jean-Marc Vallée's images have a creamy stateliness, {{but this is no}} gilded princess fantasy — it's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it a [...] "frivolously entertaining film" [...] and believed it was [...] "directed with some snap by Jean-Marc Vallée". Dargis finished her review, [...] "Despite the filmmakers’ efforts to persuade us that The Young Victoria is a serious work, and despite some tense moments and gunfire, the film’s pleasures are as light as its story. No matter. Albert may never rip Victoria’s bodice, but he does eventually loosen it, to her delight and ours." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Leane, for Den of Geek, {{stated that}} [...] "this week we {{continue}} to see the fallout of ’s revelations playing out in gleefully entertaining fashion ... we were treated to a twisty espionage-heavy thriller of an episode". Leane added that [...] "by pitting May against her other self in a well-shot, thumpingly-scored fight sequence, new-to-S.H.I.E.L.D. director Kevin Tancharoen used his experience from Mortal Kombat: Legacy to highlight how far the action elements of the show have come since the early days." [...] and also noted the development of multiple characters as positive. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said [...] "I had my trepidations about [...] "Face My Enemy"'s cutesy-looking callbacks to more camp episodes and spy tropes, the kind <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> from Chuck, back in the day. The hour certainly danced over that line here and there, what with May and Coulson’s only means to recover an important artifact lying in a lavish party, the stock laser grid security alarm, May's mirror image fight, and other such throwback fare, but I’d say [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] ended up more of a celebratory self-aware subversion, rather than {{a sign of the}} season running out on empty just yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN Movies {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from Saw VI, but did point out his {{favorite}} and highlight of the film as the [...] "garage trap". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said [...] "The 3D is used as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> it to be – which is to say, this is no James Cameron immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, {{and there is some}} fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points". [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He said Saw 3D is [...] "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but said most of the film's traps lack the [...] "Rube Goldberg-style cleverness that marked the series". [...] Scheck {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an [...] "exceedingly bland stand-in". He called the visual impact of the 3D [...] "negligible".|$|E

500|$|According to {{the review}} {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup, issue #0 received an average score of 7.3/10 based on 23 reviews from critics. Leia Calderon of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave it four-out-of-five stars writing, [...] "Overall, Bendis and Coipel's Civil War II #0 serves {{the sole purpose}} of laying out the foundation for the series. Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only real issue is the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. But {{the good news is that}} this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jean-Luc Picard after Justman saw him perform at the University of California, Los Angeles. Roddenberry insisted that he wanted a French actor in the role, but Justman {{arranged}} a meeting between Stewart and the production team to introduce the actor, and later Berman supported the casting. Fontana thought that American actor Stephen Macht would be better in the role. Justman wanted Stewart in the show in some capacity, and with Roddenberry still opposing him as Picard, Justman suggested that he might be a good fit instead for Data. Because Roddenberry couldn't find an actor he preferred more for Picard, he relented and changed his concept of Picard to better fit Stewart. Although Stewart was willing to put on an American accent to portray the role of Picard, the producers asked him to use his natural accent instead. They also tested him with a hairpiece but thought that it looked [...] "awful". Stewart was pleased to have received the role, saying that his children were impressed with the new part and praised the mythos of the show saying, [...] "The great strength of Star Trek is its epic, classic feel. For an actor of my background, it has more richness and depth than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> on television." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recurring}} theme of published tests was the Tagora´s lack of clear advantages or of a competitive edge. In comparing {{the car to}} its likely competitors, Autocars verdict was that [...] "the new Talbot is highly comparable with the others, and deserves to sell as any of them, although it does not come out with any startling advantages which <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> of the latest appearance on the scene". Those cars against which the Tagora 2.2 GLS was compared were the Ford Granada 2.3 GL, Opel Rekord 2.0S, Renault 20TX, Rover 2300 and Volvo 244 GL. Of these cars, the Tagora was the second most expensive but {{did not have a}} superiority among the significant attributes of speed, acceleration, interior room or chassis design. Out of the comparison group the Tagora had the second highest top speed, was the third fastest to 60mph though it had the best overall mpg (by 0.7 mpg). In terms of interior room, it had the fourth best legroom (front/rear). Motor Sport also noted the car´s modest competence in comparison with the Rover 2300 (launched 1976), saying that the Tagora had more leisurely acceleration. LJK Setright noted the cars´s overall [...] "adequacy" [...] going on to say that if fitted with the correct type of tyre he would still opt for a Peugeot 604 instead. Car judged the chassis design to be one area [...] "where [...] does not show the comparative youth of its design".|$|E
