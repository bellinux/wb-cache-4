500|$|... "Oceania" [...] was [...] "spoilt by some overenthusiastic vocal whoopings", {{according}} to David Hooper from BBC Music. The Guardians writer David Peschek {{said that when}} the singer sings in the song, [...] "choral swoops [...] like fireworks behind her". AllMusic's Heather Phares noted that the song, along with Medúllas lead single [...] "Who Is It", [...] "have an alien quality {{that is all the}} stranger considering that nearly all of their source material is human (except for the odd keyboard or two)". Dominique Leone of Pitchfork thought [...] "Oceania" [...] was hardly the most obvious choice for a promotional single release, despite its [...] "bizarre, swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples". Jeremy D. Larson from Time magazine provided a mixed review to the song, stating that it was the best Olympic theme song, but during the Olympics performance, [...] "when she sang 'Every pearl is a lynx is a girl' we think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> world collectively sigh, 'Where's Celine Dion?'". In 2005, the song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 47th Grammy Awards but lost out to Norah Jones' [...] "Sunrise".|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} for the 'Best Actress' BAFTA award for Dot's single-hander EastEnders episode in 2009; {{she became the first}} soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. The show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described Brown's BAFTA nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA– of which I'm a member– to connect with a big audience." [...] Brown has also won 'Best Actress' for her role as Dot at the Inside Soap Awards in 2001 and 2004, as well as the 'Outstanding Achievement' award in 2003, and 'Best Couple' in 2005 with John Bardon, as Dot and Jim Branning. She and Bardon also won 'Best On-Screen Partnership' at the British Soap Awards in both 2002 and 2005, while in 2005, Brown won a 'Lifetime Achievement' award for her role, again at the British Soap Awards. The role also resulted in several award nominations including a 'Most Popular Actress' nomination at the National Television Awards in 2005, and a 'Best Actress' nomination at the 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards among others. Dot was also voted the 46th best television character in a television poll entitled The 100 Greatest Television Characters.|$|E

She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't believe anything is going to happen until it does, until you see your name on a paper or it actually happens and you have something in your hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win.

[...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, made it sound worthwhile, I think. So I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Buffy was conceived by Joss Whedon {{as a way}} of subverting the cliché of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror film". Whedon stated [...] "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" [...] was the first incarnation of Buffy in his head, [...] "the idea of a seemingly insignificant female who in fact turns out to be extraordinary." [...] When asked how he came up with the name of [...] "Buffy," [...] Whedon states [...] "It was the name that I could think of that I could take the least seriously. There is no way <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> name Buffy and think, [...] "This is an important person. To juxtapose that with Vampire Slayer, just felt like that kind of thinga B movie. But a B movie that had something more going on. That was my dream." [...] Whedon claims the title was criticized for being too silly, and the television network begged him to change it. He refused, insisting [...] "You don't understand. It has to be this. This is what it is." [...] Jason Middleton feels that Buffy avoids the [...] "final girl" [...] character trope seen in horror films, where the androgynous and celibate heroine gets to outlive her friends and exact revenge on their killer; in Middleton's words, [...] "she... gets to have sex with boys and still kill the monster".|$|E
2500|$|Jones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. His first record, the self-penned [...] "No Money in This Deal", was {{recorded}} on January 19, and appeared in February on Starday Records, beginning the singer's association with producer and mentor H.W. [...] "Pappy" [...] Daily. The song was actually cut in Starday Records' co-founder Jack Starnes' {{living room and}} produced by Starnes. Jones also worked at KTRM (now KZZB) in Beaumont around this time. [...] Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones acquired the nickname [...] "possum" [...] while working there: [...] "One of the deejays there, Slim Watts, took to calling him George P. Willicker Picklepuss Possum Jones. [...] For one thing, he cut his hair short, like a possum's belly. [...] He had a possum's nose and stupid eyes, like a possum." [...] During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. [...] In later years, Jones would have little good {{to say about the}} music production at Starday, recalling to NPR in 1996 that [...] "it was a terrible sound. [...] We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont. [...] <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> trucks. [...] We had to stop a lot of times because it wasn't soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and we'd have to start over again." [...] Jones' first hit came with [...] "Why Baby Why" [...] in 1955. [...] That same year, while touring as a cast member of the Louisiana Hayride, Jones met and played shows with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. [...] "I didn't get to know him that well," [...] Jones said of Presley to Nick Tosches in 1994. [...] "He stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room. [...] Nobody seemed to get around him much any length of time to talk to him." [...] Jones would, however, remain a lifelong friend of Johnny Cash. [...] Jones was invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry in 1956.|$|E
