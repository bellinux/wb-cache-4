25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So if <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E
500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about the moment <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually supposed to be a way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain. A bit exaggerated but that's what it feels like when you're so into someone".|$|E

[...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely hope that you will take the time to talk to me personally next time before <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters.

500|$|In September, the Gold Democrats met in {{convention}} in Indianapolis. [...] Loyal to Cleveland, {{they wanted to}} nominate him. [...] However, the President ruled this out; his Cabinet members also refused to run. [...] Not even supporters thought the Gold Democrats would win; {{the purpose was to}} have a candidate who would speak for the gold element in the party, and who would divide the vote and defeat Bryan. [...] Illinois Senator John M. Palmer was eager to be the presidential candidate, and the convention nominated him with Kentucky's Simon Bolivar Buckner as his running mate. [...] Palmer was a 79-year-old former Union general, Buckner a 73-year-old former Confederate of that rank; the ticket was the oldest in combined age in American history, and Palmer the second-oldest presidential candidate (behind Peter Cooper of the Greenback Party; Bryan was the youngest). [...] The Gold Democrats received quiet financial support from Hanna and the Republicans. Palmer proved an able campaigner who visited most major cities in the East, and in the final week of his campaign, told listeners, [...] "I will not count it any great fault if next Tuesday <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> cast your ballots for William McKinley." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Lo {{summarised}} the storyline of the EP; [...] "The song 'Love Ballad' {{is about}} the moment <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". The EP's main genres are pop, electropop and indie pop.

It was described as a [...] "parody of love songs" [...] that talks about the [...] "carefree beginnings of a new romance". Lo also called it a [...] "way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him". In the standard edition, the EP opens with [...] "Not on Drugs", a pop, dance and electropop song in which the artist compares falling in love to being under the influence of drugs. Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner.

500|$|Real estate magnate Donald Trump, head of The Trump Organization since 1971, first {{dabbled in}} presidential {{politics}} in the early summer of 1987. [...] Republican political organizer Mike Dunbar, unimpressed with the candidates for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, founded the [...] "Draft Trump for President" [...] organization. [...] Believing Trump had {{the makings of a}} president, Dunbar pitched Trump the idea of speaking at an event for Republican candidates in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. [...] According to Dunbar in a later interview, Trump was receptive to this idea. [...] Then a registered Democrat, Trump officially changed his registration to Republican in July 1987. [...] Speculation that he would actually run for president intensified two months later, when he purchased $94,801 worth of full-page advertisements in The New York Times, Boston Globe, and The Washington Post with the heading [...] "There’s nothing wrong with America’s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can’t cure." [...] The advertisements reflected Trump's concerns that Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait were taking advantage of American money and protection without providing any benefit to the United States. [...] The next month, as Dunbar had proposed, Trump appeared at a Rotary Club luncheon in New Hampshire. [...] There, he delivered what The New York Times described as an [...] "impassioned speech," [...] in which he expressed concern about the United States being [...] "pushed around" [...] by its allies and proposed that [...] "these countries that are ripping us off pay off the $200 billion deficit." [...] In the audience, college students held placards reading [...] "Trump for President." [...] Nevertheless, Trump proclaimed, [...] "I'm not here because I'm running for President. I'm here because I'm tired of our country being kicked around and I want to get my ideas across." [...] Later, Trump appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. [...] After the appearance, he received a letter from former President Richard Nixon in which Nixon explained that his wife Pat, [...] "an expert on politics," [...] had seen Trump on the show and [...] "predicts that whenever <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> run for office you will be a winner!" [...] In November 1987, Trump released , which became a New York Times bestseller.|$|E

2500|$|Grandmaster (GM) John Nunn adds a caveat: when {{in a bad}} position, {{one must}} decide between two strategies, which he calls [...] "grim [...] " [...] and [...] "create confusion."
