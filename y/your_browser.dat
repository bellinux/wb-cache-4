25|$|The {{following}} {{table is}} a breakdown of each letter in the Hebrew alphabet, describing its name or names, and its Latin script transliteration values used in academic work. If two glyphs are shown for a consonant, then the left-most glyph is the final form of the letter (or right-most glyph if <b>your</b> <b>browser</b> doesn't support right-to-left text layout). The conventions here are ISO 259, the UNGEGN system based on the old-fashioned Hebrew Academy system, and the modern common informal Israeli transcription. In addition, an International Phonetic Alphabet pronunciation is indicatedhistorical (Tiberian vocalization) for ISO 259, prescribed for Hebrew Academy, and in practice for Israeli. For the vowels further down, the letters ח and ט are used as symbolic anchors for vowel symbols, but should otherwise be ignored.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Chisling of AllMusic {{described}} the song as [...] "a powerhouse of dance waves and infectiously produced beats". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{called it a}} [...] "beguilingly compulsive tale of pulling a drug-induced whitey, {{with a combination of}} clipped marching beats, sawing electronics and mild R flavor that bears a vague resemblance to Nelly Furtado's 'Maneater'". Ben Norman of About.com said that the song [...] "opens the album like a valkyrie leading the charge [...] riding triumphant ahead of her army. If you don't know this song, use <b>your</b> <b>browser.</b> I won't waste time explaining what it sounds like." [...] However he also noted that the song is not groundbreaking and compared it to the music of Rihanna, Chris Brown and The Pussycat Dolls. Bill Lamb from About.com called the song tame but catchy enough for Gaga to be noticed by mainstream. He also added that [...] "'Just Dance' has strong energy and features Lady GaGa's striking voice, but it ultimately adds up to rather bland dance-pop." [...] O'Donis' smooth vocals were also complimented.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{clerical}} errors led to {{doubling of}} 100% identical characters such as 﨣 (U+FA23) and 𧺯 (U+27EAF). If your default font has glyphs encoded to both points {{so that one}} font is used for both, they should appear 100% identical. These cases are listed as z-variants (despite having no variance at all). Intentionally duplicated characters were added to facilitate bit-for-bit round-trip conversion. Because round-trip conversion was an early selling point of Unicode, this meant that if a national standard in use unnecessarily duplicated a character, Unicode {{had to do the}} same. Unicode calls these intentional duplications [...] "compatibility variants" [...] as with 漢. U+FA9A calls U+6F22 its compatibility variant. As long as <b>your</b> <b>browser</b> uses the same font for both, they should appear 100% identical. Sometimes, {{as in the case of}} 車 with U+8ECA and U+F902, the added compatibility character lists the already present version of 車 as both its compatibility variant and its z-variant. The compatibility variant field overrides the z-variant field, forcing normalization under all forms, including canonical equivalence. Despite the name, compatibility variants are actually canonically equivalent and are united in any Unicode normalization scheme and not only under compatibility normalization. This is similar to how the Angstrom symbol is canonically equivalent to a pre-composed Capital Latin Letter A with Ring Above (Å). Much software (like the wikipedia editing software, for example,) will replace all canonically equivalent characters that are discouraged (the Angstrom symbol) with the recommended equivalent (Capital Latin Letter A with Ring Above [...] ). Despite the name, CJK [...] "compatibility variants" [...] are canonically equivalent characters and not compatibility characters.|$|E
