60|$|But let us {{look back}} a little, and {{consider}} certain strange and impressive facts. The Hundred Years' War began in 1337.

But she rose and struggled on, <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>year,</b> and at last again she went down under another devastating blow--Poitiers. She gathered her crippled strength once more, and the war raged on, and on, and still on, <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>year,</b> decade <b>after</b> decade. Children were born, grew up, married, died--the war raged on; their children in turn grew up, married, died--the war raged on; their children, growing, saw France struck down again; this time under the incredible disaster of Agincourt--and still the war raged on, <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>year,</b> and in time these children married in their turn.|$|R
