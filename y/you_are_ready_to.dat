2500|$|In January 1896 Hearst {{dispatched}} Bierce to Washington, D.C. to foil this attempt. The {{essence of}} the plot was secrecy; the railroads' advocates hoped to get the bill through Congress without any public notice or hearings. When the angered Huntington confronted Bierce {{on the steps of}} the Capitol and told Bierce to name his price, Bierce's answer ended up in newspapers nationwide: [...] "My price is one hundred thirty million dollars. If, when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> pay, I happen to be out of town, you may hand it over to my friend, the Treasurer of the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the video}} Voris {{admitted}} {{it may have}} been a mistake on his part not to have brought this information to the public earlier, but that he did not feel it necessary to provide all the details in order to proclaim the Gospel. [...] "I did not do it to deceive, but because I did not understand the necessity. Now, I do," [...] he said. At the end of the video, he says, [...] "We will never cease to declare these truths, the glories of the Catholic faith, regardless of what happens. If this is all threatened because of revelations of my past sins, then please pray that the will of God be done. Thank you for your prayers, your support and your understanding, as well as the measure of forgiveness <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> extend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well; I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{come quickly}} to business, because it's always best. Won't {{you come and}} sit down here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I desire nothing,' {{returned}} the old man, 'that is unreasonable. Such a request would <b>be.</b> Will <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> return {{at the end}} of this week?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{neither do}} I; but I know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> kick the trough over {{for them when}} the old man wanted us to bounce Lindau that time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] she cried. [...] "Please don't think so. It {{has given}} me a sense of--of security. That <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> help me if--if I needed you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've tracked 'em to a finish," [...] {{announced}} Boxer. [...] "Don't go any further, cap'n--unless <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> do some tall shooting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> worship him who has condescended to {{step down}} from his high {{pedestal}} and worship you. Is it not so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> sail, we'll start {{without further}} delay," [...] {{interrupted}} Anderson Rover, {{and gave the}} necessary orders to Captain Barforth.|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Rollo. [...] "Now, Henry, <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> clap {{your thumb}} over the hole, {{as soon as}} I take the flower away, or else he'll come out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> meet the danger, reverend sir; but I would fain know of what nature it was, and from whence {{it was to be}} apprehended?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Papa, don't swear. You {{know you}} must do it. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> pay two hundred pounds for him if this {{marriage}} came off. Half that will start him to Carrara." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Silence, I say!" [...] stormed Josiah Crabtree. [...] "I'll warrant you'll {{not feel}} so smart {{by the time}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave Putnam Hall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Mr. Worthington, slowly, [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> sell out." [...] He {{found it}} a little {{difficult}} to control his voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Unless <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{prescribe}} only {{laughing and}} good Jersey cows' milk," [...] said Bernard, pulling the long silky brown hair. [...] "Where's mother, little one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking foolishly," [...] Hardy cried, angrily. [...] "If I didn't {{know you}} two fellows {{as well as}} I do, I'd say <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make friends with the oppressors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is your {{appointment}} to the command," [...] {{he said with a}} certain gravity. [...] "An official appointment binding the owners to conditions which you have accepted. Now--when will <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> untrue. I did wrong, but <b>you</b> <b>were</b> yourself, as much so then as now. But do be seated. Here {{we stand}} as though <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> run away at {{first sign of}} another outbreak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Touching those signals, little citizen," [...] said Madame Defarge, sternly, [...] "that {{she made}} to the prisoners; <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> bear witness to them this very day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well,--I suppose it's simple enough," [...] {{continued}} Lopez. [...] "Mr. Wharton, I believe I {{am right}} {{in saying that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> pay the money at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look exactly}} {{like some of}} the old {{engravings}} of Mohawk princesses," [...] cried Curtis. [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> sit by my side and review the procession." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{fastened}} the tow-rope to {{the rear}} axle of his car, {{to the front of}} hers. [...] "Now will <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> put on all your power as I begin to pull?" [...] he said casually, rather respectfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Ruby answered, as {{she pressed}} my hand gently. [...] "It shall <b>be</b> settled on <b>you,</b> since I know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{give it up}} for my sake. And there shall be no more Aikin-Paynes {{henceforth}} and for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Jim, <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{cut and run}} if {{he should}} waken before I 'ave 'im fast. Don't mind me; I'll look arter myself. An' wotever you do, don't holler for the bobbies. Mind that, else I'll {{strangle}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{promised to}} show you the works," [...] he said to Raut, and put his big, clumsy hand on his friend's shoulder. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay! I know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{go through}} thick and thin, {{and that is}} why I give my consent and approbation. You are not to be stopped for nonsense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that I rather give myself away when I explain," [...] said he. [...] "Results without causes are much more impressive. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> come to Birmingham, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "La! my dear sir," [...] a lazy, {{pleasant}} voice riposted, [...] "what {{else could}} I do? There {{was no time}} for explanations. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> half-crazed, and would not have understood. And <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> bring all the nightwatchmen about our ears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{know him}} by sight,' said Mrs Brown, whose working mouth and nodding head stopped for the moment, in the fixedness of her attention. 'We saw him pass this morning, afore {{he got off}} his horse; when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> take it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am off, Lucy," [...] he said, {{taking her}} two hands in his, and gazing tenderly {{down into her}} face; [...] "I won't ask you {{to come with me}} now, but will <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> come when I am here again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lane {{struck a}} match, and {{stretched}} his legs along the window-seat, though {{he closed the}} case with a snap. [...] "Why, certainly! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> redeem the mortgage on Gaspard's Trail?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As long as {{you hold}} me, all your wishes will come true,' it said. 'But hide me in your turban, and then call to the ogre that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> come up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{spoke to}} you this morning, and now it seems that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> forsake your father and your mother and to follow him across the world, you wicked and ungrateful child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose they'll {{have to come}} too," [...] he sighed, [...] "though {{no doubt}} they'll chase poor Mr. Riley clean off the premises. But I can live without him, and I can't without you. How soon can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> marry me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will save}} <b>you.</b> <b>Be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> act--to-night." [...] The {{softened}} look and altered tone opened {{the eyes of}} the captive. Although the blanket partially concealed Adolay's face, Cheenbuk at once recognised the girl whose mother he had saved the previous spring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those {{days were}} very different," [...] Mr. Bows answered; [...] "and Mr. Arthur Pendennis was an honest, impetuous young fellow then; rather selfish and conceited, perhaps, but honest. He liked you then, because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> ruin {{yourself}} for a woman." ...|$|R
