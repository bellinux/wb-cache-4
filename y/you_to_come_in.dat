25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E
500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason we asked <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you {{this will be a}} great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, Mrs. Stone!' said Selina, rising slowly. 'How kind of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in.</b> You'll bide to supper? Mother {{has told}} you the strange news, of course?' ...|$|E
5000|$|McDivitt: Okay. ... (to White): ... They want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>in</b> now.|$|R
6000|$|The king, perceiving the Earl of Bothwell {{among the}} armed barons, {{to whom he}} {{surrendered}} his person addressed him in these prophetic words:-- [...] "Francis, Francis, what moved <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> arms against thy prince, who never wronged thee? I wish thee a more quiet spirit, else I foresee thy destruction."--Spottiswoode, p. 343.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is, {{provided}} <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> Sam. Dad doesn't want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give up {{your idea}} of becoming a lawyer unless you want to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, there is," [...] pleaded Mrs. Vervain, laying {{her hand}} on his arm. [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and dine with us. We dine early." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wasn't here, and I didn't know. But now I'm back I'd give {{everything}} I {{have for}} the right of telling <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> out of the rain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} tell you, by my aunt, {{in answer to}} your message--if you had waited for an answer--that it was {{unnecessary}} for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> that hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> for?" [...] he asked, feeling {{fairly certain}} that Flapp's mission {{could not be}} as upright and honest as desired.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you want}} here?" [...] said the rector, a little irritably. [...] "Didn't I tell <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> again till I rang for you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'E said <b>you</b> was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> if <b>you</b> came," [...] she said, and {{regarded}} me, making no motion {{to show me}} anywhere. And then, confidentially, [...] "'E's locked in, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't here, and I didn't know. But now I'm back I'd give {{everything}} I {{have for}} the right of telling <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> out of the rain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There an't," [...] growled {{the man on}} the floor, {{whose head}} rested on his hand as he stared at us, [...] "any more on <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> is there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{perhaps one}} of these days he will have one and will wait for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> for your dinner," [...] {{suggested}} Blacky. [...] "He could hide behind these bushes, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then here we are,--and now {{you must}} go. Jane can carry my hand-bag and cloak. If <b>you</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the evening at ten {{it will be}} an {{additional}} favour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Victor, <b>you</b> are not <b>to</b> {{say such}} things. Bertha {{is not a}} fool, {{and she is not}} in the least fat. <b>You</b> are <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and choose a doll for her.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said John Griffith, [...] "it's a fine day, and {{the crops}} {{are doing well}} enough. Would <b>you</b> like <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and see the missus? She'll take it civil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, it's Abercrombie Smith," [...] said Bellingham, {{glancing up}} at him. [...] "How very good of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in!</b> What a fool I am! Oh, my God, what a fool I am!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good afternoon, Miss Champneyes!" [...] he said, {{holding out}} his hand. [...] "It was very good of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and visit the Comtesse. She is always so glad indeed to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is a very}} {{hard-working}} girl, and as she {{has been}} lying helpless for several weeks, would it not appear unkind if you made her the one exception? I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> with me now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonder what he's got to say," [...] remarked Fred, and then, {{as he saw}} {{his cousin}} {{lingering}} at the doorway, he added: [...] "Don't <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> Martha, and join us?" ...|$|R
5000|$|My {{thanks to}} everyone, and <b>to</b> <b>you</b> who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> glory <b>in</b> the “Cross.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even {{that would}} excite him, my dear. I will {{tell him that}} <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and see him; but that I think you had better not do so, {{for a day or}} two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall {{we see you}} {{tomorrow}} to dinner?" [...] said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was leaving them. [...] "I do not ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I found I couldn't do it--that is, if I {{wanted to}} keep {{anything}} for myself. I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> {{and as soon as}} I hear you're ready to give it your attention, I'll lay a proposition before you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How be you, Mr. Worthington?" [...] said Ephraim; [...] "this {{is a kind}} of a surprise, hain't it?" [...] Ephraim {{was getting}} used to surprises. [...] "Well, it is good-natured of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and shake hands with an old soldier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Now, Victor, <b>you</b> are <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> {{and buy a}} nice doll {{for your}} cousin Bertha. She gave you a {{beautiful}} box of soldiers on your birthday, and you must give her a present on hers.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What are {{you doing}} there, {{knocking}} all the plaster down?" [...] she demanded, sharply. [...] "If <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> why can't <b>you</b> ring the bell? Standing there with your hat on as though the place belonged to you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll trust you, for {{you have}} the right kind of eyes. You are {{following}} Allen for a purpose, but that's none of my affair. When you go just forget all about this place, unless <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> some time and try a hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} are. I 'read after you,' {{as they say}} out here. In fact, I've got a little 'farm,' and take a shy at {{breeding}} the beasts myself. I'd like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> {{and give me a}} hint or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stokes winked. [...] "On account o' the {{surprising}} likeness," [...] he said, smiling. [...] "It is surprising, ain't it?

6000|$|... "Yes, dear; but don't {{get into}} mischief, or worry Tabby, or pick the flowers. Of course you wouldn't touch green fruit, or climb trees, or soil your little frock. I'll {{ring the bell}} for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and be dressed for tea when it is time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, [...] "I will fetch Madame Michaud in. It will be nice for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here <b>in</b> the evening sometimes, {{and it would}} be better for her <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do so than for me. These French people have such funny ideas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't," [...] she retorted. [...] "I {{never heard}} such nonsense! As if I could allow <b>you</b> <b>to</b> use the private door {{of this house}} just as it suits your fancy. If <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> to-night and say good-bye, you must <b>come</b> <b>in</b> by the front door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} <b>you</b> had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> search of me, Geoffrey," [...] she said; [...] "this is Mr. Lorimer--Captain Ormond. I {{think you have}} met before. I lost my way, and he kindly brought me across the moor. I have been telling him about Canada." ...|$|R
