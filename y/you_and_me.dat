Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, who also co-starred in Kaminey in 2009, portray three couples {{from three different}} eras. In 1910 Sargodha, they are two star-crossed lovers during the British Raj; in 1960 Mumbai, a popular Bollywood actress and a struggling musician; and in 2012 London, two university students.|$|E

25|$|Aquino had {{her share}} of box office bombs. Her 2003 movie with actor Robin Padilla, <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> Against the World, was an {{outright}} box office flop. Made for P25,000,000 and released immediately after Aquino won acting awards for her performance in 2002's Mano Po, <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> Against the World made only P4,389,005. The film's producers lost an estimated P23,000,000, even accounting for home videos. Because <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> Against the World failed to attract an audience, several movie theaters pulled the film {{and replaced it with}} another film. Some theaters reportedly did this on the movie's second day of play.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{continue}} {{to write in}} the same style that had characterized his European compositions, Weill made a study of American popular and stage music. His American output—though held {{by some to be}} inferior—nonetheless contains individual songs and entire shows that not only became highly respected and admired, but have been seen as seminal works {{in the development of the}} American musical. In 1939 he wrote the music for Railroads on Parade, a musical spectacular put on at the 1939 World's Fair in New York to celebrate the American railroad industry (book by Edward Hungerford). Unique among Broadway composers of the time, Weill insisted on writing his own orchestrations (with some very few exceptions, such as the dance music in Street Scene). He worked with writers such as Maxwell Anderson and Ira Gershwin, and wrote a film score for Fritz Lang (<b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me,</b> 1938). Weill himself strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be both commercially and artistically successful. The most interesting attempt in this direction is Street Scene, based on a play by Elmer Rice, with lyrics by Langston Hughes. For his work on Street Scene Weill was awarded the inaugural Tony Award for Best Original Score.|$|E
500|$|Jarrow {{incorporated}} musical themes from The Road to Freedom, a 1986 pop {{album with}} lyrics by Hubbard and performances by John Travolta, Leif Garrett, Frank Stallone, Chick Corea, and Karen Black. [...] Jarrow also incorporated musical themes from 1980s pop, saying [...] "the liturgical music of Scientology is 1980s pop, which seems strangely appropriate {{because of the}} science fiction books. So that's what we did [...] It's a pastiche of synth-pop and pageant choir music." [...] Jarrow said he tried [...] "to capture the feel of kiddie rock" [...] such as Free to Be… <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> and Kids Incorporated.|$|E
500|$|Delphine {{does not}} visit Goriot as he lies on his deathbed, and Anastasie arrives too late, only once {{he has lost}} consciousness. Before dying, Goriot rages about their disrespect toward him. His funeral is {{attended}} only by Rastignac, a servant named Christophe, and two paid mourners. Goriot's daughters, rather than being present at the funeral, send their empty coaches, each bearing their families' respective coat of arms. After the short ceremony, Rastignac turns to face Paris as the lights of evening begin to appear. He sets out to dine with Delphine de Nucingen and declares to the city: [...] "À nous deux, maintenant!" [...] ("It's between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> now!") ...|$|E

500|$|By the mid 1970s, Hershey concluded, [...] "I've been so {{tied up with}} David [...] {{that people}} have {{forgotten}} that I am me. I spend 50 percent of my time working with David." [...] She had, in 1974, guest-starred in a two-part episode of Carradine's television series Kung Fu. She played, {{under the direction of}} Carradine, a love interest to his character, Kwai Chang Caine, during his time at the Shaolin temple. She also appeared in two of Carradine's independent directorial projects, <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> (1975) and Americana (1983), both of which had been filmed in 1973. Her father, Arnold Herzstein, also appeared in Americana.|$|E
500|$|Carradine {{made his}} directorial debut on three episodes of Kung Fu. [...] While still {{performing}} on Kung Fu, he tried {{his hand at}} directing some independent films of his own. Americana (1983), took ten years to complete due to difficulty in financing. It featured Carradine in the starring role {{and several of his}} friends and family members in supporting roles. The film won the People's Choice Award at the Director's Fortnight at Cannes, but failed to achieve critical support or adequate distribution. Other directorial attempts included <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> (1975), and two unreleased productions: Mata Hari, an epic that starred his daughter, Calista; and a short musical called A Country Mile.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty things about you, they must be communists. Therefore they threaten both <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> Don't you think we should silence these communists from speaking?" ...|$|E

500|$|Stanley's {{achievements}} in office were mixed. He established various specialist departments to manage output in numerous industries and reorganised {{the structure of}} the Board. However, despite previous successes with unions, his negotiations were ineffective. Writing to Leader of the House of Commons and future Prime Minister Bonar Law in January 1919, Lloyd George described Stanley as having [...] "all the glibness of Runciman and that is apt to take in innocent persons like <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me...</b> Stanley, to put it quite bluntly, is a funk, and {{there is no room for}} funks in the modern world." [...] Stanley left the Board of Trade and the government in May 1919 and returned to the UERL.|$|E
500|$|Disappointed by {{the lack}} of {{progress}} on the film's production, aspiring screenwriter/comic book fan Alex Ford was able to have a script of his (titled Superman: The Man of Steel) accepted at the studio's offices in September 1998. Ford pitched his idea for a film series consisting of seven installments, and his approach impressed Warner Bros. and Peters, though he was later given a farewell due to creative differences. Ford said, [...] "I can tell you they don't know much about comics. Their audience isn't <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> who pay $7.00. It's for the parents who spend $60 on toys and lunchboxes. It is a business, and what's more important, the $150 million at the box office or the $600 million in merchandising?" ...|$|E
500|$|Against the Washington Senators on August 12, 1896, Lajoie {{made his}} major league debut. He played first base and {{recorded}} a single. Ed Delahanty was being considered {{to play the}} first base position after Dan Brouthers retired. Delahanty, however, wanted Lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field. Delahanty said to Lajoie, [...] "Look, sonny, you tell the boss you’re a first baseman and <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> are gonna get along." [...] Lajoie became the team's first baseman {{and by the end}} of the season, he and Delahanty were roommates. Later in 1898, new manager George Stallings moved Lajoie to second base, commenting that [...] " [...] have made good no matter where I positioned him." ...|$|E

500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the novel. On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I really have no strong views. I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people like <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> {{but if you have a}} nice dagger in mind please let us use it. The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lighters" [...] {{is mainly}} an {{alternative}} hip hop track. [...] It {{has also been}} described as a blend of rap/hip-hop and pop, further incorporating parts of a synth ballad. The record differs from the hardcore hip hop style used in other songs by Bad Meets Evil in the EP, as it takes influences from synthpop ballad and soul music, mainly on the track's chorus. The song opens with piano chords while Mars sings with his [...] "warm" [...] and [...] "pleasing" [...] vocals in a tenor tone on top of a pop and soul chorus, [...] "This one's for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> living out our dreams". The singer finishes his verse saying, [...] "All I want to see is a sky full of lighters". Afterwards, the bass drops along with synth chords and Eminem starts to rap with his [...] "crescendos build up to fist-pumping levels", [...] being followed by Royce.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Gunn {{revealed}} that Tyler Bates would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write {{some of the}} score first {{so that he can}} film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film. In February 2014, Gunn {{revealed that}} the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as [...] "Hooked on a Feeling", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost. In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [...] is a real person from planet Earth who’s just like <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> Except that he’s in this big outer space adventure." ...|$|E
