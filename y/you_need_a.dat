25|$|The {{reason of}} the {{interest}} for Diophantine equations, in the elliptic curve case, is that K may not be algebraically closed. There can exist curves C that have no point defined over K, and which become isomorphic over a larger field to E, which by definition has a point over K to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish C that have genus 1, from elliptic curves E that have a K-point (or, in other words, provide a Diophantine equation that has a solution in K). The curves C {{turn out to be}} torsors over E, and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that K is a number field (the theory of the Selmer group). In fact a typical plane cubic curve C over Q has no particular reason to have a rational point; the standard Weierstrass model always does, namely the point at infinity, but <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> point over K to put C into that form over K.|$|E

500|$|... "Anytime <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> Friend" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics, {{many of whom}} praised the song's gospel influence as well as Carey's vocal range. Following the mixed reception to the song's parent album, Music Box, [...] "Anytime <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> Friend" [...] was deemed a strong contrast to the album's pop influence. Critics agreed that through lowering Carey's vocal bombast, the album suffered due to lowered passion and energy levels. The song however, was considered the only standout from the album, altering heavily from the pop oriented formula of Music Box. J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun wrote [...] "Where another singer might have been tempted to turn [...] "Anytime <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> Friend" [...] into a full-blown sanctified sing-out, Carey and producer Walter Afanasieff use the gospel harmonies on the chorus as contrast for Carey's pop soul vocal." [...] A writer from Portland Press Herald called the song one of Carey's [...] "original classics", and felt it earned a place on her compilation album #1's, even though it did not top the Billboard Hot 100. In an article from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, a writer commented that Carey's vocal range in the song sounds as if it's from a [...] "glass-shattering dimension" [...] and complimented her incorporation of the gospel genre and church choir into the song's climax. Christopher John Farley from Time described the song as [...] "gospel flavored" [...] and wrote [...] "'Anytime <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> Friend' demonstrates Carey's vocal power, although too fleetingly." [...] While calling it [...] "undeniably strong", David Browne from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a mixed review, writing [...] "'Anytime <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> Friend' feature gospel-inflected choirs seemingly intended to demonstrate that Carey has soul — which she doesn't — but they're beautifully arranged, and they serve as a nice counterpoint to Carey's own lapses into show-offy vocal gymnastics." [...] Suraya Attas from The Straits Times described Carey's voice as husky, and felt it [...] "exploited her vocal range to the fullest." [...] In 2003, The Daily Record named [...] "Anytime <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> Friend" [...] one of the [...] "World's Greatest First Dance Songs." [...] USA Today critic John T. Jones called the song [...] "inspirational", while a writer from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution branded it [...] "the center of the album."

[...] Although Dead Man's Chest was written to propel the trilogy's plot, Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea.
