He was very fond of her, and worried when she participated in sports or was late returning for tea.|$|E
500|$|Spacey {{summed up}} Underwood's {{relationship}} with the viewer - i.e. whenever he breaks the fourth wall - as being {{like that of a}} [...] "best friend" [...] and [...] "the person [...] more than anyone." [...] Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions - typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten you? Perhaps you hoped I had." [...] In addition, in season 3, after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him, a seething Frank vents his anger by lashing out at the viewer; looking directly into the camera, he snaps [...] "What're you lookin' at?!" ...|$|E

[...] Epstein replied with, [...] "We just popped in to say hello. I enjoyed your performance." [...] He introduced Taylor, who merely nodded a greeting, said, [...] "Well done, then, goodbye", and left. Epstein and Taylor went to Peacock's restaurant in Hackins Hey for lunch, and during the meal Epstein asked Taylor what he thought about the group. Taylor replied that he honestly thought they were [...] "absolutely awful", but there was something [...] "remarkable" [...] about them. Epstein sat there smiling {{for a long time before}} exclaiming, [...] "I think they're tremendous!" [...] Later, when Epstein was paying the bill, he grabbed Taylor's arm and said, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should manage them?" ...|$|E

He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am, crazy?

Noisey's Daisy Jones interpreted the words as a reference to Australian singer Sia's 2013 single [...] "Elastic Heart", {{who served as the}} executive producer of Daddy Issues. The song continues with the lyrics: [...] "Living for the days, living for the nights, living for the chance to give what's right, now tell me who the hell <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am." [...] During the song's hook, Candy sings [...] "Why do all the good girls have to die/ Living in a bad girl's paradise"; Yasmeen Gharnit wrote that the section discusses how women must discard their innocence to achieve independence. Other parts include: [...] "Go buy a life that's fantastic cause all you are is your assets” and [...] "You can't buy love without passion / So please don't do nothing drastic".|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Sellers portrayed an Indian doctor, Dr Ahmed el Kabir in Anthony Asquith's {{romantic comedy}} The Millionairess, a film {{based on a}} George Bernard Shaw play of the same name. Sellers was not {{interested}} in accepting the role until he learned that Sophia Loren was to be his co-star. When asked about Loren, he explained to reporters [...] "I don't normally act with romantic, glamorous women... she's a lot different from Harry Secombe." [...] Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming, culminating in Sellers declaring his love for her in front of his wife. Sellers also woke his son at night to ask: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should divorce your mummy?" [...] Roger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions, that [...] "he'd play a role as an Indian doctor, and for the next six months, he'd be an Indian in his real [...] life." [...] The film inspired the George Martin-produced novelty hit single [...] "Goodness Gracious Me", with Sellers and Loren, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart in November 1960. A follow-up single by the duo, Bangers and Mash, reached number 22 in the UK chart. The songs were included on an album released by the couple, Peter & Sophia, which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart.|$|E

[...] Oliver St. John Gogarty, in his literary memoir As I Was Going Down Sackville Street, considers [...] the Pillar [...] "the grandest thing we have in Dublin", where [...] "the statue in whiter stone gazed forever south towards Trafalgar and the Nile". [...] That Pillar, says Gogarty, [...] "marks {{the end of a}} civilization, the culmination of the great [...] period of eighteenth century Dublin". [...] Yeats's 1927 poem [...] "The Three Monuments" [...] has Parnell, Nelson and O'Connell [...] on their respective monuments, mocking Ireland's post-independence leaders for their rigid morality and lack of courage, the obverse of the qualities of the [...] "three old rascals".A later writer, Brendan Behan, in his Confessions of an Irish Rebel (1965) wrote from a Fenian perspective that Ireland owed Nelson nothing and that Dublin's poor regarded the Pillar as [...] "a gibe at their own helplessness in their own country". In his poem [...] "Dublin" [...] (1939), written as the remaining vestiges of British overlordship were being removed from Ireland, Louis MacNeice envisages [...] "Nelson on his pillar/ Watching his world collapse".Austin Clarke's 1957 poem [...] "Nelson's Pillar, Dublin" [...] scorns the various schemes to remove the monument and concludes [...] "Let him watch the sky/ With those who rule.

500|$|On May 1, 18 {{days after}} the episode's {{original}} airdate, a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza in New York City, on West 45 Street, on a side street near {{the location of the}} world headquarters of Viacom, Comedy Central's parent company. Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established. Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive [...] "the whole issue with 'South Park,' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for." [...] However, King stressed the theory was [...] "one possibility out of a hundred". Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident. Younus Abdullah Muhammed, who runs the group's website, was in Times Square at the time speaking out against President Barack Obama with a loudspeaker. But he said of the failed car bomb, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square? [...] It {{had nothing to do with}} the 'South Park' controversy. It was not an attack targeting Viacom." [...] NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of the theory, [...] "We certainly wouldn't rule that out." [...] However, media reports indicated Faisal Shahzad, the suspect arrested in connection with the attempted bombing, had trained for months prior to the first broadcast of [...] "200." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E

500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Peter Neal {{was making a}} short film {{documentary}} about the Experience, titled Experience (also known as See My Music Talking). [...] On December 19, 1967, he captured Hendrix playing an impromptu solo version of [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'". [...] The filming took place during a publicity photo session at the London studio of photographer Bruce Fleming, who had photographed the British album cover for Are You Experienced. [...] For the shoot, a twelve-string Zemaitis acoustic guitar restrung for a left-handed player was conveniently on hand. [...] Hendrix, seated on a stool against a white backdrop, sang while playing the guitar. [...] After a false start, he settles into the song, which biographer Keith Shadwick describes as [...] "100 percent country blues... s with great feeling, however artificial {{the circumstances of the}} session may have been". [...] Hendrix's acoustic guitar playing shows familiarity with the styles of Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, and Skip James. [...] Music writer Michael Fairchild compares some of his guitar techniques to those found in 1928 recordings by Tommy Johnson, such as [...] "Big Fat Mama" [...] and [...] "Big Road Blues". [...] The guitar was tuned down two whole steps (C–F–B–E–G–C), perhaps influenced by Lead Belly's twelve-string style. [...] At the end of the 3:05 performance, Hendrix laughs it off with [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could do that?" [...] In addition to the 1968 documentary, the [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'" [...] performance is included in the 1973 film Jimi Hendrix and accompanying soundtrack album (re-released on Blues). [...] In the UK, it was released by Reprise Records as a single in 1973 with the Experience's adaptation of B.B. King's [...] "Rock Me Baby" [...] recorded at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 as the B-side.|$|E
