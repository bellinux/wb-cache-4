25|$|It {{seemed clear}} {{all along that}} the Republican {{dominance}} would render this a no-contest and the Republicans were just waiting for all of their votes to be present, but the Federalists had one last defense. A marathon session of debate, lasting from 11 A.M. to 10 P.M., was {{the order of the}} day on December 2, 1803. Most notably, Uriah Tracy of Connecticut argued in a similar vein as Adams when he invoked the federative principle of the Constitution. For Tracy, the original two-vote system was formulated in order to give the small states a chance to elect the Vice President, who would be a check on the Presidentâ€™s powers. In essence, the states balanced the power of the people. However, this only works if <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> partisan, as Georgia (for example) was a Republican small state.|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen gave [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] a {{grade of}} A {{in his review}} for The A.V. Club. He called the opening {{sequence}} [...] "strong", and {{said that one of}} the [...] "tricks" [...] of this episode was that it does not break its own rules in finding a resolution. He summarized by saying [...] "Once again, TNG does what it does best: You take an ostensibly goofy idea, and then <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> sting by thinking through the consequences."

500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of The Motion Picture, {{executive}} producer Gene Roddenberry wrote his own sequel. In his plot, {{the crew of the}} Enterprise travel back in time to set right a corrupted time line after Klingons use the Guardian of Forever to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This was rejected by Paramount executives, who blamed the poor performance and large budget ($46million) of the first movie on its plodding pace and the constant rewrites Roddenberry demanded. [...] As a consequence, Roddenberry was removed from the production and, according to Shatner, [...] "kicked upstairs" [...] to the ceremonial position of executive consultant. Harve Bennett, a new Paramount television producer, was made producer for the next Star Trek film. [...] According to Bennett, he was called in front of a group including Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner and asked if he thought he could make a better film than The Motion Picture, which Bennett confessed he found [...] "really boring". When Bennett replied in the affirmative, Charles Bluhdorn asked, [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> for less than forty-five-fucking-million-dollars?" [...] Bennett replied that [...] "Where I come from, I can make five movies for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the work}} in Shaun of the Dead, blood and gore was {{prevalent}} throughout the film. Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: [...] "In many ways, the more extreme <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>it,</b> the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail." [...] The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the additional effects was that [...] "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [...] seemingly very trivial enhancements {{can make a difference}} when combined across a sequence." ...|$|E

500|$|On June 21, Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson, stating, [...] "He {{may have}} lived a {{sheltered}} life, but {{there really is}} no excuse for using terms like 'Jew me' and 'kike' in a pop song, unless <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> clear you are denouncing such terms, and do so in an artful way." [...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", they were silent on other racial slurs in the album. [...] The Notorious B.I.G. says [...] "nigga" [...] on [...] "This Time Around," [...] another song on the HIStory album, but it did not attract media attention, as well as, many years before, use in lyrics of word [...] "nigger" [...] by John Lennon.|$|E
500|$|... "Complicated" [...] {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song {{the highlight of}} the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her [...] "despair". Jon Parales of The New York Times described [...] "Complicated" [...] as being one of the more [...] "emotional" [...] songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> so hard to love you?/I hate it" [...] were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of men are not just present on [...] "Complicated", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing [...] "On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can expect her to be the same." [...] Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the [...] "spiraling dance-floor siren" [...] persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", was carried through onto [...] "Complicated". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man how hard he is to love, she sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Love. Angel. Music. Baby., Stefani decided to release a studio album {{containing}} a mixture of leftover tracks and newly recorded ones, titled The Sweet Escape (2006). The record featured Stefani rapping on several tracks, but also contained the dance-pop genre that was explored on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.. It yielded two more top ten singles, [...] "Wind it Up" [...] and [...] "The Sweet Escape", both released in 2006; the latter track became the singer's second single to reach number two on the Billboard Hot 100, following her collaboration [...] "Let Me Blow Ya Mind" [...] with Eve in 2001. Themes from the record include fashion, in addition to romantic situations and details of her career and personal life. Stefani took a hiatus from her solo career to continue work on a sixth studio album with No Doubt, Push and Shove, which was released in late 2012. A line of non-album singles was released following the aforementioned record, including [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Spark the Fire", both released in 2014.
