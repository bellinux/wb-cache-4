500|$|Otto Frank {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, [...] "It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed." [...] He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, [...] "he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally". Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the Nuremberg Trials, because [...] "people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like <b>your</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> so you could understand this." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} evidently worked, as Rinder {{wrote an}} [...] "Apology and Announcement" [...] on June 4, 2005 {{in which he}} told Miscavige, [...] "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology." [...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with <b>your</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can put up with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{third and}} final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a [...] "reaction against the more {{commercial}} sound of Benefactor. By this time, Carter {{had been replaced by}} veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. Instincts was released in October 1984, debuted at No.68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band's best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)," [...] which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No.35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band's most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band's promotional support while on a nationwide tour. [...] "The very next town we got to after they made that decision, there wasn't an A person there," [...] said Iyall. [...] " [...] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had been. All that just ground to a halt." [...] Iyall also revealed during that tour that she had signed with her own manager, David Rubinson, and would be leaving the band {{at the end of the}} tour. The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. [...] "You get tired of each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from <b>your</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> your friends." [...] According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall's weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: [...] "Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like 'Who's this fat chick?' They decided that was as far as it was going to get, and pulled their support." [...] Crawdaddy! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall declined to discuss the issue, but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter.|$|E

In an open letter, the senior Johnston {{addressed}} his son's kidnappers, {{telling them to}} [...] "please think about what this is doing to my family." [...] Again, he asked the kidnappers to [...] "please let my son go now, today." [...] Addressing his son, {{he said that the}} family [...] "wanted you to know how distressed and sorry we all are that you were taken," [...] adding that despite warnings from his son that being kidnapped was a possibility, [...] "when it came, it was still a considerable shock." [...] He ended the open letter by saying that [...] "all our heartfelt warmest fondest love is sent to you from all <b>your</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> in the fervent hope that you will be released unharmed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lind said of {{assuming}} the role, [...] "The audition for Bianca {{felt like an}} amusement park ride. It was such a thrill {{to go to an}} audition by plane rather than subway! I can only hope I do half of what [...] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it." [...] Regarding Bianca being the [...] "moral center of Pine Valley" [...] and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did feel pressure in the beginning. [...] "I did look at some of [...] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca." [...] Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me feels very strongly that [...] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone else’s interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting to support <b>your</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, [...] "I can feel the pressure, but I am going to let it go." [...] The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.|$|E
2500|$|San Miguel de Allende {{has long}} had a {{reputation}} as a haven for visual artists. Since the 1950s, when Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros worked there, it has attracted professional and amateur painters, sculptors and printmakers to the classes and workshops frequently held. In addition to two major art institutions (Instituto Allende and Bellas Artes), artists and art venues can be seen {{in various parts of the}} town. One notable art gallery is the Galería Manuel Chacon, which carries contemporary art. On the streets, it is not unusual to see someone sketching people on the street or selling their own work. Some notable ex-pat painters associated with San Miguel are Canadians Leonard Brooks, Toller Cranston, Marion Perlet, Gary Slipper, and Andrew Osta. More recently, the town has been attracting writers, film makers, and musicians as well. The town annually hosts an important free of charge film festival, the GIFF. One annual event that caters to the writing community is The Writers’ Conference which brings together authors, editors and literary agents. The 2009 event attracted names such as Erica Jong, Todd Gitlen and Josephine Humphreys. Writers have lived here since the mid 20th century. Beat poet Neal Cassady died on the railroad tracks just outside town. Other writers who have lived or spent time here include W.D. Snodgrass, Beverly Donofrio, Sandra Gulland, Tony Cohan, Joe Persico, Gary Jennings, Vance Packard, Lynette Seator, Richard Gabrio and Dianna Hutts. Some have written books about the town, such as Elisa Bernick who wrote The Family Sabbatical Handbook: The Budget Guide To Living Abroad With <b>Your</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> Rue who wrote [...] "My Favorite Second Chance" [...] (Book 2 of The Lake Effect Series). Another writing event is Poetry Week, which began in 1997. Barbara Faith, a well-known author of romance books lived in San Miguel with her husband Alfonso Covarrubias.|$|E
