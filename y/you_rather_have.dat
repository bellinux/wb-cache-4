500|$|Alex Beam (columnist, The Boston Globe) {{criticized the}} Essjay affair as {{being part of}} what he characterizes as the {{problems}} of [...] "crowdsourcing" [...] and the [...] "wisdom of crowds" [...] stating also that the crowd accepts authority unquestioningly: [...] "Who would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> write your encyclopedia entries? Bertrand Russell, T.H. Huxley, and Benedetto Croce, who wrote for the Britannica? Or ... EssJay?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{final act}} of the K Foundation was distributing a van load of Tennent's Super - a high-alcohol-content lager - to London's street {{drinkers}} on Christmas Day 1995. [...] However, the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near Waterloo station on the South Bank — was unusually devoid of homeless people, {{many of whom were}} in homeless shelters for the day. [...] "That was a pity", said Jimmy Cauty. [...] "If you are down-and-out, would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a bowl of soup or a can of Tennent's?" [...] The Sunday Times later called the scheme [...] "ethically dubious".|$|E
500|$|The {{canvassing}} {{is largely}} unsuccessful. [...] Most of {{the supporters of}} the park say {{they will not be}} able to attend the meeting. [...] Mark, April and Tom speak with one seemingly interested resident, who is implied to be a pedophile. [...] Leslie becomes frustrated with the lack of success and attempts to push poll the community residents. [...] She suggests phrasing the question, [...] "Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?" [...] Tom leaves the canvassing group to call prospective contractors about the park project, hinting at accepting bribes and making corrupt deals. [...] Several residents express a lack of support for the park. [...] Resident Kate Speevak (Lennon Parham) vows to attend the public meeting and voice her disapproval after a frustrated Leslie says, [...] "You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park". [...] The canvassing ends with an angry Leslie finding Mark and April playing Rock Band with Ann's boyfriend, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) at Ann's house.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{still you}} find it harder work than learning? <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> to master the dead {{language}} than the live tongues?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought,' said Winifred to her husband, 'that <b>you</b> would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> {{exchanged}} a Sunday when Albinia is {{better able to}} enjoy you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} Captain Challoner, whom I met only once; {{but it is}} obvious that he <b>has</b> talent. <b>You</b> would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> him a soldier?" ...|$|R
2500|$|After this trial, Edwards gained {{national}} attention as a plaintiff's lawyer. He filed {{at least twenty}} similar lawsuits {{in the years following}} and achieved verdicts and settlements of more than $60 million for his clients. Similar lawsuits followed across the country. When asked about an increase in Caesarean deliveries nationwide, perhaps to avoid similar medical malpractice lawsuits, Edwards said, [...] "The question is, would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> cases where that happens instead of having cases where you don't intervene and a child either becomes disabled for life or dies in utero?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Egad, captain, {{there you}} are a true sailor! Which would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> been, I say, William Shakespeare or Sir Francis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have,</b> Anita--a {{great many}} lumps of sugar, or a {{beautiful}} string of beads, {{or a little}} girl to play with?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} the reason--those other hands gettin' sick at Manila. But I can tell <b>you,</b> I'd <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a crew of Americans any day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me, how I have chattered!" [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I {{am afraid}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> looked at the things in peace and quiet. I did n't know I could talk so much. But somehow, I feel very happy; I feel as if I had improved." ...|$|R
50|$|Creational {{patterns}} {{are ones that}} create objects for <b>you,</b> <b>rather</b> than <b>having</b> <b>you</b> instantiate objects directly. This gives your program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now there <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> me. One {{of these}} bright little periodicals, you know, {{that you see}} popping to and fro on the bookstalls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have ordered}} coffee {{up in the}} little sitting-room again," [...] she said, a little shyly. [...] "Do you mind, or would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> it here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't bother about it, you know, if {{you mind}} very much," [...] Guy said. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> {{a game of}} billiards, or a swim in the lake?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, the spoons {{have slipped}} down somewhere; {{right under the}} other things. O yes, here's one, and only one. <b>You</b> would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> one than not, I suppose, Mr. Dewy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No--you {{would have}} run the risk the other way. <b>You</b> would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> risked her finding you with Cytherea as a second wife, than with me as a personator of herself--the first one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I {{am sorry}} {{you have this}} bustle, and so many to entertain, when I know <b>you</b> would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> the {{peaceful}} feelings belonging to the day undisturbed. I should like to shelter you up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About breakfast?" [...] he said. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> {{it in your}} room, or {{will you}} join us at our table d'hote? The force are most anxious to meet you." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{told him}} the name of our town. When we give a person information, I have always heard {{that we ought to}} make it complete. So I {{mentioned}} our address in the town. But I was troubled by a doubt. Perhaps he preferred the country. Being anxious about this, I said: [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> heard that I live in the country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn felt {{enormously}} {{conscious of}} Mrs. Zapp down below. He kept listening, {{as he led}} them up-stairs and lighted the gas. But Teddem so imitated Colonel Roosevelt, with two water-glasses for eye-glasses and a small hat-brush for mustache, that Mr. Wrenn was moved wrigglingly to exclaim: [...] "Say, I'm going out and get some beer. Or 'd <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> something else? Some cheese sandwiches? How about 'em?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Gibson also sang {{radio and}} TV commercials, {{including}} the famous [...] "Chiquita Banana," [...] "Hello, Bryers Calling," [...] "Winston Tastes Good," [...] "The Dodge Boys," [...] "Wouldn't <b>You</b> Really <b>Rather</b> <b>Have</b> a Buick?" [...] and [...] "Pepsodent Toothpaste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I've {{made up my}} mind we'll {{place one}} with you, Mr. Ditmar," [...] the {{salesman}} concluded. [...] "I don't object to telling <b>you</b> we'd <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> one in the Chippering than in any mill in New England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> {{your husband}} exposed to danger, {{when he leaves}} you?" [...] said Tito, smiling. [...] "If you don't mind my being poniarded or shot, why need I mind? I will give up the armour--shall I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit. I'd {{ask you to}} come in, but it's dreadful hot here, and {{not much}} room," [...] {{answered}} Becky, crimping round the pastry before she poured in the custard. [...] "I'm {{going to make a}} nice little pudding for you; your mother said you liked 'em; or would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> whipped cream with a mite of jelly in it?" [...] asked Becky, anxious to suit her new boarder.|$|E
6000|$|... "With the Queen of Spades, if your lordship pleases," [...] says Mr. Warrington, blushing. So the {{equipage}} {{drove to}} his hotel in Covent Garden, where the landlord came forward with his usual obsequiousness, and recognising my Lord of March and Ruglen, bowed his wig on to my lord's shoes in his humble welcomes to his lordship. A rich young English peer in the reign of George the Second; a wealthy patrician in the reign of Augustus; which would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> been? There is a question for any young gentlemen's debating-clubs of the present day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the fault}} is, being disorderly at prayer time. Now {{if you like}} frank and open dealing, {{and are willing to}} deal so with me, I should like to talk with you a little about it, but if you are not willing, I will dismiss the subject. I do not wish to talk with you now about it, unless you {{yourself}} desire it. But if we talk at all, we must both be open, and honest, and sincere. Now should <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> me talk with you or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Is it so? Do {{you know}} what your words mean? If they mean anything, they mean that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>rather</b> not <b>have</b> been christened, because you are now {{expected}} to behave as a christened man should. Now is there any one of you who dare say, [...] "I wish I had not been christened?" ...|$|R
60|$|Fred. Marry <b>you!</b> I <b>had</b> <b>rather</b> die a {{thousand}} deaths, than suffer it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, boy! it's {{all very}} well {{for you to say}} that now, but you know well enough that <b>you</b> would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> lost your ears than have missed such a chance as this. But, I say, it'll puzzle you to stuff that fellow, won't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me {{a square}} deal," [...] I cried, jumping up. [...] "Mayn't I have one word {{to say about}} my future? Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> me happy and {{successful}} as a forester, {{even if there is}} danger, than just an ordinary, poor doctor? Let's go over our woodland. I'll prove that you are letting your forest run down. You've got sixty acres of hard woods that ought to be bringing a regular income. If I can't prove it, if I can't interest you, I'll agree to study medicine. But if I do you're to let me try forestry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Dynevor grumbled {{something}} about parsons, which {{neither of them}} chose to hear; and Clara cut it short by saying, 'After all, Uncle Oliver, you have done it all! Dear grandmamma came back and was happy here, {{and that was all}} that signified. You never wanted it for yourself, you know, and my dear father was not here to have it. And for you, what could you have had more than your nephew and niece to--to try to be like your children! And hadn't <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> them without purchase than with?' And as she saw him smile in answer to her bright caress, she added merrily, 'There's nothing else to pity but the fir trees and gold fish; and as they have done very happily before without the Pendragon reign, I dare any they will again; so I can't be very sorry for them!' ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the morning}} Hector said: [...] "Now, Madame de Blenfoix, I have been {{thinking}} the matter over, and consider {{that it would be}} a wholly unnecessary journey and a loss of four days were you to travel to Nancy with us. You are only ten days' journey from Poitou, and I should advise you to start at once. My man, Paolo, and two of the troopers will accompany you as an escort. Your road will lead through Orleans, which will be almost halfway, and you will also pass through Tours. At both these towns you can, if you will, stay for a day to rest. I will ride down with you into Blenfoix, where I shall be able to get paper and pens, and will write letters to Captain MacIntosh and to my intendant explaining exactly the position that you will occupy. One of the troopers will ride forward with these from your last halting place before you arrive there, in order that you may find everything prepared and be received properly on your arrival. Do you both ride, or would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a pillion's place behind the troopers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} even <b>you,</b> general, would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> gone through the battle of Narva, than have spent that night among the wolves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Dan! don't say it's <b>you!</b> I'd <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> it any of {{the other}} boys," [...] cried Nat, in such a distressed tone that Dan looked pleased, and showed that he did, by turning round with a queer {{expression}} in his face, though he only answered, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I you, Miss Longworth," [...] he {{answered}} heartily, [...] "but {{to be frank}} with <b>you,</b> I would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> met <b>you</b> somewhere else." ...|$|R
