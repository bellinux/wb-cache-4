2500|$|You {{were asked}} before the invasion, {{or after the}} invasion, of Iraq if you'd checked with your dad. And I believe, I don't {{remember}} the quote exactly, but I believe {{you said you had}} checked with a higher authority. I would like to ask you, what part does your faith play on <b>your</b> <b>policy</b> decisions? ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{politicians}} {{are engaging in}} exchanges surrounding the phrase [...] "First World". It started with Lee Kuan Yew (PAP) who said [...] "We {{want to have a}} First World parliament for Singapore, so {{we need to have a}} First World government and a First World opposition. If you want us to treat you as gentlemen, argue on the merits of <b>your</b> <b>policy</b> and our policy. Take it to a higher level and we will treat you accordingly and respond accordingly." ...|$|E

5000|$|So my {{question}} for you is, how is the United States going to decrease its energy consumption in the first place? In other words, how will <b>your</b> <b>policies</b> influence Americans, rather than just using special light bulbs, to do this? ...|$|R

50|$|As {{a fellow}} {{member of the}} Commonwealth it is our earnest desire to give South Africa our support and encouragement, but I hope you won't mind my saying frankly {{that there are some}} aspects of <b>your</b> <b>policies</b> which make it {{impossible}} for us to do this without being false to our own deep convictions about the political destinies of free men to which in our own territories we are trying to give effect.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} to what will come," [...] Ernest went on, [...] "if you persist in <b>your</b> <b>policy</b> of having these socialists and {{radicals}} of all sorts at your house, myself included." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{principle}} in this case, anyhow, [...] Is {{shattered by the}} facts: since none can doubt [...] <b>Your</b> <b>policy</b> was counted an affront, [...] And drove my long ally to Austria's arms, [...] With what result to us must yet be seen! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{difficulty}} in understanding <b>your</b> <b>policy,</b> Bulstrode; though I confess to some in understanding your frankness. Such as it is, however, I trust you feel certain {{it will not}} be abused. Now, as to my situation, what peculiar countervailing advantages do I enjoy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have arranged," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "about your making over <b>your</b> <b>policies</b> of {{insurance}} to me as security for the debt you owe me. You won't have to pay them next half-year, I'll do that for you if necessary." [...] He laughed as he said this. [...] "I have now come {{to ask you to}} set the house alight, and have the plan carried out, and the whole affair comfortably settled." ...|$|R

5000|$|His {{supposed}} {{instruction to}} {{the son of the}} Standard Oil fortune was to echo in public relations henceforth: [...] "Tell the truth, because sooner or later the public will find out anyway. And if the public doesn't like what you are doing, change <b>your</b> <b>policies</b> and bring them into line with what people want." [...] The context of the quote was said to be apocryphal, being spread by Lee as self-promotion, making it both famous and infamous.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} mistaken," [...] I replied. [...] "I am only doubting whether your plan for {{relieving}} Mr. Van Brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose. Are {{you aware of}} the delays {{that are likely to}} take place before {{it will be possible to}} borrow money on <b>your</b> <b>policy</b> of insurance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} {{comprehend}} <b>your</b> <b>policy,</b> judge, if not your polity. Leaplow being a popular government, it becomes necessary that its public agents should be popular too. Now, as monikins naturally delight {{in their own}} excellences, nothing so disposes them to give credit to another, as his professions that he is worse than themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see <b>your</b> <b>policy,</b> sir, and it {{does not}} become me to deny it. As for myself, I confess I like Guert surprisingly, and shall not give him up easily; though he has already got me into two serious scrapes in the short time we have been acquainted; He is a hearty, good-natured, thoughtless young fellow; who, Dutchman-like, when he does make an attempt to enjoy life, does it with all his heart." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I fear {{also that}} you have erred, Asti, but {{everything}} is forgiven to those who err through love," [...] answered Tua kindly and kissing her. [...] "Oh, my father, Pharaoh! What god fashioned you so weak that an evil spirit in a woman's shape can play the rudder to <b>your</b> <b>policy!</b> Leave me now, Asti, for I must sleep and call on Amen to aid his daughter. The snare is strong and cunning, but, perchance, in my dreams he will show me how it may be broke." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas More.--The way was {{prepared}} meantime for evil {{as well as}} for good. You were retrograde in sound policy, sound philosophy and sound learning. Our business at present is wholly with the first. Because <b>your</b> <b>policy,</b> defective as it was at the best, had been retrograde, discoveries in physics, and advances in mechanical science which would have produced nothing but good in Utopia, became as injurious to the weal of the nation as they were instrumental to its wealth. But such had your system imperceptibly become, and such were your statesmen, that the wealth of nations was considered as the sole measure of their prosperity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] said Geoffrey, with {{an ominous}} glitter in his eyes. [...] "You needn't speak more plainly. Accidents, {{no doubt of}} the kind you refer to, have {{happened}} already. They have not, however, stopped us yet, and are not going to. I, of course, appreciate your delicate reference to your former policy; I conclude it was <b>your</b> <b>policy</b> individually. I don't like threats, even veiled ones, and nobody ever succeeded in coercing me. Accordingly, when we have drained it, we'll sell you all the land you want at its market value. You can't have an acre at anything like the price you offer now." ...|$|E

40|$|U. S. peace {{activist and}} mother Cindy Sheehan built her {{authority}} as a peace activist by yoking her antiwar mission to {{her role as}} a mother of a dead soldier son. In a statement addressed to Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of defense during the war on Iraq, Sheehan (2005, 45) wrote: 2 ̆ 2 I wish I could convey to you in person the pain and devastation <b>your</b> reckless <b>policies</b> have brought to my life. The grief is so profound and primal that it can 2 ̆ 7 t be described by the written word. You can 2 ̆ 7 t see my red, swollen eyes or my grief-etched face. <b>Your</b> <b>policies</b> have created a hole in my heart. 2 ̆ 2 As an activist strategy that made her a household name and, as some would say, galvanized the United States peace movement of the early-twenty first century, Sheehan concretized her emotional pain as a physical disability and then used this metaphor of disability to speak out against the war. What are the benefits and costs of such a rhetorical strategy...|$|R

You made {{tremendous}} preparations--I don't {{say you were}} wrong--but {{look at it from}} our point of view. We saw a declared enemy armed and arming. Against us, and against us alone, could his preparations be directed. It was time we took some precautions: indeed, we were already too late. Surely what has happened at the front proves that we had no designs against you. You were ready. We were unready. It is the wolf and lamb if you like; but the wolf was asleep and never before was a lamb with such teeth and claws.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As if thou hadst {{any other}} reason for that, Waldemar," [...] said De Bracy, [...] "than the {{promotion}} of thine own individual interest? Come, Fitzurse, we know each other--ambition is thy pursuit, pleasure is mine, and they become our different ages. Of Prince John thou thinkest as I do; that he is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical {{to be an easy}} monarch, too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch, and too fickle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. But he is a monarch by whom Fitzurse and De Bracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore you aid him with <b>your</b> <b>policy,</b> and I with the lances of my Free Companions." ...|$|E

"Yes, I can {{see that}} they are not fit to {{associate}} with them," [...] said the Altrurian, with a gleam of commonsense that surprised me, [...] "and that as long as your present conditions endure they never can be. You must excuse the confusion which the difference between your political ideals and your economic ideals constantly creates in me. I always think of you politically first, and realize you as a perfect democracy; then come these other facts, in which I cannot perceive that you differ from the aristocratic countries of Europe in theory, or practice. It is very puzzling. Am I right in supposing that the effect of your economy is to establish insuperable inequalities among you, and to forbid the hope of the brotherhood which <b>your</b> <b>policy</b> proclaims?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed, your majesty," [...] said Prigio, [...] "you must {{permit me}} to correct <b>your</b> <b>policy.</b> Your only reason for {{dispatching}} your sons in pursuit of this dangerous but I believe fabulous animal, was to ascertain which of us would most worthily succeed to your throne, at the date--long may it be deferred!--of your lamented decease. Now, {{there can be no}} further question about the matter. I, unworthy as I am, represent the sole hope of the royal family. Therefore to send me after the Firedrake were {25} both dangerous and unnecessary. Dangerous, because, if he treats me as you say he did my brothers--my unhappy brothers,--the throne of Pantouflia will want an heir. But, if I do come back alive--why, I cannot be more the true heir than I am at present; now can I? Ask the Lord Chief Justice, if you don't believe me." ...|$|E

It may be that my hostility to the [...] rebel party, looking at their conduct since your {{government}} was [...] formed six years ago, disables me from taking an impartial view of [...] this great question. If I could believe them loyal, if they were [...] honourable and truthful men, I could yield them much; but I [...] suspect that <b>your</b> <b>policy</b> of surrender to them will only place more [...] power in their hands, to war with greater effect against the unity [...] of the three kingdoms with no increase of good to the Irish [...] people.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Joseph {{was much}} {{astonished}} when Coningsby, who being somewhat impatient for {{the entrance of}} the ladies was rather more abrupt than his wont, told the worthy Baronet that he looked, upon a government without distinct principles of policy as only a stop-gap to a wide-spread and demoralising anarchy; that he for one could not comprehend how a free government could endure without national opinions to uphold it; and that governments for the preservation of peace and order, and nothing else, had better be sought in China, or among the Austrians, the Chinese of Europe. As for Conservative government, the natural question was, What do you mean to conserve? Do you mean to conserve things or only names, realities or merely appearances? Or, do you mean to continue the system commenced in 1834, and, with a hypocritical reverence for the principles, and a superstitious adhesion to the forms, of the old exclusive constitution, carry on <b>your</b> <b>policy</b> by latitudinarian practice? ...|$|E

5000|$|When Ian Smith came {{to power}} and {{declared}} independence in 1965, Bishop Lamont was horrified. He had been a long-time critic of {{the policies of the}} Rhodesian government, claiming they were racist. Amongst his criticism, Lamont wrote an open letter to Ian Smith, then Prime Minister of Rhodesia, saying [...] "Far from <b>your</b> <b>policies</b> defending Christianity and Western civilization, as you claim, they mock the law of Christ and make Communism attractive to the African people." [...] In other writings he declared Rhodesia's constitution and land apportionment laws to be segregationist, unfair and [...] "a direct contradiction of the New Testament's teaching". He denounced the white people in power in the country as a colonial-style clique while praising black leaders and their guerrillas as freedom fighters.|$|R
