25|$|The fairest {{solution}} would be to replay the game {{but it is not}} in my control...Naturally I feel embarrassed at the way that we won and feel extremely sorry for the Irish who definitely deserve to be in South Africa...I have said at the time and I will say again that 'yes' I handled the ball. I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E

Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> we look good. To write us off just because we haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E

500|$|Yi {{was named}} to Milwaukee's {{starting}} lineup by head coach Larry Krystkowiak in place of Charlie Villanueva to begin the 2007–08 season. He recorded nine points and three rebounds in a debut loss to the Orlando Magic. He played his first home game in Milwaukee three days later and scored 16 points while grabbing eight boards in a 78–72 win over the Chicago Bulls. The game was also Yi's first game to be televised nationally in China, where it was watched by an estimated 100 million viewers. Yao Ming praised Yi's play in his first few games, saying, [...] "If you compare us in our third NBA games, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Yi's statistics are far better than mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Seward's wife Frances {{was deeply}} {{committed}} to the abolitionist movement. In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. Seward's frequent travel and political work suggest that it was Frances who played the {{more active role in}} Auburn abolitionist activities. In the excitement following the rescue and safe transport of fugitive slave William [...] "Jerry" [...] Henry in Syracuse on October 1, 1851, Frances wrote to her husband, [...] "two fugitives have gone to Canada—one of them our acquaintance John." [...] Another time she wrote, [...] "A {{man by the name of}} William Johnson will apply to you for assistance to purchase the freedom of his daughter. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I have given him something by his book.

I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile.

500|$|The {{building}} was an unusually narrow structure, only [...] wide but [...] deep stretching the entire distance from Fifth to Winston Streets. [...] The main floor was an arcade connecting Fifth and Winston Streets with stalls for ten horses, repressed vitrified brick, walls of white enamel tiling, and pressed steel ceilings [...] above the floor. [...] More than anything else, {{it was the}} extravagant third floor living quarters, described as [...] "the chief's boudoir" [...] and a [...] "palace for chiefs," [...] that drew the most attention. [...] Access {{to the third floor}} was by a private elevator that [...] "moves noiselessly and stealthily to the upper haven." [...] The third floor was covered in Peruvian mahogany with French bevel glass mirrors, a mantel of Vermont marble, polished inlaid oak floors, a private slide pole, a massive brass bed, private roof garden, and [...] "a tub big enough for two chiefs." [...] The Times reported: [...] "Notice the Peruvian mahogany carefully, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the heart of the log has been chosen and that its grain has been placed so that it gives the appearance of real flames.

500|$|On {{the other}} side of the feud, to hold the territory, Gebhard needed the full support of his {{military}} brother and the very able Neuenahr. To push Ernst out, he needed additional support, which he had requested from Delft and from England. It was clearly in the interests of England and the Dutch to offer assistance; if the Dutch could not tie up the Spanish army in Flanders, and if that army needed a navy to supply it, Philip could not focus his attention on the English and the French. His own diplomats had sought to present his case as one of pressing concern to all Protestant princes: in November, 1583, one of his advisers, Dr. Wenceslaus Zuleger, wrote to Francis Walsingham: [...] "I assure you if the Elector of Cologne is not assisted, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the war in the Low Countries will shortly spread over the whole of Germany." [...] The support Gebhard received, in the form of troops from the Earl of Leicester, and from the Dutch, in the form of the mercenary Martin Schenck, had mixed results. Leicester's troops, professional and well-led, performed well but their usefulness was limited: Elizabeth's instructions to help Gebhard had not come with financial support and Leicester had sold his own plate and had exhausted his own personal credit while trying to field an army. Martin Schenck had seen considerable service in Spain's Army of Flanders, for the French king and for Parma himself. He was a skilled and charismatic soldier, and his men would do anything for him; reportedly, he could sleep in his saddle, and seemed indomitable in the field. Unfortunately, Schenck was little more than a land-pirate, a free-booter, and rascal, and ultimately he did Gebhard more harm than good, as his behavior in Westphalia and at the Battle of Werl demonstrated.|$|E

One of the first British prisoners taken in the GPO was Second Lieutenant AD Chalmers, who was bound with telephone wire and lodged in a telephone box by the young Volunteer Captain and IRB activist, Michael Collins. Chalmers later recalled O'Rahilly's kindness to him. In a statement to a newspaper reporter, {{he said that he}} was taken from the phone box after three hours and brought up to O'Rahilly, who ordered: [...] "I want this officer to watch the safe to see that nothing is touched. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> no harm comes to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chesterton {{was a large}} man, {{standing}} [...] {{and weighing}} around [...] His girth {{gave rise to a}} famous anecdote.

But heaven {{is on the side of}} a righteous vengeance; a legion which dared to fight has perished; the rest are hiding themselves in their camp, or are thinking anxiously of flight.
