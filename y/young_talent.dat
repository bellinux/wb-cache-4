5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine <b>young</b> <b>talent.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before Mega Man, Capcom {{primarily}} made arcade games, {{and their}} console releases were mostly ports of these titles. In the mid-1980s, Capcom {{made plans to}} develop Mega Man specifically for the Japanese home console market. They decided to bring in fresh, <b>young</b> <b>talent</b> for the small team, including artist Keiji Inafune, a recent college graduate who started on the Street Fighter team. Inafune recalled that the Mega Man development team worked extremely hard to complete the final product, with a project supervisor and lead designer who sought perfection in every possible aspect of the game.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, Ottawa's fourth placing in the Conference {{meant that}} the first-round playoff series was against the fifth-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins. Some media were expecting the Penguins to win the series for three reasons—the Penguins had won the season series, the Senators' past playoff {{troubles}} and the strong <b>young</b> <b>talent</b> of the Penguins, particularly young star Sidney Crosby. The Senators, however, won easily by a score of four games to one, including a 3–0 shutout win in Game 5. This was the only series where the Senators were the higher-seeded team.|$|E

Rather than go on to work on a big budget American film after Inglourious Basterds, her next role was in a small theater piece in France.|$|E

5|$|As a captain, Gilligan was well-liked by {{players and}} commentators, {{although}} many {{did not believe}} he was an effective tactician. Nevertheless, under his leadership, Sussex became an attractive, competitive team. He encouraged the search for <b>young</b> <b>talent,</b> and the players consequently discovered became {{the backbone of the}} club into the 1930s. As a fielder, he inspired his teams to become good fielding sides. In addition, as MCC captain of a team which toured India in 1926–27, he encouraged Indians {{to take responsibility for their}} own cricket board instead of allowing white Englishmen to run Indian cricket, and lobbied the MCC to bestow Test match status on the Indian team. As MCC president, he played a part in the D'Oliveira affair in 1968. He died in 1976, aged 81.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, lack of {{popularity}} with {{the fans and}} a fall out with Lorenzo Sanz resulted in Capello being sacked, and Vicente del Bosque eventually taking over in November of that year. The squad was also largely different from the previous squad: the budding <b>young</b> <b>talent</b> of Raúl, Iker Casillas, Fernando Morientes and Guti being supported {{with the arrival of}} Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado, and Iván Helguera and the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro and Roberto Carlos. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the European Cup/Champions League for the eight time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl. This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.|$|E

5|$|Educated at Wesley College, Melbourne, Loxton first gained {{prominence}} as an Australian rules football player. After debuting in 1942, {{he played}} 41 {{games in the}} VFL for St Kilda as a forward, kicking a total of 114 goals before retiring {{at the end of}} the 1946 season to concentrate on his cricket career. In 1944, he headed St Kilda's goal-kicking aggregate with 52 goals and placed second in the club's Best and Fairest. Loxton served in a tank division during World War II and made his first-class cricket debut in 1946–47. He scored 232 not out, which remains a record for any Australian player on his first-class debut. After a strong first season, Loxton was selected to make his Test debut in the final match of the 1947–48 home series against India. Australia had already won the series and used the last match to trial their <b>young</b> <b>talent.</b> Loxton seized his opportunity, scoring 80 and taking three wickets, securing himself a position on the 1948 England tour.|$|E
5|$|Other than {{finishing}} as runners-up in Allsvenskan in 1996, {{the team}} did not excel in the 1990s, as the club {{failed to win}} Allsvenskan and Svenska Cupen throughout the entire decade. The 1990s ended with relegation from Allsvenskan in 1999. Hans Cavalli-Björkman was succeeded as chairman by Bengt Madsen in 1999, and former player Hasse Borg was contracted as Director of Sport. These operational changes, {{as well as the}} emergence of <b>young</b> <b>talent</b> Zlatan Ibrahimović, led to the return to Allsvenskan in 2001. Ibrahimović rose to fame and became an important player in the club's campaign to return to the top league. He was later sold to Ajax in 2001, before playing for several European clubs in Italy's Serie A, FC Barcelona in Spain's La Liga, Paris Saint-Germain in France's Ligue 1, and his current club as of 2017, Manchester United F.C. in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 final was Vieira's last match as an Arsenal player; {{he joined}} Juventus in the close season for a {{combined}} total fee of €20million. Wenger's decision {{to sell his}} captain was made so the team could benefit from Fàbregas, who broke into the first eleven during the season. In later years, Wenger deviated from his usual counter-attacking style, and imposed a fluent system, with less emphasis on physicality. The immediate seasons after Arsenal relocated to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 saw Wenger sell several experienced players, and integrate more <b>young</b> <b>talent,</b> {{as a means of}} fostering an identity with the club. Financing for the stadium however meant Arsenal prioritised its expenditure instead of the squad and trophies. Though Wenger managed to solidify the club’s position in the Premier League's top four and secure the necessary funds to pay back its debtors, the 2005 Cup win represented Arsenal's last silverware for nine years. In 2014, he led Arsenal to a record-equalling 11th FA Cup, and became the record equalling most successful manager in the competition's history a year later, as his side beat Aston Villa.|$|E

5|$|The late preseason saw {{a wave of}} signings {{of players}} cut by other teams, {{particularly}} the Bengals and Colts. Signees included Isaac Hagins, Danny Reece, Dave Green, and Jack Novak, with Ira Gordon and camp standout Jim Cagle among those waived to make roster space for them. Running back Charlie Davis was also obtained via trade. The moves left the team with nine former Bengals on their roster, a situation they expected, as they knew that Bengals owner Paul Brown had more <b>young</b> <b>talent</b> than {{he would be able}} to keep on his team. Linebacker Richard Wood was obtained from the New York Jets for a future draft choice, with injury-plagued running back Harold Hart placed on injured reserve to make roster space for him. Wood was the final roster addition of the preseason, and became the fifth ex-USC player on the roster.|$|E
5|$|The {{three decades}} after the 1952 Grey Cup victory have been called the Argonauts' Dark Ages. The team went thirty-one years between {{championship}} victories and nineteen without even making an appearance in the final. Part of the reason was a salary cap introduced in 1953 that cost them many talented players. For {{the first time in}} decades, they began ranking {{at the bottom of the}} Eastern Division. The management style under new owner John Bassett has also been blamed: <b>young</b> <b>talent</b> was traded or allowed to leave and the team could not form a nucleus of championship players; coaches came and went rapidly. Two notable events occurred off-field at the end of the 1950s: in 1958 the Argonauts became a founding member of the Canadian Football League and a year later found a new home at Exhibition Stadium.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best <b>young</b> <b>talent</b> in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the first Xenosaga game, Takahashi and Sugiura reassessed the {{internal}} structure of Monolith Soft, determining that the current lead developers were too old, clashing with their intended goals for the company to foster <b>young</b> <b>talent.</b> With this mindset, Takahashi stepped down from his lead role in the Xenosaga series, he continued to work for the company in a supervisory role by providing scenario draft's, while younger staff continued the series development. This move also allowed Takahashi a greater degree of creative freedom in a number of projects as opposed to being tied to a single series. In May 2002, Monolith Soft moved from Yokohama to their current offices in Meguro, Tokyo. The next entry in the Xenosaga series, Xenosaga Episode II, began development under a new team following {{the release of}} Episode I. While developing Episode II, the staff shifted their focus from the main series to help tell the story through multiple media. Among these additional projects was , a spin-off title for mobile devices co-developed with Tom Create and Namco Mobile. Pied Piper was Tanaka's last work on the Xenosaga series. Beginning in 2003, Monolith Soft also developed Namco × Capcom, a PlayStation 2 crossover game featuring character's from various Namco and Capcom video games. The idea was proposed by Monolith Soft, with development lasting two years.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an 11-year-old Kylie Minogue was {{established}} as a child actress, appearing as a cameo actress in the TV series The Sullivans and Skyways. Both Minogue and her sister Dannii Minogue were both child stars trying to achieve success in the TV industry of Australia, but Dannii received better opportunities as a TV actress than Kylie. In 1985, Kylie was cast {{as one of the}} lead roles on TV soap The Henderson Kids but her role only lasted one season, and was completed after two seasons. Interested in following a career in music, she made a demo tape for the producers of the weekly music programme <b>Young</b> <b>Talent</b> Time, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Dannii's success overshadowed Kylie's acting achievements, until Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan, culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20million British viewers.|$|E
5|$|Mido {{was signed}} by Tottenham on an 18-month loan deal on 28 January 2005. He scored two goals on his Tottenham debut against Portsmouth on 5 February 2005. He scored 3 goals in 11 {{appearances}} during the 2004–05 season for Tottenham. Mido announced plans in July 2005 to launch his own football academy in Egypt, which had the aim of nurturing the country's <b>young</b> <b>talent.</b> In January 2006, he expressed {{that he did not}} wish to return to Roma {{at the end of the}} 2005–06 season, but rather sign permanently with Tottenham. Tottenham manager Martin Jol said that the club were confident of signing Mido on a permanent deal due to his good performances, but later admitted Tottenham may be defeated in keeping Mido, with other clubs interested in signing him. His permanent move was further put into doubt in April 2006, after he suffered a new injury problem. He suffered abuse from a small section of the Southampton and West Ham United fans in 2005. West Ham manager Alan Pardew apologised to Mido for the abuse by the fans. He finished the 2005–06 season with 11 goals in 27 games, meaning he was Tottenham's second highest goalscorer. Tottenham confirmed in May 2006 that Mido would be returning to Roma.|$|E
