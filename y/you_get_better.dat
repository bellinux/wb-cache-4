500|$|Larter {{appeared}} in Glamour along with fellow actresses Rachel Bilson and Diane Lane in 2007. When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get older, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better....</b> Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
500|$|Sonic the Hedgehog has {{maintained}} its popularity, {{and has since}} been {{considered one of the}} greatest video games of all time. Frank Provo of GameSpot described the game as [...] "one of the best platformers of all time", noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port [...] "after all these years, the underlying graphics, audio, and gameplay still hold up". Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time. Writing in The Guardian, Keith Stuart observed that Sonic the Hedgehogs emphasis on speed and pinball mechanics dramatically departs from generally accepted precepts of game design, requiring that players [...] "learn through repetition rather than observation" [...] as [...] "the levels aren't designed to be seen or even understood in one playthrough." [...] However, Stuart concluded that [...] "sometimes in Sonic, when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better,</b> or through sheer luck, things take off, every jump is right, every loop-the-loop is perfect, and you're in the flow, sailing above the game's strange structure... Sonic is incorrect game design and yet... it's a masterpiece." [...] Mega ranked the game its third-favorite Genesis title, and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th-greatest game of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success; the original Genesis version sold over 15million copies by February 2009, and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008.|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell {{me how you}} are," [...] {{continued}} the girl, kneeling beside the chair and taking the withered hands gently in her own. [...] "Do you suffer any? And are <b>you</b> <b>getting</b> <b>better,</b> dear aunt, in this beautiful garden with {{the birds and the}} sunshine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} be so {{unreasonably}} gay," [...] said Miss Edith to me. [...] "That may be your way when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> acquainted with people, but I am afraid some of the family will think {{that you are in}} such good spirits because Mrs. Chester now knows that she is a widow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Tom, I {{would not}} wish to see a better gentleman any day, than you have stuff enough in you to make; and, if Charlotte be a girl worth having, she'll value that more than French polish. You're getting polished, too, Tom, and will more as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> and sounder, and that polish will be true and not French.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} my word 'voluntary' has misled you," [...] I put in. [...] "It isn't the word exactly. The {{divisions}} among us are rather {{a process of}} natural selection. You will see, as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> acquainted with the workings of our institutions, {{that there are no}} arbitrary distinctions here but the fitness of the work for the man and the man for the work determines the social rank that each one holds." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's nothing I {{want to do}} {{more than}} help <b>you</b> to <b>get</b> <b>better.</b> I'll just go out and send a wire, and then I'll be right back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I've succeeded {{beyond my}} hopes, for here you are, a steady, {{sensible}} businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying up {{the blessings of}} the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times. I am proud of you, Teddy, for <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> every year, and everyone feels it, though you won't let them say so. Yes, and when I have my flock, I'll just point to you, and say 'There's your model, my lads'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A painter?" [...] Mr. Carteret {{seemed to}} turn whiter. [...] "I'm going {{in for the}} {{portrait}} in oils. It sounds absurd, I know, and I'm thus specific only to show you I don't in the least expect you to count on me." [...] The invalid had continued to stare at first; then his eyes slowly closed and he lay motionless and blank. [...] "Don't let it trouble you now; it's a long story and rather a poor one; when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> I'll {{tell you all about}} it. Well talk it over amicably and I'll bring you to my view," [...] Nick went on hypocritically. He had laid his hand again on the hand beside him; it felt cold, and as the old man remained silent he had a moment of exaggerated fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack," [...] {{the artist}} said, {{stopping}} {{in his work}} now, and speaking very earnestly, [...] "there is not a lad of your age in the land, brought up as a miner, or a mechanic, or an artisan, who may not, if he sets it before him, and gives his whole mind to it, end by being a rich man and a gentleman. If a lad from the first makes up his mind to three things--to work, to save, and to learn--he can rise in the world. You won't {{be able to save}} out of what you get at first, but you can learn when your work is done. You can read and study of an evening. Then when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> wages, save something; when, at twenty-one or so, you get man's wages, live on less than half, and lay by the rest. Don't marry till you're thirty; keep away from the public-house; work, study steadily and intelligently; and by the time you are thirty you will have a thousand pounds laid by, and be fit to take a manager's place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather think not, Peacocke. I rather think not. You'll {{have to get}} {{up earlier}} before <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the <b>better</b> of Robert Lefroy. You don't expect to get this money back again,--do you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>you</b> will <b>get</b> <b>better</b> as <b>you</b> walk, mynheer," [...] I suggested, for, to {{tell the}} truth, I misdoubted me of this chill, and {{knew that he had}} eaten nothing but what was quite wholesome.|$|R
6000|$|... "My faith, yes!" [...] said Bird. [...] "But," [...] {{he added}} sadly, [...] "perhaps {{it would not}} pay to mine it. I will show <b>you</b> when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> up. <b>Better</b> not go to Chicoutimi to-day! It is snowing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; I am {{very sorry}} {{to find you}} here, Devereux, but I am glad to see <b>you</b> are <b>getting</b> <b>better.</b> I have really come in order that you might satisfy this gentleman, who has taken me prisoner, that I am King of the Maritzburg Scouts." ...|$|R

5000|$|The singer {{also took}} on a new {{approach}} to recording the album. [...] "Williams, who generally has never recorded his vocals until the entire instrumental tracks were finished, here found himself singing along with the all-star rock session men putting down his basic rhythm tracks. 'I think everybody agrees now that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> results when the artist sings along with the rhythm track sessions, even if you erase the vocal track afterwards,' says Williams. Ever the perfectionist, Andy wound up taping new vocals over the finished instrumental tracks. 'I just felt I could do it a bit better than I did at the live sessions,' he explains." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to sister Anna Alekseyevna Nekrasova, on November 19 {{the poet}} [...] "sent for censor Petrov {{and for two}} hours was trying to put it to him {{that there was nothing}} reprehensible in the Part 4. He even {{suggested}} certain lines in the earlier parts of the poem might have deserved the ban better... Petrov puffed, swiping sweat from his face, occasionally moaning: 'Please calm down, Nikolai Alekseyevich... Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better,</b> you'll correct some things and it will pass through...'" [...] In the last desperate attempt to appease the censors, Nekrasov removed several fragments (including three songs) from Part 4 and added two lines glorifying Tsar Alexander II (Glory to the one / Who's given freedom to the people, - Slavsya, narodu / davshy svobodu).|$|E
6000|$|Clare blushed, but {{her eyes}} sparkled and her glance was steady. [...] "If we are to have an explanation, it must be {{complete}} and without reserve. Very well!
