50|$|Crooked Tree Wild Life Sanctuary (CTWS) is a {{protected}} area in Belize. It {{is recognized as}} a Wetland of International Importance. It was designated as a waterfowl habitat on April 22, 1998 under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. During Belize’s dryseason many resident and migratory birds find refuge in the lagoons. The sanctuary contains16,400 acres of lagoons, creeks, log wood swamps, broad leaf forest and pine savanna, home to hundreds of species of wildlife. The Sanctuary protects globally endangered species including the Central American River Turtle (locally known as Hicatee), Mexican Black Howler Monkey, and <b>Yellow-headed</b> <b>Parrot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Sanctuary has {{a diverse}} array of species {{including}} fish, mammal, reptile and bird population. There are 26 species of international concern within the Sanctuary and the 66-foot buffer vegetation {{on the edge of}} the lagoon. The water opossum, Yucatán howler monkey, Morlet's crocodile, American salt water crocodile, Baird's tapir, Neotropical river otter, cownose ray and the Cubera snapper can be found within or around the sanctuary. They are also 330 species of birds, including the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>parrot,</b> the great curassow, and the jabiru stork can be seen. Several other species can be found just outside the protected are such as the jaguar, puma, margay, ocelot, jaguarundi and the Central American spider monkey.|$|E

2500|$|Though only captive-bred yellow-headed amazons may be owned, {{these are}} widely {{available}} (if somewhat expensive) and their personalities make them highly desirable pets; they have been kept as such for centuries because {{they are among the}} parrots that [...] "talk" [...] best. [...] Their vocal abilities are generally bested only by the African grey parrot and matched by similar species, such as the yellow-naped <b>parrot.</b> <b>Yellow-headed</b> amazons in captivity appear to have an affinity for both singing and the learning of song - and a naturally powerful, operatic voice.|$|R
40|$|In 2001 the {{abundance}} of <b>Yellow-headed</b> <b>Parrot</b> Amazona oratrix ‘‘guatemalensis’ ’ at a roost site in Punta de Manabique, Guatemala {{was found to be}} 70 individuals. A comparison with a roost census in 1994 suggested a population decline. The largest threat to this form of <b>Yellow-headed</b> <b>Parrot</b> is nest-robbing for the pet trade. The rate of decline and the limited number of individuals living in the wild suggest the population is facing extinction. The core zone of reproduction is located in a palm savanna. Information on feather patterns of the head of this form of A. oratrix is provided...|$|E
40|$|Managers of Payne’s Creek National Park in {{southern}} Belize are considering designating a small sustainable extraction zone for Caribbean pine and palmetto palm forest products to support conservation programs and local communities. Zoning {{is often used}} in protected areas to help achieve different management goals according {{to the needs of}} various regions of the park. This study provides a foundation for a resource extraction zone which encompasses resources of interest while minimizing disturbance to local endangered species. The contribution of field survey and local knowledge to a traditionally computation-based process was also explored. Multiple-criteria decision analysis and ground survey were used to evaluate land suitability within the park based on five zoning criteria: pine and palmetto resources, potential for pine regeneration, local roads, and <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>parrot</b> nest sites. The GIS-based weighted linear combination method was found to be sensitive to changing management goals and therefore useful for reflecting user priorities, but it was significantly improved by the inclusion of ground survey. The data improvements and local expertise gained in the field increased the practicality of zoning options and aided in evaluation of them. Maps of zone option boundaries and resources were created for park managers. One extraction zone option was recommended, which may provide a starting point for a comprehensive zoning plan...|$|E
