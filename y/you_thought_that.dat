H.J. Igoe, writing in The Catholic Herald, thinks that [...] "Formby has a common English touch. We warm to the kindly turnip face, the revolving eyes, the mouth like a slashed coconut, the silly little songs... the melodiously tinny voice and twanging banjo. The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother's boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot hang a picture and underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Neil Gaiman. After Steven Moffat {{replaced}} Russell T Davies as the showrunner of Doctor Who, being a fan of Gaiman's blog, Moffat met with Gaiman and Gaiman had asked to write an episode. In an interview Gaiman stated [...] "I came {{up with something that}} {{was one of those things}} where <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> nobody's done that before." [...] The episode was originally titled [...] "The House of Nothing" [...] before Gaiman sat down to write it, but that was changed to [...] "Bigger on the Inside". This title remained until about six weeks before the episode aired, but the crew was beginning to worry that [...] "Bigger on the Inside" [...] would give away the surprise that Idris was the TARDIS, so it was changed. [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] was also a fake title attached to the 1984 serial The Caves of Androzani; then-producer John Nathan-Turner had changed the title to that on his planning board in an attempt to weed out a suspected leak in his office.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} universal acclaim from contemporary music critics. Lindsey Weber of Vulture called the short film a [...] "strangely moving ode to Los Angeles". Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal rated it an A+ and wrote, [...] "Just when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Jared Leto and Thirty Seconds to Mars cannot possible [...] get any better, they prove us wrong" [...] with their music video for [...] "City of Angels". He found it [...] "raw and captivating" [...] {{and felt that}} [...] "it will certainly move people." [...] Brenna Ehrlich from MTV commented that while the short film [...] "may lack all the majestic animals" [...] featured in the music video for [...] "Up in the Air", [...] "it does have some exotic animals of a different sort: a whole pack of celebrities." [...] Liza Darwin from Nylon magazine opened her review by writing, [...] "There are music videos, {{and then there are}} Thirty Seconds to Mars music videos." [...] She stated, [...] "Part documentary, part cinematic music video, this Jared Leto-helmed mini-film is touching, sweet, and totally worth watching in its 11-minute entirety." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{reviewing}} the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that the}} episode [...] "manages some good bits {{but not enough to}} make it a quality program." [...] He also wrote that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> 'Alone Again, Natura-diddly' would be Season 11’s sole episode that features a big change for a secondary character, you thought wrong. No, Barney’s sobriety isn’t as major an event as Maude’s demise, but it actually has a bigger impact on the series. After all, Maude was a tertiary role; her disappearance affects secondary personality Ned, but she didn’t appear all that much, so she didn’t really go missed. Making Barney sober affects the series on a much more consistent basis – though probably not in a good way. After all, most of Barney’s appeal came from his drunken idiocy, so he loses his natural kick when he goes on the wagon." ...|$|E
