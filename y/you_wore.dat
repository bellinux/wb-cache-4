500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown khaki pants, brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant was just looking at me and going 'God I'm so glad <b>you</b> <b>wore</b> that hat. I'm so glad <b>you</b> <b>wore</b> that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad <b>you</b> <b>wore</b> those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Kabul {{was known}} as the Paris of central Asia as it was {{transforming}} into a European style city. Once the jewel of Asia, a very progressive and moderately modern capital. Kabul in those days had, modern cinemas, cafes, formal French gardens, schools, libraries, universities, fine boutiques. The inhabitants of Kabul known as [...] "Kabulis" [...] were highly educated, modern, progressive and cosmopolitan people. Where women and men attended primary school, high school and university. Mini-jupes (mini skirts) were a common sight in the 1970s. Highly educated, culturally aware and yet religious at the same time, there was never an issue with not having your hair covered or the clothes <b>you</b> <b>wore</b> in the Kabul of the 1960s and 1970s. This progressive peaceful society lasted until foreign interference occurred in the late 1970s plummeting the country to what Afghanistan has become today. In December 1979, Soviet armed forces landed at Kabul International Airport to help bolster the PDPA-led government of Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|After their two-week {{encounter}} ended, Abe became agitated {{and began}} drinking excessively. She claimed that with Ishida {{she had come}} to know true love {{for the first time in}} her life, and the thought of Ishida being back with his wife made her intensely jealous. Just over a week before Ishida's eventual death, Abe began to contemplate his murder. On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, 1936, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, [...] "I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, <b>you</b> <b>wore</b> that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers. You [...] bastard, I'll kill you for that.' Ishida was startled and drew away a little, but he seemed delighted with it all..." ...|$|E
