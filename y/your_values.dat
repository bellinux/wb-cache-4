[...] Alleanza Nazionale, an Italian neoconservative political party formed from {{the collapse of the}} neo-fascist party MSI, has used imagery from the work within candidate propaganda posters titled: [...] "Defend <b>your</b> <b>values,</b> your civilization, your district".|$|E

50|$|Framing {{is used to}} construct, refine, {{and deliver}} messages. Framing in {{politics}} is essential to getting your message across to the masses. Frames are mental structures that shape the way we view the world (Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant! Know <b>Your</b> <b>Values</b> and Frame the Debate 2004). Reframing is used particularly well by both conservatives and liberals in the political arena, so well that they have news anchors and commentators discussing the ideas, supplied phrases and framing (Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant! Know <b>Your</b> <b>Values</b> and Frame the Debate 2004).|$|E

5000|$|According to Demchak, one key {{ingredient}} {{to becoming a}} successful leader is to believe you can always be better. He advises potential leaders to: “learn from your failures, surround yourself with people who will challenge you. Ensure your vision is shared ‘clearly and often’ with your team. Remain grounded in <b>your</b> <b>values</b> so that you never forget who you serve or why you come to work.” ...|$|E

50|$|The most {{powerful}} move {{you can make}} in the Smallville RPG is to challenge either one of your relationships, or one of <b>your</b> <b>values.</b> This means {{that you think that}} you were wrong and are coming to a new understanding; you get to roll the dice three times rather than once in your dice pool but are using a smaller dice {{for the rest of the}} session.|$|E
50|$|Values clarification. Values {{change over}} time in {{response}} to changing life experiences. Recognizing these changes and understanding how they affect one's actions and behaviors {{is the goal of}} the values clarification process. Values clarification does not tell you what you should have, it simply provides the means to discover what <b>your</b> <b>values</b> are. This approach, although widely practiced, came under strong criticism for, among other things, promoting moral relativism among students.|$|E
