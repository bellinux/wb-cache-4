25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>tree</b> varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E

Thus its regeneration and seed production capacities are important factors {{to take into account}} to reach the necessities of the country. To study the production of cones and seeds of Aleppo pine, Tunisia’s native Aleppo pine forests were surveyed in summer 2006, using 79 plots (40 × 25 m: 1, 000 m²) spread over four bioclimatic zones. Stand and tree characteristics, crown dimensions and cone/seed variables were measured from an average tree of each plot (i. e. a total of 79 trees). Recorded data were submitted to simple and multiple regression analyses for explaining the variability in crown volume and crown surface, cone number and seed <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> average <b>tree.</b> Results showed a negative correlation between the stand density, crown characteristics and number of cones and seeds harvested from the average tree.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a simple and {{quantitative}} system for coffee yield estimation and nutrient input advice, so as to address the problem of declining annual coffee production in Tanzania (particularly in its Northern coffee zone), which is related to declining soil fertility. The study was conducted between 2010 and 2013 at TaCRI Lyamungu, with source data taken from Hai and Lushoto districts, Northern Tanzania. An earlier model QUEFTS, developed for maize but under similar conditions as those of Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) in the study areas was used as a benchmark. Secondary fertilizer trial data were used in model calibration for coffee, while adding two more steps related to balanced nutrition and the economics of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM). Primary soil analytical data and calculated yields on basis of tree number were used for model testing. The result was a new model which we hereby call SAFERNAC (Soil Analysis for Fertility Evaluation and Recommendation on Nutrient Application to Coffee). The model consists of three modules: SOIL (the soil properties of interest), PLANT (all the crop and crop management parameters such as physiological nutrient use efficiency, plant density, maximum <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> <b>tree)</b> and INPUT (nutrient inputs – organic and inorganic). It consists of two subsequent parts – a baseline approach (no input) for coffee land evaluation; and an integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) approach that involves application of nutrient inputs, for ISFM planning and design of fertilizer experiments.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that apple (Malus * domestica Borkh) flowering distribution maps can be used for site-specific management decisions. The objectives of this study were (i) to study the flower density variability in an apple orchard using image analysis and (ii) to model the correlation between flower density as determined from image analysis and fruit yield. The research was carried out in a commercial apple orchard in Central Greece.

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{planted in the}} spring of 1989 to {{investigate}} the effects of root growth control using root restricting bags on the growth, fruitfulness, and fruit calcium concentrations and contents of apple (Malus x domestica Borkh. cv. 'Fuji'). The trial was planted as a 2 x 5 factorial randomised complete block design. Trees were conventionally planted or planted in in-ground fabric containers of 15, 34, 65 or 139 litre volume on MM 106 or MM 115 rootstocks. The fabric container used was the Root Control Bag℠, (Root Control Inc., Oklahoma City, OK). These containers are cylindrical, with one end closed with clear plastic to form the bottom of the bag and the wall material is porous which allows new root growth in the form of fine roots around the periphery of the container. Trees were planted in two rows at a spacing of 3. 0 x 5. 0 metres. Throughout the experiment, trees were untrained, un pruned, and allowed to develop natural crown form and size. Fruit thinning was not carried out in any year to avoid obscuring treatment effects. The within-row and inter-row area was maintained weed free using an overall herbicide spray programme. Irrigation water was applied through drippers with all trees receiving the same frequency of irrigation and amount of water. In other respects, normal orchard management practices were followed. Root restriction reduced tree trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) in the years 1991 to 1994, and canopy volume and tree height in 1995 when compared with the unconfined treatment. Throughout the experimental period, TCSA decreased linearly as bag volume was reduced. However, growth differences in TCSA within bag sizes were not reflected in canopy volumes. Trees grown on MM 106 rootstock compared with MM 115 had smaller TCSA and canopy volumes. However, root restriction reduced the invigorating effect of MM 115 as the difference in TCSA or canopy volume (the absolute difference or expressed as a percentage) between the two rootstocks was considerably greater in the unconfined than in the bagged treatments. The smaller trees resulting from root restriction had lower yields when compared with the unconfined treatment. Throughout the experiment, there were no differences in <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> <b>tree</b> within bag volumes or between rootstocks. However, the cumulative <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> unit of TCSA were higher where roots were restricted, indicating that these trees had a higher productive efficiency. The effect of root restriction across all bag volumes was to increase cumulative yield efficiency by between 215 to 1589 grams per cm² of TCSA at the 95 % confidence interval. Treatment differences in mean fruit weight in 1992 to 1994 and fruit size distribution in 1994 were attributable to their effect on crop density. Crop densities (fruit number/TCSA) and <b>yield</b> efficiencies (<b>yield</b> <b>per</b> tree/TCSA) between the bagged and unconfined treatments varied between years indicating the trees experienced an 'over charge' of fruiting. Confirming this view, all trees showed a biennial bearing trend although deviations in yield from constant cropping were not strong. The propensity towards biennial bearing did not differ between treatments. Root restriction increased apple fruit calcium concentrations and contents. This effect was independent of fruit size and was not adequately explained by differences in crop density between treatments...|$|R

The following treatments were compared: A: 20 m 3 /tree/season at weekly intervals; B: Il m 3 /tree/season at biweekly intervals; C: 8 m 3 /tree/season at triweekly intervals. Percentage of aborted flowers and total <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>tree,</b> resulted positively affected by frequent irrigations. Fruit characteristics like fresh weight, volume, fruit length and mesocarp thickness, instead were better on trees watered once every three weeks because of fruits from less yielding trees produced bigger fruits. No substantial difference {{was found between the}} first two treatments. Though the frequent watering, alternate bearing and statistically significant differences on flowering and fruit characteristics were found among the three years of experiments...|$|E
40|$|The growth, yield, kernel {{quality and}} wind {{resistance}} of Macadamia cv. Ikaika (333) introduced from Hawaii, were studied. The {{results showed that}} there was no remarkable difference of trunk height, trunk diameter and canopy diameter from Macadamia cv. Ikaika (333), Kau (344), Own Choice, Makai (800), and Keauhou (246) at their early years. The yield of young Ikaika trees was much significantly higher than that of Keauhou, Kau, Makai and significantly higher than that of Own Choice in the test field. Furthermore, the yield of Ikaika was higher than that of Keauhou, Kau, and Makai while lower than that of Own Choice in the main Macadamia producing areas in South China. Compared with the main planting areas {{in other parts of the}} world, the <b>yield</b> of Ikaika <b>per</b> <b>tree</b> in China was similar to that in South Africa while lower than that in Australia and America. However, the <b>yield</b> of Ikaika <b>per</b> km 2 here was obviously higher than that in South Africa, the same to Australia while a bit lower than Hawaii. The kernel ratio, kernel weight and crude fat content of Ikaika were similar to those produced in Australia and Hawaii. Under the condition of tropical cyclone of scale 7 to 11, our data demonstrated that Ikaika’s wind resistance was remarkably lower than Own Choice while higher than Makai, but not significantly different from Keauhou and Kau...|$|R
40|$|In Myanmar, {{natural rubber}} (Hevea brasiliensis) is mainly {{grown in the}} {{southern}} part of the country, where the rainfall is too high leading to suspension of tapping in the rainy season and intensive tapping after the rainy season. Rubber farmers face problems of uneven distribution of tapping days, low tapper productivity, high tapping cost, and shorter economical lifespan of the trees. Hence, a study was carried out to address the problems by conducting an on-farm experiment to assess performances of low frequency rubber tapping system (LFRTS) with rainguard in the area. Five treatments: (T 1) S/ 2 d 2 (no tapping in the rainy season); (T 2) S/ 2 2 d 3 (no tapping in the rainy season); (T 3) S/ 2 (RG) d 2 (tapping with rainguard in the rainy season); (T 4) S/ 2 d 3 ET 2. 5 % Pa (1) 3 /y (m) (tapping without rainguard in the rainy season); (T 5) S/ 2 (RG) d 3 ET 2. 5 % Pa (1) 3 /y (m) (tapping with rainguard in the rainy season) were evaluated. The cumulative <b>yield</b> in kilogram <b>per</b> <b>tree</b> of T 5 during the study period was comparable to that of T 1, while its daily <b>yield</b> in gram <b>per</b> tapping <b>per</b> <b>tree</b> was 23 % and 30 % higher than that of T 1 and T 2, respectively. Bark consumption of T 5 was 16 % and 39 % lower than that of T 1 and T 2, respectively. T 5 needed only 67 % of tapper requirement by d 2 frequency tapping. Tapping costs of T 5 were 17 % lower than those of conventional tapping system, T 1. The study suggested that LFRTS with rainguard could be implemented to address the problems of the farmers in the area. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Kinnow� decline was {{studied in}} {{relation}} to soil plant nutritional status under semi arid condition of Hisar (India). There were no differences between the soil pH, electrical conductivity and calcium carbonate of healthy and declining trees. The soil under the healthy trees had significantly higher organic carbon (0. 46 %) than that under declining trees (0. 35 %). The nutrients viz., N, P, Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe in the soil under healthy and declining trees {{did not differ significantly}} except K. Leaf N, Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe were significantly more in the healthy trees. The deficiency of N, P, Zn and Mn in the leaves of both categories of trees could be attributed to low contents of these nutrients in the soil under healthy and declining trees. Growth, yield and fruit quality were better in healthy trees as compared to declining trees. The <b>yield</b> on kg <b>per</b> <b>tree</b> basis in declining trees reduced (8. 43 kg/tree) as compared to that in healthy trees (20. 74 kg/tree). Low organic carbon, soil N, Zn and Mn content could be associated with the declining problem of �Kinnow�...|$|R
