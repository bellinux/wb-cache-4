[...] Copsey concluded his review praising the song and Rihanna, writing [...] "Like Rihanna herself, it's hectic, confident and unashamedly sexual." [...] Meghan Brownfield for the Columbia Missourian praised the song as a track which people will want to dance to as well as writing that the lyrics ensure that the listener pays attention to the lyrics, saying [...] "It is a song you would hear in a club that everyone would want to dance to.

[...] Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine, however, was critical of the song, writing that the song is a [...] "boring dubstep-normalizing dance number reminiscent of LMFAO," [...] as well as Rihanna's own [...] "We Found Love".|$|E

There are other optical illusions that originate from the same or similar kind of visual ambiguity, such as the Necker cube. If <b>you</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> one part of her body, such as her foot and the shadow, it is possible to switch back and forth by focusing on the opposite motion that she is currently performing with her foot.

And in some cases when able to switch back and forth with ease it looks like she is waving her leg back and forth and has lost the spinning effect entirely[...]|$|E
