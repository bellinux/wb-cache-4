25|$|Humphries has {{presented}} many successful shows in London, {{most of which}} he subsequently toured internationally. Although he eventually gained worldwide popularity, he encountered stiff resistance {{in the early years}} of his career: his first London one-man show, A Nice Night's Entertainment (1962), received scathing reviews, and it was several years before he made a second attempt. He gained considerable notoriety with his next one-man revue, Just a Show, staged at London's Fortune Theatre in 1969. It polarised the critics but was a hit with audiences and became the basis of a growing cult following in the UK. He built on this with his early '70s shows, including A Load of Olde Stuffe (1971) and At Least <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> You've Seen It (1974–75).|$|E

500|$|While {{playing for}} the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm playing {{football}} to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. [...] The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football. [...] I guess <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> {{my goal is to}} spread a Christian message." [...] At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. [...] Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that [...] "you don't need to hurt anyone to get by" [...] in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. [...] He then joked, [...] "There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence." ...|$|E

Pointing to the target to show grandfather , he said: 'After you can perform like this, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> you are an archer'. Grandfather, thanked him and asked to be allowed to try. He drew his bow, let fly his arrow and struck the end of T'ung's arrow. He shot again and again hit the mark. T'ung was greatly amazed and subsequently presented to grandfather his two favorite bows. Thereafter grandfather practiced still more [...] he was able to shoot to the left and right, accurately letting fly the arrow as he moved. When he became a general he taught this to his officers and men so that his whole army became skilled at shooting to the left and right and frequently used this technique to crush the enemy's spirit".|$|E

Kadeer has alleged that there were agents provocateurs among the crowds. Others claim that the protesters initiated the violence; for example, an Uyghur eyewitness cited by The New York Times said protesters began throwing rocks at the police. The government's official line was that the violence was not only initiated by the protesters, but also had been premeditated and coordinated by Uyghur separatists abroad. The local public security bureau said it found evidence that many Uyghurs had travelled from other cities to gather for the riot, and that they had begun preparing weapons two or three days before the riot.|$|E

500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say,</b> oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E

Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick, the person behind the floating bodies. Ruck was approached by the show's producers having envisioned him for the role. Ruck described the character, [...] "He is no dummy... and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it. Ultimately he would like to use it for good, but in so doing he causes a lot of damage. So I guess <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> he's obsessed.

500|$|Spears' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed by most critics. Linda Stasi of the New York Post asserted that Spears looked [...] "slim [...] trim and gorgeous" [...] and that [...] "her acting was {{nothing short of}} adorably believable". Stasi concluded that Spears' cameo was the highlight of [...] "Ten Sessions". David Hinckley of New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments, avouching that she [...] "proved [...] she can act every bit as well as she can sing". Michelle Zoromski of IGN argued however that while Spears' {{appearance was}} a [...] "nice change of pace from her latest public appearances", it was nonetheless a [...] "bit clunky and not as seamless as other guest roles have been on the show". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club was also less enthusiastic about the singer's performance. Bowman opined: [...] "The Big Britney Episode, as it will henceforth be known, wasn't really much to get all huffy over. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> this for the [...] team: They tend to minimize the annoyance factor of their special guest stars. Britney was a sideshow, and she got her couple of laughs, but she didn't hog the screen time." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} the game world, the team initially created a [...] "hybrid city", which producer Dan Houser describes as [...] "a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic" [...] city. Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design {{on a real}} location meant [...] "you {{have a lot of}} things <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> about it". As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in Grand Theft Auto (1997), basing it loosely on New York City. The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing Brooklyn and Queens, a commercial centre resembling Manhattan, and suburbs similar to New Jersey. The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to [...] "start out feeling poor and work to being richer". Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a [...] "hybrid of a generic American city", including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia. He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously. Sam Houser cited films and shows like Heat (1995) and The Sopranos (1999–2007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game. He also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda series (1986–present) and the film Goodfellas (1990), describing Grand Theft Auto III as [...] "a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG". Dan Houser also cited The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64 as influences.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Warn, {{editor-in-chief}} of lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com, {{thought that the}} portrayal of Emily and Naomi's relationship in the episode was [...] "a good example of a well-plotted, well-executed, and well-acted storyline coming to a satisfying conclusion", which she regarded as [...] "a noteworthy event given how few TV shows <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that about". She felt that Emily's changing relationship with Katie as {{a significant part of}} her character development made her [...] "sympathetic and relatable to those who might have otherwise have difficulty relating to a lesbian character". One critic for PopSugar.com wrote that in this episode the [...] "drama was still in full flow" [...] despite the absence of principal characters Effy and Cook, and was impressed with the episode's [...] "uplifting ending". They believed that Ronni Ancona was [...] "fab" [...] as the twins' mother, and regarded Pandora and Doug's dance at the ball as a [...] "fantastic comic moment". Ellie Newton-Syms of InJournalism Magazine was [...] "thrilled" [...] with the conclusion of Katie and Emily's storyline. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, wrote that she [...] "almost [...] like joining in" [...] when Emily cried after breaking up with Naomi, and thought that the twins' secret language was [...] "very cute and adorable". Dan French, in a review for Digital Spy, highlighted the episode's [...] "dramas aplenty" [...] and believed Katie and Emily's parents to be [...] "slightly creepy". The Suns Keeley Bolger described Katie and Emily's falling out as [...] "spectacular".|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the failed coup, Diệm blamed Durbrow for a {{perceived}} lack of US support, while his brother Nhu further accused the ambassador of colluding with the rebels. Durbrow denied this in later years, saying that he had been [...] "100% in support of Diệm". In January 1961, Diệm told Kahin of his belief the US had been involved, while Nhu told Karnow [...] "the principal culprits in the revolt were the 'western embassies' and individual Americans in particular ... American military advisers were helping the paratroopers during the revolt." [...] In May 1961, Nhu said [...] "he least <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> ... is that the State Department was neutral between a friendly government and rebels who tried to put that government down ... and the official attitude of the Americans during that coup was not at all the attitude the President would have expected". For Diệm, that Durbrow had called for restraint was an indication he saw Diệm and the rebels as equals, something Diệm saw as anathema. Durbrow called for Diệm to treat the remaining rebel leaders leniently, stressing the need for Diệm to [...] "unify all elements of the country", but Diệm was adamantly opposed to this, angrily rebuffing the ambassador, saying [...] "You apparently do not understand that the rebels caused much blood-letting", accusing them having [...] "duped" [...] innocent people. Diệm also sent Gene Gregory, an American supporter who edited the Times of Vietnaman English-language newspaper operated as a mouthpiece for the Nhus and known for stridently attacking Ngô family opponentsto meet Durbrow with concrete evidence of [...] "American support of and complicity in the coup". From the coup onwards, Diệm became increasingly suspicious of Washington's policies. He was also angry with US media coverage of the coup, which depicted Diệm as authoritarian and the revolt as a manifestation of widespread discontent. Diệm instead viewed opposition simply as troublemakers.|$|E
