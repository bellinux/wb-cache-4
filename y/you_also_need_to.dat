50|$|Kegerators are {{generally}} {{designed for use}} with beer kegs, but they are gaining popularity for dispensing other types of drinks, most notably wine, cold brewed coffee, kombucha, and soda. With home brew kegs, you can put whatever liquid you want inside the keg, pressurize it and dispense it with a kegerator. Different types of liquids require different alterations to the dispense system. Wine and cold brewed coffee use a CO2/Nitrogen blend to pressurize the kegs. These types of drinks also require all stainless steel contact with the dispense system fittings because the higher acid content can corrode the chrome plated brass normally found in dispense systems. <b>You</b> may <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> change out the beer line for silicone wine line, which {{is less likely to}} impart flavors.

50|$|The {{original}} Harvard architecture computer, the Harvard Mark I, employed entirely separate memory {{systems to}} store instructions and data. The CPU fetched the next instruction and loaded or stored data simultaneously and independently. This {{is in contrast}} to a Von Neumann architecture computer, in which both instructions and data are stored in the same memory system and (without the complexity of a CPU cache) must be accessed in turn. The physical separation of instruction and data memory is sometimes held to be the distinguishing feature of modern Harvard architecture computers. With microcontrollers (entire computer systems integrated onto single chips), the use of different memory technologies for instructions (e.g. flash memory) and data (typically read/write memory) in von Neumann machines is becoming popular. The true distinction of a Harvard machine is that instruction and data memory occupy different address spaces. In other words, a memory address does not uniquely identify a storage location (as it does in a Von Neumann machine); <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know the memory space (instruction or data) to which the address belongs.|$|E

RTS, {{which includes a}} charts and results tables, {{can be used to}} improve a restaurant’s mix of tables. While the CHR already has a web-based tool for identifying restaurant table mixes, this version of RTS is useful in that it runs in Excel. The tool contains fill-in tables that will allow restaurant managers to run “what-if” scenarios for different table mixes, using different assumptions. Additionally it provides graphical information that the web-based tool doesn’t. Finally, it allows for situations where customers select their own tables, instead of being assigned to a table by a host or hostess, a scenario common in many restaurants. These features make this version of interest and more accessible to a wider group of restaurant managers and hospitality educators. **In order to run this tool you need Excel 2007 or later (for PC), or Excel 2011 or later (for Mac).
