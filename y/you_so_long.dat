[...] Dyer became a known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while they walked out of the meeting house together. [...] Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth. [...] Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate. [...] In the first of two letters of Dyer's that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, [...] "if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of <b>you,</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two years". [...] Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries. [...] Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was not ashamed of doing so. [...] This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members. [...] The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines, but also the boundaries of age and class.|$|E
2500|$|After Brannick posted it on {{the wall}} of the team's press room, Lee's {{petition}} earned him congratulatory letters from Chinese Americans all over the country, and became national news, earning time on the television series What's the Story. Jack Orr, a Sporting News writer, went to Lee's restaurant and told him he was right to object. [...] "Writers shouldn't be using that term", he said. [...] "But what took <b>you</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> to get around to protesting?" [...] Two years later, another New York sportswriter, Jimmy Cannon, noted when defining [...] "Chinese home run" [...] in a glossary of baseball terms he wrote for Baseball Digest that it [...] "would probably be called something else if the Chinese had more influence".|$|E
2500|$|Diogenes {{arrived in}} Athens with a slave named Manes who {{abandoned}} him shortly thereafter. With characteristic humor, Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying, [...] "If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes?" [...] Diogenes would mock such a relation of extreme dependency. He found {{the figure of}} a master who could do nothing for himself contemptibly helpless. He was attracted by the ascetic teaching of Antisthenes, a student of Socrates. When Diogenes asked Antisthenes to mentor him, Antisthenes ignored him and reportedly [...] "eventually beat him off with his staff". Diogenes responds, [...] "Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from <b>you,</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as I think you've something to say." [...] Diogenes became Antisthenes' pupil, despite the brutality with which he was initially received. [...] Whether the two ever really met is still uncertain, but he surpassed his master in both reputation and the austerity of his life. He considered his avoidance of earthly pleasures a contrast to and commentary on contemporary Athenian behaviors. This attitude was grounded in a disdain for what he regarded as the folly, pretense, vanity, self-deception, and artificiality of human conduct.|$|E
