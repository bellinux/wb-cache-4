500|$|There {{are over}} [...] of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park. Most of the trails are rocky and steep, so hikers are {{encouraged}} to wear proper footgear and {{to be prepared for}} icy conditions during the cold winter months. As John Young writes in Hike Pennsylvania, [...] "If you want to do some hiking in the Worlds End region, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> that hiking here means climbing". Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands.|$|E

500|$|Christiansen {{reportedly}} {{purchased a}} house with cash {{a few months after}} the hijacking. While dying of cancer in 1994 he told Lyle, [...] "There is something <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know,</b> but I cannot tell you." [...] Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain. After Christiansen's death family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.|$|E
500|$|Palmer {{gave the}} quote during a radio series of Men <b>You</b> <b>Should</b> <b>Know</b> {{describing}} {{the life of}} Webster about forty years after Webster died. [...] Palmer {{said that he was}} paraphrasing Webster, and given the lapse of time and the casual nature of a Sunday School class, Orton believes it unlikely to be an exact quote. [...] Orton believes Palmer was trying to emphasize Webster's character, rather than give a definitive statement on the faithfulness of {{all the members of the}} Willie Martin handcart company, and finds it unlikely that it was an exact quote. [...] Orton also finds it unlikely that Webster knew all of the survivors, given that they spread throughout Utah after they arrived and didn't have a reunion until after Webster's death. [...] Orton believes Webster was only referring to the pioneers in Cedar City, where the quote was given.|$|E

[...] ISIS responded on Telegram by calling them [...] "idiots", and asking [...] "What they [...] hack?" [...] By the next day, however, Anonymous claimed to have taken down 3,824 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts, and by the third, more than 5,000, and to have doxxed recruiters. A week later, Anonymous increased their claim to 20,000 accounts and released a list of the accounts. The list included the Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, The New York Times and BBC News. The BBC reported that most of the accounts on the list appeared to be still active. A spokesman for Twitter told The Daily Dot that the company is not using the lists of accounts being reported by Anonymous, as they have been found to be “wildly inaccurate” and include accounts used by academics and journalists.|$|E

500|$|Hatt-ı hümayuns on {{the white}} were more {{elaborate}} and some may have been drafted by a scribe before being penned by the Sultan. They often started by addressing the recipient. The Sultan would refer to his grand vizier as [...] "My Vizier", or if his grand vizier was away at war, would refer to his deputy as [...] "Ka'immakâm Paşa". Those written to other officials would often start with an expression like [...] "You who are my Vizier of Rumeli, Mehmed Pasha" [...] ("Sen ki Rumili vezîrim Mehmed Paşa'sın"). The head of religious affairs (Şeyhülislam) or the Sultan's personal tutor would be addressed simply and respectfully. In cases where the hatt-ı hümayun was to be delivered ceremoniously, with an imperial sword and a cloak, as in an appointment to a high rank, {{there would be a}} flowery salutation such as [...] "after I have honored you with my glorious greeting <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> that..." [...] (seni selâm-ı şâhanemle teşrif eylediğimden sonra malumun ola ki...). Correspondence to a military commander could have a lengthy and ornate salutation or just address him by his title. A note without an address was meant for the grand vizier or his deputy.|$|E
