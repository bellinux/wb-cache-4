An accomplished jazz musician (The Lounge Lizards being a jazz band's name), Lowe also wrote the main theme music (called [...] "For <b>Your</b> <b>Thighs</b> Only"), {{and some of his}} compositions appear in later entries of the series. The theme, inspired by Irving Berlin's 1929 song [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band", was composed within 20 minutes. Lowe said it [...] "sounded so unusual, so different, so fresh compared to most computer game music, that I decided to write something with the same pep, simplicity, humor, and out-of-sync attitude." ...|$|E

Music journalist Greg Levine cited its lyrics as [...] "the generic pop lyrics", while also noting the similarity the lyrics have to those of other classic soul ballads, stating [...] "Each line seems to be directly lifted from Marvin Gaye, Prince, or Curtis Mayfield."

500|$|Co-written by Raphael Saadiq, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] is {{a tribute}} to one of D'Angelo's primary influences, Prince, and evokes his early [...] The {{similarity}} of D'Angelo's music on Voodoo to Prince was addressed in Saul Williams's liner notes, as he stated [...] "I'd pay to see Prince's face as he listens to this album." [...] Questlove described the song as [...] "finding the line between parody and honesty [...] In an era of 'the cover song', redoing a Prince song was taboo. This is the second best thing". It follows a six eight signature and features electric guitar interplay throughout, which is reminiscent of the Jimi Hendrix guitar style and [...] "Maggot Brain" [...] sound. The song contains a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic. D'Angelo's vocals were overdubbed several times to produce the sound of a choir singing harmonies during choruses, all of which were sung by D'Angelo.

2500|$|In late 2004, Hunt was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and told to have surgery to remove her right breast and her lymph nodes. Hunt postponed seeking treatment for five months, later wondering if she would have faced first stage rather than third stage cancer had she not. When she chose to have surgery, she decided to have it done in Ireland, because she felt that the Irish are more supportive and comfortable with illness than people in the U.S.; she envisaged that treatment in the U.S. would feel impersonal. Hunt decided to have a complete mastectomy with no following reconstruction. She says, [...] "Reconstruction – as if the breast is miraculously put back to the way it was. In fact, pretty much all you get is your cleavage back; you don't get any feeling or sensitivity... They take muscles from your back, skin from <b>your</b> <b>thighs,</b> fat from your stomach. You had a breast removed, but the rest of you was fine. Now half your body is hacked about – and for what?" [...] The day of her operation Hunt wrote a note on her breast to the surgical team, telling them to have fun, make sure they took the right breast off and drew them a flower.|$|E

See! sportive Fate, to punish awkward pride, Bids Bubo build, and sends him such a guide. A standing sermon, at each year's expense, That never coxcomb reached magnificence! [...] You show us, Rome was glorious, not profuse, And pompous buildings once were things of use. Yet shall, my lord, your just, your noble rules Fill half the land with imitating fools; Who random drawings from your sheets shall take, And of one beauty many blunders make; Load some vain church with old theatric state, Turn arcs of triumph to a garden-gate; Reverse your ornaments, and hang them all On some patched dog-hole eked with ends of wall; Then clap four slices of pilaster on 't, That, laced with bits of rustic, makes a front Shall call the winds through long arcades to roar, Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door; Conscious they act a true Palladian part, And, if they starve, they starve by rules of art. [...] Oft have you hinted to your brother peer A certain truth, which many buy too dear: Something there is more needful than expense, And something previous even to taste--'tis sense. Good sense, which only is the gift of Heaven, And though no science, fairly worth the seven: A light, which in yourself you must perceive: Jones and Le Notre have it not to give. [...] To build, to plant, whatever you intend, To rear the column, or the arch to bend, To swell the terrace, or to sink the grot; In all, let Nature never be forgot. But treat the goddess like a modest fair, Nor over-dress, nor leave her wholly bare; Let not each beauty everywhere be spied, Where half the skill is decently to hide. He gains all points, who pleasingly confounds, Surprises, varies, and conceals the bounds. [...] Consult {{the genius of the}} place in all; That tells the waters or to rise or fall, Or helps the ambitious hill the heavens to scale, Or scoops in circling theatres the vale; Calls in the country, catches opening glades, Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades; Now breaks, or now directs, the intending lines; Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs. [...] Still follow sense, of every art the soul, Parts answering parts shall slide into a whole, Spontaneous beauties all around advance, Start even from difficulty, strike from chance; Nature shall join you; Time shall make it grow A work to wonder at--perhaps a Stowe. [...] Without it, proud Versailles, thy glory falls; And Nero's terraces desert their walls: The vast parterres a thousand hands shall make; Lo! Cobham comes, and floats them with a lake: Or cut wide views through mountains to the plain, You'll wish your hill or sheltered seat again. Even in an ornament its place remark, Nor in a hermitage set Dr. Clarke. [...] Behold Villario's ten years' toil complete: His quincunx darkens, his espaliers meet; The wood supports the plain, the parts unite, And strength of shade contends with strength of light; A waving glow the bloomy beds display, Blushing in bright diversities of day, With silver-quivering rills meandered o'er-- Enjoy them, you! Villario can no more; Tired of the scene parterres and fountains yield, He finds at last he better likes a field. [...] Through his young woods how pleased Sabinus strayed, Or sat delighted in the thickening shade, With annual joy the reddening shoots to greet, Or see the stretching branches long to meet! His son's fine taste an opener vista loves, Foe to the Dryads of his father's groves; One boundless green, or flourished carpet views, With all the mournful family of yews; The thriving plants, ignoble broomsticks made, Now sweep those alleys they were born to shade. [...] At Timon's villa let us pass a day, Where all cry out, [...] "What sums are thrown away!" [...] So proud, so grand; of that stupendous air, Soft and agreeable come never there. Greatness, with Timon, dwells in such a draught As brings all Brobdingnag before your thought. To compass this, his building is a town, His pond an ocean, his parterre a down: Who but must laugh, the master when he sees, A puny insect, shivering at a breeze! Lo, what huge heaps of littleness around! The whole, a laboured quarry above ground; Two Cupids squirt before; a lake behind Improves the keenness of the northern wind. His gardens next your admiration call, On every side you look, behold the wall! No pleasing intricacies intervene, No artful wildness to perplex the scene; Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother, And half the platform just reflects the other. The suffering eye inverted Nature sees, Trees cut to statues, statues thick as trees With here a fountain, never to be played; And there a summer-house, that knows no shade; Here Amphitrite sails through myrtle bowers; There gladiators fight or die in flowers; Unwatered see the drooping sea-horse mourn, And swallows roost in Nilus' dusty urn.

In books, not authors, curious is my lord; To all their dated backs he turns you round: These Aldus printed, those Du Sueil has bound, Lo, some are vellum, and the rest as good For all his lordship knows, but they are wood. For Locke or Milton 'tis in vain to look; These shelves admit not any modern book. [...] And now the chapel's silver bell you hear, That summons you to all the pride of prayer; Light quirks of music, broken and uneven, Make the soul dance upon a jig to heaven. On painted ceilings you devoutly stare, Where sprawl the saints of Verrio or Laguerre, On gilded clouds in fair expansion lie, And bring all Paradise before your eye. To rest, the cushion and soft Dean invite, Who never mentions hell to ears polite.

Is this a dinner? this a genial room? No, 'tis a temple, and a hecatomb. A solemn sacrifice, performed in state, You drink by measure, and to minutes eat. So quick retires each flying course, you'd swear Sancho's dread doctor and his wand were there. Between each act the trembling salvers ring, From soup to sweet-wine, and God bless the King. In plenty starving, tantalised in state, And complaisantly helped to all I hate, Treated, caressed, and tired, I take my leave, Sick of his civil pride from morn to eve; I curse such lavish cost and little skill, And swear no day was ever past so ill. [...] Yet hence the poor are clothed, the hungry fed; Health to himself, and to his infants bread The labourer bears; what his hard heart denies His charitable vanity supplies. [...] Another age shall see the golden ear Embrown the slope, and nod on the parterre, Deep harvests bury all his pride has planned, And laughing Ceres re-assume the land. [...] Who then shall grace, or who improve the soil? Who plants like Bathurst, or who builds like Boyle. 'Tis use alone that sanctifies expense, And splendour borrows all her rays from sense. [...] His father's acres who enjoys in peace, Or makes his neighbours glad, if he increase: Whose cheerful tenants bless their yearly toil, Yet to their lord owe more than to the soil; Whose ample lawns are not ashamed to feed The milky heifer and deserving steed; Whose rising forests, not for pride or show, But future buildings, future navies, grow: Let his plantations stretch from down to down, First shade a country, and then raise a town. [...] You too proceed! make falling arts your care, Erect new wonders, and the old repair; Jones and Palladio to themselves restore, And be whate'er Vitruvius was before: 'Till kings call forth the ideas of your mind (Proud to accomplish what such hands denied) Bid harbours open, public ways extend, Bid temples, worthier of the god, ascend; Bid the broad arch the dangerous flood contain, The mole projected break the roaring main; Back to his bounds their subject sea command, And roll obedient rivers through the land: These honours peace to happy Britain brings, These are imperial works, and worthy kings.|$|E

5000|$|The Roman {{imperial}} coronation {{evolved over}} the thousand years of the empire's existence from an originally very simple ritual (but which by its very simplicity paralleled and most clearly demonstrated its origins in its Byzantine counterpart) to one of increasing complexity. The oldest manuscript of the Roman imperial coronation ritual {{is found in the}} 9th century Gemunden Codex and while it is uncertain for whom (if anyone) the ritual described in it was intended to be used in it we come the closest to seeing the very types of forms which would have been used for Charlemagne himself. The ritual began with a short prayer for the Emperor, [...] "Hear our prayer, Lord, and those of your servant...". This was immediately followed by the prayer, [...] "Look, Almighty God, with a serene gaze on this, your glorious servant,...", in which a golden crown was placed on the Emperor's head during the words of the concluding phrase of this prayer, [...] "Through whom honor and glory are yours through infinite ages of ages. Amen." [...] A sword was then given to the Emperor with the word, [...] "Receive this sword by the hands of bishops, who, though unworthy, are consecrated to be in the place and authority of the holy Apostles, deliver it to you, with our blessing, to serve for the defense of the holy Church, divinely ordained, and remember of whom the Psalmist prophesised, saying, 'Gird the sword upon <b>your</b> <b>thigh,</b> O most Powerful One, that with it you may exercise equity.'", a form which would have a long history both in the imperial coronation ritual and in those of numerous European royal coronation rituals as well. The Laudes Imperiale (a series of formal acclamations that originated in Roman times—see below) were then chanted. The ceremony traditionally took place in the Italian city of Bologna.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} produce rapid muscle force and joint torque is {{important}} for performance in sports, injury prevention and rehabilitation, and balance recovery. One way to measure rapid torque production is rate of torque development (RTD), which is {{the slope of the}} torque-time curve. Interventions aimed at increasing RTD are of interest. Adopting an external focus of attention, which is focused on one’s environment, has been found to enhance peak torque production compared to an internal focus of attention, which is focused on one’s bodily movements. However, the effects of focus of attention on RTD is unknown. Methods: Thirty participants evenly split between sexes (age = 22. 1 ± 2. 6 years, mass = 78. 98 ± 11. 71 kg, and height = 173. 78 ± 11. 00 cm) completed a minimum of three and a maximum of eight trials of maximal voluntary isometric contractions of the knee extensors under both external and internal focus conditions. External focus instructions were, “While looking straight ahead, try to push out as hard and fast as you can while focusing on the device arm. ” Internal focus instructions were, “While looking straight ahead, try to push out as hard and fast as you can while focusing on the muscles on the front of <b>your</b> <b>thigh.</b> ” Paired t-tests were used to compare the two conditions for both peak torque and RTD. Results: RTD was significantly greater during the external focus condition than during the internal focus condition (external focus 11. 16 ± 4. 98 N·m·kg- 1 ·s- 1 versus internal focus 9. 92 ± 4. 22 N·m·kg- 1 ·s- 1, p = 0. 0248). There {{was no significant difference in}} peak torque between conditions (external focus 2. 14 ± 0. 60 N·m·kg- 1 versus internal focus 2. 08 ± 0. 61 N·m·kg- 1, p = 0. 1887). Conclusion: An external focus of attention elicited a 12. 4 % greater RTD than the internal focus of attention. However, there was no difference in peak torque condition. This improved rapid torque production may be important in situations that require explosive movement, such as in sport performance and the prevention of injuries and falls...|$|R

In New Zealand the thorny vine is best known as bush lawyer.

The berry is shaped like a small blackberry and was once used by early Europeans to make jams and jellies.

5000|$|According {{to ancient}} custom {{just before the}} {{coronation}} proper the Archbishop of Esztergom handed the Holy Crown to the Count Palatine (Nádor) who lifted it up {{and showed it to}} the people and asked if they accept the elect as their king (this is part of the Coronational Ordo of Mainz, which historians like György Györffy theorized that could be the one used). The people responded, [...] "Agreed, so be it, long live the king!" [...] A bishop then presented the king to the Archbishop requesting him {{in the name of the}} Church to proceed with his coronation. The Archbishop asked the king three questions—if the king agreed to protect the holy faith, if he agreed to protect the holy Church and if he agreed to protect the kingdom—to each of which the king responded, [...] "I will." [...] The king then took the oath, [...] "I, N., grant and promise in the sight of God and of the angels," [...] etc. The Archbishop then said the prayer:Almighty and everlasting God, Creator of all things, Commander of angels, King of kings and Lord of lords, who caused your faithful servant Abraham to triumph over his enemies, gave many victories to Moses and Joshua, the leaders of your people, exalted your humble servant David to the eminence of kingship, enriched Solomon with the ineffable gifts of wisdom and peace. Hear our humble prayers and multiply your blessings upon your servant, whom in prayerful devotion we consecrate our king; that he, being strengthened with the faith of Abraham, endowed with the meekness of Moses, armed with the courage of Joshua, exalted with the humility of David and distinguished with the wisdom of Solomon, may please you in all things and always walk without offense in the way of justice. May he nourish and teach, defend and instruct your Church and people and as a powerful king administer a vigorous regimen against all visible and invisible powers and, with your aid, restore their souls to the concord of true faith and peace; that, supported by the ready obedience and glorified by the due love of these, his people, he may by your mercy ascend to the position of his forefathers and, defended by the helmet of your protection, covered with your invincible shield and completely clothed with heavenly armour, he may in total victoriously triumph and by his power intimidate the unfaithful and bring peace to those who fight for you, through our Lord, who by the vigor of his Cross has destroyed Hell, overcame the Devil, ascended into heaven, in whom subsists all power, kingship and victory, who is the glory of the humble and the life and salvation of his people, he who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen. [...] The king then prostrated himself before the altar as the Litany of the Saints was sung. After this the Archbishop anointed the king on his right forearm and between his shoulders as he said the prayer:God, the Son of God, Jesus Christ, our Lord, who was anointed by his Father with the oil of gladness above his fellows, through this present sacred anointing pour over your head the blessing of the Spirit Paraclete to penetrate into your innermost heart that you may receive invisible grace and that having justly governed a temporal kingdom, you may reign with him eternally, he who alone is without sin, the King of king, living and glorified with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. [...] Then the Mass for the day was begun with the Archbishop saying after the Collect for the day, the additional prayer, [...] "God who reigns over all," [...] etc. After the Gradual and Alleluia the king was invested with the Hungarian regalia. The king was first invested and girded with the Sword of St. Stephen with the formula:Accept this sword through the hands of bishops, who unworthy, yet consecrated by the authority of the holy apostles, impart it to you by divine ordinance for the defence of the faith of the holy Church and remember the words of the psalmist, who prophesied, saying, [...] "Gird yourself with your sword upon <b>your</b> <b>thigh,</b> O most mighty one, that by it you may exercise equity, powerfully destroying the growth of iniquity and protect the holy Church of God and his faithful people. Pursue false Christians, no less than the unfaithful, help and defend widows and orphans, restore those things which have fallen into decay and maintain those things thus restored, avenge injustice and confirm good dispositions, that doing this, you may be glorious in the triumph of justice and may reign forever with the Savior of the world, whose image you bear, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns, forever and ever. Amen. The king then brandished the sword three times. The king was then crowned with the Holy Crown as the Archbishop said the formula [...] "Accept this royal crown," [...] etc. [...] Next the king was given the Scepter with the formula:Accept the Rod of virtue and equity. Learn to respect the pious and to intimidate the proud; guide the straying; lend a hand to the fallen; repress the proud and raise the humble, that our Lord Jesus Christ may open to you the door, he who said of himself, [...] "I am the Door, whoever enters by me, bu me shall be saved," [...] and let he who is the Key of David and the Scepter of the House of Israel, be your helper, he who opens and no one may shut, who shuts and no one may open; who brings the captive out of prison, where he sits in darkness and the shadow of death, that in all things you may imitate him, of whom the Prophet David said, [...] "Your seat, O God, endures forever; a rod of righteousness is the rod of your kingdom. You justice and hate iniquity, therefore, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows," [...] Jesus Christ, our Lord. [...] Then the Orb was placed into his left hand without any formula and the king was enthroned with the formula:Be steadfast and hold fast to that place of which you have become heir by succession from your forefathers, now delegated to you by the authority of Almighty God and transmitted to you by us and all the bishops and servants of God and when you see the clergy draw near to the holy altar, remember to give them appropriate honor that the Mediator between God and humanity may confirm you in this royal position as the mediator between clergy and laity and that you may be able to reign with Jesus Christ, our Lord, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen. According to some accounts the Te deum was then sung followed by the responsory:Let your hand be strengthened and your right hand be exalted. Let justice and judgment be the foundations of your throne and mercy and truth go before your face. Alleluia. Ps. Have mercy on me,... Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Let your hand be strengthened,... The Archbishop then said either the prayer, [...] "God who made Moses victorious" [...] or the prayer [...] "Inerrant God." [...] The people then greeted the king with the words, [...] "Life, health, happiness, victory!" [...] after which the Mass proceeded to its conclusion.|$|R
