40|$|In {{the period}} 1998 – 2001 {{significant}} numbers of vine samples of different varieties, grafted onto different rootstocks, ready for out-planting or planted and declined a few months or years later, were collected or sent to our laboratory to investigate the presence of phytopathogenic fungi. Three hundred eighty rooted cuttings ready for outplanting, 1250 <b>young</b> <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> and exhibiting decline symptoms {{in the first year}} of establishment, 82 vines two to nine years old and 27 old vines exhibiting the classical esca symptoms were examined. Isolations yielded the fungi Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Fomitiporia punctata and Stereum hirsutum, as well as other fungi of the genera Phaeoacremonium, Cylindrocarpon and Botryosphaeria. The low incidence of these fungi isolated in a low percentage of samples suggested that they could not by themselves be the cause of young grapevine decline. Abiotic causes, such as lesions from improperly healed rootstock disbudding sites and graft unions made in the nursery, as well as improper storage and transportation conditions of the propagated material must also have played a role and made the decline more acute. The occurrence of the isolated fungi as endophytes and their role in the outbreak of grapevine decline remain to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive case study and a psychological examination of lianas intended for their landscaping application. In the Introduction, {{the significance of}} the study is represented by showing why the study for use of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> in Japan is belated to those in Europe and America and also the possibility of the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> being used extensively in the urban green and landscaping projects in Japan. In Chapter 1, the characteristics of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are investigated theoretically, and a methodological framework for case study and analysis is examined. First, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are classified in seven categories {{from the point of view}} that they are organs climbing on other objects, and to these is added one category for other plants showing similar properties to the lianas, being specified as 2 ̆ 2 lianoid plants. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are classified in total eight categories according to their characteristics for application. On the other hand, the structures on which the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are dependent are classified in fifteen types. Then, theoretically possible combinations of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> and their supports are investigated, and a table serving as a basis for analysis is prepared. In Chapter 2, the result of investigation and analysis of the cases of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> mainly in the urban area in Tokyo is shown, and the problems to be resolved hereafter are discussed. The findings of the investigation are generally as follows: a) The <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> used over a wall of a large scale are comprised overwhelmingly of Japanese ivy which has a strong adsorptive force shows a growth coming up to a height of 20 m in about 10 years; b) With the new type commercial high-rise buildings, nutant characteristics of the plants of the hedera genus are generally employed; c) With the tea houses, restanrants and other similar shops, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are used in order to give an impression of Western style; d) In the independent houses, use of a variety of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> is seen; e) For the trellis, the traditional wisteria is used generally...|$|R

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaDifferent {{species in}} Botryosphaeriaceae fungi are {{commonly}} associated with black dead arm, bot canker, dieback, excoriose and esca diseases of grapevine. These grapevine trunk diseases are of major importance in Portugal and in many other grapevine growing regions of the world. The phenotypic and molecular characterisation of 43 Botryosphaeriaceae isolates, obtained from grapevine propagating materials, <b>young</b> and mature <b>vine</b> <b>plants,</b> allowed the identification of B. dothidea (two isolates), “B”. obtusa (19 isolates), “B”. stevensii (three isolates), “B”. viticola (one isolate), “B”. lutea (one isolate), “B”. parva (14 isolates) and “Botryosphaeria” spp. (three isolates). This is the first record of “B”. viticola in Portugal. Pathogenicity tests carried out with Botryosphaeriaceae isolates in grapevine (in vivo assays) revealed the intra-specific variation among isolates. The efficacy of tebuconazol, pyraclostrobine, pyraclostrobine+metiram and cyprodinil+fludioxonil fungicides as mycelial growth inhibitors was confirmed against B”. parva, “B”. obtusa, “B”. lutea e “B”. stevensii, being cyprodinil+fludioxonil the best fungicide tested (lowest EC 50 values). The efficacy of pyraclostrobine, metiram, and pyraclostrobine+metiram as spore germination inhibitors was confirmed against “B”. parva and “B”. obtusa, being pyraclostrobine+metiram the best fungicide tested (lowest EC 50 values). The potential use of such fungicides to control the Botryosphaeriaceae diseases {{in the field is}} promising, as often in the same vine different Botryosphaeriaceae species are present. This would also allow the alternation of products to avoid resistance risks...|$|R

Commercial vineyard soil with high Cu levels was placed in plastic tubes and transplanted with <b>young</b> <b>vines,</b> which were inoculated with six AMF species (Dentiscutata heterogama, Gigaspora gigantea, Acaulospora morrowiae, A. colombiana, Rhizophagus clarus, R. irregularis) and a control treatment on randomized blocks with 12 replicates. After 130 days, the mycorrhizal colonization, root and shoot dry matter (DM), height increment, P and Cu absorption, and chlorophyll contents were evaluated. The height increment, shoot DM and chlorophyll contents were not promoted by AMF, although the root DM was increased by R. clarus and R. irregularis, which had the greatest mycorrhizal colonization and P uptake. AMF increased Cu absorption but decreased its transport to shoots. Thus, AMF species, particularly R. clarus and R. irregularis, contribute to the establishment of <b>young</b> <b>vines</b> exposed to high Cu levels...|$|R
