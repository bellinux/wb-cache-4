5000|$|In early January 1990, Nova Scotia Power {{announced}} that the Japanese industrial conglomerate Mitsui had won the RFP that had been issued in fall 1988 and a contract was signed {{on behalf of the}} Government of Nova Scotia. The proposal detailed a turnkey project designed by Mitsui with the CFB steam boiler supplied by Pyro-Power through Kamtech Services (a subsidiary of The Lauren Corporation of Abilene, Texas), project management and engineering by Chicago-based Sargent & Lundy LLC, and construction of the plant itself by Jones Power Corporation. Two weeks later, the provincial government {{announced that}} its Environmental Control Council would conduct a one-day hearing into the project on January 18, 1990 in place of the PUB hearings conducted the previous spring which were aborted {{as a result of the}} amendment to the Public Utilities Act. This hearing received submissions from citizens and organizations that were strongly opposed to the Point Aconi Generating Station, pointing out the environmental impact, that its generating capacity wasn't required, and that it was a political mega-project that would add to the financial debt of the publicly owned Nova Scotia Power Corporation. Other submissions from citizens and organizations were supportive of the project, which they claimed would create an estimated 500 construction and operating jobs, as well as theoretically guarantee work in Cape Breton's coal mines; the United Mine Workers of America Local 26 had lobbied hard for the power plant. Richie Mann, the environment critic for the official opposition Liberal Party asked at the one-day hearing [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> evidence that this process is not an exercise in public relations, a sham?" ...|$|E

The story was recounted by Rosenbaum as starting three years before the recordings were made. When {{he was growing up}} in Indianapolis, Rosenbaum knew an African-American woman who said that he [...] "had to meet a man that she knew, who played guitar, played blues and christian songs, they'll make the hairs stand up {{on the back of your}} neck." [...] Rosenbaum subsequently met Blackwell: [...] "I met the gentleman across the street from the Methodist hospital in Indianapolis". Blackwell's friend said, [...] "well he hasn't got a guitar", so Rosenbaum said, [...] "well I got a guitar." [...] Blackwell than said that he needed some [...] "bird food". Rosenbaum did not understand what he was referring to, so Blackwell explained, [...] "you gotta get some bird food for the bird, before the bird sings... beer!" [...] Rosenbaum said, [...] "I'm too young!" [...] Blackwell continued, [...] "we'll buy the beer, <b>you</b> just <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> money."

6000|$|Arriving at a {{small stream}} they ordered the Indian to make a fire, and took turns to watch over the guns. While he was thus occupied, Gist, a veteran woodsman, and {{accustomed}} to hold {{the life of an}} Indian rather cheap, was somewhat incommoded by the scruples of his youthful commander, which might enable the savage to carry out some scheme of treachery. He observed to Washington that, since he would not suffer the Indian to be killed, they must manage {{to get him out of}} the way, and then decamp with all speed, and travel all night to leave this perfidious neighborhood behind them; but first it was necessary to blind the guide as to their intentions. He accordingly addressed him in a friendly tone, and adverting to the late circumstance, pretended to suppose that he had lost his way, and fired his gun merely as a signal. The Indian, whether deceived or not, readily chimed in with the explanation. He said he now knew the way to his cabin, which was at no great distance. [...] "Well then," [...] replied Gist, [...] "you can go home, and as we are tired we will remain here for the night, and follow your track at daylight.

5000|$|Ludwig {{was among}} several civilians observing the {{progress}} of the Battle of Caloocan, fought between insurgents led by Emilio Aguinaldo and the Oregon Volunteers, soldiers of the United States Army, from a stone bridge over the Malabon River near Furageros on 26 March 1899. Ludwig and the other spectators were then warned by an orderly that they were in danger in their current position. The orderly addressed Ludwig directly: [...] "I am speaking to you particularly. <b>You</b> have already <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> trouble by hanging around the firing line, and we will have no more of it." [...] According to fellow civilian spectator C. S. Bradford in The New York Times, Ludwig and a companion left the position and disappeared into the nearby forest which later became the scene of fighting. Oregon Volunteers soldiers were ordered to fire upon the houses in the woods, in one of which was Ludwig. A bullet fired by an Oregonian soldier entered Ludwig's right side, killing him instantly. Bradford and two others took charge of Ludwig's body. A passport found on Ludwig's person was signed by Aguinaldo confirming that he had been granted permission to enter the lines of the insurgents at will. C. S. Bradford recounted these events to The New York Times upon his return from the Philippines to his home in San Francisco, California in May 1899. Ludwig's date of death was also confirmed by the Oregon Volunteers in their official account of the war published in 1902.|$|R
