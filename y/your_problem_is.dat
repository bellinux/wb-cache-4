6000|$|A great drift at {{the foot}} of the cliff saved me. I picked myself up, fearfully bruised but with nothing broken, found my rifle and limped away four miles through the woods to the road, {{thinking}} as I went that I was well served for having delivered the deer [...] "from the power of the dog," [...] only to take advantage of their long run to secure a head that my skill had failed to win. I wondered, with an extra twinge in my limp, whether I had saved Old Wally by taking the chase out of his hands unceremoniously. Above all, I wondered--and here I would gladly follow another trail over the same ground--whether the noble beast, grown weary with running, his splendid strength failing for the first time, and his little, long-tended flock ready to give in and have the tragedy over, knew just what he was doing in mincing along the cliff's edge with his heedless enemy close behind. What did he think and feel, looking back from his hiding, and what did his loud whistle mean? But that is always the despair of studying the wild things.

In MSAA, all {{new college}} {{students}} (mahasantri) must be learning with the pattern of pesantren education. The problem is, not all mahasantri feel ready {{to stay in the}} boarding school program. Various reasons are put forward are mostly considered himself not have the capital to study in boarding school and others felt they was too long to stay in the boarding school before. But, on the other hand, some of students enthusiastically participated for this program. In an effort to accomplish objectives of MSAA program, it is required study-related mahasantri‘s needs and psychological dynamics for implementing this program. This study aims to obtain the mapping of social support for mahasantri, both pleasant conditions as well as unpleasant conditions. The study involved 87 mahasantri with a survey method. The study used open-ended questionnaire as data inquiry. Some questions include on the positive experiences, such as "Tell us briefly what your benefits during stay in MSSA?" “Are there people who most often assist you to achieve your benefit during stay in MSAA?” In negative experience, "Tell me what <b>your</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> greatest during stay in MSAA" "How do you solve a problem that you felt are" and "who helps resolve your problem?" The results showed that that mahasantri felt lucky to get friend a lot and had opportunity to learn the science of religion. The result also showed that mahasantri, majority stated that friends as contribute part to got benefit. On the negative experi-ence, there is a wide variation, such as got a penalty, and involved a conflict with others. Mushrifs and roommate is a party who was considered helpfull to overcoming these negative conditions. According the results, this study indicate that the process experienced by mahasantri in MSAA, cannot seperate from personalized environment. It mean, that consideration and the risk of the existence of such parties should be part of a great management of education design in MSAA...|$|E
40|$|Domesticating {{wild fruit}} trees Cue: In Cameroon, {{as in other}} parts of Africa, people derive many {{benefits}} from wild, or indigenous, tree species. They are an important source of food and medicines for farming families, and can also be a source of income. However many forest fruit trees are being lost through deforestation and farmers are having to walk farther and farther from their homes to harvest them. One solution to this problem is for farmers to plant wild fruit species near their homes, a process called domestication. Ann Degrande, who works for ICRAF, the World Agroforestry Centre, in Cameroon, has been part of a programme to support fruit tree domestication. She spoke to Martha Chindong about the benefits indigenous fruit trees can offer, both to farmers and to the environment, and about the challenges facing farmers who want to earn income from their fruit. Martha began by asking whether the programme itself was supplying farmers with tree seedlings to plant. IN:		?The technology we are developing now is tree domestication. ? OUT:		?. will get him a more diverse package of income. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ann Degrande of the World Agroforestry Centre on how planting indigenous fruit trees benefits both farmers and the environment. Transcript Degrande	The technology we are developing now is tree domestication and we want people to select their own trees. So the best trees they can find in their environment. We teach them how to multiply, how to propagate those best trees that they can find in their environment. However, sometimes farmers in a particular village are asking for new species, for new trees that they can?t find in their environment. And then we try to link them up with other communities, with other farmers in other areas that have those trees on their farms. And we try to develop a kind of exchange of seeds or vegetative material. Chindong	What are the environmental aspects of it, are they really achieving anything? Degrande	That is a very interesting question, and the great advantage of agroforestry is that it can combine poverty alleviation and environmental protection. Because we are talking here of planting more trees to help farmers to get more income but by planting those trees we are also protecting the environment. Chindong	You talked of fruit trees or domestication. I wanted to find out whether these trees they plant only help for environmental protection or they have other benefits from the trees? Degrande	Trees usually have a lot of benefits. Trees can give fruits that can be sold on the market that can give income. The same fruits can also be eaten, consumed by the household and that has advantages for everybody in the household to have a more balanced diet, to have more vitamins, to have more minerals in their diet. The other benefit that trees have is that they can provide firewood, they can give shade, they can also protect against wind. Trees have many benefits and that?s the good thing about trees. Chindong	Ann, if I can get you well, it means that as of now you don?t have any problem with farmers accepting the new techniques of agroforestry, <b>your</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> only to extend the technique? Degrande	No, that would be too much said. There are always problems when you introduce a new technology. First of all there is the problem of sensitising people. People need to be sensitised and informed about the new technique and the benefits of trees and the benefits of tree domestication. That is the first thing. The second thing is adopting new techniques and especially vegetative propagation needs some initial investment. You need for instance to set up a nursery, that requires some financial means, that sometimes individual farmers cannot have. Sometimes farmers group themselves and try to generate the necessary means to set up a nursery. But sometimes they need some help, they need financial support, maybe in the form of credit from NGO?s or the government. And then another thing is about the marketing, the commercialisation of the tree products. In Cameroon a lot of tree products are consumed widely, they are in the markets. But {{there are a lot of}} problems for farmers to get to those markets. There is for instance bad infrastructure, the roads are not good and that means that a lot of this fruit especially the perishable fruit remain in the village and cannot generate income for farmers although they are demanded in the market. So there is a whole issue of infrastructure and even support to farmer groups to commercialise their tree products. And that needs some attention I think from support organisations and even from government. Chindong	Considering the villages that you work with can you picture your farmers with hectares of agroforestry gardens? Degrande	I think it?s a progressive thing. What we first try to promote is that at least every farmer has some fruit trees or some beneficial trees on his farm or her farm. So we don?t exclude that some of the more enterprising farmers, they can go for hectares and hectares of fruit trees. There will be some farmers who will do that but the majority of farmers they will integrate trees in their cocoa farms, they will plant more trees on the boundaries of their farm, they will plant better trees in their home garden and that?s how they will get more out of these trees. Another thing is that we are also developing approaches to help to assist farmer groups to market their products as a group so that they get more bargaining power. So those are the kind of things we are looking at and we want to make small changes but that will mean something to the farmer that will get him a more diverse package of income.

Syntactically, metalinguistic comparison appears to behave like a co-ordinate structure with ellipsis in the para-clause.

Strategic management experts Ireland, Hitt and Hoskisson claim that effective structures provide the stability an organization needs to successfully implement its strategies and maintain its current competitive advantages while simultaneously providing the flexibility to develop advantages it will need in the future. Structural stability provides the capacity the organization requires to consistently and predictably manage its daily work routines while structural flexibility provides the opportunity to explore opportunities and actions that the organization will need to be successful in the future. In other words, vision is no good without the organizational structure to sustain it. So, what are we to do? How do organizational leaders respond? Do we need to change our structure? Add structure?
