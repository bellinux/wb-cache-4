[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five and wrote [...] "Now that's how <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> vampire story!" [...] The two praised Gilligan's use of humor as well as the episode's examination of both Mulder and Scully's differing points of views. Shearman and Pearson noted that [...] "the gimmick here isn't supernatural, but structural", and called the episode's framing device [...] "subtly done", which resulted in its [...] "brilliance".

Vito was impressed when he found out Jim was a volunteer fireman. When Jim first tried to kiss him, Vito pushed him away, called him a fag, and the two scuffled briefly. Several days later, Vito went back to the restaurant and apologized, saying, [...] "Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lie so long, you don't know when to stop." [...] The two men reconciled. They drove on their motorcycles to a secluded spot by a nearby lake, where they picnicked and had sex. Vito moved in with Jim shortly thereafter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|E
