500|$|Mellor's earlier works {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} cultures, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed [...] "images of native and introduced flora and fauna—for example, a kangaroo with a bull—to symbolise two different peoples and cultures". These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition Native Titled Now, shown in South Australia in 1996. Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, {{it was important to}} be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, [...] "so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> about their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from those two things being parallel". Mellor's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor's works had earned him [...] "an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history".|$|E
500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Hands {{over the}} City, Steiger agreed {{to appear in}} another Italian film, Time of Indifference (1964), in which he starred {{opposite}} Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters. Though Steiger's powerful performance was unaffected, the production was marred by a dispute between director Francesco Maselli and producer Franco Cristaldi, with one wanting {{it to be a}} purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet's gritty drama The Pawnbroker (1964), Steiger played an embittered, emotionally withdrawn survivor of the Holocaust living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger's career was waning at the time, and he had to [...] "scramble for paying gigs for a decade" [...] before getting this part. Steiger agreed to a reduced fee of $50,000. [...] He read Lumet's novel and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character, and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society. Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic, stating: [...] "Sure, Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> them through with him. I explained that this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion; he had been hammered by life and by people. The faith he had to find was in other people, because God had betrayed him." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{promote his}} film The Love Letter, Selleck {{was invited to}} be on The Rosie O'Donnell Show on May 19, 1999. Unexpectedly, he found himself {{defending}} an ad in which he appeared supporting the National Rifle Association (NRA) and his position on gun ownership. After questions from O'Donnell, Selleck said, [...] "It's your show, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> about it after I leave." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 4, 2012, Busch feuded with Justin Allgaier at the Nationwide {{event at}} Dover and {{after talking to}} his boss and brother Kyle. When asked by Bob Pockrass about being on probation, Busch said, [...] "It refrains me from not beating {{the shit out of}} you right now because you ask me stupid questions. But since I'm on probation, I suppose that's {{improper}} to say as well. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> about racing things, we'll talk about many things, Bob. It is not racing, you're here just to start stuff, you know that's you're all out here for!" [...] NASCAR immediately suspended Busch from the Pocono race as a result for violating their policy forbidding swearing publicly.|$|E
2500|$|Some women became picture brides in {{an attempt}} to escape {{familial}} duties. They thought that by leaving Japan or Korea they could get out of responsibilities such as filial piety that came along with traditional marriage. Some women thought that they would gain freedoms denied to them in Japan and Korea. A quote from a Korean picture bride named Mrs. K embodies the mindset of many picture brides traveling to Hawaii, [...] "Hawaii's a free place, everybody living well. Hawaii had freedom, so if you like talk, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk,</b> if you like work, you can work." [...] With the influx of women becoming picture brides, some women followed the trend as the thing to do. As one Japanese picture bride, Motome Yoshimura, explained, [...] "I wanted to come to the United States because everyone else was coming. So I joined the crowd." ...|$|E
