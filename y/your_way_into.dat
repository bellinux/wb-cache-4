According to Merle Travis, [...] "At that time [...] "Western swing" [...] was a household word. Al Dexter {{had had a}} million-seller on his [...] "Pistol Packin' Mama" [...] record. Bob Wills was heard on every jukebox with this [...] "San Antonio Rose". T. Texas Tyler was doing well with his [...] "Remember Me (When the Candlelights are Gleaming)". It was practically impossible to wedge <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Palace Barn where Red Murrell and his band were playing. A mile down the hill was the Riverside Rancho. You were lucky to find a ticket on a Wednesday night. Tex Williams and his Western Caravan were playing there." ...|$|E
5000|$|You finally {{make it to}} the Keeper's Keep and go inside. You hear {{dialogue}} from Commander Rourke & Thaddeus Thatch. You battle several keepers as {{you make}} <b>your</b> <b>way</b> down <b>into</b> the labyrinth.|$|R

"Ay, that's auld Tam Lowrie's--a very decent man, Thamas--and a douce creditable house--nane of your flisk-ma-hoys--I am glad ye made {{choice of}} sic gude quarters, neighbour; for I am {{beginning}} to think ye are but a queer ane--ye look as if butter wadna melt in your mouth, but I sall warrant cheese no choke ye.--But I'll thank ye to gang <b>your</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> the parlour, for I am no like to get muckle mair out o' ye, it's like; and ye are standing here just in the gate, when we hae the supper to dish." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Munger laughed again, {{and then}} she said, with a proselyting sigh, [...] "It's a pity you couldn't all find <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Church." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, {{but this}} IS England, you {{abandoned}} young reprobate," [...] interposed Lord Antony with a laugh, [...] "and do not, I pray, bring <b>your</b> loose foreign <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> this most moral country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard enough}} of your words as I was {{passing through the}} corridor," [...] {{continued}} the latter, [...] "to readily guess what had gone before. So {{it is for this}} that you have wormed <b>your</b> sneaking <b>way</b> <b>into</b> my home? And thought you that Simon de Montfort would throw his daughter {{at the head of the}} first passing rogue? Who be ye, but a nameless rascal? For aught we know, some low born lackey. Get ye hence, and be only thankful that I do not aid you with the toe of my boot where it would do the most good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. God hath {{said in his}} word, {{that rather}} than there shall want witness at the day of judgment, against the workers of iniquity: the very dust of their city, that shall cleave to his {{messengers}} that publish the gospel shall itself be a witness against them; and so Christ bid his servants say--"Into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go <b>your</b> <b>ways</b> out <b>into</b> {{the streets of the}} same, and say, Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you": &c. [...] "But I say unto you," [...] saith he to his ministers, [...] "it shall be more tolerable for Sodom" [...] at the judgment [...] "than for that city" [...] (Luke 10:10-12).|$|R

6000|$|Later on Sir Ralph again {{went to the}} Tower {{and shortly}} returned. [...] "Put on your cloaks and hoods at once," [...] {{he said to his}} wife. [...] "The Essex and Hertford men have arrived {{on the north side of}} the city and may be here in the morning, and it will be then too late to retire to the Tower. I will give you a quarter of an hour to pack up your belongings. The men will carry them for you. As to you, boys, you can safely remain here until daybreak, then put on your citizen dresses and make <b>your</b> <b>way</b> quietly <b>into</b> the city, as soon as the gates are open. Put them over your own clothes. I charge you to take no part in any street fray; but if the better class of {{citizens}} make a stand, throw off your citizen clothes and join them and strike for the king and country, for assuredly England would be ruined were the rabble to have their way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a weird {{little piece}} you are," [...] he exclaimed; [...] "you {{seem to have}} wormed <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the hearts of these men. Do {{you know that you}} will {{probably}} never get to Vincennes alive?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sing <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> {{the hearts}} of all these strange people," [...] he bade her, smiling. [...] "Sing the envy and malice away from them. Sing so {{that they believe that}} England, after all, is the one {{desirable}} country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{your own}} house, isn't it?" [...] she replied, with a {{suspicious}} little quiver in her tone. [...] "I don't suppose you've forgotten <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the parlor. Keep {{well away from}} me or you may get some soapsuds on your fine clothes." ...|$|E
40|$|When a {{new idea}} arrives in a {{manifested}} form it is encompassing the whole set of information environment parameters that triggered that very moment. It is because {{you are able to}} discover, order, manipulate and refactor the raw data sets in your own knowledge set. A quite unique set. Many components of the set are manifested augmentations of one unique set of research habits. What happens when in the process of shaping the original idea actor like LAM specialists, software and hardware tools, legal framework and social graph are involved proposing different and more efficient approaches? Some answers arrive when you deconstruct the idea's background, as personal knowledge background, libraries, cultural frameworks and technological means are seen as real fairy godmothers of the future discoveries. But {{most of the time it}} is all about hacking <b>your</b> own <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the field being into a continuous competition with time and different limitations. The study will offer some paths using as many augmentation skills and tools as the aforementioned actors may offer in order to become an elegant lean thinking machine...|$|R
5000|$|He {{also studied}} with Michael Luggio at the Malisa Theatre Academy. [...] "I can safely say that I {{have never met}} anyone quite like Michael Luggio. His {{approach}} to acting and teaching is incredibly invigorating. He breaks all the barriers down, so you are left with the simplest and most honest performance possible. His classes are built around making the safest environment for his actors, {{in order for them}} to discover, learn and rid themselves of fear. It becomes a platform where anything is possible. Michael has helped me more than anyone I have ever met. He continues to bring it back to the craft and makes you feel safe and confident as you make <b>your</b> <b>way</b> out <b>into</b> the industry." [...] He attended the Youngblood Theatre Company at weekends, and at 15 landed a small part in Hollyoaks. After school, he began a degree in French literature lasting [...] "for about two weeks. I hated it." [...] He soon got a job washing vases for a florist to keep him going between auditions. [...] "It wasn't great but when you're that broke you'll do anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mengu-Timur's word to Prince Yaroslav: {{give the}} German {{merchant}}s <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> lands.

6000|$|... "You may. Even {{were you}} forcing <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the castle I will {{guarantee}} that no hair {{of their heads}} shall be injured. And now, prince, it is my turn to question. I see Saxon helmets and shields among your followers. Whence come they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have stolen}} nothing," [...] he declared, [...] "I don't know what you're talking about. I won't listen to you. You {{have no right}} to force <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> my flat. Colonel or no colonel, I won't have it. I'll send for the police." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by this intrusion, sir? How dare you force <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> my house in my absence? How dare you {{encourage}} my servants to disobey my orders? How dare you imperil this young lady's health by coming here to talk with her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Halbert {{looked on}} the youth with surprise, and resumed--"You seem to hesitate, young man. Are your own {{prospects}} so inviting, {{that you should}} pause ere you accept those which I should offer to you? or, must I remind you that, although you have offended your benefactress, {{even to the point}} of her dismissing you, yet I am convinced, the knowledge that you have gone unguided on <b>your</b> own wild <b>way,</b> <b>into</b> a world so disturbed as ours of Scotland, cannot, in the upshot, but give her sorrow and pain; from which it is, in gratitude, your duty to preserve her, no less than it is in common wisdom your duty to accept my offered protection, for your own sake, where body and soul are alike endangered, should you refuse it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your La is safe," [...] {{said the}} ape-man. [...] "Had she slain me she would now herself be dead {{and many more}} of you; but she spared me that I might save her. Go <b>your</b> <b>way</b> {{with her back to}} Opar, and Tarzan will go his <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the jungle. Let there be peace always between Tarzan and La. What is your answer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But not all are of <b>your</b> <b>way</b> of thinking. It cost much labour {{to place}} it there, and it should remain until Master Lillie understands he cannot play {{fast and loose with}} the people," [...] and now Hardy, having forced his <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the centre of the throng, was almost {{bursting}} with the desire to explain that he had assisted in this good work.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{must know}} that bodies of deserters, both French and English, are {{continually}} coming in to them, carrying their weapons with them. Now, {{what is there to}} prevent you and your men from pretending to be such a body, and so making <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Abbey?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do," [...] he admitted, [...] "and {{you know}} {{perfectly}} well that in your heart {{you agree with me}} and they are not your friends. Every one of them is more or less an adventurer, and how you found <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> such company I can't imagine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you went}} into Lynn and Sedley, and made <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the 'made robes' department, you would see me in a frock coat, walking about with a degage air and {{directing}} ladies who want to buy petticoats or stockings. First to the right, madam, and second on the left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stella," [...] he said, [...] "to me {{you always}} seemed, {{especially}} during our {{last few years}} together, cold and utterly indifferent. I know now that I was mistaken. In <b>your</b> <b>way</b> you cared for Palliser. You starved me. My own fault, you would say? Perhaps. But listen. There is a <b>way</b> <b>into</b> every man's heart and a <b>way</b> <b>into</b> every woman's, but sometimes that way lies hidden except to the one right person, and you weren't the right person for me, and I wasn't the right person for you. Now answer {{the rest of my}} question and let us part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My offer {{seems to}} {{surprise}} you," [...] Rochester remarked, pleasantly. [...] "It need not. You {{can go and}} tell the whole world of it, if you like, although, as a reputation for sanity is quite a valuable asset, nowadays, I should suggest that you keep your mouth closed. Still, if you do speak of it, {{no one will be}} in the least surprised. My friends--I haven't many--call me the most eccentric man in Christendom. My enemies wonder how it is that I keep out of the asylum. Personally, I consider myself a perfectly reasonable mortal. I have whims, and I am not afraid to indulge them. I give you this money on one--or perhaps we had better say two conditions. The first is that you make a bonâ fide use of it. When I say that, I mean that you leave immediately your present employment, whatever it may be, and go out into the world with the steadfast purpose of finding for yourself the things which you saw a few minutes ago down in the valley there. You may not find them, but still I pledge you to the search. The second condition is that some day or other you find <b>your</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> this part of the country, and tell me how my experiment has fared." ...|$|R
