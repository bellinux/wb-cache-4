2500|$|A Midrash {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>has</b> given you treasure," [...] to mean that God benefitted them either {{for their own sake}} or for their father Jacob's sake.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Midrash, Rashi {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God of <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>has</b> given you treasure," [...] to mean that God gave them the money in their merit, and if their merit was insufficient, the God of their father Jacob gave it {{to them in the}} merit of their father. Similarly, the 12th century Italian Rabbi Menachem ben Shlomo taught that the words [...] "your God" [...] signified that it was a reward for their fearing God, while the words [...] "the God of your fathers" [...] signified that it was a reward for Jacob's fearing God. Rashbam, however, read [...] to report that everyone knew that the brothers regularly benefitted from miracles. And David Kimhi (RaDaK) interpreted the steward to mean that if the brothers found the money in their sacks, it was a gift from heaven, comparable to if a human being had given them a treasure.|$|E
2500|$|Malbim {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God of <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>has</b> given you treasure," [...] to mean that since the money being brought to Egypt {{from all over the}} world was only [...] "a treasure" [...] – that is, hidden away in the treasury until the time of the Exodus from Egypt, when it would become the Israelites' – the steward told the brothers that their treasure could remain in their sacks, for it made no sense to place it in Pharaoh's treasury, when it was destined for them in any case. Professor Nahum M. Sarna, formerly of Brandeis University, wrote that the steward's reassuring reply was intelligible only on the assumption that he was privy to Joseph's scheme. [...] His purpose was to lull the brothers into a false sense of relief. Professor Robert Alter of University of California, Berkeley, wrote that the steward dismissed the brothers' fears by introducing a kind of fairy tale explanation for the silver that they found in their bags. But Professor Jon D. Levenson of Harvard Divinity School wrote that the steward sensed the hand of a beneficent Providence in the strange events.|$|E
