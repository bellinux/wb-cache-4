5000|$|Many {{recognized}} {{specialists in}} the knowledge areas where Korzybski claimed to have anchored general semantics - biology, epistemology, mathematics, neurology, physics, psychiatry, etc. - [...] supported his work in his lifetime, including Cassius J. Keyser, C. B. Bridges, W. E. Ritter, P. W. Bridgman, G. E. Coghill, William Alanson White, Clarence B. Farrar, David Fairchild, and Erich Kähler. Korzybski wrote {{in the preface to}} the third edition of Science and Sanity (1947) that general semantics [...] "turned out to be an empirical natural science." [...] But the type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of serious debate within metaphysical philosophy. So Black summed up general semantics as [...] "some hypothetical neurology fortified with dogmatic metaphysics." [...] And in 1952, two years after Korzybski died, American skeptic Martin Gardner wrote, [...] "Korzybski's work moves into the realm of cultism and pseudo-science." [...] Former Institute of General Semantics executive director Steve Stockdale has compared GS to yoga. [...] "First, I'd say that there is little if any benefit to be gained by just knowing something about general semantics. The benefits come from maintaining an awareness of the principles and attitudes that are derived from GS and applying them as they are needed. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>sort</b> of compare general semantics to yoga in that respect... knowing about yoga is okay, but to benefit from yoga you have to do yoga." [...] Similarly, Kenneth Burke explains Korzybski's kind of semantics contrasting it, in A Grammar of Motives, with a kind of Burkean poetry by saying [...] "Semantics is essentially scientist, an approach to language in terms of knowledge, whereas poetic forms are kinds of action".|$|E

50|$|Dr. Gill Pratt, Program Manager DARPA Robotics Challenge {{described}} DARPA and {{its goals}} with the Robotics Challenge:DARPA’s {{role is to}} spur innovation. And we do it by focused, short term efforts. We pick {{things that are not}} impossible, but also not very low risk. So we take very high risk gambles, and those risks have tremendous payoffs. So if we’re successful it means that these robots are actually {{going to be able to}} make a difference. In particular, in disaster scenarios making society more resilient. The lesson of the original challenge Grand Challenge - driverless cars is that persistence pays. It’s important if you know the technology is almost there and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sort</b> of see the light at the end of the tunnel, a little bit of persistence will pay off. What I’m hoping for in the trials is that some of the teams will score some points. I don’t think that any team is going to score all the points that there are. Maybe no teams will even score half the points that there are. But I think some teams will do moderately well. My expectation is that the robots are going to be slow. What we’re looking for right now is for the teams to just do as well as roughly that one year old child. If we can get there, then we think that we have good reason to believe that some of these teams with continued persistence for another year will actually be able to demonstrate robots that show the utility that these things might have in a real disaster scenario. DARPA is in the innovation business, not in the development business. So, what we do is we wait for technology to be almost ready for something big to happen, and then we add a focused effort to catalyze the something. It doesn’t mean that we take it all the way into a system that’s deployed or to the marketplace. We rely on the commercial sector to do that. But we provide the impetus, the extra push the technology needs to do that.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the topics}} that comes up {{regularly}} in chat, through emails and on our message board is the experience of confusing diagnoses. Top offenders on this list include PDD, ASD, high functioning autism, Asperger’s Syndrome and PDD-NOS. Once you have an understanding on autism spectrum disorders, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sort</b> it out, {{but most of us}} are unfamiliar with autism when we get that first assessment. When the assessing clinician asks us if we have any questions, we don’t know what questions to ask based on our inexperience so (in most cases; frozen with numbness) we say ‘no’. It is then assumed that we understand the whole thing and we are sent on our merry way. When we get home, confusion sets in. Does my son/daughter have autism or PDD? Are they different? Is one milder than the other? If my child is diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, does that mean s/he is better off? What is the difference between autism, high functioning autism and Asperger’s syndrome? And where does this PDD-NOS fit in to the whole thing? It is really hard to move forward if you can’t get an accurate understanding of the diagnosis. So we start to read, to question others, to go on the Internet and then we find that the information confuses us even more! As we read articles written on the subject by professionals, we see that even they are not consistent. Find one definition that makes sense, and there will be six professionals refuting it. You can tell by reading our message board that our children’s doctors don’t always agree. The more I read on the subject, the more I start to wonder who really knows the answers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new sort algorithm, called AlphaSort, {{demonstrates}} that commodity processors and disks can handle commercial batch workloads. Using commodity processors, memory, and arrays of SCSI disks, AlphaSort runs the industrystandard sort benchmark in seven seconds. This beats the best published record on a 32 -CPU 32 -disk Hypercube by 8 : 1. On another benchmark, AlphaSort sorted {{more than a}} gigabyte in one minute. AlphaSort is a cache-sensitive, memoryintensive sort algorithm. We argue that modern architectures require algorithm designers to re-examine {{their use of the}} memory hierarchy. AlphaSort uses clustered data structures to get good cache locality, file striping to get high disk bandwidth, QuickSort to generate runs, and replacement-selection to merge the runs. It uses shared memory multiprocessors to break the sort into subsort chores. Because startup times are becoming {{a significant part of the}} total time, we propose two new benchmarks: (1) MinuteSort: how much <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>sort</b> in one minute, and (2) PennySort: how much <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>sort</b> for one penny...|$|R
