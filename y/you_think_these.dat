500|$|While writing [...] "Tabula Rasa", Damon Lindelof {{suggested}} that John Locke {{was in a}} wheelchair {{before going to the}} island, and {{while the rest of the}} writing team initially reacted with shock, they embraced the idea. Lindelof wanted to embrace how [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> people are is actually entirely different", particularly since [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] did not have many developments on Kate's backstory or why she was a fugitive, [...] "the Locke thing was a huge, big, reveal". To enhance the plot twist, all the flashbacks were shot in a way that disguised the presence of a wheelchair. In the scene where Locke is sitting in his bed, the paralysis is alluded by the electromedical nerve stimulation machine on his nightstand. Lindelof also created a title for the episode, [...] "Lord of the Files", a pun on Lord of the Flies and Locke's off-island occupation, but the writers had already settled on [...] "Walkabout".|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> guys are here to do? I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Vision of Love" [...] {{has been}} lauded by {{contemporary}} music critics for its lyrical content, vocals, {{and use of}} melisma. In a retrospective review on the album in 2005, Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "inspired" [...] and complimented Carey's use of the whistle register in the song. In 2006, Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker named the song [...] "the Magna Carta of melisma" [...] for both the song's and Carey's influence on pop and R singers and American Idol contestants. Additionally, Rolling Stone said that [...] "the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like [...] "Vision of Love," [...] inspired the entire American Idol vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R singer since the nineties." [...] Slant Magazine critic Rich Juzwiak, wrote [...] "I think [...] was {{a vision of the}} future world of American Idol." [...] In a separate review from Slant, RJ wrote [...] "The last half of [...] "Vision Of Love" [...] (starting with the belted bridge) is a series of crescendos that get so intense that another Mariah has to step in to keep up the momentum." [...] Additionally, RJ complimented the usage of the whistle register in the song [...] "And then there's the whistle note. And then there's the final vocal run that's more like a roller-coaster track. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> aren't climaxes, she proves you wrong with her denouement, the way the last word, [...] "be," [...] sort of wanes into an [...] "mm hmm hmm." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com said that [...] "'Vision of Love' {{is one of the best}} songs of Mariah's recording career [...] It is simply one of the most stunning debut releases ever by a pop recording artist." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are always}} putting me off--I never can tell what you think. And yet I'm {{sure you have}} opinions. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> people frivolous, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{goodness}} me! ain't you dressed yet?" [...] shrilled the red one. [...] "How does it {{fit in the}} back? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> velvet tabs look awful swell? Why ain't you dressed, Maida?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>these</b> five years, Arnold. Tell me the truth," [...] Mabane persisted. [...] "Let {{me know if}} your {{thoughts}} {{are the same as}} mine." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And so, <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> that {{we shall}} get to Berlin, Ralph Barclay? <b>You</b> <b>think</b> that <b>these</b> Prussian louts are going to beat the French army? Look now, {{it is a little}} strong to say that, in a French town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is queer plantin', Jamie," [...] put in Joel, [...] "and queerer grain {{will come}} of it. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> young {{chestnuts}} will ever grow, ag'in, {{that you put}} them out in rows, like so much corn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{corrected}} himself. [...] "Of course I don't accuse you of wilfully deceiving anybody. I'm {{willing to}} grant that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> Voices are real; but my teacher, Doctor Boyden, says that mediumship {{is only a}} kind of hysteria--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> I.W.W. {{plotters}} will spare your wheat?" [...] asked Kurt. [...] "You are wrong. They may lie to your face. But they'll betray you. The I.W.W. {{is backed}} by--by interests {{that want to}} embarrass the government." ...|$|E
6000|$|Aur. I'll {{cut through}} the grates with aquafortis, but I'll meet <b>you.</b> <b>Think</b> of <b>these</b> things, and despair, and die, old gentleman. [...] [AURELIAN and CAMILLO are carried off on [...] one side, and LAURA and VIOLETTA on [...] the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} I can smoke, but I intend to try," [...] he said. [...] "If {{you mean to}} rush the next hill right off, you will go without me." [...] He turned to the hired man. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>these</b> roads, Grierson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well my dear William what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>these</b> girls? for my part, I do {{not find}} them so plain as I expected: but perhaps <b>you</b> may <b>think</b> me partial to the Daughters of my Husband and perhaps you are right--They are indeed so very like Sir George that it is natural to think"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said my gloomy friend, {{answering}} my thoughts. [...] "You don't {{know what}} a wicked shameful thing straightness is if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> trees are straight. You never will know till your precious intellectual civilization builds a forty-mile forest of telegraph poles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There’s a fine {{view from}} up there," [...] said Mr. Tredgold. [...] "With the captain’s glass {{one can see}} the sea distinctly. I spent nearly all last Friday {{afternoon}} up there, keeping an eye on things. Do you like the garden? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> old creepers ought to be torn down from the house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, strong-minded, strong-hearted, strong-souled, and strong-bodied; {{that is why}} I {{made her}} larger than the miserable, pinched-up woman of our day. Strength and beauty must go together. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> broad {{shoulders}} can bear burdens without breaking down, these hands work well, these eyes see clearly, and these lips do something besides simper and gossip?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, so it is,' rejoined Growl; 'and I'll tell <b>you</b> what's more--I <b>think</b> <b>these</b> two geniuses, {{whoever they}} are, have {{run away from}} somewhere.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> all <b>these</b> ships {{would be}} lying idly here, if Pisani were in command?

6000|$|... "All you can, Richard! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that in <b>these</b> {{many years}} no others {{have done all}} they could? Has the {{difficulty}} grown easier because of so many failures?" ...|$|R
60|$|But do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> men saw the {{strength}} of the Jews now? No, no, their pillars were within, and so were shadowed from their eyes. David himself could not tell what judgment to make {{of the way of the}} world against the people of God, until he went into the sanctuary of God (Psa 73:16,17).|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true: we soon {{met with}} Mrs. Thorpe, {{and then we}} wanted for nothing. My dear, do not <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> silk gloves wear very well? I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms, you know, and I have worn them a great deal since. Do you {{remember}} that evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a little," [...] {{he whispered}} in my ear. [...] "It {{is not quite}} so {{wonderful}} as <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>These</b> blind peoples, when they first see, have all alike the same hatred of anything what is dark."

(1 Cor 15:50).|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} <b>you,</b> sir; <b>you</b> <b>think</b> all <b>these</b> inexplicable {{terms are}} connected with Sir Wycherly's religious feelings. You may certainly be right, for it exceeds my knowledge to connect them with any thing else. I wish, notwithstanding, {{he had not}} disowned this noble young lieutenant of ours! Is it quite certain the young man is a Virginian?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, we {{have had}} trouble--lots of it, but nothing we could not overcome," [...] he repeated. [...] "If {{everything}} went smoothly it would grow monotonous. Still, you can rest perfectly contented, sir, and assist us with your judgment in the difficult cases.

6000|$|... 'Jerry {{talked for}} {{nearly a quarter of}} an hour about sick people in the village, while Rene asked questions. Then he sighed, and said, [...] "You explain very well, Monsieur Gamm, but if only I had your {{opportunities}} to listen for myself! Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>these</b> poor people would let me listen to them through my trumpet--for a little money? No?"--Rene's as poor as a church mouse.|$|E
6000|$|... "It don't {{matter much}} what you thowt o' me, old man," [...] {{returned}} the cowboy, somewhat sharply; [...] "an', as to fair-play, there's {{a lot of}} men here who don't agree wi' your humbuggin' notions about temperance an' tee-totalism--more of 'em, maybe, than <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>These</b> want to have the drink, an' I've come to give it 'em. I see nothin' unfair in that." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{smiled a}} little. [...] "I think you {{scientific}} people {{go a long}} way round to explain a very simple thing.

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way you think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think),</b> and Fourth Thoughts (the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the way <b>you</b> <b>think).</b> All <b>these</b> thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.|$|R
