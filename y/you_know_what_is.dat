2500|$|Your story {{fits the}} Isle of Man like a lid to a box. [...] I have but {{to lift the}} {{alabaster}} box of precious ointment, and up leaps the genuine Manx perfume, so that the house {{is filled with the}} savour thereof. [...] Whether it's the blood in you, or the poet and diviner, you know all about it, you need not that any should tell you concerning Man. for <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> Man, and that in two senses.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime {{in the mid}} 200s, Gongsun Du {{gathered}} all {{his subordinates}} and asked them, [...] "I heard that Lord Cao is away on a campaign. Ye (around present-day Handan, Hebei) is unguarded. If I lead 30,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry to attack Ye, can anyone stop me?" [...] All of them agreed that Gongsun Du would succeed if he did so. After Gongsun Du sought his opinion, Liang Mao replied, [...] "The Han Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos and on the brink of collapse. General, you command thousands of troops, yet you sit here and watch others attack and destroy each other. As a subject of the Han Empire, is this what you should be doing? Lord Cao is concerned about the Han Empire's future and the people's welfare, which is why he leads an army of righteousness to eliminate tyrants and villains. He has made immense contributions and his virtues are well-known. There is none other like him in the Han Empire. As peace and stability has just recently been restored, it is only a matter of time before everyone starts pointing fingers at you, General, for not doing anything to save the Han Empire. Now, General, you want to lead your forces west to attack Ye? All it takes is one morning to find out the result of this test of survival and destruction. General, I hope <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> good for you." [...] Gongsun Du's subordinates were shocked when they heard what Liang Mao said. After a long pause, Gongsun Du said, [...] "What Administrator Liang said is correct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} one thing?" [...] he went on. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> meant by an objects which is square? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> meant by an objects which is round?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you said}} nothing, McCrae," [...] he began presently. [...] "I felt {{all along that}} <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> wrong--if <b>you</b> had only spoken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder whether}} we shall {{overtake}} him! Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> this gentleman's route?' inquired Guy, in French that was daily becoming more producible.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Snug!' said John indignantly. 'You have a {{comfortable}} idea of snugness, you have, sir. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> done in that room, you ruffian?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... --He {{knew what}} money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{the pride of}} the English? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's mouth? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the matter, sir," [...] said he, turning round {{again as}} quickly as before. [...] "I'll let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the matter. I'll publish this, sir, to the medical world;" [...] and as he shrieked out {{the words of the}} threat, he stood on tiptoes and brandished his eye-glasses up almost into his enemy's face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!--then {{you have}} {{accepted}} him? Then Chettam has no chance? Has Chettam offended you--offended you, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> it you don't like in Chettam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, that's not logic--and I {{knew that}} before. It's really nothing, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> it <b>you</b> said to yourself? You {{certainly}} {{said more than}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{thought was}} not {{in my mind that}} Thayendanega himself would be opposed to our commander; but if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> done last year, it is easy to {{understand}} my meaning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I cooked {{an extra}} good supper for him!" [...] Carrie exclaimed. [...] "I'm {{beginning}} to understand why folks get poisoned. But now <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to do about}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{are going}} to Court, to woo the Princess! Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known {{throughout}} all the country side?' And they told him all about it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, my dear Miss Swancourt,' he tenderly replied, 'I {{have not}} said {{anything}} against it. But <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said about handsome being and handsome doing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will keep}} still--if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best for you. I have your pocketbook, and now I am {{bound to have}} that watch and that ring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, David; but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{saved for}} the pig {{came from all}} of you; {{you would have had}} no right to spend it on {{anything}} else, unless they all had consented." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, oh; {{so one of}} you is {{father of}} the lad who brought the donkey, and the other the owner of it; and you neither of <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in the kishes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Noel!" [...] she said, {{suddenly}} {{stopping in}} the middle of the walk. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> the worst mischief you ever did yourself in your life? I will tell you. That worst mischief was sending me to Zurich." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her uncle smiled, {{as if she}} {{had said}} {{something}} peculiarly acceptable to him, and asked, hesitatingly, [...] "When you say you never did, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the full phrase?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I. Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{to happen}} to me? Ah! Flora has not told you. I thought she would not think it grand enough. She talked about diplomacy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{going on}} to the right, sir?" [...] Fergus asked a field officer, {{who was in the}} act of mounting. [...] "Marshal Keith has sent me to inquire." ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE. Well? Well??? (Tackling {{him very}} seriously and talking faster and faster.) Crampton: do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> <b>been</b> {{the matter with}} me to-day? You don't suppose, do you, that I'm {{in the habit of}} playing such tricks on my {{patients}} as I played on you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{that is all}} true. But a girl {{situated}} like Frances {{is bound}} not to,--not to sacrifice those with whom Fame and Fortune have connected her. I can speak plainly to you, Mrs. Roden, because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> my own opinions about many things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{might not}} find the island," [...] said the captain, blowing a cloud so dense that his face was almost hidden. [...] "Some of these little islands {{have been known to}} {{disappear}} quite suddenly. Volcanic action, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> smiling at?" [...] he added, sharply.|$|R
60|$|Ah yes. You {{appreciate}} Robert; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> in his poetry. Certainly {{there is}} no pretension in me towards that profound suggestiveness, and I thank you for knowing it and saying it.|$|E
6000|$|L. Then, {{outside of}} it, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> true, and say so; and I may trust {{the outside of}} your heart; but within, it is all foul and false. Is that the way? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; give me but a piece. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> behind you, but {{you have}} no {{knowledge}} of what is before you.' And picking up the tobacco in his beak, the raven flew away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Help me? On {{this theme}}!" [...] Sam grinned broadly. [...] "Tom, <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking about. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> this theme <b>is</b> on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had once," [...] was Edith's reply, [...] "before I {{came to live}} here. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{this house}} <b>is</b> for me, with its gilded mirrors, its couches, its soft carpets? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I <b>am,</b> and have been for two years?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am beyond myself about this, and am mad," [...] he said. [...] "I am no stoic {{at all to}} be supplicating here; but I do supplicate to you. I wish <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> in me {{of devotion}} to you; but it is impossible, that. In bare human mercy to a lonely man, don't throw me off now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Ozma, [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> in my mind, {{and that}} I am seeking {{a way to}} prevent any one in the future from {{discovering}} the Land of Oz." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Seneky, in particular, is in {{a dreadful}} taking," [...] she resumed, [...] "and to pacify him, I consented to ride over myself, {{at this time}} of night, to let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> threatened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, then, I {{think we}} should guard against such contingencies. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> in my mind; we have spoken of it before, and not once only. I want you to marry, and you know whom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Changing to angry recollection.) Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{they cost}} me? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> done to me, to-day, this morning, in my father's house? I was shamed, humiliated, as I {{would never have}} dreamed it possible. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they did to me? The {{servants}} were called in, and by them I was stripped before everybody--my family, Hubbard, the Reverend Mr. Rutland, the secretary, everybody.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to reactions {{of seeing the}} poison take effect on others, Jones counseled, [...] "Die {{with a degree of}} dignity. Lay down your life with dignity; don't lay down with tears and agony." [...] He also said, [...] "I tell you, I don't care how many screams you hear, I don't care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> ahead of <b>you</b> - if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> ahead of <b>you,</b> you'd be glad to be stepping over tonight." [...] Rhodes stated that while the poison was squirted in some children's mouths, there was no panic or emotional outburst and the assembled Temple members looked like they were [...] "in a trance". This statement contradicts to the crying and screaming children heard throughout the majority of the death tape.|$|R
60|$|P.S.--I don't {{write my}} name very plain, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> so never mind.|$|R
