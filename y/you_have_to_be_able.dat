500|$|Martin Singer, an {{attorney}} representing Cosby, {{made a statement}} in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account. After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{conflict}} on Wikipedia {{within the}} topic of Scientology was drawn out over specific disagreements. Journalist Alan Bjerga of McClatchy Newspapers reported in August 2006, [...] "Wayne Saewyc, a Wikipedia spokesman, said debates on controversial topics can become incredibly time-consuming and sometimes maddening. In the entry covering Scientology, for example, contributors argued for nine months over whether the Scientologist method of childbirth should be called 'silent birth' or 'quiet birth. In an October 2006 article about Wikipedia, Paul Vallely of The Independent commented that, [...] "Some pages {{seem to have been}} taken over by fanatics and special interest groups (try the Scientology [...] page)." [...] Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in October 2006 about the state of Scientology articles on the site, saying [...] "he believes the Wikipedia entry is the most balanced and informative account to be found anywhere on the web." [...] Gerard commented on [...] "NPOV" [...] (neutral point of view) in the topic, [...] "This {{is a good example of}} why NPOV is one of the most revolutionary things about Wikipedia. On the web you'll find a lot of Church of Scientology sites, and a lot of critics' sites, which are generally very bitter. On Wikipedia you have to be neutral, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to reference your facts." ...|$|E

2500|$|Martin {{characteristically}} deviates {{from the}} traditional fantasy model and clear-cut lines of good versus evil. Martin reflects: [...] "I think the battle {{between good and evil}} is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions that we make. It's not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, they're really ugly". This viewpoint characterizes the book and is evident in the actions of several different families which frequently have conflicts with each other. The Starks' and Lannisters' conflict is a central component of the novel, and the reader receives points of view from both sides. Likewise, Daenerys' storyline develops around the Targaryen's upheaval in Westeros, in which the Starks played a significant role. Martin argues: Having multiple viewpoints is crucial to the grayness of the characters. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to see the struggle from both sides, because real human beings in a war have all these processes of self-justification, telling ourselves why what we're doing is the right thing.|$|E

Beyond that the writing was so alike that it was the strangest coincidence in the world. Of course when they made figures it was different and Pupkin explained to Zena that in the bank <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make a seven so that it doesn't look like a nine.|$|E

50|$|The CSPA {{has other}} {{initiatives}} to promote overall safety such as recommended procedures and instructor qualification requirements. A Canadian skydiver starts {{off with a}} solo license, then progresses onward to their A, B, C, and D license. The CSPA requires that each skydiver keep a log of every jump signed by another jumper and submit that log book to acquire these qualifications. For example, to get a B License <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to perform certain maneuvers and have 50 skydives which are all documented in the submitted logbook. Without this sort of basic proof skydivers would {{have no idea how}} many jumps they have done and could embellish experience levels. This was a very big risk before but through the proper establishment of documentation procedures, proof of a skydivers experience is easily attainable preventing inexperienced instructors to take the lead.|$|E

The minute you are interested in seeing things from different points of view you lose a lot of forward motion." [...] Bergmann prefers to explore themes and variations which he skillfully interweaves into coherent, emotionally satisfying narratives. He says he loves the Arabian Nights for the ways in which [...] "the emotions are so real they anchor the flying carpets." [...] His films offer preposterous connections, fictional institutions and unresearched statistics that are completely convincing. His flair for the absurd does not, however, carry him into Surrealism. He finds that [...] "the irrational is only interesting if you can understand it." ...|$|E

[...] In 1970, H. C. Schonberg of the New York Times contrasted Seattle Opera's approach to marketing to the then still staid marketing of New York's Metropolitan Opera: [...] "Out there, you see campaign buttons with the legend Opera Lives. It is in Seattle where {{you can look at the}} sky and find an airplane skywriting the virtues of Seattle Opera. There are even auto bumper stickers about opera." [...] Further, Schonberg remarked favorably on the [...] "air of freshness and experimentation that contrasts vividly with the dull, tried and true, tired professionalism in other opera houses one could mention." ...|$|E
