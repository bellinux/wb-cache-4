500|$|A [...] "working mom", as {{described}} by Paltrow, Elizabeth is the central figure in the detective process. Despite being among the virus' first victims, Paltrow believed that Elizabeth was [...] "lucky", as she thought the disease's survivors were being left {{to deal with the}} newly difficult conditions of everyday life, such as finding food and potable water. When on location in Hong Kong, Paltrow was instructed by Soderbergh to take photographs {{to be used in the}} film, and admitted she was apprehensive about the assignment. [...] "I was just another tourist taking pictures", she said, and added, [...] "I did feel a little pressure. When Steven Soderbergh gives you a photo assignment, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> come back with something decent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few days, however, Terohaute's {{behaviour}} {{became more and more}} erratic. He disappeared for short periods, refusing to say where he had gone. He would not gather tripe de roche. When asked to go hunting he refused, replying that [...] "there are no animals, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> kill and eat me." [...] He later accused the Britons of having eaten his uncle.|$|E

2500|$|President Grant {{reminded}} Belknap that Congress had {{authorized the}} construction of the bridge. President Grant was convinced that Congress would not authorize money to tear the bridge down, overruled Belknap's decision, and told Belknap in person [...] "You certainly cannot destroy this structure on your own authority...General, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> drop this case." [...] Belknap was embarrassed, stood up blushing, bowed to President Grant, and left the meeting. The Eads Bridge was completed in 1874 and is still in active use today.|$|E
2500|$|Saw Ke became king {{due to the}} {{recommendation}} of his brother-in-law Gov. Thilawa of Yamethin. After Thado Minbya's death, Queen Saw Omma and Commander Nga Nu tried to seize the Ava throne but the court drove them out. The court initially gave the throne to Thilawa. But the taciturn governor of Yamethin refused, reportedly saying: [...] "I do not open my mouth to speak three or four words a day. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> choose Saw Ke." [...] The court offered the throne to Saw Ke, who accepted. He became king of Ava on 5 September 1367.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her husband}} became president, Julia reconsidered surgery. [...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now that my husband had become so famous I really thought it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Discerning {{the line}} between the fact and the fiction of Thompson's work {{presented}} a practical problem for editors and fact-checkers of his work. Love called fact-checking Thompson's work [...] "one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world", and [...] "for the first-timer... a trip through a journalistic fun house, where you didn't know what was real and what wasn't. You knew <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended. Hunter was a stickler for numbers, for details like gross weight and model numbers, for lyrics and caliber, and there was no faking it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goforth then {{traveled}} {{to hold a}} series of meetings at the Liaoyang congregation. [...] "The revival at Liaoyang {{was the beginning of a}} movement which spread throughout the whole surrounding country. Bands of revived Christians went here and there preaching the Gospel with telling effect. At one out-station there was a Christian who had a notoriously bad son. During the meetings that were held by one of the revival bands at his village, the young man quite broken up, confessed his sins and came out strongly for Christ. His conversion produced a remarkable effect upon the whole village. Heathen would say to each other on the streets: [...] "The Christian's God has come. Why, He has even entered that bad fellow, and driven all the badness out of him. And now he's just like other Christians. So, if you don't want to go the same way <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> keep away from that crowd." [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly then {{heard the}} {{approach}} of Kennedy and Scanlan, and the four gang members concealed themselves, some behind logs, {{and one in the}} tent. They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, [...] "Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm." [...] Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, [...] "Sergeant, I think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded." [...] Kelly at the same time called out, [...] "Put up your hands." [...] Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled and put his hand on his revolver case. He was instantly fired at, but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, [...] "It's all right, stop it, stop it." [...] Scanlan jumped down and tried to make for a tree, but before he could unsling his rifle, he was shot and killed.|$|E

6000|$|Benson {{gave him}} a {{sympathetic}} nod. [...] "One can understand that; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>better</b> reasons for getting back {{than the rest of}} us, though I've no particular wish to loiter up here. Break the trail, Blake; due south by compass!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>thee</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> {{step out}} and call my son. Sometimes {{he does not}} hear the bell when he is busy. Thee will find my garden-hood and shawl behind the door," [...] said Mrs. Sterling, presently; for {{punctuality}} was a great virtue in the old lady's eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Ewell led his corps in the May 1864 Battle of the Wilderness and {{performed}} well, enjoying the rare circumstance of a slight numerical superiority over the Union corps that attacked him. In the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Lee {{felt compelled to}} lead {{the defense of the}} [...] "Mule Shoe" [...] on May 12 personally because of Ewell's indecision and inaction. At one point Ewell began hysterically berating some of his fleeing soldiers and beating them over the back with his sword. Lee reined in his enraged lieutenant, saying sharply, [...] "General Ewell, you must restrain yourself; how can you expect to control these men when you have lost control of yourself? If you cannot repress your excitement, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> retire." [...] Ewell's behavior on this occasion undoubtedly was the source of a statement made by Lee to his secretary, William Allan, after the war that on May 12 he [...] "found Ewell perfectly prostrated by the misfortune of the morning, and too much overwhelmed to be efficient." [...] In the final combat at Spotsylvania, on May 19, 1864, Ewell ordered an attack on the Union left flank at the Harris Farm, which had little effect beyond delaying Grant for a day, at the cost of 900 casualties, about one-sixth of his remaining force.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1934, Wilson {{was visited}} by old {{drinking}} companion Ebby Thacher. Wilson was astounded {{to find that}} Thacher had been sober for several weeks {{under the guidance of}} the evangelical Christian Oxford Group. Wilson took some interest in the group, but shortly after Thacher's visit, he was again admitted to Towns Hospital to recover from a bout of drinking. This was his fourth and last stay at Towns hospital under Doctor Silkworth's care and he showed signs of delirium tremens. It was while undergoing treatment with The Belladonna Cure that Wilson experienced his [...] "Hot Flash" [...] spiritual conversion and quit drinking. Earlier that evening, Thacher had visited and tried to persuade him to turn himself over to the care of a Christian deity who would liberate him from alcohol. According to Wilson, while lying in bed depressed and despairing, he cried out, [...] "I'll do anything! Anything at all! If there be a God, let Him show Himself!" [...] He then had the sensation of a bright light, a feeling of ecstasy, and a new serenity. He never drank again for the remainder of his life. Wilson described his experience to Dr. Silkworth, who told him, [...] "Something has happened to you I don't understand. [...] But <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> hang on to it".|$|E
2500|$|Drosnin {{also made}} a number of claims and alleged {{predictions}} that have since failed. Among the most important, Drosnin clearly states in his book [...] "The Bible Code II", published on December 2, 2002, that there was to be a World War involving an [...] "Atomic Holocaust" [...] that would allegedly {{be the end of the}} world. Another claim Drosnin makes in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] is that the nation of Libya would develop weapons of mass destruction that they would then be given to terrorists who would then use them to attack the West (specifically the United States). In reality Libya improved relations with the West in 2003 and gave up all their existing weapons of mass destruction programs. A final claim Drosnin made in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] was that Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat would allegedly be assassinated by being shot to death by gunmen which Drosnin specifically stated would be from the Palestinian Hamas movement. This prediction by Drosnin also failed, as Yasser Arafat died on November 11, 2004 of what was later declared to be natural causes (specifically a stroke brought on by an unknown infection). The only conspiracy theories about Yasser Arafat allegedly being murdered have been made by a few Palestinian figures, and have involved alleged poisoning that was supposed to have been on the orders of Israeli officials. The only alleged Palestinian collaboration in this conspiracy theory involve two leading Palestinian figures from the Palestinian Fatah movement; those are current Palestinian Authority and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas and Mohammed Dahlan the former head of Fatah in Gaza. Writer Randy Ingermanson criticized Drosnin by stating that; [...] "And that's all they are, even for Drosnin – possibilities. He believes that the future is not fixed, and that the Bible code predicts all possible outcomes. Which makes it not much of a predictive tool, but again, he seems not to mind this very much. If you are laying bets based on Drosnin, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> be willing to bet on all possible outcomes." ...|$|E
