5|$|The stone-curlews are a {{group of}} nine species of largely {{tropical}} and nocturnal birds. They are characterised by their strong black or yellow-black bills, large <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes</b> and cryptic plumage. One species is a vagrant to Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The stone-curlews are a {{group of}} largely {{tropical}} waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes</b> and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.|$|E

50|$|Overall dark brown/black colours. The male has a {{striking}} <b>yellow</b> <b>eye</b> {{and a dark}} coloured (greenish) head. The female {{is similar to the}} male, but without the <b>yellow</b> <b>eye</b> and has a white face patch during breeding season. A white wing bar can be seen in both sexes when in flight.|$|R
40|$|Three {{spontaneous}} eye mutants of Cochliomyia hominivorax, the screwworm fly, {{are described}} and characterized. The mutants, <b>yellow</b> <b>eye</b> (ye), orange eye (or), and white eye (wh), segregate independently and are recessive. <b>Yellow</b> <b>eye</b> is recessively epistatlc to orange eye and dominantly epistatic to white eye. All three mutants have complete penetrance, are autosomal, and have {{little effect on}} fly viabillty under laboratory conditions...|$|R
5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes</b> do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is {{commonly}} {{confused with the}} clinking currawong, but the latter species has a white rump and larger white wing patches. The black currawong has a heavier bill and a characteristic call unlike the clink-clink call of the clinking. The forest and little ravens are similar in size but lack the white wing patches, and instead have entirely black plumage and white, rather than <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes.</b> The black currawong {{is unlikely to be}} mistaken for the closely related pied currawong as the latter does not reach Tasmania, but it has a longer and deeper bill and lacks the white rump and undertail coverts.|$|E
5|$|The grey currawong is {{unlikely}} to be confused with other species apart from other currawongs. It is immediately distinguishable from crows and ravens as they have wholly black plumage, a stockier build and white (rather than <b>yellow)</b> <b>eyes.</b> However, it can be encountered in mixed-species flocks with the pied currawong. It can be distinguished by its paler plumage, lack of white base to the tail, straighter bill, and very different vocalisations. In northwestern Victoria, the black-winged currawong (subspecies melanoptera) has a darker plumage than other grey subspecies, and is thus more similar in appearance to the pied currawong, but its wings lack the white primaries of the latter species. In Tasmania, the black currawong is similar but has a heavier bill and call similar to the pied and lacks the white rump.|$|E

5|$|Two-color {{varieties}} {{always have}} a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white {{is the most common}} two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes.</b> Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.|$|E
5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed {{has a tendency to}} display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes</b> while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E

25|$|Goa'uld symbiotes are {{serpentine}} lifeforms {{with four}} jaws and glowing <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes.</b> Originally aquatic, mature Goa'uld symbiotes have extensive fins and are powerful swimmers, {{with the ability}} to launch themselves from the water towards prospective hosts. A Goa'uld can burrow into their host through the back of the mouth or the neck, though they prefer the latter because they wish to avoid remembering the look of horror on the host's face. They then enter the brain, take control of the body, and gain total access to the host's memories; thus, the Goa'uld often use symbiote implantation as a means of interrogation that also provides a useful future spy.|$|E
25|$|Rufus Scrimgeour {{serves as}} the Minister for Magic of the United Kingdom, {{succeeding}} Cornelius Fudge who was ousted by the wizarding community for his failure to announce the return of Voldemort, discrediting Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore, and allowing Dolores Umbridge to become Headmistress of Hogwarts, from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince {{until his death in}} the following book. He is described as looking like an old lion with tawny hair and bushy eyebrows, <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes</b> and wire-rimmed spectacles. Before being selected as minister, Scrimgeour headed the Auror Office of the Ministry and he is heavily battle-scarred from his years of service as an Auror, giving him an appearance of shrewd toughness. As minister, he visits the Muggle Prime Minister with Fudge, now an advisor, to inform him about recent wizarding events, crucial to internal security.|$|E

500|$|Thornton {{has been}} praised for his lyrics, {{which are often}} abstract, surreal, and filled with non-sequiturs and {{juvenile}} humor. Music critic Chairman Mao wrote that Dr. Octagonecologyst occupies [...] "...the heretofore-undefined area where hip-hop meets hallucinatory sci-fi and porn." [...] In the album's narrative, Dr. Octagon is an extraterrestrial, time-traveling gynecologist and surgeon originally from Jupiter. Dr. Octagon's history is detailed throughout the album's songs, skits, and samples. [...] "Real Raw" [...] describes him as having <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes,</b> green skin, and a pink-and-white Afro haircut. [...] "General Hospital," [...] "A Visit to the Gynecologist," [...] and [...] "Elective Surgery" [...] detail a list of services offered by Octagon, who claims to treat chimpanzee acne and moosebumps, and relocating saliva glands. Octagon is described as being incompetent, as many of his surgery patients die as he conducts his rounds. Octagon also pretends to be a female gynecologist and often has sex with female patients and nurses.|$|E
500|$|The adult magpie is {{a fairly}} solid, sturdy bird ranging from [...] in length with a [...] wingspan, and {{weighing}} [...] Its robust wedge-shaped bill is bluish-white bordered with black, with a small hook at the tip. The black legs are long and strong. The plumage is pure glossy black and white; both sexes of all subspecies have black heads, wings and underparts with white shoulders. The tail has a black terminal band. The nape is white in the male and light greyish-white in the female. Mature magpies have dull red eyes, {{in contrast to the}} <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes</b> of currawongs and white eyes of Australian ravens and crows. The main difference between the subspecies lies in the [...] "saddle" [...] markings on the back below the nape. Black-backed subspecies have a black saddle and white nape. White-backed subspecies have a wholly white nape and saddle. The male Western Australian subspecies dorsalis is also white-backed, but the equivalent area in the female is scalloped black.|$|E
500|$|The children's book The World's Angriest Boy in the World, {{which appears}} in Haller's {{memories}} of his childhood, was written by Hawley and published {{for use in the}} show. Stevens described it as [...] "the world's most twisted children's book", but useful for him to hold and read while acting. The physical manifestation of the book's title character was inspired by Edward Gorey drawings, with Wylie explaining that he [...] "loved the idea of him wearing a little velvet, Eddie Munster child’s funeral suit. That’s where that dude came from. He’s really scary." [...] Another manifestation of the Shadow King, the Devil with the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Eyes,</b> was inspired by the reality television series My 600-lb Life, with Wylie explaining, [...] "They do this amazing thing at the beginning of every episode of that show where they show the person struggling {{to get out of bed}} or walk down a hallway ... They light it badly just to make the person’s journey seem that much more difficult." [...] Boisclair was cast in the role due to his [...] height and slender frame, with prosthetics used to give him a [...] "gigantic body with no neck [...] really skinny arms and legs". Boisclair was called a [...] "rare and lucky find", akin to Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the alien in the 1979 film Alien. Boisclair's prosthetics were designed by Sarah Pickersgill, under special effects makeup head Todd Masters, and took four-and-a-half hours to apply. Masters' team were also responsible for creating the body parts that are found sticking out of walls in the pilot, including Lenny's upper body and arm, produced from a silicone copy of Plaza; extensive bruising for Cary and Kerry Loudermilk after a major fight sequence, which was achieved with Pros-Aide transfers that were reduced each day to show the wounds healing; and the burn makeup for Linklater after he is injured in the pilot, which was designed to cover half his face and most of his chest and back, with just the face and neck requiring five separate prosthetics. Marcine Peter at Contour Contact Lens provided hand-painted contact lenses for the production, including for Boisclair to wear as the Devil with the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Eyes.</b>|$|E

500|$|It took {{eight months}} for Enigma {{to build the}} physics behind the web-based grapple and swing game mechanic. During early builds of the game, the motion was slower, but the {{development}} team sped up the movement, feeling it was truer to the character. The Sonic the Hedgehog series served as an inspiration for the game's pace. Significant effort was put into creating the game's visual style and making Spidy a relatable, charismatic character. Daniel Parente cited Limbo, Braid, and Patapon as influences for the game's aesthetics. Comics and cartoons served as influences for Spidy's design. The character was given a pair of large <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes,</b> which allowed the character to emote. Two of the legs were removed, bringing the total from eight to six, which Andrew McKerrow described {{as an effort to}} avoid triggering the fears of people with arachnophobia and [...] "make the character a little more friendly looking and little less creepy". It was only after making these changes to Spidy that the developers decided to make Spidy an extraterrestrial, as that would justify the character design's deviations from regular spiders.|$|E

It is generally a dark grey bird with white in the wing, undertail coverts, the base of the tail and most visibly, the tip of the tail. It has <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes.</b> The orbital (eye-ring), legs and feet are black, whereas the bill and gape range from greyish black to black. The overall plumage varies according to subspecies. The nominate race versicolor and plumbea are slate-grey in colour, while melanoptera and intermedia are blackish-brown, and arguta of Tasmania and halmaturina a sooty black. The size of the white patch on the wing also varies, being large and easily spotted in versicolor, plumbea, intermedia and arguta, but non-existent or indistinct in melanoptera and halmaturina.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy XII also {{introduces}} the [...] "Occuria", immortal beings {{who have no}} visible faces, only a pair of glowing <b>yellow</b> <b>eyes</b> seen under their floating shell-like armor, surrounded by an aquamarine aura. The Occuria can become selectively invisible, and are also capable of possession, shape-shifting and image projection. Referred to by some as gods, but unknown to the main religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race {{played a central role}} in the history of Ivalice, controlling all major events, such as the rise of the Dynast-King Raithwall. Though peace fostered in Ivalice in the four-hundred year rule after Raithwall, the Occurian Venat, apparently disgusted with its kind's manipulations, rebelled and gave the secret of Nethicite to the Archadia's Dr. Cid and Vayne to overthrow the Occuria and make mankind the masters of their own fate. The events of the game eventually provoke the end the [...] "Age of Stones" [...] (the Occuria's control over Ivalice). In Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings, the Occuria were revealed to have played a part in the sealing of the Purvama Lemurés long ago, which by the present time became a land of legend that many Sky Pirates sought for its Auracite.|$|E
