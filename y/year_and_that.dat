5|$|A further three CH-47Fs {{were ordered}} in December 2015 for $US150 million, {{including}} spare parts, related equipment and some support costs. The ADF {{had intended to}} expand the CH-47F fleet at a later date, but the order was placed at short notice to use an under-spend on other Defence capabilities. All three helicopters were delivered in June 2016, two and half months earlier than planned. During the year the CH-47s were also approved to operate from the Canberra class vessels after trials proved successful. The 2016 Defence White Paper and its supporting documentation stated that the CH-47Fs will receive modifications to better enable them to perform aeromedical evacuation tasks by the 2025–26 financial <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> {{it is intended to}} regularly upgrade the helicopters so that they can continue to be supported through the US military's logistics system.|$|E

5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course. She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time to rein in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E

5|$|Despite its stated {{commitment}} to providing politically balanced programming, C-SPAN and its {{shows such as}} Washington Journal, Booknotes, Q & A, and After Words have been accused by some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias. In 2005, the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN's morning telephone call-in show Washington Journal, showing that Republicans were favored as guests over Democrats by a two-to-one margin during a six-month period that <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> people of color are underrepresented. A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E

5|$|Even {{with the}} Jiajing reforms to {{document}} migrant workers and merchants, {{by the late}} Ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population. Gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the Ming, some guessing that it had doubled, tripled, or even grown fivefold since 1368. Fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps 160 million in the late Ming dynasty, while Brook estimates 175 million, and Ebrey states perhaps as large as 200 million. However, a great epidemic that entered China through the northwest in 1641 ravaged the densely populated areas along the Grand Canal; a gazetteer in northern Zhejiang noted {{more than half the}} population fell ill that <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> 90% of the local populace in one area was dead by 1642.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1892, the Carabane {{school was}} one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns {{belonging}} to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{researchers}} at Tufts University Center for Animals and Public Policy estimated that 14–21 million animals {{were used in}} American laboratories in 1992, a reduction {{from a high of}} 50 million used in 1970. In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Coach Lumbly {{tells the}} debate team that Ginny has {{transferred}} to Townsend Prep for the remainder of her senior <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Hal will be paired with Heston for the day. Struggling with his speech and his stutter, Hal calls his therapist, who suggests that he sing his speech or talk with a foreign accent. Hal and Heston finish the day without much success, while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker, which inexplicably goes missing. Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team, telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school's chances of winning. He breaks into Earl's bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen tequila, then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis's house, who lives across the street from Ginny. A drunken Hal drags Lewis's mother's cello across the street and throws it through Ginny's window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate, Ram.|$|E

These figures were much lower when the budget was brought down on March 26, 2013, but the Dunderdale government was still projecting a deficit of $563.8 million for the 2013 fiscal year. Roughly 1,200 public sector jobs were eliminated, due to spending cuts totalling over $300 million.|$|E
5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City {{can be attributed to the}} lake effect.|$|E

5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
