25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if you were going to make a time machine, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E
500|$|In March 2007, Washington state {{representative}} Larry Seaquist caused a minor controversy {{when he was}} quoted as saying, [...] "These people are {{not the kind of}} people <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> living next door to you. They'd be the ones with the junky cars in the front yard and would try to slip around the law." [...] The quote was assumed to be an attack on NASCAR fans but Seaquist later claimed that it was directed at ISC.|$|E
500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort {{of getting out of}} the Beatles and just going my own way... it was a very happy occasion." [...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> it now." ...|$|E

500|$|Willis went to {{the camp}} and {{impressed}} Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as quick as anything <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to see." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Abrams, of Rogerebert.com, {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review; he awarded {{three out of}} four stars, and praised the film's choreography and fight scenes. He said that [...] "while time hasn't been kind to the best ass-kicking knuckle-draggers, Skin Trade is energetic, and winsome." [...] In his opinion, the movie hails from a [...] "decadent period of action cinema [...] when every renegade cop had a private vendetta, a pet charity/social concern, and a few lousy quips in his back pocket." [...] He summed up his review by saying: [...] "ou can teach a new dog old tricks, though why <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to is anyone's guess." [...] The Action Elite's Eoin Friel also enjoyed the film; he awarded four out of five stars, and praised the choreography, stunts and fight scenes. Unlike Schager or Vishnevetsky, Friel had no issues with Jaa's fluency in English, and even felt he [...] "handled English pretty well".|$|E
500|$|Dante {{debuted in}} Devil May Cry, a game {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} part of Capcom's Resident Evil franchise. Series' creator Hideki Kamiya wrote his name after rewriting the story and took it from Dante Alighieri's poem Divine Comedy. Kamiya has said that the title character from the manga series Cobra by Buichi Terasawa served as the basis for Dante's personality. Kamiya based his idea of Dante on what he perceived as [...] "Stylish" [...] – wearing a long coat to make the character [...] "showy" [...] and a non-smoker, as Kamiya saw that as [...] "more cool". The character wears red because in Japan it is a traditional color for a heroic figure. Kamiya has also stated he perceives Dante as [...] "a character that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to go out drinking with", someone who was not a show-off but would instead [...] "pull some ridiculous, mischievous joke" [...] to endear people to him. He added that this aspect was intended to make the character feel familiar to audiences. Although Kamiya was not the main writer from the first two Devil May Cry novels he viewed Shinya Goikeda's depiction of Dante similar to the one he wrote.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Perala from Anchorage Daily News complimented the video, saying [...] "If {{you have}} a secret fondness for pop singer Madonna, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to check out her Ciao Italia, the singer's concert film from Italy. You can be pleasantly {{surprised}} at how amazing she is." [...] Heather Phares from Allmusic said: [...] "Madonna's Ciao Italia: Live From Italy captures a performance from her 1988 world tour and features hits like 'Lucky Star', 'True Blue', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Like a Virgin', and 'Material Girl'. A much simpler, less choreographed performance than her later extravaganzas like The Girlie Show World Tour, Ciao Italia is still entertaining in its own right, and will definitely please fans nostalgic for some old-school Madonna hits." [...] Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying [...] "A festive Italian stadium show featuring the Material Girl, who's turned into a first-rate entertainer, strutting and singing in flashy production-number renditions of her recent most Billboard topping songs, is indeed a delight. The video captures the enormity of Madonna as a performer, and her theatrics, oomph and chutzpah." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post said that [...] "Ciao Italia works wonderful because it makes Madonna look like she's at home, with her Italian family all around her. [...] A Turin soccer stadium became the sexual {{center of the universe}} last year when Madonna, one of our naughtiest superstars, taped this concert there before 75,000 gyrating Italians. Ebullient and insouciant, Madonna sings her hits-including the darkly beautiful 'Live to Tell'—in cavernous stereo; dances engagingly with 14-year-old Chris Finch, the quintessential Lucky Little Boy; and crowns herself queen of teases, bending over to reveal 'Kiss' printed on her underpants [...] Sheer showmanship is present in her performances as well as the camera work of this video." [...] Jim Farber from Rolling Stone said that [...] "this version of Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour returns the star to the medium where she excels best. On videocassette, however, Madonna makes manipulation seem like an exciting message indeed." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide however, gave a negative review of the album, saying [...] "Possibly the biggest problem with Ciao Italia regarded the sloppy manner in which the program was assembled. I can’t recall if Italia appeared as a TV special that aired live or if it was taped and edited specifically for future broadcast screenings, but it certainly looked like something that was created on the fly. Sloppy camerawork and editing abound, as those two factors don’t flow together terribly well. It felt as though they tried their best to get appropriate material at the time but that they failed to massage it after the fact." ...|$|E

Jane Aubin, scientific director of the Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis at the Canadian Institute for Health Research, said the miners would have to be monitored closely. [...] "They haven't been as physically active as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> [...] to be, so they have undoubtedly experienced some muscle loss", she said. [...] "Probably after that extended period of time, in both a confined space and in relative darkness, they've also probably experienced some bone loss." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Morpurgo, {{the author}} of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: [...] "Spielberg’s a {{wonderful}} storyteller and a kid. He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary to meet someone with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to be there was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep last night. I was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 16, 2008, rival mayoral {{candidate}} Leonard Padilla distributed a 2007 {{report of}} similar allegations made against Johnson at St. HOPE Sacramento High School. The allegations were investigated by local police, but no charges were filed. On April 29, 2008, {{a group of}} female civic leaders including former Sacramento Mayor Ann Rudin, Sacramento Municipal Utility District board member Genevieve Shiroma, and former State Senator Deborah Ortiz demanded {{the release of the}} police report on the matter. The teacher to whom the student initially brought the complaint subsequently resigned over the incident, claiming, [...] "St. HOPE sought to intimidate the student through an illegal interrogation and even had the audacity to ask me to change my story." [...] Sacramento Police Chief Rick Braziel responded, saying, [...] "I think the allegations at the school were handled in the way that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> them handled. Immediately they followed all the normal protocols that they were supposed to follow. I think it was pretty clear there was nothing there... We did ask the young lady whether anyone had influenced her – her answer was no." [...] The Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinness said on May 30, 2008, that Johnson's actions, though ill-advised, were not illegal.|$|E
2500|$|This creates further problems, {{as it is}} {{even more}} crucial to 'save face' after one's {{relationship}} has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as [...] "face-work", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face, and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what [...] "face" [...] you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to do, or you can [...] "save face" [...] by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Diver of BBC Music gave a mixed review, {{writing that}} [...] "the songs of Who You Are are expectedly split between slower, slushier affairs and punchy anthems for bolshy teens" [...] {{and called the}} album [...] "too patchy, too hurried, the powers behind it too eager to {{capitalise}} on the artist's current chart success", although he felt that [...] "there's ample room for improvement". Ailbhe Malone from NME described it as [...] "cheeky, relevant, and fresh [...] but unfortunately [...] a flash that's shortly over" [...] and noticed that [...] "no matter how much Jessie J sings about being herself, we don't really ever {{get a sense of}} who, or what, that is". Gary McGinley of No Ripcord called it [...] "an album of two halves as the stronger brat-pop moments soon give way to by insipid, dated ballads"; he noted that [...] "there are glimpses of promise scattered between the overwrought delivery and unnecessary vocal gymnastics", but concluded by saying that Who You Are [...] "promised much more than what has been delivered". Fiona Shepherd [...] of The Scotsman wrote that it [...] "covers all the tried and tested commercial territory: mainly a slick, generic imitation of American R divas [...] blended with the obligatory hip-pop stance" [...] and felt that Cornish [...] "is more interested in tiresome vocal showboating than communicating anything truthful". Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine agreed, saying that [...] "in the quest to find herself, she seems to have gotten sidetracked". Matthew Perpetua of Pitchfork Media was particularly critical; he felt that [...] "the music is scattered, covering all the bases in an over-eager attempt to prove vocal chops" [...] and noticed that Cornish [...] "comes across like a severely dumbed-down Lily Allen at best, and at worst she seems like someone <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to root against in a televised singing competition".|$|E
