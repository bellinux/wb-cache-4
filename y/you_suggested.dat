25|$|At Yangwu, several war {{plans were}} {{presented}} to Yuan Shao. Ju Shou observed that Cao Cao's men were running out of grain, and thus it would be proper to enter a war of attrition, denying Cao Cao a decisive battle. Another advisor, Xu <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> that Yuan Shao should maintain the front at Guandu {{but at the same}} time send men to circle around and capture the emperor in Xu. Yuan Shao accepted neither plan, saying he preferred to capture the emperor with a direct advance. Xu You was not pleased.|$|E
500|$|The Manfred Symphony {{would cost}} Tchaikovsky more time, effort and soul-searching than {{anything}} else he would write, even the Pathetique Symphony. It also became the longest, most complex work he had written up to that point, and though it owes an obvious debt to Berlioz due to its program, Tchaikovsky {{was still able to}} make the theme of Manfred his own. Near the end of seven months of intensive effort, in late September 1885, he wrote Balakirev, [...] "Never in my life, believe me, have I labored so long and hard, and felt so drained by my efforts. The Symphony is written in four movements, as per your program, although—forgive me—as much as I wanted to, I {{have not been able to}} keep all the keys and modulations <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> ... It is of course dedicated to you".|$|E
2500|$|In 200 CE, {{war broke}} out between Cao Cao and the {{northern}} warlord Yuan Shao. At the Battle of Boma, Xun <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> that Cao Cao use a diversionary tactic to eliminate Yuan Shao's general Yan Liang; the battle ended with victory for Cao Cao and Yan Liang's death {{at the hands of}} Guan Yu. After the victory at Boma, Cao Cao and his forces headed west with their baggage train along the south banks of the Yellow River. Yuan Shao sent his troops across the river to raid the baggage train and they encountered Cao Cao. Cao Cao's subordinates were shocked and they asked him to head back to protect his camp. Xun You said, [...] "This is an opportunity to capture the enemy! Why should we retreat?" [...] Cao Cao looked at Xun You and laughed. He then ordered his troops to use their baggage as bait to lure Yuan Shao's forces into a trap. At the Battle of Yan Ford, when Yuan Shao's soldiers were scrambling for the baggage, Cao Cao sent his infantry and cavalry forces to attack them and scored a major victory; Yuan Shao's general Wen Chou was killed in action. Cao Cao then retreated to Guandu (官渡; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan); Yuan Shao laid siege to Guandu.|$|E

6000|$|But Binet was {{far from}} agreement. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> that Polichinelle should play Scaramouche?" [...] he asked, incredulously.|$|R
6000|$|... [Pleasantly.] You've been so very friendly, haven't you? If <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> to {{him that}} ... he's {{standing}} in Henry's way....|$|E
6000|$|... 'And you're {{going to}} marry her? How very romantic--and convenient! What an {{excellent}} arrangement for her. Which of <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> it?' ...|$|E
60|$|LEVER. I didn't want to come. I don't {{understand}} why <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> it. [MRS. GWYN is silent.] It's been a mistake.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose, now," [...] {{continued}} Nicholas, [...] "that you had {{the power}} to influence nations, what would <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> instead of war?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ingleby {{looked at}} Coulthurst. [...] "I {{scarcely}} think Major Coulthurst would object to anything <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> but I am in his hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{considered}} this with visible intensity. [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> {{is that the}} things you speak of depend on other people?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You made {{a curious}} remark about boldness paying, when <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> coming here. Did {{you know that}} young man was in charge?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know where}} Miss Gascoyne is, but <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that you had}} {{something}} to ask me, and I shall be busy by and by," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I {{should tell}} you that I did as <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> to me. I asked Alec MacKenzie pointblank, and he confessed that he was guilty of George's death.' ...|$|E
3000|$|Could <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> {{some early}} “precursor events” (weak signals) which, if detected, may hint at a growing {{likelihood}} of this Wild Card? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "But supposing {{all this}} turned out as <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> it might, how could {{even the best}} {{disposed}} friend {{do anything to help}} us?" ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> let the executions fixed for Friday the 19th instant be {{postponed}} to, {{and be done}} on, Friday the 26th instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you are {{responsible}} for the whole affair. You introduced Douglas to her. <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> that he should bring her home. Go to her to-morrow and ascertain her intentions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] he protested, [...] "even if I did as <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> {{and went}} back into politics, it would be some time, if ever, before I should be any better off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{called the}} boys together, as <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> and fixed up the meeting for to-night," [...] he said. [...] "They'll {{be ready to}} give you a hearing, after supper, in the hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] he cried--and {{there was}} a frown drawing {{together}} his fine brows--"what <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> amounts to a tyranny on the Queen's part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{and your}} friend have {{certainly}} put your heads together to good purpose," [...] the old lawyer said, [...] "and I {{do not see}} any better plan than <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> <b>You</b> had better have Bassett down here, and give him your instructions yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Interviewer Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> {{that members}} of the Gush Shalom ("Peace Bloc") group who made those {{comments}} should be placed on trial for treason? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite know. <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> the notion. Anyway, I {{scarcely}} think Esmond {{can make}} out very much of a case against us. He doesn't really know that Tomlinson was at the bakery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks for the information," [...] Lisle said coolly. [...] "Do {{you mind}} my inquiring whether {{you would have}} taken the {{sovereign}} in case I'd missed? As <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> I'm lately from the wilds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{two places}} appeal {{to me at}} present, heaven (not hell as <b>you</b> <b>suggested),</b> and Grosvenor Square. Perhaps, however, they are the same; at any rate, there is an angel in both of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> that I dismiss Wilding?" [...] {{cried the}} Duke. [...] "You know his influence, {{and the bad}} {{impression}} his removal would leave." ...|$|R

6000|$|JOAN. [Recoiling] But, Dot, {{what are}} we really going to have for the baby? I can't rehearse with that thing. Can't <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> something, Freda? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would make}} it very easy for me," [...] Lisle said. [...] "Till <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> it, {{the idea of going}} as a soldier never {{occurred}} to me but, with their assistance, it will not be difficult." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] {{said the}} officer. [...] "In fact, {{we heard the}} detonation. Still, I daresay there are several things we should like to ask each other about, and <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> going across to your steamer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He and I {{think that}} there has been some mistake about that. <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> the {{appointment}} to him, and he felt unwilling to raise an objection without giving the matter very mature consideration. You can understand that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am in your hands,' he cried. 'What would <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> that {{we should}} do? Would it not be best that I should remain here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Far better, Porus. The plan <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> is an {{excellent}} one. We must try and make this chamber a little more fitting for Aemilia's abode." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] agreed Geoffrey, {{whose face}} was strangely set. [...] "I am anxious about it, too. Can <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> {{anything}} I should do, Mr. Gray?" ...|$|R
