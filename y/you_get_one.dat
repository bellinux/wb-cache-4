500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Rings of Ahkaten" [...] {{was held}} on 17 October 2012, with filming beginning the next week on 22 October. Director Farren Blackburn had previously worked on the programme in the 2011 Christmas special [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe". According to Matt Smith, there were [...] "between 50 and 60 prosthetic aliens" [...] in a scene set in an alien market. The Doctor features minimally in the first act because Smith was busy filming pick-ups or reshoots for [...] "Nightmare in Silver". Millennium FX's Neill Gorton remarked that he had [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} scene like the Star Wars cantina" [...] and had worked on different moulds in his spare time in case they could be used in the future, as making thirty different aliens at one time would be out of the budget. Much of the episode was constructed around talks of what could be created with limited resources. For example, Cross recalled that producer Marcus Wilson called him and asked, [...] "We've always wanted to have a speeder-bike like in Return of the Jedi and we {{know how to do it}} inexpensively, so can <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> into the story?" [...] However, Cross felt that the speeder-bike ended up having more in common with Flash Gordon. The songs were written by composer Murray Gold. To help establish the year at the beginning of the episode [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials is heard and the Doctor is seen reading a 1981 copy of The Beano. The issue of The Beano was reprinted and included in a special Doctor Who-themed edition on 15 May 2013.|$|E
