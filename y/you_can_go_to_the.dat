Tillery writes that [...] "what we see and experience during the game is actually an illusion" [...] – or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribed – and that [...] "hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality." [...] Speaking at a 1974 press conference, in reply to whether there was a [...] "paradox" [...] between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: [...] "It is difficult... <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Himalayas and miss it completely and [...] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual... I think one by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to, whatever we're chained to." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{you are in}} the deep--whatever that depth be--cry to God: to God Himself, {{and none}} but God. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pure fountain-head, why drink of the stream, which must have {{gathered}} something of defilement as it flows? If you can go to God Himself, why go to any of God's creatures, however holy, pure, and loving? Go to God, who is light of light, life of life. From Him all goodness flows.|$|E
60|$|If you are {{a philosopher}} {{you can do this}} thing: <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of a high building, look down upon your fellow-men 300 feet below, and despise them as insects. Like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds, they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose. They do not even move with the admirable {{intelligence}} of ants, for ants always know when they are going home. The ant is of a lowly station, but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station.|$|E
60|$|To {{be frank}} with you, so great is {{the superiority of}} the French actors, in vaudevilles, the light opera, and genteel comedy, that I fear I have lost my taste for the English stage. Of tragedy I say nothing, for I cannot enter into the poetry of the country at all, but, in all below it, these people, to my taste, are immeasurably our superiors; and by ours, you know I include the English stage. The {{different}} lines here, are divided among the different theatres; so that if you wish to laugh, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Variétés; to weep, to the Théâtre Français; or, to gape, to the Odéon. At the Porte St. Martin, one finds vigorous touches of national character, and at the Gymnase, the fashionable place of resort, just at this moment, national traits polished by convention. Besides these, there are many other theatres, not one of which, in its way, can be called less than tolerable.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, girls, {{the first}} thing to do is to eat. Here are {{biscuits}} for some days, and the two bottles of wine, which we must be sparing of. Dick and I have eaten lots of biscuits, and have had some water from a well at a little distance behind the wood. There was a large gourd lying by it which we have taken the liberty of borrowing. You can drink some water if you like, but you must each take a glass of wine. You must keep up your strength. There is no one in sight, so if you like <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> well and have a wash. Don't be longer than you can help; it would be ruin to be seen before we have changed our clothes. While you are away washing, Dick and I will put on our dresses, and when you come back you can do the same. We can stain our faces and hands afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I've got an idea," [...] Daylight said, hastening {{to get the}} {{conversation}} on less perilous ground. [...] "We're running away from cities, {{and you have no}} kith nor kin, so it don't seem exactly right that we should start off by getting married in a city. So here's the idea: I'll run up to the ranch and get things in shape around the house and give the caretaker his walking-papers. You follow me in a couple of days, coming on the morning train. I'll have the preacher fixed and waiting. And here's another idea. You bring your riding togs in a suit case. And as soon as the ceremony's over, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel and change. Then out you come, and you find me waiting with a couple of horses, and we'll ride over the landscape so as you can see the prettiest parts of the ranch the first thing. And she's sure pretty, that ranch. And now that it's settled, I'll be waiting for you at the morning train day after to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{these remarks}} Matlack had stood quietly {{gazing at the}} bishop. [...] "Do you see that pile of logs and {{branches}} there?" [...] said he; [...] "that's the firewood that's got to be cut for to-morrow, which is Sunday, when we don't want to be cuttin' wood; and if you'll {{go to work and}} cut it into pieces to fit this stove, I'll give you your supper. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other camp and sleep where you have been sleepin', if you want to, and in the mornin' I'll give you your breakfast. I 'ain't got no right to give you Mr. Archibald's victuals, but what you eat I'll pay for out of my own pocket, considerin' that you'll do my work. Then to-morrow I'll give you just one hour after you've finished your breakfast {{to get out of this}} camp altogether, entirely out of my sight. I tried to have you sent away before, but other people took you up, and so I said no more; but now things are different. When a man pulls up what I've drove down, and sets loose what I've locked up, and the same as snaps his fingers in my face when I'm attendin' to my business, then I don't let that man stay in my camp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're as glad as you are, Phil," [...] Jack had answered. [...] "Glad on {{your account}} {{as well as}} our own. Now maybe <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Colby Hall with us." ...|$|R
