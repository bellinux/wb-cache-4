500|$|... "John Lee Hooker for President" [...] is a blues song {{in which}} Cooder narrates as American blues {{musician}} John Lee Hooker visiting the White House. Adopting Hooker's style and laconic vocal tone, {{he decides to}} run for the presidency after disliking what he observed in his visit, naming Jimmy Reed as Vice President, Little Johnny Taylor as Secretary of State, and proposing to have [...] "nine fine-lookin' womens on the Supreme Court". According to Cooder, the song was inspired by blues musician Gus Cannon's 1927 song [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Blame</b> the Colored Man", a satirical piece about Booker T. Washington's invitation to the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1901.|$|E

I never got the girl but I once got the gorilla in a 3-D picture called Gorilla at Large. I menaced Claudette Colbert, Lizabeth Scott, Paulette Goddard, Anne Baxter, Barbara Stanwyck. Those girls would take one {{look at me and}} scream and can <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> them? I was drowned, beaten, stabbed and all for my art. But I knew I was horribly overweight. I lacked any kind of self esteem. At 25 I was playing the fathers of people older than me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thiệu's {{aversion to}} public {{appearances}} {{was attributed to}} a fear of hostility from South Vietnamese who believed that he failed them. He acknowledged his compatriots’ low esteem of his administration in a 1992 interview, but said, [...] "You say that <b>you</b> <b>blame</b> me for the fall of South Vietnam, you criticize me, everything. I let you do that. I [...] {{like to see you}} do better than I." [...] Thiệu continually predicted the demise of the Vietnamese Communist Party's grip on power and warned against the United States establishing diplomatic relations with the communist regime. [...] (Relations between the U.S. and the communist regime in Hanoi were formally established in 1995.) Thiệu said that when the communists were deposed and when [...] "democracy is recovered" [...] that he would return to his homeland, but their hold on Vietnam remained unchallenged during his lifetime. He futilely offered to represent the refugee community in reconciliation talks with Hanoi to allow exiles to return home.|$|E

He later said [...] "This was a mess... and there was always that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got to the point where we did not know who we were fighting and why, and you can say that we are damn glad to be back." [...] The flyers had their passports confiscated, and they were to be returned when they attested that they had never forsworn allegiance to America.|$|E
