The worst invasive plants include shoebutton (Ardisia elliptica), lantana (Lantana camara), <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria parviflora), and Pride of India (Melia azedarach). On Laysan this sedge and other plants were decimated by introduced rabbits. The seeds are eaten by the Laysan finch (Telespiza cantans).|$|E
50|$|Setaria pumila is {{a species}} of grass known by many common names, {{including}} <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> yellow bristle-grass, pigeon grass, and cattail grass. It is native to Europe, but it is known throughout {{the world as a}} common weed. It grows in lawns, sidewalks, roadsides, cultivated fields, and many other places. This annual grass grows 20 centimeters to well over a meter in height, its mostly hairless stems ranging from green to purple-tinged in color. The leaf blades are hairless on the upper surfaces, twisting, and up to 30 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a stiff, cylindrical bundle of spikelets 2 to 15 centimeters long with short, blunt bristles. The panicle may appear yellow or yellow-tinged.|$|E
5000|$|Rootworm larvae can {{complete}} development only on {{corn and}} a few other species of grasses. Rootworm larvae reared on other grasses (specifically, <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail)</b> emerged as adults later and had smaller head capsule size as adults compared to larvae reared on corn. Adults feed primarily on corn silk, pollen and kernels on exposed ear tips, although they will feed on leaves and pollen of other plants. Adults begin emerging before corn reproductive tissues are present, adults may feed on leaf tissue, scraping away the green surface tissue and leaving a window-pane appearance. However, adults quickly shift to preferred green silks and pollen as they become available. Northern corn rootworm adults feed on reproductive tissues of the corn plant, but rarely feed on corn leaves. [...] "Northern" [...] adults are more likely than [...] "western" [...] adults to abandon corn and seek pollen or flowers of other plants as corn matures.|$|E

Seedlings were grown under controlled environment. Seedlings were harvested 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after treatment (HAT) and sectioned into root, shoot/stalk and leaves. ^ Absorption of root applied radioactivity was 135. 6 (120 HAT) and 230 (96 HAT) disintegration per minute (dpm) mg− 1 fresh weight in velvetleaf and <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> respectively. The translocation of root absorbed 14 C-isoxaflutole to shoot was 83. 6 % (120 HAT) in velvetleaf and 93 % (72 HAT) in <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail.</b> When applied to the <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail</b> foliage, absorption was maximum 24 HAT and translocation of 14 C-isoxaflutole from treated leaf to other plant parts reached its peak at 48 HAT (33. 4 %). Based on Rf values, applied radioactivity was partitioned into isoxaflutole (Rf = 0. 91), diketonitrile metabolite (Rf = 0. 62), unknown metabolite ‘A’ (Rf = 0. 49) and benzoic acid (Rf = 0. 29). <b>Yellow</b> <b>foxtail</b> had more benzoic acid content (21. 08 %) than the benzoic acid content (12. 85 %) in velvetleaf. The active herbicide fraction (total of diketonitrile metabolite and unknown metabolite ‘A’) was more in velvetleaf (80. 2 %) than in <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail</b> (69. 9 %). The presence of high level of active herbicide fraction in velvetleaf may explain its susceptibility to isoxaflutole. ^ Absorption of root applied 14 C-isoxaflutole was more in Pioneer- 3751 corn hybrid (52. 1 dpm mg− 1 fresh weight in 24 h) than in Pioneer- 3394 corn hybrid (37. 5 dpm mg− 1 fresh weight 24 h). However, absorption of 14 C-isoxaflutole and its subsequent translocation from root to shoot reached its peak 96 HAT in two corn hybrids. Both corn hybrids were equally tolerant to isoxaflutole. Benzoic acid contents in the P- 3394 and P- 3751 (24. 57 and 25. 57 %, respectively) were similar, while the active herbicide fraction was also similar (63. 7 % and 67. 8 %) in P- 3394 and P- 3751. ...|$|E

Addition of crop oil concentrate to the spray solution increased phytotoxicity. When plants {{were treated with}} single droplets, smaller concentrated droplets were more phytotoxic than larger more dilute droplets. Application site of single herbicide droplets also influenced phytotoxicity. ^ Fluazifop-butyl, haloxyfop-methyl and sethoxydim exhibited soil herbicidal activity in greenhouse and field experiments. When grass seeds were planted at the soil surface control was greater with all three herbicides than when planted 2, 4, or 6 cm deep. Imbibition of the herbicides by grass and soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. seed did not reduce germination at concentrations of 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 3) M or below. All three herbicides were more readily absorbed from the soil by seedling roots than shoots. Haloxyfop-methyl exhibited the longest soil residual in the field followed by fluazifop-butyl and sethoxydim. Haloxyfop-methyl and fluazifop-butyl controlled shattercane Sorghum bicolor (L.)

A field experiment was conducted in 2009 to determine the influence of increasing N fertilizer rates and increasing Palmer amaranth densities on weed biomass and grain sorghum biomass and yield. Three rates were 0, 67, and 134 kg N ha- 1 and natural populations of Palmer amaranth were thinned to densities of 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 plants m- 1 of row. Palmer amaranth biomass increased as weed density and N rates increased. Weed-free grain sorghum yields were similar across all three N rates, and parameter estimates of yield across Palmer amaranth densities were not different between N rates. Based on the parameter estimates from the rectangular hyperbola model, initial slope (I) as density approached zero was 16 %. Maximum expected yield loss (A) at high Palmer amaranth densities was 68 %. Palmer amaranth showed a high response to N and the higher N rate increased the ability of the weed to reduce grain sorghum yield. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the influence of six N rates on growth of six selected plant species, including grain sorghum, soybean, <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> velvetleaf, Palmer amaranth and shattercane. Covariance analysis was performed with N rate as a covariate. Biomass of all species increased as N rate increased in both runs of the study. Soybean responded the least to N rate of all species in regards to biomass, height and leaf area production. In the first run, the biomass of three grass species (grain sorghum, <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> shattercane) had similar estimates of slope and intercept of biomass across N rates. In the second run, the biomass slopes of grain sorghum and shattercane differed from soybean and were the only slopes that differed between species. Palmer amaranth had the highest rate of response as N increased but slopes of height were similar for Palmer amaranth, grain sorghum and shattercane. Soybean leaf area slopes were different from grain sorghum, <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> and velvetleaf, but all other slopes were not different among species. Addition of N to grain sorghum increased weed growth and resulted in more yield loss as a result of weed density. The greenhouse study demonstrated that grain sorghum and Palmer amaranth increased in response similarly to the addition of N. Alternative N fertilizer management could play a role in minimizing Palmer amaranth impacts in grain sorghum production...|$|E

ThompsonThe acetolactate synthase {{inhibitor}} herbicide-resistant {{grain sorghum}} technology introduced {{will allow for}} the application of nicosulfuron for postemergence (POST) grass control, however it is essential to determine a program-based approach to ensure broad spectrum weed control. Field experiments were conducted at three locations across Kansas in 2015 and 2016 to assess a range of possible herbicide programs for grass and broadleaf weed control and crop tolerance using InzenTM Sorghum. The experiments consisted of 1 early pre-plant (EPP), 2 preemergence (PRE), and 3 POST, and 5 PRE followed by POST herbicide treatments. Weed control and crop response were evaluated visually at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after POST treatment (WAPT). Treatments containing nicosulfuron and/or bromoxynil & pyrasulfotole caused 10 to 20 % crop injury at 1 WAPT in both 2015 and 2016 at the three locations. Treatments containing nicosulfuron + dicamba caused up to 30 % injury with more injury in 2015 than in 2016. In 2015 at Manhattan the nicosulfuron-only treatment provided 64 % control of Palmer amaranth and, when tank mixed with dicamba or bromoxynil & pyrasulfotole, control ranged from 71 to 76 %. When nicosulfuron POST followed PRE of S-metolachlor & atrazine, Palmer amaranth control was 96 to 100 %. At both locations, nicosulfuron provided 35, 55, and 61 % control of large crabgrass, <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> and stinkgrass, respectively. Annual grass control ranged from 85 to 100 % when nicosulfuron followed a PRE S-metolachlor & atrazine. Greenhouse experiments were set up to determine the efficacy of nicosulfuron on four annual grass species at six different rates, two different rates, and the addition of atrazine. The four grass species evaluated were large crabgrass, <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> barnyardgrass, and wheat. Nicosulfuron was applied at 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2 times its labeled rate of 35 g ha- 1. A full factorial of rate by height by atrazine was applied for a total of 24 treatments replicated 4 times on each species. Each nicosulfuron rate was applied with and without atrazine at 840 g ha- 1 on 5 to 10 cm tall plants and on 15 to 20 cm tall plants. Visual ratings were taken 1, 2, and 4 weeks after treatment (WAT). Aboveground biomass was harvested 4 WAT, dried and weighed. Treatments containing nicosulfuron from 4. 4 to 70 g ha- 1 all caused similar reduction in biomass compared to the nontreated check. Averaged over the inclusion of atrazine, nicosulfuron applied at 35 and 70 g ha- 1 provided 17 % less control when treating 15 to 20 cm large crabgrass compared to the 5 to 10 cm large crabgrass, respectively.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyJohanna A. DilleThis {{dissertation}} has two complementary components: educational, in {{a survey}} of students in Weed Science and their perception of the Kansas State University Agronomy Learning farm, and research, regarding interactions between mesotrione and sulfonylurea herbicides. The Learning Farm serves as a resource where undergraduate students at KSU can develop agronomic skills through hands-on field site experiences and investigations. Students’ perceptions of experiential learning activities in the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills were studied {{as a result of the}} Learning Farm. Activities included: undergraduate students in Weed Science (AGRON 330) developing a weed management recommendation, and Undergraduate Research Assistants (URAs) conducting weed science research projects at the Learning Farm. Students stated that experiential learning activities increased their critical thinking skills, required effective time management, and presented concepts that could be used in other situations. Pre- and post-project evaluation questionnaires showed that URAs had an increased interest in agronomy, weed science, and research following the completion of their project. For the research project, field and greenhouse studies were conducted from 2003 to 2006 to evaluate the efficacy of various sulfonylurea herbicides when applied with mesotrione or mesotrione + atrazine. Research demonstrated that the addition of mesotrione to sulfonylurea herbicides decreased efficacy of sulfonylurea herbicides on green foxtail, <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> and shattercane. The addition of atrazine to the tank mix, or increased mesotrione rates, resulted in additional decrease in sulfonylurea herbicide efficacy on shattercane and foxtail species. Additional studies were performed to determine if absorption, translocation, or metabolism was the basis for the reduction in sulfonylurea herbicide efficacy when mixed with mesotrione or mesotrione + atrazine. Results indicated that the cause of antagonistic interaction between mesotrione and sulfonylurea herbicides in green and <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail</b> was reduced absorption and translocation of the sulfonylurea herbicides.

40|$|Setaria spp. (foxtails) {{comprise}} {{a group of}} serious cosmopolitan weeds. Current control strategies for these species are flawed due to the heavy reliance on herbicide use and the associated problems. An improved weed management system can only be developed after weedy adaptation is understood, through the studies of weed population biology and physiology. Investigations of Setaria 2 ̆ 7 s genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and variation in herbicide resistance represent the initial steps toward this goal;Isozyme analyses indicated that, foxtails, like other introduced, self-pollinating weeds, had low genetic variation but strong population genetic differentiation. At the species level, S. geniculata (knotroot foxtail, abbreviated herein as Krft) had the greatest heterozygosity, followed by S. viridis (green foxtail, or Gnft), S. glauca (<b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> or Yeft), and S. faberii (giant foxtail, or Gift). Knotroot foxtail had the strongest population differentiation followed by Yeft and Gnft. Little isozyme polymorphism was found in Gift and no further analysis was conducted for the species. There were geographic patterns in the genetic diversity of individual species. A north-south gradient occurred to Gnft and Krft populations in North America. <b>Yellow</b> <b>foxtail</b> populations formed three distinctive clusters: Asian, European, and North American cluster. Green and Yeft populations in Iowa had greater diversity than those {{from the rest of}} North America. Such population genetic structures likely resulted from founder effects, multiple introductions, and natural selection. Some populations, sampled on various geographic scales, were genetically well differentiated. Other populations from diverse ecological environments shared identical genotypes. Phylogenetically, Gnft and foxtail millet were likely the same species and several Gnft varieties appeared to be genetically identical. A high degree of genetic similarity was also shared between Krft and Yeft;Foxtails had inter- and intraspecific variation in atrazine and metolachlor resistance. The resistance mechanisms (quantitative or qualitative) to these two herbicides may be different in yellow, green and giant foxtail. Glutathione-herbicide conjugation mediated by glutathione S-transferase was not the primary detoxification mechanism for these herbicides in these foxtail species. No evidence for population shifts to more resistant foxtail variants with prolonged atrazine exposure was found in several detailed studies...|$|E
40|$|Predicting weed {{emergence}} {{is useful}} for planning weed management programs. Unfortunately, our ability to anticipate initial emergence and subsequent levels of emergence from simple field observations or weather reports is often inadequate to achieve optimal control. Weed emergence models may provide predictive tools that help managers anticipate best management options and times and, thereby, improve weed control. In this study, the germination characteristics of four annual grass weeds (large crabgrass, goosegrass, green foxtail, and <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail)</b> were investigated under different temperatures and water stresses to calculate base temperatures and base water potentials. These parameters were used to develop a mathematical model describing seedling emergence processes in terms of hydrothermal time. Hydrothermal time describes seed germination in a single equation by considering the interaction of soil water potential and soil temperature. The model, called WeedTurf, predicted emergence with some accuracy, especially for large crabgrass (lowest efficiency index [EF] value 0. 95) and green foxtail (lowest EF value 0. 91). These results suggest the possibility of developing interactive computer software to determine the critical timing of weed removal and provide improved recommendations for herbicide application timing...|$|E
40|$|Goss’s {{bacterial}} wilt and blight, caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis (Cmn), has reemerged {{as an important}} disease of Zea mays (corn) in the U. S. Midwest. Results from a 2011 multistate survey indicated that Setaria spp. (foxtail) were often present in corn fields {{with a history of}} Cmn. The objective of this research was to determine if Setaria spp. that are common in the Midwest are susceptible to infection by Cmn. In the greenhouse, seedlings of four Setaria spp., including S. viridis (green foxtail), S. faberi (giant foxtail), S. verticillata (bristly foxtail), and S. pumila (<b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail),</b> and Zea mays (Golden Cross Bantam sweet corn, GCB) were inoculated with a suspension of 1. 0 × 107 bacteria cells. The trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design and repeated once. Percent of symptomatic leaf area was visually estimated eight days after inoculation. S. faberi exhibited the highest levels of disease among the four Setaria spp., with disease incidence similar to what was observed on Z. mays. S. viridis was the next most susceptible. Symptoms were also observed on S. viridis, S. verticillata, and were lowest for S. pumila. Bacterial streaming was confirmed microscopically and Cmn was reisolated from the four Setaria species. Results indicate that these four Setaria spp. are susceptible to Cmn, thus serving as potential sources of inoculum...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the production of Stemphylium vesicarium conidia and Pleospora allii ascospores from different inoculum sources on the ground were compared in a model system of a wildflower meadow mainly composed of <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> creeping cinquefoil and white clover. The meadow was either inoculated (each October) or not inoculated with a virulent strain of S. vesicarium, and either covered or not covered with a litter of inoculated pear leaves. Spore traps positioned a few centimetres above the ground were exposed for 170 7 -day periods between October 2003 and December 2006. Ascospores and conidia were trapped in 46 and 25 % of samples, respectively. Ascospore numbers trapped from the pear leaf litter were about five times higher than those from the meadow, while conidial numbers were similar from the different inoculum sources. The ascosporic season was very long, with two main trapping periods: December-April, and August-October; the former was most important for the leaf litter, the latter for the meadow. The conidial season lasted from April to November, with 92 % of conidia caught between July and September. The fungus persistently colonized the meadow: the meadow inoculated in early October 2003 produced spores until autumn 2006. The present work demonstrates that orchard ground is {{an important source of}} inoculum for brown spot of pear. Thus, it is important to reduce inoculum by managing the orchard ground all year long...|$|E
40|$|Cover Crop: Sorghum {{is used as}} {{a drought}} tolerant, summer annual {{rotational}} cover crop either alone or seeded in a warm season cover crop mixture. There are multiple cultivars of sorghum available for use as a cover crop including sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids (Sorghum bicolor x Sorghum bicolor var. sudanense). However, all sorghum and Sudangrass-related species have the potential to smother weeds, suppress nematode species, and penetrate compacted subsoil (Clark, 2007). Sorghum cover crops can also be used as livestock forage in a cropping system (Magdoff and Van Es, 2009). Sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids can produce up to 4, 000 - 5, 000 pounds of dry matter per acre (Clark, 2007). Soil Compaction: Sorghums and sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids have extensive root systems that can penetrate up to 8 feet into the soil and extend more than 3 feet away from the stem (Shoemaker and Bransby, 2010). These aggressive root systems alleviate subsoil compaction. To encourage more significant root growth, sorghum stalks should be cut at least once during the growing season when they reach 3 – 4 feet tall (Clark, 2007). Weed Management: Sorghums are quick growing grasses that have the potential to shade out and/or smother weed populations when planted at a high density. In addition, root exudates of sorghum have been shown to reduce the growth of weeds such as velvet leaf, thorn apple, redroot pigweed, crabgrass, <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail</b> and barnyardgrass (Stapleton et al., 2010). Sorghum is also recommended for control of nutsedge infestations (Clark, 2007). Flowering sorghum seed head and vegetation in Tucson, Arizona...|$|E
40|$|Field experiments, {{conducted}} from 1991 to 1994, generated {{information on}} weed seedbank emergence for 22 site-years from Ohio to Colorado and Minnesota to Missouri. Early spring seedbank densities were estimated through direct extraction of viable seeds from soil cores. Emerged seedlings were recorded periodically, as were daily values for air and soil temperature, and precipitation. Percentages of weed seedbanks that emerged as seedlings were calculated from seedbank and seedling data for each species, and relationships between seedbank emergence and microclimatic variables were sought. Fifteen species {{were found in}} 3 or more site-years. Average emergence percentages (and coefficients of variation) of these species were as follows: giant foxtail, 31. 2 (84 %); velvetleaf, 28. 2 (66); kochia, 25. 7 (79); Pennsylvania smartweed, 25. 1 (65); common purslane, 15. 4 (135); common ragweed, 15. 0 (110); green foxtail, 8. 5 (72); wild proso millet, 6. 6 (104); hairy nightshade, 5. 2 (62); common sunflower, 5. 0 (26); <b>yellow</b> <b>foxtail,</b> 3. 4 (67); pigweed species, 3. 3 (103); common lambsquarters, 2. 7 (111); wild buckwheat, 2. 5 (63), and prostrate knotweed, 0. 6 (79). Variation among site-years, for some species, {{could be attributed to}} microclimate variables thought to induce secondary dormancy in spring. For example, total seasonal emergence percentage of giant foxtail was related positively to the 1 st date at which average daily soil temperature at 5 to 10 cm soil depth reached 16 C. Thus, if soil warmed before mid April, secondary dormancy was induced and few seedlings emerged, whereas many seedlings emerged if soil remained cool until June...|$|E
