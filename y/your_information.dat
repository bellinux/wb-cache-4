25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat <b>your</b> <b>information</b> and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get <b>your</b> <b>information</b> correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E

Linderman also ordered Pollock to [...] "instruct Mr. Barber to prepare a reverse die for a dollar with a representation of an eagle as well as the inscriptions required by law. He will select whichever of his Heads of Liberty he prefers for the obverse of the same." [...] Linderman evidently preferred the designs of Morgan over those of the Chief Engraver; he wrote Pollock on February 21, 1878, [...] "I have now to state for <b>your</b> <b>information,</b> that it is my intention, in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress, becoming law, to request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the dies prepared by Mr. Morgan." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for The A.V. Club on January 4, 2006, Hayes was again asked about the episode.

2500|$|In February 1982, Iraq {{was removed}} from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism to ease the {{transfer}} of dual-use technology to that country. According to investigative journalist Alan Friedman, Secretary of State Alexander Haig was [...] "upset at the fact that the decision had been made at the White House, even though the State Department was responsible for the list." [...] "I was not consulted," [...] Haig is said to have complained. In March, President Reagan signed National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 4-82—seeking [...] "a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East"—and in June Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) co-written by NSC official Howard Teicher, which determined: [...] "The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran." [...] Pursuant to this Directive, Thomas Twetten arrived in Baghdad on July 27 to share CIA satellite imagery on Iranian troop movements with the Iraqi Mukhabarat. This was [...] "the first U.S. provision of intelligence to Iraq," [...] and sparked a short-lived debate over whether Iraq would tolerate a CIA presence in the country: Mukhabarat head Barzan Tikriti told Twetton to [...] "get the hell out of Iraq," [...] but Iraqi military intelligence—"having already drooled over it and having said repeatedly how valuable it was"—subsequently informed Twetton [...] "we'll continue to look at <b>your</b> <b>information,</b> and we'll assess whether it is of use to us in any way." [...] Reports of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran reached the CIA as early as 1983, but the U.S. took no action to restrain Iraq's violations of international law, failing even to alert the UN. In late 1983, Reagan selected Donald Rumsfeld as his envoy to the Middle East; Rumsfeld met Saddam in Baghdad in December 1983 and March 1984. [...] "On November 26, 1984, Iraq and the U.S. restored diplomatic relations." ...|$|E
