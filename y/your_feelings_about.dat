One third were CF gene carriers. The Health Orientation Scale (HOS) was used to evaluate perceived feelings about three situations: (a) How would you describe <b>your</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>about</b> yourself when you consider your test result? (b) How do you think most people feel when they are told that they carry the CF gene? (c) How do you think most people feel when they are told that they do not carry the CF gene? Comparing the profiles of CF carriers and non-carriers, we found that carriers had significantly less positive feelings about themselves than non-carriers. Carriers as well as non-carriers attribute significantly more negative feelings to most carriers of the CF gene than to most non-carriers. Moreover, carriers of the Cf gene attribute more negative feelings to other CF carriers than to themselves. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of carrier status on self-description, as well as a significant effect of carrier status and degree of kinship with a CF patient on feelings attributed to most carriers. Although these results suggest some danger of stigmatization of CF carriers, the cognitive bias of 'illusory superiority' seems to counterbalance some of its effects. status: publishe...|$|E

Attitudes towards mathematics expressed in drawings significantly correlated with attitudes expressed in the TIMSS statements about mathematics.

I know that, before I undertook my research into Mr. Cook three years ago, I could say that I knew the buildings better than the man who gave us these cloistered, special buildings. In brief, Mr. Cook gave the University of Michigan the Martha Cook Building, then the Lawyers Club, then the John P.
