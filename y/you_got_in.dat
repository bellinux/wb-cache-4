[...] "I wanted to write some strong characters, but I didn't {{want them to be}} like those horrible people in those awful American science fiction films, chewing gum and stating the obvious. Not that I wanted to do something terribly 'British', but I didn't like all the flag-waving <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> those films. I tried to get real human interest in the stories, and some good humour." ...|$|E

According to Mitchell, {{while they were}} {{getting ready for the}} show the band and their entourage were informed about a possible drug bust planned for the following day. The group's road crew warned everyone to take precautions against any potential for drugs to be planted on them. Mitchell responded by wearing a suit without pockets and not wearing any underwear. Tour managers Gerry Stickells and Tony Ruffino expressed their concern to Hendrix and asked him if he had any drugs on him to which he replied: [...] "No." [...] After arriving in Toronto, he was awoken by concert promoter Ron Terry who told him: [...] "Whatever <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> that bag, get rid of it." [...] Terry then took him into the plane's bathroom and dumped anything that might be mistaken for illegal drugs into the toilet. Terry commented: [...] "I thought he was clean." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Orr, a {{columnist}} in the Toronto Star, suggested that Hextall's aggressive nature, {{which resulted in}} three suspensions of six or more games during his NHL career, was an intentional part of his game designed to protect him. He theorized that because Hextall's style of play frequently took {{him out of his}} goal crease, the threat of physical violence lessened the chances of him being challenged by an attacker when out of position. In the 1993 playoff series between the Montreal Canadiens and Hextall's Nordiques, the Canadiens' coach Jacques Demers designed a plan to disrupt Hextall's play after Montreal had lost its two first games to Quebec. He noted that Hextall would be off his game if he were disturbed or bumped. Montreal then won four straight games to win the series in six games. Demers felt that Hextall's emotional play lessened his effectiveness; while acknowledging him as a [...] "great competitor", he felt that [...] "he didn't reach the level of a Grant Fuhr or a Martin Brodeur [...] he lost his cool if <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> his face." ...|$|E
