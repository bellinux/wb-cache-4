5|$|Lake sturgeon, {{endangered}} in both Indiana and Illinois, {{as well as}} banded killifish, {{threatened in}} Illinois, are both part of the Wolf Lake ecology. The lake supports the nesting habitat for four species of endangered birds: little blue heron, <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron,</b> black-crowned night heron, and yellow-headed blackbird.|$|E
25|$|Ardeidaes rest in salty ponds (snowy egret, green heron, western cattle egret, <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron,</b> tricolored heron, etc.) {{and living}} with the aquatic turtles, the common moorhen, the blue land crab, the blackback land crab, the sand fiddler crab and other species of crabs. The common kestrel is easily visible and audible during rides into the dry forest, like the zenaida dove, an endemic species of West Indies {{protected}} inside the archipelago.|$|E
50|$|Human {{activities}} also constitute {{threats to}} the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron.</b> In areas where the herons cohabit with people, they are often disturbed or shooed away from their nests if they {{get too close to}} human habitations. Loss of habitat is another major threat to the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron,</b> with the wetlands they favor regressing continually. Additionally, in some part of the Americas such as Louisiana and the Bahamas, the meat of the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> is considered a delicacy, leading to illegal hunting of the fledgling.|$|E
50|$|There are 172 {{species of}} birds, {{including}} four species of hummingbird, broad-winged hawks, <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>herons,</b> and the brown trembler. Some {{plants and animals}} thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica's forests.|$|R

50|$|Before they mysteriously {{disappeared}} in 1995, {{a number of}} species have been spotted at the Sanctuary, including snowy egrets, glossy ibis, black-crowned and <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>herons,</b> little blue herons, green herons and tri-colored herons. In 2003, The Wetlands Institute identified the American redstart, black and white warbler, black-throated blue warbler, downy woodpecker and sharp-shinned hawk, {{but none of the}} egrets and herons that were traditionally identified with the area. In 2005, a number of feral cats were trapped and removed from the site, leading to fines for anyone caught feeding stray cats without a license.|$|R
50|$|The delta {{is a vital}} {{stopping}} point along the Mississippi Flyway. The flyway stretches from southern Ontario {{to the mouth of}} the Mississippi River and contains one of the longest migration routes in the Western Hemisphere. About 460 bird species have been recorded in Louisiana, with 90% (300 species) found within the coastal wetlands. Many diverse and rare species including indigo buntings, scarlet tanagers, <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>herons</b> and bald eagles call Louisiana home. Also found in the Mississippi River Delta are great egrets, glossy ibises, roseate spoonbills, wintering hummingbirds, birds of prey and wood storks.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this 3 -year study were to locate mixed heronries in Oklahoma, census breeding pairs of each species, and indentify site characteristics {{that may be}} important to heron ecology. During the study, 17 mixed heronries, containing {{a total of six}} ardeid species, were found in Oklahoma. The majority of heronries (82 %) were located within the oak-woodland fauna region. Other site characteristics determined to be important were the slope of the topography, nearness to a permanent water source, and proximity to urban areas. In 1980, approximately 27, 850 pairs of herons were estimated to have nested in 17 heronries. Cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis) are most numerous (61 %) and <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>herons</b> (Nyctanassa violacea) are least common in the state...|$|R
50|$|The <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> is {{generally}} not considered a threatened species, as the population size is very large, its range is wide {{and it has a}} stable trend. Its status with the IUCN is of Least Concern, meaning no conservation action is required across the species’ range. However, this status changes in some specific geographic locations, such as Indiana, where the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> is considered Endangered, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Kentucky where it is classified as Threatened, and Virginia, where it is classified as Special Concern. As such, some conservation measures are taken locally, but the conservation of the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> is usually simply included in broader projects, especially those that aim for wetland conservation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> {{is found}} {{exclusively}} in the Americas, and its distribution depends closely on food (mainly crustaceans) availability.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} species of birds, the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> is an {{intermediate}} host and amplifier of the eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus (sleeping sickness). This common virus in the Southeast of the United States is lethal to horses and can be to humans as well. It is transmitted by mosquitoes: an infected mosquito will transmit the virus to a <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron,</b> which will be unaffected by it but will host it (the heron {{is known as a}} “reservoir host” for the virus) until another mosquito picks it up from the heron and transmits it to a horse or a human. Because of the distances that the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> travels when it migrates, it carries the virus over larger geographical areas, becoming an amplifier of the EEE. However, EEE remains a rare disease which symptoms can be treated, and only a few cases are declared every year.|$|E
50|$|The refuge was {{established}} in 1975 and provides important stop-over and nesting habitat for over 200 species of neotropical migratory birds. The refuge is also known for large numbers of wintering waterfowl, at times exceeding 125,000 birds. Mallards, American wigeon, gadwall, northern shoveler, teal, scaup, and ring-necked ducks traveling through the Mississippi Flyway stop by Hillside National Wildlife Refuge each winter. Breeding populations of wood ducks and hooded mergansers can be found throughout the refuge. Common shorebirds include killdeer, snipe, least and pectoral sandpipers, and greater and lesser yellowlegs. A wading bird rookery provides nesting and roosting habitat for several species of marsh and wading birds including white ibis; great, snowy, and cattle egrets; great blue, little blue, and green-backed herons; and <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>herons.</b>|$|R
40|$|Diamondback {{terrapins}} (Malaclemys terrapin) {{are native}} to the remote oceanic islands of Bermuda and presently inhabit only four small brackish water ponds on a private golf course. The life history of this species is poorly understood on Bermuda and so {{the aim of this}} study was to fill these knowledge gaps, to compare the results with what is known from other areas in the North American range, and to inform the development of a local management plan. The results of a mark-recapture census revealed that ca. 100 individuals ≥ 81 mm straight carapace length live on Bermuda, of which nearly half (48. 5 %) were considered sexually mature. The population is dominated by females (sex ratio 2. 9 : 1) and annual recruitment over the three year period was found to be extremely low (approximately two terrapins). Female diamondback terrapins in Bermuda nest almost exclusively within a limited number of sand bunkers on the golf course. Nesting commenced in late March or early April and ended in late August. Peak oviposition was observed in May and June. Clutch size averaged 5. 1 eggs (range 0 - 10; SD 2. 4) and the incubation period averaged 61. 8 days (range 49 - 83; SD 10. 5). Delayed emergence was documented, with 43. 8 % of the hatchlings remaining in their natal nests over the winter months. The mean annual hatching success rate was determined to be 19 % (range 17. 6 - 21; SD 1. 9). Radio-telemetry was used to investigate the movements and survivorship of postemergent hatchling diamondback terrapins. The results indicated that mangrove swamps and grass-dominated marshes adjacent to the ponds are important developmental habitats for hatchlings. <b>Yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>herons</b> (Nyctanassa violacea) were found to be significant predators of small terrapins during spring emergence. Small aquatic gastropods comprised 66. 7 % of the faecal samples analysed from the Bermudian population. Scavenged fish and vertebrate animal remains, terrestrial arthropods, polychaete worms and bivalves were consumed in lesser amounts. Sediment from the pond environment was found in 74 % of the faecal samples analysed and is believed to have been incidentally ingested while foraging for the small benthic gastropods. Eco-toxicological analyses of the pond sediment, prey and terrapin eggs showed that the Bermudian diamondback terrapins live and feed in wetland habitats characterised by chronic, multifactorial contamination; principally total petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a variety of heavy metals. This study found that some of those contaminants are accumulating in the gastropod prey as well as being transferred to terrapin eggs. This may be reducing the incidence of successful embryonic development for this species in Bermuda and may likely contribute to the observed low hatching rates. These collective findings indicate that the Bermudian population is very vulnerable to local extirpation...|$|R

50|$|Being {{a highly}} {{specialized}} crustacean feeder, the <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> {{has no real}} competition for food. The adults have virtually no predators, but the nests are vulnerable to other animals. Both the eggs and the young are an appealing meal to American crows and some mammals such as raccoons. Crows are also known to harass adult <b>yellow-crowned</b> <b>night</b> <b>heron</b> out of their nest, or displace the eggs {{in order to use}} the nest themselves. The importance of the impact of such predation varies geographically, Virginia being the state where it matters the most.|$|E
