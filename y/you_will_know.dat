2500|$|The {{album was}} {{primarily}} recorded at recording studios MSR Studios NYC, Cake Studio, British Grove Studios and the Sotogrande Studios in New York, London and Spain, respectively {{over the course}} of three weeks, although sessions took place throughout 2009 and 2011, although Duffy had been recording songs she had written using her computer and iPod since the release of Rockferry, some of which remained in demo form until the final stages of the recording process. Duffy had formed a songwriting partnership with Albert Hammond for the record, which resulted in nine of the ten final songs released being written, composed and produced by Duffy and Hammond together. Aside from her partnership with Hammond, Duffy also forged collaborative efforts with other musicians who she felt reflected the sound change she was aiming for, including hip hop group The Roots. Duffy {{said in an interview that}} their involvement would be limited to [...] "a rhythm section" [...] going on to say [...] "if you know The Roots <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> just how cool [...] is. I love them and they are so cool." [...] She was also heavily involved with the recording process. The Daily Telegraph reports that often Duffy was a perfectionist regarding her songs, and that she often stayed in the studio with her mix engineer to ensure the composition sounded exactly as she wanted. This was often done without the help of Hammond, and she was quoted [...] "this is all I care about. I keep a tight rein when it comes to quality control." [...] Billboard reported in November later that year that Duffy had experimented with a new dance sound, confirming that neither Bernard Butler nor Steve Booker, who produced the bulk of Duffy's debut album, Rockferry, had returned for the record.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} line-up, {{formed in}} May 1999, consisted of Adam Easterbrook, Karl Sabino, Ian Johnsen and Mark Nicholas. They played their first gig in October supporting Guided By Voices at the Bristol Flee & Firkin. Debut single [...] "A Dull Today is Darker Yesterday's Bright Tomorrow" [...] {{was released in}} June 2000 on {{what appeared to be}} a one-sided 7" [...] single, although the silent b-side, included as a bonus track on their first CD album, was later revealed to be a 'cover' of Crass's [...] "The Sound of Free Speech". Another early gig was in New York City [...] followed by shows supporting bands such as Beachwood Sparks, And <b>You</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Know</b> Us By The Trail Of Dead, Cheap Trick and further dates with Guided By Voices. In November 2001 the band released the single [...] "Gadfly Adolescence", which was described by NME as 'a magnificent debut from these shamelessly prog-tinged guitar alchemists, running the gamut of classic English teen anthems from [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] to [...] "All The Young Dudes" [...] to [...] "Eton Rifles" [...] and beyond...a heady mix of ragged riffs, symphonic song structures and heart-tugging lyrics about lazy childhood summers spent [...] "deep in the gloaming".' This song was re-recorded for the group's debut album The Spring Heel Penny Dreadful & Other Tales of Morbid Curiosity, released in May 2003 by the indie label Must Destroy who were at the time finding success with one of their other signings, The Darkness. Opening song [...] "I Are Becoming Instinct" [...] was also released as a single. The album's sequencing was influenced by Guided By Voices' Bee Thousand, The Beatles' The White Album and Faust's The Faust Tapes and was championed by Julian Cope ('The best and most disconcerting psychedelia I’ve heard these past coupla years ... managed to heft several vats of raw Faust in the direction of post-Oasis Beatlemania'), and DJ John Peel who invited them to record a session for his Radio One show. The album also garnered positive reviews in Mojo ('Crunchy, punchy, proggy - and very English ... how lovely to see rock still has a decent vocabulary') ...|$|E
