5000|$|Before it was {{established}} that the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> was {{closely related to the}} American woodstork, the former was classified as belonging to the genus Ibis, together with the milky stork and painted stork. However, the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> has actually long been recognised as a true stork [...] and along with the other 3 related stork species, it should not strictly be called an ibis.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{is spread}} over 2 km2. It {{is home to}} flamingos, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>storks,</b> ospreys, grey herons, great cormorants, kingfishers, baya weavers, garganeys, among others. It is often visited by bird watchers.|$|R
50|$|The dam and its {{surrounds}} support over 350 {{bird species}} which includes rarities such as African broadbill, saddle-billed and <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>storks,</b> African finfoot, Pel's fishing owl and Narina trogon. The dam also supports a breeding colony of pink-backed and great white pelicans. Additionally the dam supports a stable population of Nile crocodiles.|$|R
50|$|Fledglings {{have also}} been {{observed}} to not differ considerably in their foraging and feeding strategies from adults. In one investigation, four adult, hand-reared <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>storks</b> kept in captivity showed typical grope-feeding and foot stirring shortly after they were introduced to bodies of water. Hence, this suggests that such feeding techniques in this species are innate.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} birds present {{and some of}} the larger ones are the cattle egret, black stork and <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork.</b> Some of its species are endemic to the country, and many are of high {{conservation}} concern.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> {{is closely}} related to 3 other species in the Mycteria genus: the American woodstork (Mycteria americana), the milky stork (Mycteria cinerea) and the painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala). It is {{classified}} as belonging to one clade with these 3 other species [...] because they all display remarkable homologies in behavior and morphology. In one analytical study of feeding and courtship behaviours of the wood-stork family, MP Kahl attributed the same general ethology to all members of the Mycteria genus, with few species-specific variations. These four species are collectively referred to as the wood-storks, which {{should not be confused with}} one alternative common name (wood-stork) for the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>Yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> (Mycteria ibis), {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the wood stork or wood ibis, is a large African wading stork species in the family Ciconiidae. It is widespread in regions south of the Sahara and also occurs in Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|Serengeti National Park {{has also}} great ornithological interest, boasting about 500 bird species, {{including}} Masai ostrich, secretarybird, kori bustards, helmeted guineafowls, southern ground hornbill, crowned cranes, marabou storks, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> lesser flamingo, martial eagles, lovebirds, oxpeckers, and {{many species of}} vultures.|$|E
50|$|Within {{its range}} the white stork is {{distinctive}} when {{seen on the}} ground. The winter range of C. c. asiatica overlaps that of the Asian openbill, which has similar plumage but a different bill shape. When seen at a distance in flight, the white stork can be confused with several other species with similar underwing patterns, such as the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> great white pelican and Egyptian vulture. The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> is identified by its black tail and a longer, slightly curved, yellow beak. The white stork also tends to be larger than the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork.</b> The great white pelican has short legs which do not extend beyond its tail, and it flies with its neck retracted, keeping its head near to its stocky body, giving it a different flight profile. Pelicans also behave differently, soaring in orderly, synchronised flocks rather than in disorganised groups of individuals as the white stork does. The Egyptian vulture is much smaller, with a long wedge-shaped tail, shorter legs and a small yellow-tinged head on a short neck. The common crane, which can also look black and white in strong light, shows longer legs and a longer neck in flight.|$|E
50|$|The birdlife here is {{varied with}} many records of blue flycatcher, blue-spotted wood dove, harrier hawk, bat hawk, baglafecht weaver, tawny eagle, purple grenadier, sunbird, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> hadada ibis, African citril, cape turtle dove, paradise flycatcher, yellow white eye, white-browed robin chat, black-headed gonolek, black kite among others.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} to follow moving crocodiles or hippopotami through the water and feed behind them, appearing {{to take advantage of}} organisms churned up by their quarry. Feeding lasts for only a short time before the bird obtains its requirements and proceeds to rest again.|$|E

50|$|The lake is alkaline, feeding {{blue-green algae}} {{which in turn}} feed flamingoes. At {{times the number of}} flamingoes feeding in the lake may be as high as two million.Raptors such as tawny eagles prey on the flamingoes.In total, 135 species of bird have been recorded. They include little grebe, pratincole, swift, little bee-eater, cape wigeon, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> African spoonbill, augur buzzard, gabar goshawk, water dikkop, great tit, starling, {{hornbill}} and crombec.|$|E
50|$|More than 500 {{species of}} birds live in the Gambia. The Bijilo Forest Park and the Abuko are {{important}} bird habitats. Faunal species seen here are the pelicans, spoonbills, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> (Mycteria ibis), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), mouse-brown sunbird (Anthreptes gabonicus), African fish eagle (Hieraaetus spilogaster) (in the river valleys). Wetland bird species are Dendrocygna viduata, sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), crakes, greater painted snipe (Rostratula benghalensis) and African jacana (Actophilornis africanus).|$|E
50|$|The {{milky stork}} was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} Ibis genus, with the binomial name Ibis cinereus, but is now categorised as belonging to Mycteria due to large similarities in appearance and behaviour to the three other storks in this genus (the wood stork, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> and painted stork). Phylogenetic studies based on DNA hybridization and cytochrome oxidase b have demonstrated that the milky stork shares a clade with other Mycteria, and forms a sister pair of species with the painted stork.|$|E
5000|$|As well {{as being}} {{abundant}} and widespread, the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> also appears tolerant of short-term natural habitat changes. However, in East Africa, it {{is known to be}} at risk from poaching and habitat reduction despite abundance and population stability [...] and is listed under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA). Nevertheless, the overall population is not currently considered to be threatened with serious decline, especially since breeding success is relatively high. In East Africa where it is most abundant, broods of 1-3 per nest have been recorded.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the snap-bill reflex, the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> also uses a systematic foot stirring technique to sound out evasive prey. It prods and churns up {{the bottom of the}} water as part of a “herding mechanism” [...] to force prey out of the bottom vegetation and into the bird’s bill. The bird does this several times with one foot before bringing it forwards and repeating with the other foot. Although they are normally active predators, they have also been observed to scavenge fish regurgitated by cormorants.|$|E
5000|$|... 263 {{bird species}} have been {{identified}} including waterfowl attracted to the area by the plains, a few examples include tawny eagle, kori bustard, red-billed oxpecker, black stork, black-winged pratincole, white-backed vulture, Cape vulture, marabou stork, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> martial eagle, secretarybird, bateleur, lappet-faced vulture, golden-breasted bunting, yellow-fronted canary, bushveld pipit, Cape longclaw, long-tailed paradise-whydah, violet-eared waxbill, African quailfinch, lesser masked-weaver, red-billed buffalo-weaver, capped wheatear, fiscal flycatcher, Chestnut-backed sparrow-lark, rufous-naped lark, arrow-marked babbler and orange-breasted bush-shrike. In the centre of D'nyala, is a VIP mansion, and a conference centre that is of historical significance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> {{may also}} begin nesting and {{breeding}} {{at the end}} of long rains. This occurs especially on flat extensive marshlands as water levels gradually decrease and concentrate fish sufficiently for the storks to feed on. However, unseasonal rainfall has also been reported to induce off-season breeding in northern Botswana and western and eastern Kenya. Rainfall may cause local flooding and hence ideal feeding conditions. This stork appears to breed simply when rainfall and local flooding are optimal and hence seems to be flexible in its temporal breeding pattern, which varies with rainfall pattern throughout the African continent.|$|E
50|$|Three shallow {{alkaline}} {{lakes and}} the surrounding lands make up the Kenya Lake system: Lake Bogoria at 10700 ha, Lake Nakuru at 18800 ha and Lake Elementaita at 2534 ha. This system {{has one of the}} most diverse populations of birds in the world, and is the home of thirteen globally threatened species of bird. It is an important nesting and breeding site for great white pelicans, and is the most important feeding area for lesser flamingos in the world. The system is home to globally important populations of black-necked grebe, African spoonbill, pied avocet, little grebe, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork,</b> black-winged stilt, grey-headed gull and gull-billed tern.|$|E
5000|$|This species {{appears to}} rely mainly on {{sense of touch}} to detect and capture prey, rather than by vision. They feed patiently by walking through the water with {{partially}} open bills and probe the water for prey. Contact of the bill with a prey item {{is followed by a}} rapid snap-bill reflex, whereby the bird snaps shut its mandibles, raises its head and swallows the prey whole. The speed of this reflex in the closely related American woodstork (Mycteria americana) has been recorded as 25 milliseconds [...] and although the corresponding reflex in the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> has not been quantitatively measured, the yellow-billed stork’s feeding mechanism appears to be at least qualitatively identical to that of the American woodstork.|$|E
5000|$|These birds breed colonially, often {{alongside}} other species; but the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> {{is sometimes}} the only occupant species of a nesting site. A subset {{of up to}} 20 individuals may nest close together in any {{one part of a}} colony; with several males occupying potential nest sites all in the same place. If many of these males do not acquire mates, the whole group moves on with the unpaired females to another tree. These “bachelor parties” [...] are a noticeable feature of colonies of this species and usually consist of 12 or more males and at least as many females. As many as 50 nests have been counted all at once in a single breeding area.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna of the CRA forests {{includes}} lesser woolly bat (Kerivoula lanosa), Veldkamp's bat (Nanonycteris veldkampii), {{grey parrot}} (Psittacus erithacus), African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), agile mangabey (Cercocebus agilis), grey-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes subcylindricus), shoebill (Balaeniceps rex), yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus), Dzanga robin (Stiphrornis sanghensis), Hartlaub's duck (Pteronetta hartlaubii), ostrich (struthio camelus), little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), pelican, cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), shoebill (balaeniceps rex), hamerkop (scopus umbretta), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> (Mycteria ibis) and raptors and water birds. In the Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park alone 379 {{species of birds}} have been sighted, which {{can be seen from}} observation platforms built in the park or by taking a boat ride on the Sangha River or its tributary, the Mossapoula River.|$|E
50|$|It {{does not}} {{generally}} migrate far, {{at least not}} out of its breeding range; but usually makes short migratory movements which are influenced by rainfall. It makes local movements in Kenya and has also been found to migrate from North to South Sudan with the rainy season. It may also migrate regularly to and from South Africa. However, little is actually known about this bird’s general migratory movements. Due to apparent observed variation in migratory patterns throughout Africa, the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> has been termed a facultative nomad. It may migrate simply to avoid areas where water or rainfall conditions are too high or too low for feeding on prey. Some populations migrate considerable distances between feeding or breeding sites; usually by using thermals to soar and glide. Other local populations {{have been found to}} be sedentary and remain in their respective habitats all year round.|$|E
50|$|The {{mangroves}} are {{an important}} habitat {{for a variety of}} wildlife from fish crustaceans and molluscs in the waters to snakes and monkeys such as Sykes' monkey in the trees and animals including antelopes, elephants and African buffalo who come to graze on the fringes of the swamps. Larger animals that feed in the swamp waters include hippopotamus, green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) turtles, porpoises and important populations of the endangered dugong. Located alongside coral reefs, these mangroves are sheltered by the coral from ocean tides and storms, and the swamps provide food for the many fish, shrimps and other marine fauna that shelter in the coral. The swamps are also important feeding grounds for large numbers of migratory birds such as curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea), little stint (Calidris minuta) and Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia), waterbirds such as crab-plover (Dromas ardeola), <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> and malachite kingfisher, and seabirds such as roseate tern (Sterna dougallii).|$|E
5000|$|As {{with all}} stork species, male yellow-billed storks select and occupy {{potential}} nest sites in trees, whereupon females attempt {{to approach the}} males. The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>stork</b> has an extensive repertoire of courtship behaviours near and at the nest {{that may lead to}} pair formation and copulation. Generally, these courtship behaviours are also assumed to be common to all Mycteria species and show remarkable homology within the Mycteria genus. After the male has initially established at the nesting-site and the female begins to approach, he displays behaviours that advertise himself to the her. One of these is the Display Preening, whereby the male pretends to strip down each of his extended wings with the bill several times each side [...] and the bill does not effectively close around the feathers. Another observed display among males is the Swaying-Twig Grasping. Here, the male stands on the potential nesting-site and bends over to gently grasp and release underlying twigs at regular intervals. This is sometimes accompanied by side-to-side oscillations of the neck and head and he continues to pick at twigs in between such movements.|$|E
40|$|MSc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 A {{selection}} of southern African bird species were modelled {{in terms of}} the probability of these species colliding with or being electrocuted on overhead power lines in South Africa, based on morphological and behavioral factors. Species were included in the model on the basis of internationally recognized vulnerability to these interactions at the family level. The collision model performed poorly when tested against the actual reported mortalities for species contained in the Eskom-EWT Strategic Partnership Central Incident Register CIR) (chi-square of goodness of fit) at the individual species, family and within family levels. The electrocution model performed slightly better at the family, and within family level. Both collision and electrocution models performed better for the physically larger species (and families) and for those species with higher modelled probability of collision or electrocution. As the product of random carcass detection and reporting, the CIR data are biased in various ways. Testing the models against the CIR is therefore equally important for highlighting inadequacies in the CIR, as in the model. A number of new species have emerged as being of high collision (including most importantly African Pygmy Goose, Southern Ground Hornbill, Black-bellied Bustard, Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, Caspian Tern, Hooded Vulture, Bateleur, African Marsh Harrier, Black Harrier, Pink-backed Pelican and <b>Yellow-billed</b> <b>Stork)</b> or electrocution (Southern Bald Ibis) probability in theoretical terms, and will require further investigation to determine their actual probability of interaction. By mapping the combined distributions of those species with high probabilities of collision and/or electrocution mortality, a number of priority high risk geographic areas emerge around the country...|$|E
