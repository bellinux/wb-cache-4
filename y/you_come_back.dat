500|$|In an October 2010 interview, Ono {{spoke about}} Lennon's [...] "lost weekend" [...] and her {{subsequent}} reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save {{her marriage to}} John. [...] "I {{want the world to}} know that it was a very touching thing that [...] did for John." [...] While visiting with Ono in March 1974, McCartney, on leaving, asked [...] "hat will make <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to John?" [...] McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles. [...] "John often said he didn't understand why Paul did this for us, but he did." [...] In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon's post-Beatles work.|$|E
500|$|When Reba McEntire {{made her}} Grand Ole Opry debut on September 17, 1977, she almost {{did not make}} it in the door after a guard at the Opry gate missed her name on the night's list of performers. Her parents and older sister, Alice, drove 1,400 miles round trip from their Oklahoma home to see {{what turned out to be}} Reba's three-minute {{performance}} that night. Her act was cut from two songs to just one—"Invitation to the Blues"—because of a surprise appearance from Dolly Parton. McEntire was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on January 17, 1986.

500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E
500|$|Computer and Video Games {{predicted}} that the game [...] "will be the one <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to when you've got a full house", and appreciated its [...] "crazy genius" [...] gameplay. Nintendo World Report {{was pleased with the}} game's variety, but found the small number of unlockable items and lack of high scores disappointing. Although video game review website IGN noted that the game was not the best in the Wario series of video games, they still considered it an [...] "essential piece of the Wii collection". The website was also entertained by the single-player mode as well as the multiplayer, especially when [...] "shov the controller off on unsuspecting houseguests or non-gamers months and years down the road". They considered the game's use of the Wii Remote to be [...] "slick and intuitive", the graphics to be [...] "nearly inexplicable", and the sound to be [...] "totally off the wall". GameZone called the game [...] "original and addictive", but noted that it would not appeal to everyone. The Courier-Mail praised the game's use of the Wii's motion-sensitive controllers as one of its best features, which helps push it [...] "over-the-top" [...] as [...] "one of the most inventive games designed for the Wii's interactive controls". Canada's Toronto Sun also appreciated its [...] "novel use" [...] of the Wiimote.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

500|$|The Singles 1992–2003 was {{generally}} well received by music critics. Mike McGuirk of Rhapsody described the album as [...] "a real joy {{for anyone who}} has a taste for Gwen Stefani's yearning vocals and her band's uncanny ability to mix ska, teen pop and hip-hop." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the album a [...] "stellar collection", concluding that it is [...] "the kind of compilation that satisfies fans of all stripes and converts skeptics. It's the greatest-hits package that [...] deserve." [...] Anthony Thornton of NME stated, [...] "Despite being an album packed with as much drama as the band themselves have suffered, it'll be the pop anthems <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for and fortunately there's enough here to keep even the soap addicts happy." [...] Sara McDonnell of musicOMH wrote that the album's music had [...] "sheer diversity" [...] due to the band's [...] "pick 'n mix approach to musical styles". The high points were [...] "Gwen Stefani's lyrics, which deal principally with {{coming to terms with}} her own femininity" [...] and [...] "the band's collaborations with various hip producers", such as The Neptunes, Nellee Hooper and Sly and Robbie; and the low points were the album's [...] "hotch-potch feel", [...] "random tracklisting" [...] and the [...] "forays into reggae". Ruth Mitchell of the BBC Music viewed the album as a typical Christmas album that was [...] "unlikely to stand out from the crowd" [...] and [...] "too long, [...] tiresome about half way through", although complimenting [...] "Just a Girl", [...] "Hey Baby" [...] and [...] "Underneath It All". However, she also expressed disappointment at the placement of [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "the foursome's most glorious pop moment", {{at the end of the}} album. The Rolling Stone Album Guide later gave the album four stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12.

You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} themes {{found in this}} book; some that are {{recurring}} are roles in society, religion, relationships, and also hybrid nature of American and Mexican ethnicities. Within these short stories Cisneros concentrates on the identities which women appropriate {{as a result of}} relationships, and how these are connected with their roles in society. [...] Critic Mary Reichart observes that in Cisneros's previous work as well as [...] "in Woman Hollering Creek (1991), the female characters break out of the molds assigned to them by the culture in search of new roles and new kinds of relationships. Cisneros portrays women who challenge stereotypes and break taboos, sometimes simply for the sake of shocking the establishment, but most often because the confining stereotypes prevent them from achieving their own identity." [...] An example of this is Cleófilas, who had hoped for a better life after leaving her home in Mexico to live in the United States. [...] The soap operas she had seen had led her to believe that her life {{was going to be a}} fairy tale. [...] Instead, with a failing marriage and another child on the way she sees that her life resembles only the saddest aspects of a soap opera. [...] Another example of this is found in the final section of this book, entitled [...] "There Was A Man, There Was A Woman", where Cisneros illustrates how women can use their bodies as political instruments in their attempts to fight against male domination. [...] The two female protagonists in [...] "Never Marry a Mexican" [...] and [...] "Eyes of Zapata" [...] use their bodies in attempts to gain recognition and acceptance from husband and lover. [...] However, in doing so, they face the problems of objectification and oppression; two issues which end up adversely shaping the characters' identities. [...] In the end, the illegitimate societal roles of these women influence their quest for female identity. For example, Inés, in [...] "Eyes of Zapata", talks about the role she plays as lover, not a wife: [...] "You married her, that woman from Villa de Ayala, true. But see, you came back to me. You always come back. In between and beyond the others. That's my magic. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to me." ...|$|E
