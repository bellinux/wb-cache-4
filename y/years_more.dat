5|$|In 1804, Ordener {{organized}} {{and led the}} controversial kidnapping of the Duke d'Enghien. In 1805, he commanded a regiment of the Imperial Guard cavalry at several important battles, including the Battle of Austerlitz; although he led an energetic and opportune charge, Napoleon noted that Ordener seemed tired and predicted that the general would last only five or six <b>years</b> <b>more.</b> Ordener participated in one more campaign and then accepted a post in the Senate. Napoleon appointed him as Josephine Bonaparte's equerry, supervising the care and maintenance of her horses. He followed this with the post as governor of the Emperor's household in Compiegne, where Ordener died on 30 August 1811.|$|E

Six of these were built, and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six towers, one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888. The other four towers survive to this day.|$|E

Many of these vessels were purpose-built for the company's needs, and were constructed at shipyards both within Australia and abroad. The company's eventual demise came {{as a result of a}} number of factors, including increased competition from road and rail, the cost of replacing ships after World War II, waterfront disputes and rising costs. As a consequence, after almost 100 years in operation, the company was placed into voluntary receivership and was delisted from the stock exchange in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several <b>years,</b> <b>more</b> consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
5|$|Jarrow {{had been}} a {{settlement}} {{since at least the}} 8th century. In the early 19th century, a coal industry developed before the establishment of the shipyard in 1851. Over the following 80 <b>years</b> <b>more</b> than 1,000 ships were launched in Jarrow. In the 1920s, a combination of mismanagement and changed world trade conditions following World War I brought a decline which led eventually to the yard's closure. Plans for its replacement by a modern steelworks plant were frustrated by opposition from the British Iron and Steel Federation, an employers' organisation with its own plans for the industry. The failure of the steelworks plan, and the lack of any prospect of large-scale employment in the town, were the final factors that led to the decision to march.|$|E

5|$|On July 22, 1847, {{the first}} party of Mormon pioneers {{arrived in the}} Salt Lake Valley, where they founded Salt Lake City, the first European {{settlement}} in Utah. Over the next 22 <b>years,</b> <b>more</b> than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah. Initial colonization along the Wasatch Front was mostly made by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with no direct involvement from it. Outside the Wasatch Front, most settlements were directed, planned, organized, and dispatched by leaders of the LDS Church. Settlements were also founded by the railroads, mining companies and non-Mormons. Many settlements were named after leaders, history or from scriptures of the LDS Church. Natural features of the region, including rivers, mountains, lakes and flora, are also commonly used for names.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wooden {{church building}} was moved again in 1909 and extended in 1928 {{for use as}} a community hall. It had a kitchen extension added in 1955 and a kindergarten room in 1958. The split paling cladding was replaced with weatherboards in the 1900s. The roof was replaced with iron, probably in 1914 when the brick church was also re-roofed in iron. The interior paling lining of the old wooden church was covered with pine sheeting in the late 1930s. This building {{has been used as a}} church for seven <b>years,</b> <b>more</b> than sixty years as a meeting room and community centre and more than seventy years as a day and Sunday school. After the school moved to a new building in 1929 the old building remained in use as a Sunday school.|$|E
5|$|The solar arrays {{themselves}} were launched and installed {{over a period}} of eleven <b>years,</b> <b>more</b> slowly than originally planned, with the station continually suffering from a shortage of power as a result. The first two arrays, each 38m2 (409ft2) in area, were launched on the core module, and together provided a total of 9kW of power. A third, dorsal panel was launched on Kvant-1 and mounted on the core module in 1987, providing a further 2kW from a 22m2 (237ft2) area. Kvant-2, launched in 1989, provided two 10m (32.8ft) long panels which supplied 3.5kW each, whilst Kristall was launched with two collapsible, 15m (49.2ft) long arrays (providing 4kW each) which were intended to be moved to Kvant-1 and installed on mounts which were attached during a spacewalk by the EO-8 crew in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Wells {{had survived}} {{the death of his}} first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him without a clear heir. His estate was further {{complicated}} by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under New York law at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide and sell the property, and within a few <b>years</b> <b>more</b> buildings had gone up, {{just in time for the}} construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence.|$|E
5|$|When Korea {{was split}} into two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides. The communist country of North Korea was supported by Russia, China and others, while the democratic South was supported by the United Nations and the United States. In 1950 the United States got involved and over the next three <b>years</b> <b>more</b> than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented and although more than 150,000 Jewish American men and women were serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 <b>years.</b> <b>More</b> frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E
