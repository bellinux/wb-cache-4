500|$|Despite such reviews, Hollywood proved {{reluctant}} to create starring roles for Wong; her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from seeing {{her as a}} leading lady. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the Museum of the Moving Image, notes, [...] "She built up a level of stardom in Hollywood, but Hollywood didn't {{know what to do}} with her." [...] She spent the next few years in supporting roles providing [...] "exotic atmosphere", for instance playing a concubine in Tod Browning's Drifting (1923). Film producers capitalized on Wong's growing fame but they relegated her to supporting roles. Still optimistic about a film career, in 1923 Wong said: [...] "Pictures are fine and I'm getting along all right, but it's not so bad to have the laundry back of you, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>wait</b> and take good parts and be independent when you're climbing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>wait</b> 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way... I was amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can get on it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's heard me talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E

2500|$|Prescott {{stated that}} on Two Eleven, Norwood's vocals {{return to a}} multi-layered style like those present on {{previous}} songs [...] "Angel in Disguise", [...] "Full Moon" [...] and [...] "Afrodisiac". These are present on another ballad on Two Eleven called [...] "Without You", which was originally crafted for singer Alicia Keys. Initially tipped by Norwood as an early contender for {{the second or third}} single, Billboards Andrew Hamp said [...] "Without You" [...] showcases Norwood's [...] "strong vocals" [...] with a [...] "confident" [...] attitude. It drew comparisons to [...] "Enough of No Love" [...] by Keyshia Cole, both Cole's song and Norwood's song were produced by Harmony Samuels. Touching on similar subject, [...] "No Such Thing As too Late" [...] sees Norwood talking about the emotions of a new relationship. Lyrics include the line [...] "When you really love somebody / <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>wait</b> / 'cause there's no such thing as too late." [...] This goes hand-in-hand with another song [...] "Hardly Breathing", where Norwood speaks of the anguish of having her partner leave. Both of the songs were written and produced by Jim Jonsin and Rico Love.|$|E

2500|$|The cast had all {{assumed that}} Last Tango in Halifax would only run for one series. Filming {{of the second}} series clashed with filming of the second series of the BBC One period drama The Paradise, which also starred Sarah Lancashire. This necessitated her having to leave her role in The Paradise halfway through the second series in order to reprise her role as Caroline in Last Tango in Halifax. In an {{interview}} in 2013 Lancashire stated {{that the decision to}} return to Last Tango in Halifax was the easiest she had made in her working life stating [...] "as an actor <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>wait</b> an entire career to be involved in a project like this." [...] In 2014 Wainwright recalled being [...] "blown away" [...] by Lancashire's performances in the rushes for the series, which partly inspired her to script the series Happy Valley in which Lancashire plays the lead role. In December 2014, ahead of the third series, Lancashire stated that she would continue for the series {{for as long as it}} runs stating that she found the series [...] "beautifully written" [...] and that she'd [...] "turn up to read two lines a day just to be part of this piece".|$|E
2500|$|Lancashire discerned {{that the}} series was [...] "very special" [...] within reading two pages of the script. Other factors that persuaded her to commit to the series {{included}} the casting of Reid and Jacobi, and the series' juxtaposition of a heart-warming story with elements of humour. In terms of her character, Lancashire identified with Caroline being [...] "a working woman trying to keep everything under control". She stated the series' ensemble cast was [...] "the closest I’ve come to being in a theatre company on television" [...] due to how well the actors worked together.

[...] The role resulted in her receiving the most fan mail of her career. Lancashire was surprised and humbled by the responses from women stating that Caroline's same sex relationship had personally inspired them. She stated that in her approach to the character she did not focus on Caroline's sexuality, but the [...] "humanity of her". Due to the underrepresentation of gay characters on television, Lancashire felt it particularly important that Caroline's experience would not be portrayed inaccurately.
