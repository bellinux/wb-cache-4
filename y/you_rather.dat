Hunt also produced Marnie's album, Crystal World. In 2014, he started in São Paulo, Brasil the band Tamoios with singer Luisa Maita, and Fernando Rischbieter.|$|E
500|$|On April 17, 2006, {{he said on}} {{the topic}} of Muslims, [...] "They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100million of them, then there'll be 900million of them.' I mean, would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> die—would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> us die than them?" [...] This was taken from an {{argument}} dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.|$|E
500|$|... "Sounding," [...] said Classic Rock, [...] "like it was {{recorded}} in a studio where the amps were set to FUCK <b>YOU</b> <b>rather</b> than 11 and armed with a dual attack of heavy and heaviest, Slayer's 10th studio album [...] offers a remarkable clarity of vision and strength of identity." ...|$|E

Bertrand Russell, T.H. Huxley, and Benedetto Croce, who wrote for the Britannica? Or ... EssJay?" ...|$|E
500|$|Following the 2005–06 {{television}} season, PTC {{issued a}} report Faith in a Box that analyzed depictions of religion in primetime television. The study stated that most positive references to religion were on reality shows such as , while claiming that scripted shows {{tended to be more}} negative towards it. The report also ranked Fox as the [...] "most anti-religious network", followed by NBC, UPN, ABC, CBS, and the WB. In 2008, PTC published a report titled Happily Never After, using analysis of several primetime shows early in the 2007-2008 television season to assert that extramarital sex is favored on television shows. Ian O'Doherty of The Irish Independent asked regarding the PTC's marriage depiction study: [...] "After all, would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> watch people having fun or would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> watch a realistic depiction of marriage, which...would simply be an hour of two people sullenly chewing their food, pausing occasionally only to throw each other filthies and occasionally grumbling under their breath how the biggest regret of their life was ever setting eyes on you and that their mother was right all along?" [...] PTC released a report in October 2009 stating that prime-time television shows on broadcast networks had twice as many depictions of violence against women in 2009 than in 2004.|$|E
500|$|The {{final act}} of the K Foundation was distributing a van load of Tennent's Super - a high-alcohol-content lager - to London's street {{drinkers}} on Christmas Day 1995. [...] However, the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near Waterloo station on the South Bank — was unusually devoid of homeless people, {{many of whom were}} in homeless shelters for the day. [...] "That was a pity", said Jimmy Cauty. [...] "If you are down-and-out, would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> have a bowl of soup or a can of Tennent's?" [...] The Sunday Times later called the scheme [...] "ethically dubious".|$|E

500|$|In the episode's DVD commentary, MacFarlane {{addressed}} what viewers {{perceived to}} be a rather abrupt ending to the episode. As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back, Lois walks through the front door, returning from the hospital, and has brought the kids home with her. MacFarlane stated, [...] "Some of the fans actually noticed, commented {{on the fact that}} this was a very abrupt resolution, but, to that I would say, you're not watching [...] wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> we throw in more jokes and fill up the time, and then hustle to the finish line at the last minute?".|$|E
500|$|... "Let's Get It On" [...] {{features}} soulful, passionate lead vocals and multi-tracked background singing, both by Gaye. It has a 1950s-styled {{melody and}} begins with three wah-wah guitar notes and centers on simple chord changes, while its arrangements are centered on an eccentric rhythm pattern. Its signature guitar line {{is played by}} session musician Don Peake. Music journalist Jon Landau dubs the song [...] "a classic Motown single, endlessly repeatable and always enjoyable". The song is reprised on the fourth track, [...] "Keep Gettin' It On". It expands on the title track's sensual theme with political overtones: [...] "won't <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> make love, children / as opposed to war, like you know you should." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the first round}} in season two, each team {{had a chance to}} earn 25 additional points. Before the show, a question was asked to 100 YouVersion users (e.g. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> fast for 40 days or eat manna for 40 years?"). A question with three possible choices was then asked about the percentage of people who answered (e.g. [...] "What percentage said they would rather fast for 40 days than eat manna for 40 years?"). During the break, each team wrote their answer on a tablet computer, and each team that submitted the correct answer earned 25 points. This round was removed from the game in the third season and replaced with another opening round-style game played for ± 100 points a question.|$|E

500|$|A {{surprise}} public screening {{was held}} on April 6, 2009, at the Alamo Drafthouse theater in Austin, Texas, hosted by writers Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and producer Damon Lindelof. The showing was publicized as a screening of , followed by a ten-minute preview of the new Star Trek film. A few minutes into Khan, the film appeared to melt and Nimoy appeared on stage with Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof, asking the audience, [...] "wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> see the new movie?" [...] Following the surprise screening in Texas, {{the first of many}} premieres across the world was held at the Sydney Opera House in Sydney on April 7, 2009. For almost two years, the town of Vulcan, Alberta had campaigned to have the film premiere there, but because it had no theater, Paramount arranged instead a lottery where 300 winning residents would be taken to a prerelease screening in Calgary.|$|E
500|$|West's {{performance}} on the song is notably intense, forcefully rapping lines such as [...] "we above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all / I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall." [...] Swizz Beatz sets {{the tone of the}} song using several ad-libs such as [...] "one hand in the air, if you don't really care" [...] and the line [...] "this shit is fucking ridiculous" [...] which is repeated several times throughout the song, delivered by nearly every rapper. The second verse is delivered by Jay-Z, who spends the majority of his verse deconstructing the hate that surrounds fame and poses the question, [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> be underpaid or overrated?" [...] Jay-Z comments on how a career in the music industry creates many opponents. The third verse is delivered by Pusha T, who muses on cocaine dealing.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Spins March Hogan wrote, [...] "'Some of us {{just like}} to read', she sings, and hey, that {{includes}} us. But it's easier to clap for something that moves or touches <b>you,</b> <b>rather</b> than serves as an advertisement for Gaga as incomprehensible high-end brand." [...] Consequence of Sound wrote in their review, [...] "Gaga's head appears on a black swan and she boogies down in a clam bikini. If this doesn't bump up her sales, I no longer believe in art." [...] Hilary Hughes of Esquire said that the video [...] "hits all the marks of Gaga-esque eccentricity: glitter, boob grabs, weird animals, space, severed limbs, devotional imagery, nudity, neon, etc. It just doesn't redefine those marks, as previous music videos of Gaga's— namely [...] "Bad Romance," [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and [...] "Judas"— have". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic believed that Gaga was parodying herself with the video and suggested that her aim was [...] "to make a video both celebrating and poking fun at her career thus far." [...] However, he considered it forgettable when compared to Gaga's previous efforts.|$|E

500|$|The {{canvassing}} {{is largely}} unsuccessful. [...] Most of {{the supporters of}} the park say {{they will not be}} able to attend the meeting. [...] Mark, April and Tom speak with one seemingly interested resident, who is implied to be a pedophile. [...] Leslie becomes frustrated with the lack of success and attempts to push poll the community residents. [...] She suggests phrasing the question, [...] "Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?" [...] Tom leaves the canvassing group to call prospective contractors about the park project, hinting at accepting bribes and making corrupt deals. [...] Several residents express a lack of support for the park. [...] Resident Kate Speevak (Lennon Parham) vows to attend the public meeting and voice her disapproval after a frustrated Leslie says, [...] "You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park". [...] The canvassing ends with an angry Leslie finding Mark and April playing Rock Band with Ann's boyfriend, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) at Ann's house.|$|E
500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all. In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means." ...|$|E
500|$|The Stone Tape remains well-regarded to this day. [...] Roger Fulton, {{writing in}} The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, calls it [...] "arguably the most creepy drama {{ever seen on}} television". The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as [...] "one of the masterpieces of genre television, an {{authentic}} alliance of mind-stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics". Writer and member of The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape [...] "strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] it just has this impact on <b>you,</b> <b>rather</b> {{like being in the}} room itself. Extraordinary piece of work". [...] Writer Grant Morrison recalled The Stone Tape as [...] "really creepy and very memorable. Just brilliant images. That {{scared the hell out of}} me!". Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that [...] "The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his finest single work in the genre". Lez Cooke, in his book British Television Drama: A History, has praised the play as [...] "one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today".|$|E

500|$|Admitting {{she is not}} perfect, Beyoncé {{sings the}} lines [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> I be a machine who doesn't notice when you late or when you lyin'?" [...] and [...] "No I'm not an angel, but at least I'm trying". In [...] "No Angel", Beyoncé {{declares}} that her partner is [...] "no angel either", remarking {{that he is not}} perfect. However, despite his imperfections, the protagonist admits she still loves him. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "nderneath the pretty face is something complicated / I come with a side of trouble / But I know that's why you're staying" [...] in the song aimed to inform her [...] "roguish" [...] male lover. The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word at a time in longer intervals. A short interlude about [...] "mov things to the bedroom" [...] is interpolated in the song. Beyoncé forgoes lyrical subtlety during that part, singing explicit lines such as [...] "Tell me do you wanna ride?" [...] and [...] "First both of my legs go back on your head, and whatever you want, yeah baby, I'm bad". Fuse's Mark Sundstrom interpreted the song's message as talking about the singer's husband Jay-Z and added [...] "She loves him more because she knows him entirely, accepting he's not perfect or without a past". Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld considered its lyrical content to be about how a [...] "couple's respective internal messiness can bring them closer together".|$|E
