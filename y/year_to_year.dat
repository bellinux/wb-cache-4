5|$|Cone {{production}} varies a {{great deal}} from <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>year,</b> but, {{as a result of its}} low flowering rate, is generally very low. However, there are typically a very high number of follicles per cone, leading to relatively high seed counts. There is some seed predation, primarily from the curculionid weevil Cechides amoenus.|$|E

5|$|The Games column lists {{regular season}} totals and {{excludes}} post-season play. Although all teams {{are scheduled for}} {{the same number of}} games each season, variance in the number from <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>year</b> is possible due to games that are cancelled or postponed and not played later in the season, or due to tie-breakers played {{at the end of the}} season to determine playoff eligibility or seeding.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>year,</b> but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E
