Now I {{should find}} {{my mind to}} flee from God, as {{from the face of}} a dreadful judge; yet this was my torment, I could not escape his hand: [...] "It is a fearful thing to {{fall into the hands of}} the living God" [...] (Heb 10:31).

[...] Indeed, this would make me make a little stop, and, as it were, look over my shoulder behind me, to see if I could discern that the God of grace did follow me with a pardon in his hand, but I could no sooner do that, but all would be clouded and darkened again by that sentence, [...] "For <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> afterwards, when he would have inherited the blessing, he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears." [...] Wherefore I could not return, but fled, though at sometimes it cried, [...] "Return, return," [...] as if it did holloa after me.

The man in the tweed suit shook hands with his fair companion--probably she hardly felt the prick, not sufficiently in any case to make her utter a scream. And, mind you, the scoundrel had every facility, through his friendship with Mr. Errington, of procuring what poison he required, not to mention his friend's visiting card. We cannot gauge how many months ago he began to try and copy Frank Errington in his style of dress, the cut of his moustache, his general appearance, making the change probably so gradual, that no one in his own entourage would notice it. He selected for his model a man his own height and build, with the same coloured hair." ...|$|E

"I and {{the other}} three Lascars then took passage that evening in a craft for Rotterdam, and got to Amsterdam two days before your ship arrived; we went to {{different}} houses, and going separately into the worst parts of the town, soon found a man who kept a gambling den, and who was a man who could be trusted. I offered him a thousand francs to collect twenty-five men, who were to be paid a hundred francs each, and to be ready, if your ship arrived after dark, to attack two passengers I would point out to them. I did not want you to be hurt, so bargained that all knives were to be left behind, and that he was to supply the men only with clubs. If the ship came in in daylight you were to be attacked the first time you went out after dark. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> was carried out.

6000|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--That is a {{perfectly}} superb notice. You can easily believe that nothing ever gratified me so much before.

I {{found it}} a hard work now to pray to God, because despair was {{swallowing}} me up; I thought I was as with a tempest driven away from God; for always when I cried to God for mercy, this would come in, 'Tis too late, I am lost, God hath let me fall; not to my correction, but condemnation: my sin is unpardonable; and I know, concerning Esau, how that after he had sold his birthright, be would have received the blessing, but was rejected. About this time I did light on that dreadful story of that miserable mortal Francis Spira; a book that was to my troubled spirit, as salt, when rubbed into a fresh wound: every sentence in that book, every groan of that man, {{with all the rest}} of his actions in his dolours, as his tears, his prayers, his gnashing of teeth, his wringing of hands, his twining and twisting, and languishing, and pining away under that mighty hand of God that was upon him, were as knives and daggers in my soul; especially that sentence of his was frightful to me, Man knows the beginning of sin? but who bounds the issues thereof? Then would the former sentence, as the conclusion of all, fall like an hot thunderbolt again upon my conscience; For <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> afterwards, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.|$|E

'I was up all night last Monday night because my mare was sick, and there was never a sound out of him.
