40|$|A {{new model}} for elucidating the {{geometrical}} foundations of plasticity <b>yield</b> <b>criteria</b> is proposed. The proposed ansatz uses differential geometry and group theory concepts, {{in addition to}} elementary hypotheses based on well-established experimental evidence. Its theoretical development involves the analysis of tensor functions and provides a series expansion that allows the functional stress dependence of plasticity <b>yield</b> <b>criteria</b> to be predicted. The theoretical framework for the model includes a series of spatial coefficients that provide a more flexible theory for in-depth examination of symmetry and anisotropy in compact solid materials. It describes the classical <b>yield</b> <b>criteria</b> (such as those of Tresca, Von Mises, Hosford, Hill, etc.) and accurately describes the anomalous behaviour of metals, such as aluminium, which was elucidated by Hill (Theoretical plasticity of textured aggregates.

Further, absolutely new instances of stress dependence are predicted; this makes it highly useful for fitting experimental data {{with a view to}} studying the phenomena behind plasticity. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on the atomistic studies {{presented}} in Part I we develop analytical <b>yield</b> <b>criteria</b> for single crystals that capture {{the effect of}} shear stresses other than the Schmid stress (non-glide stresses) on the shear stress needed for dislocation glide (Peierls stress).

Employing these criteria we identify the operative slip systems for tensile/compressive loading along various axes within the standard stereographic triangle and determine the ensuing tension-compression asymmetry. This result is in an excellent qualitative agreement with available experimental data. Moreover, using the constructed <b>yield</b> <b>criteria</b> within the Taylor homogenization procedure, we demonstrate that effects associated with non-planar cores of screw dislocations persist in random polycrystals.
