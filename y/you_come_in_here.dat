2500|$|Jazz {{historian}} and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum's [...] "left hand was {{the equal of}} his right." [...] When Bud Powell was opening for Tatum at Birdland around 1950, {{the end of an}} era when musicians engaged in overt competition and so-called cutting sessions, Powell reportedly said to Tatum, [...] "Man, I'm going to really show you about tempo and playing fast. [...] Anytime you're ready." [...] Tatum laughed and replied, [...] "Look, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> tomorrow, and anything you do with your right hand, I'll do with my left." [...] Powell never took up the challenge. Of note was Tatum's double-time stride playing, where his left hand alternated between playing bass notes (or tenth intervals) and mid-range chords at high speed, a device he used in showcase recordings like [...] "I Wish I Were Twins", [...] "The Shout", and [...] "Elegy".|$|E
2500|$|Along with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, she {{released}} Trio (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one [...] on Billboard's Country Albums chart, and also {{reached the top}} 10 on Billboard's Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including Phil Spector's [...] "To Know Him Is to Love Him," [...] which went to number one. Trio won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After a further attempt at pop success with Rainbow, (1987) including the single [...] "The River Unbroken," [...] Parton focused on recording country material. White Limozeen (1989) produced two number one [...] hits in [...] "Why'd <b>You</b> <b>Come</b> <b>in</b> <b>Here</b> Lookin' Like That" [...] and [...] "Yellow Roses." [...] Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came on in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the chart.|$|E
