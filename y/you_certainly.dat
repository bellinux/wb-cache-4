500|$|Upon release, {{the soundtrack}} of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{emerged as a}} major success by selling 2.5 million units within 30 days. Additionally, it became the largest selling {{album of the year}} in India. Writing for Rediff, Sukanya Varma praised most of the compositions, while being {{critical}} of the song [...] "Say Shava Shava" [...] due to the [...] "overdose of Punjabi emotions". She summed up by saying, [...] "The music of K3G has a presence. Hate it or love it, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> won't ignore it." [...] Planet Bollywood gave it 8 of 10 stars, calling [...] "Suraj Hua Maddham" [...] by Sonu Nigam the best song, and the best reason to buy the album.|$|E
500|$|Air Force {{running back}} Leotis Palmer {{was having the}} best season of his career heading into the San Francisco Bowl. During the regular season, he {{accumulated}} 537rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns and 113passing yards for two touchdowns. Palmer and the Falcons had already clinched the season's rushing title, cementing their status as the No.1 rushing team in the country after West Virginia—the second-place team—failed to gain sufficient yardage in its final game to pass the Falcons. Despite finishing with the top-ranked rushing offense, none of Air Force's offensive linemen received postseason honors. [...] "It should give our players a lot of incentive for next year. Hopefully, if we repeat next year, maybe we'll get two or three on there. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> don't accumulate the number of yards we do unless you have people up front doing their job," [...] DeBerry said at the time.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E
