500|$|Alice was {{too much}} puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again. [...] "They've a temper, some of them—particularly verbs, they're the proudest—adjectives <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> with, but not verbs—however, I can manage the whole lot!

500|$|Four filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Do-Over" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him how {{he will be able to}} get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his employee ID card. Jack tells her <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> if you walk with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows. In the third scene, Liz and Bev talk to NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to-door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the [...] "do over".|$|E
500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which {{also contributed to the}} decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, well, yes. <b>You</b> artists <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything,</b> and it's all right. You {{must come}} over {{immediately}} afterwards {{and tell me}} all about it, won't you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Strait {{released}} a self-named album in 2000, which despite a No.1 and No.7 showing {{on the country}} and Billboard 200 album charts, produced no No.1 singles, {{and was the first}} studio album of his career to not be certified platinum. The singles [...] "Go On" [...] and [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Anything</b> Else" [...] were released from the record, with both peaking in the top five. In May 2001, The Road Less Traveled was released. Reviews for the album were mostly positive, Rolling Stone described it as sticking to the formula [...] "but adds a few twists that make it superior to his last few releases." [...] It featured [...] "vocal processing", and was considered by some critics as an experimental album.|$|E
2500|$|According to The War for Late Night, [...] "the 'People of Earth' letter—the manifesto, as NBC {{came to call}} it—changed the tone. This wasn't just Conan saying no; it was Conan saying no, and you're wrong, and, by the way, go fuck yourselves." [...] However, {{the moment}} that [...] "represented {{the point of no}} return" [...] came that Wednesday night, as a [...] "clearly liberated" [...] O'Brien made this joke in his monologue: [...] "I'm trying very hard to stay {{positive}} here, and I want to tell you something. This is honest. Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> you want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too." [...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?" [...] Conversations changed as to how much O'Brien would take to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.|$|E
2500|$|... "This begs many questions. First, {{is there}} such a thing as 'the {{international}} community'? Do people in China, which accounts for a fifth of the world's population, and the Buddhists, who account for another fifth—among others—really want the U.S. and its client states to bomb the Serbs or Iraqis? And who exactly, and when, deputed the U.S. to act on behalf of this 'world community'? ... Secondly, can the blunt weapon of force, of whose use U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright boasted, balance conflicting and competing ethnic, religious, economic and political interactions over this wide and conflictive region? Can the U.S. raise the expectations of the Albanians and Slav Moslems without affronting Macedonians, Greeks, Italians, Bulgars and Croats, as well as Serbs? ... Thirdly, can force be a substitute for policy? It was a wise German who said that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> with bayonets except sit on them. The same goes for gunships, the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy. Bomb and rocket once, and it has an effect. But if the victim survives, the second bout is less effective, because the victim is learning to cope." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "You know… {{leadership}} is a confidence trick. You have to persuade men that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> absolutely <b>anything,</b> otherwise they lose confidence in you {{and instead of}} following eagerly into the jaws of death they begin wondering whether perhaps they {{should go to the}} lavatory instead." ...|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--In 1856 {{you gave}} me {{authority}} to draw on you for any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars. I see clearly that such a privilege would be more available {{now than it was}} then. I am aware that times are tighter now than they were then. Please write me at all events, and whether <b>you</b> <b>can</b> now <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> or not I shall continue grateful for the past.|$|R
6000|$|Well, I {{had better}} {{come to the}} yoke. It is a stiff place, and I feel as though I were bogged up to the axle. But, [...] "sutjes, sutjes," [...] as the Boers say--I am sure I don't know how they spell it--softly does it. A strong team will come through at last, that is, {{if they are not}} too poor. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> never <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> with poor oxen. Now to make a start.|$|R
60|$|I {{put myself}} in your hands, Violet. I shall never suspect that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything,</b> not that I should reproach you for--I will never reproach you--but that you may reproach {{yourself}} for.|$|E

2500|$|The show ended 7 April 2006 {{after its}} 15th season with exactly 300 episodes.

6000|$|The son {{went up to}} {{the woman}} again, and asked: [...] "Aren't <b>you</b> well? <b>Can</b> we <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for <b>you?</b> It won't do to stay here, you know." [...] The woman only made a low murmur, and he said to his sister, [...] "Suppose we get her up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah! Just {{because you}} had me {{expelled}} from Oak Hall you think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything,</b> don't you? Well, just wait till you get out West, that's all! I'll show you {{a thing or two}} you won't forget as long as you live!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. I {{suppose you}} are right to tell me. Of course you know that I can do nothing for you; and I don't suppose that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for me. As far as your own welfare goes, {{if she has a}} large fortune,--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Look here.--I am {{wasting my}} time and brains on ribaldry, but I am worth nothing better--at least, I think so at times; but <b>you,</b> who <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> put your hand to, what {{business}} have you, in the devil's name, to be throwing yourself away on gimcracks and fox- hunting foolery? Heavens! If I had your talents, I'd be--I'd {{make a name for}} myself before I died, if I died to make it.' The colonel griped his hand hard, rose, and looked out of the window for a few minutes. There was a dead, brooding silence, till he turned to Lancelot,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> {{until you}} have seen everything, or as much as <b>you</b> <b>can?</b> And besides, darling, I love you. Come along with me.

Come across the sea and be happy!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, my son," [...] she said, [...] "remember what I {{have always}} told <b>you.</b> One <b>can</b> <b>do</b> without <b>anything</b> {{in this world}} except money. We have plenty for the moment, it is true, but a stroke of ill-fortune, and our income might well vanish. Now listen, Bertrand. Make sure of this girl's money. She is of age, and she will marry you." ...|$|R
60|$|Still, that's {{what you}} call love, and if you've got it, and are well shaved, and your boots well blacked, you can do things that seem almost impossible. Yes, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything,</b> {{even if you do}} trip over the dog in getting off the piazza.|$|E
6000|$|Belton {{did as he}} was told; {{he pulled}} off his coat and sat himself down by the fire. [...] "I don't know that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to help me,--at least, not as yet. But I must go and see after her. Perhaps she may be all alone." ...|$|E

5000|$|Allen {{announced}} he had retired his mare on January 16, 2009. [...] "She’s smart, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> rate her; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> with her,” Allen said. “She {{just seems like}} she wants to win. She’s a wonderful mare. We would love to retire her undefeated, but more than anything else, we want to retire her sound; she’s been so good to us. We’ve had a little criticism for not running her in open company and not running her in this or that and all this other stuff. But Joel Marr said it best, ‘If it’s so easy, I’m surprised there haven’t been 100 of them like her.’” ...|$|R
5000|$|He finally {{returned}} on October 3 at Hoosier Park in an Indiana Sire Stakes elimination, {{winning in}} 1:49. He then won his elimination for the Breeders Crown Open Pace in 1:49.4.

He then finished his season {{by winning the}} American-National Aged Pace at Balmoral Park in 1:49.1.
