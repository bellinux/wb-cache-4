2500|$|Derfner's {{first major}} musical was Signs of Life, with lyrics by Len Schiff and book by Peter Ullian. The work, about a Nazi {{concentration}} camp in Terezin, Czechoslovakia, was originally called Terezin. It {{is the true}} story of the Theresienstadt concentration camp, which {{was the subject of a}} 1944 Nazi propaganda film created to deceive the world by portraying it as a model academic and artistic community. Derfner has stated, [...] "Bizarrely, Terezin became a cultural capital of Europe because the Nazis sent all these artists and intellectuals and all the musicians there." [...] Commenting on the creation of the play, he said, [...] "You can’t tell a story about injustice and cruelty; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story about people." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Perkins {{told her}} agent, Debi Allen, {{about the idea}} and a meeting with a BBC comedy {{commissioner}} followed shortly after. Perkins was advised to work her idea into a six-part sitcom, which she initially resisted doing as she saw it more as a comedy drama instead. A sitcom required [...] "a 'sit' or precinct" [...] and Perkins eventually decided to locate the show in a veterinary surgery, as it features {{people from all walks}} of life. After the first episode was commissioned, a table-read was organised for December 2011. In April 2012, Perkins was filming World's Most Dangerous Roads in Laos, when she was told her sitcom had been commissioned for a full series. From April to July, Perkins wrote the remaining episodes. Perkins later called Heading Out [...] "a midlife crises sitcom", explaining [...] "It's more about how awkward it is to tell your parents anything, as opposed to just the gay issue. Essentially, when you come out to your parents, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them, 'I'm having sex!'. And no one wants to say that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that," [...] {{said the}} blacksmith, with a {{somewhat}} severe {{expression on his}} face, [...] "is all that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about your wonderful Water-devil!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must forgive me. What <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> must <b>have</b> {{dissipated}} my poor senses. It is {{even more}} startling than anything I had imagined," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|I was joking, but {{she said}} seriously, [...] "Yes; he must go away. And I don't envy <b>you</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him. I suppose you will bungle it, of course." ...|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND. Your brother's, you mean. A {{man should}} wear his own clothes; {{and a man}} should tell his own lies. I'm sorry <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> mine for me to-day.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{might wish}} for time, {{if there was}} {{anything}} more. But if there's nothing else <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me--then, no, I cannot marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, la, la!" [...] Sophy exclaimed. [...] "Is {{that all}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us? I shall {{begin to think}} that you were up to {{mischief}} there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Behaving very well? Is {{that all}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me? I don't believe {{you said a}} proper word to her. You are conspiring {{together}} to kill me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sally winced. [...] "Yes" [...] she agreed, [...] "I guess <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me. He {{was fond}} of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did {{anything}} low down and mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have seen}} it. I knew what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> from the instant you entered. And your father <b>has</b> given <b>you</b> his consent?' raising her hand, {{as if to}} say, 'I give up all hopes of him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mary, {{the time}} <b>to</b> shake hands <b>has</b> not yet come; {{that you must}} know very well. You did not say in your letter what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me, but only that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me; remembering what we parted in anger about, and knowing that you know how deeply I feel on that subject, I naturally concluded that you wished to see me about it. I {{do not wish to}} be trifled with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I willingly {{offer you}} all the time that I have at my own command," [...] Mercy replied. [...] "Does what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me relate to Lady Janet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} did,--because {{you are so}} soft. And now, Phineas, we will put it off no longer. Tell me all that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fewer adventures <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the better, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Rooth; [...] "and if Mr. Dormer {{keeps you}} quiet he'll add {{ten years to}} my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't see why {{you should}} always be {{dragging}} in this Mr. Brice," [...] she said, almost tearfully. (It will not do to pause now and inquire into Virginia's logic.) [...] "I came out <b>to</b> hear what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|He felt a regal {{impulse to}} assist her. [...] "I <b>have</b> wanted <b>to</b> see you," [...] he said. [...] "A {{few days ago}} you wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me something--you wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me of the people. What was it <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you in brown!" [...] she said, indignantly {{turning to}} Mr. Lorry; [...] "couldn't you <b>tell</b> her what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her, without {{frightening}} her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do {{you call that}} being a Banker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think Helen {{very much}} {{improved}} in appearance and manners,' said Sir Edward; 'and I am {{quite willing to}} believe all that I see <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me of her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Out with it, then," [...] he cried, almost roughly. [...] "Don't you know, child, {{that this}} is torture for me? What in God's name more can <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will all}} {{want to hear what}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> Major," [...] the head of the staff said. [...] "You had best go into the mess tent, and hold a durbar." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{left the}} {{professor}} at the Club House and raced back to the farm. I wanted to pour my joys into a sympathetic ear. Ukridge, I knew, would offer that same sympathetic ear. A good fellow, Ukridge. Always interested in what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him; never bored.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me {{break the}} news to myself," [...] she said--"let me {{anticipate}} you, if I can. His useless will, the terms in which you speak of his daughters, the doubt you seem to feel of my continued respect for his memory, have opened a new view to me. Mr. Vanstone has died a ruined man--is that what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not be displeased," [...] I said, and as I spoke I seated myself {{beside her}} on the stone. She made no objections. I think she was too much {{agitated}} even to notice it. [...] "I had no intention of keeping anything from you, but I first wanted <b>to</b> hear what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me. Sylvia did not tell me everything, nor have you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit there," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to an easy-chair opposite to him. [...] "I {{want to see}} your face while you are talking. Now, what is this tale which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{finished}} with Africa, {{if that is}} what you mean," [...] was the somewhat grave reply. [...] "As to settling down here, well, that depends a little upon what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a cold}} greeting," [...] said Ralph, {{amazed and}} trembling, for he feared lest Suzanne should have changed her mind as to their marriage. [...] "What is it that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me? Speak on, quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll always {{remember}} that, and I'll tell your mother. Ah, but she won't believe me, Dick; <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|At last I said, [...] "Do you know, Polly, I {{could not}} think what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me. I saw <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} on your mind, that you were anxious and absent, and that your visit had some purpose more than you pretended,--and yet, as you assured me that all I cared for were well, I could not conceive what it could be. Did {{you see it in}} the paper before Charley started to business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Because I {{wanted a}} {{statement}} and your letter from him,” said Appleby. “You see, <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Miss Wayne that story sooner or later.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my lad," [...] he said, [...] "and what is {{this great}} thing <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me that is so mightily wonderful? I got what's-his-name--Mr. Jones's--letter, and now I am ready {{to hear what you}} have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her look, her tone, were so {{charged with}} {{insidious}} meanings {{as to make}} him feel that even to understand her would savour of dishonest complicity. [...] "What is it <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" [...] he cried with a flushed frown.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be for long," [...] he went on. [...] "I am far too anxious to hear what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me to submit to any needless delays. The truth is, I have had a message from Lady Janet." ...|$|E
60|$|FANNY [she {{stretches}} {{out her hand}} and lays it on his]. Won't it be too hard for <b>you?</b> You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them all--your friends-- everybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me, Tom," [...] remarked Sam, {{as the three}} were going downstairs to breakfast. [...] "What was it?" ...|$|R
60|$|BRODIE. I thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me something. Here I am. For God's sake {{out with}} it, and don't stand beating about the bush.|$|R
