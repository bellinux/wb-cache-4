500|$|The couplet {{summarizes}} the sonnet in two lines, [...] "Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue, because I would not dull <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> song". This {{is a clear}} statement from the poet vocalizing for the final time {{that he will not}} dull, bore, or represent his muse in a tedious way by creating a sonnet as exhausted and cliched as his contemporaries. In his analysis of the couplet, Stephen Booth compares the couplet to a proverb: [...] "My desire is not to dull you, if I cannot delight you." [...] Booth suggests that the poet does not wish to make his lover seem common with overabundant praise. Aitkins similarly suggests that the poet does not wish his praises to become annoying. Helen Vendler suggests that the poet uses proverbial language here to address the Fair Youth's seeming obsession with receiving praise; a personal plea would fall on deaf ears, so he makes his case rather impersonal.|$|E
500|$|Lior Philips from Consequence of Sound found {{influences}} of Gaga's [...] "dance musicality" [...] in [...] "The Cure", {{especially in the}} [...] "finger clicking, pristine clean production, anthemic flute-like synth, and her remarkable falsetto". Comparing the track to songs by OneRepublic, Philips complimented {{the simplicity of the}} verses, writing that it [...] "intensifies the mood". Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood states that [...] "The Cure" [...] is [...] "an intriguing midtempo pop-soul jam", with [...] "synthetic textures", and [...] "very Madonna circa 'Human Nature'". Amy Mackelden of Marie Claire called it a [...] "synth-pop masterpiece that will be stuck in your head from the second you hear it" [...] and further wrote: [...] "The lyrics are super uplifting and relatable, especially as the chorus features the positive refrain, 'No matter what you know, I'll fix <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> love.'"

In youth you didn't have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you, too, shall cry – while my heart shall be glad." [...] Nonetheless, his [...] "war with the public" [...] was based on understanding that public. He would also write, [...] "I wrote Di kishefmakhern (The Witch) in Romania, where the populace – Jews as much as Romanians – believe strongly in witches." [...] Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.|$|E

Becky Bain of Idolator wrote that [...] "This track showcases more of the adventurous new directions Christina said she hoped to try on this album. We like it!"

500|$|Hatt-ı hümayuns on {{the white}} were more {{elaborate}} and some may have been drafted by a scribe before being penned by the Sultan. They often started by addressing the recipient. The Sultan would refer to his grand vizier as [...] "My Vizier", or if his grand vizier was away at war, would refer to his deputy as [...] "Ka'immakâm Paşa". Those written to other officials would often start with an expression like [...] "You who are my Vizier of Rumeli, Mehmed Pasha" [...] ("Sen ki Rumili vezîrim Mehmed Paşa'sın"). The head of religious affairs (Şeyhülislam) or the Sultan's personal tutor would be addressed simply and respectfully. In cases where the hatt-ı hümayun was to be delivered ceremoniously, with an imperial sword and a cloak, as in an appointment to a high rank, {{there would be a}} flowery salutation such as [...] "after I have honored <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> glorious greeting you should know that..." [...] (seni selâm-ı şâhanemle teşrif eylediğimden sonra malumun ola ki...). Correspondence to a military commander could have a lengthy and ornate salutation or just address him by his title.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} healing effect of love. In an article for Bustle, Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had {{supported}} Gaga throughout her career. While performing [...] "The Cure" [...] at 'Coachella', the singer said to the crowd: [...] "I love you guys so much. I have {{been through so much}} in my life and I've seen so much. And you cure me every time with your love." [...] The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts [...] "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll fix <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the closing line [...] "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure". Ally Hirschalg from Mic also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancee Taylor Kinney the previous year.|$|E

500|$|... "Glassheart" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a dubstep, dance, house and grime song that runs for 3:56 (three minutes, 56 seconds). According to Jenna Hally Rubenstein for MTV Buzzworthy, the song consists of a [...] "grimy, hazy beat", which she compared to [...] "Too Close" [...] (The Lateness of the Hour, 2011), a song performed by Alex Clare. Lyrically, the song is about Lewis' fear that her lover will break her heart. According to Lewis, the song is about protecting yourself, your heart, as well as your emotions. She continued to describe the song as [...] "poignant". The singer went on to reveal that she decided to name the album after the song. Lewis' [...] "crisp" [...] vocals can be heard above the instrumentation as she [...] "croons about the fragility of her heart" [...] as she performs the chorus lines [...] "So baby if you love me/ Let me know/ 'Cause everything hurts just like before/ You're about to tear this heart apart/ I love you like a glass heart." [...] The chorus is built on a [...] "transcendent house beat" [...] as Lewis delicately sings the lines [...] "Promise that we'll never fall apart/ And I'll love <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> Glassheart". The chorus is then followed by a [...] "euphoric instrumentation [...] collapses into a grimy dubstep break." [...] Rubenstein likened the lyrics to those performed by Blondie on her song [...] "Heart of Glass" [...] (Parallel Lines, 1978).|$|E
500|$|Playwright {{and poet}} William Shakespeare (1564–1616) makes {{frequent}} use of the Philomela myth—most notably in his tragedy Titus Andronicus (c. 1588–1593) where characters directly reference Tereus and Philomela in commenting on rape and mutilation of Lavinia by Aaron, Chiron, and Demetrius. Prominent allusions to Philomela also occur in the depiction of Lucrece in The Rape of Lucrece, in the depiction of Imogen in Cymbeline, and in Titania's lullaby in A Midsummer Night's Dream where she asks Philomel to [...] "sing in our sweet lullaby". In Sonnet 102, Shakespeare addresses his lover (the [...] "fair youth") and compares his love poetry to {{the song of the}} nightingale, noting that [...] "her mournful hymns did hush the night" [...] (line 10), and that as a poet would [...] "hold his tongue" [...] (line 13) in deference to the more beautiful nightingale's song so that he [...] "not dull <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> song" [...] (line 14). Emilia Lanyer (1569–1645), a poet who is considered by some scholars to be the woman referred to in the poetry of William Shakespeare as [...] "Dark Lady", makes several references to Philomela in her patronage poem [...] "The Description of Cookeham" [...] in Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum (1611). Lanyer's poem, dedicated to Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland and her daughter Lady Anne Clifford refers to Philomela's [...] "sundry layes"(line 31) and later to her [...] "mournful ditty" [...] (line 189).|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but I also think she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own style. I've learned this. I know how to do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, Perry said that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E

Graham Brown, George Jones, Little Texas, Dana McVicker (who also sang backup on Tritt's first two albums), Tanya Tucker and Porter Wagoner, peaked at number four. Its follow-up, [...] "Can I Trust <b>You</b> <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Heart," [...] became Tritt's third Billboard number one in early 1993. The album's next three singles did not perform as well on the charts: the title track (a cover of an Elvis Presley song), peaked at 13, followed by [...] "Looking Out for Number One" [...] at number 11 and [...] "Worth Every Mile" [...] at number 30. T-R-O-U-B-L-E became the second album of his career to achieve double-platinum certification. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic thought that T-R-O-U-B-L-E followed too closely the formula of It's All About to Change, but said that the songs showed Tritt's personality.

[...] Louis XII of France defeated the Genoan army outside the city, which then agreed a capitulation, including an entry which was followed by the execution of the Doge and other leaders of the revolt.
