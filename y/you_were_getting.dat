[...] In response to the question, the lyrics {{in the first three}} verses consist of various advertising slogans, including, [...] "Better by design", [...] "Be all that you can be", and [...] "Vorsprung durch technik". Critic Parry Gettelman interpreted these lines as meaning to [...] "signify the emptiness of modern, godless life". In the song's second half, the theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced, particularly in the lines [...] "I have no compass / And I have no map". [...] "Babyface" [...] is about a man practicing his obsessive love for a celebrity by manipulating her image on a TV recording. [...] "Lemon", inspired by an old video of Bono's late mother in a lemon-coloured dress, describes man's attempts to preserve time through technology. This is reflected in lines such as, [...] "A man makes a picture / A moving picture / Through the light projected he can see himself up close". The lyrics to [...] "Numb" [...] are a series of [...] "don't" [...] commands, amidst a noisy backdrop of sounds. The Edge notes that the song was inspired by one of the themes of Zoo TV, [...] "that sense that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> bombarded with so much that you actually were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you".|$|E

Carey denied ever having {{been involved with the}} rapper in a personal relationship, claiming that they had only met a handful of times, and it was professional. Subsequently, he referred to Carey in several of his songs in a negative light, claiming to have been angered by her not admitting to seeing him. On Charmbracelet, Carey included a song titled [...] "Clown", which critics suggested was aimed at Eminem. [...] "Clown"'s lyrics were described as [...] "languidly sinister" [...] by Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, and read: [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / When you know very well we never even touched each other." [...] In 2005, during concerts on the rapper's Anger Management Tour, he began playing voice-mails and recordings that were reportedly left by Carey. One of the messages said: [...] "I heard <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> back with your ex-wife. Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?". After playing the excerpt, Eminem would pretend to be sick before launching into his song [...] "Puke". On May 12, 2009, Eminem released his sixth studio album Relapse, which included the song [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". The song's lyrics suggested Eminem was still in love with Carey and [...] "wanted her back": [...] "I want another crack at ya" [...] and [...] "Nick Cannon better back the f**k up. I'm not playing, I want her back, you punk." [...] After the song's release, Cannon went on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at the rapper's comments: ...|$|E
