25|$|Examples of {{infidelity}} are found acted out in television and film {{because of the}} drama often. In {{the beginning of the}} popular series Grey’s Anatomy, one of TV’s most beloved couples, Derek and Meredith, began their relationship while Derek was married to Addison. Although, Derek and Meredith went on to have a strong relationship, Addison changed. She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts {{to come to grips with}} the infidelity. There are many more examples {{of infidelity}} in films and television, and real life, but the point is: if your partner cheats on <b>you</b> <b>it</b> is impossible to be completely unbothered.|$|E
