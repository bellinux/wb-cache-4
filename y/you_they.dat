5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill <b>you.</b> <b>They</b> destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with <b>you.</b> <b>They</b> didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

Stafford built a new office suite at the Gardens for Conn, and the feud was over. After Stafford was charged in 1971 with fraud and became ill with a stomach ulcer, Conn was with him in hospital when he died. According to Conn, Stafford's last words to him were [...] "see dad, I told <b>you</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't put me in jail." ...|$|E

500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance.

500|$|Disappointed by {{the lack}} of {{progress}} on the film's production, aspiring screenwriter/comic book fan Alex Ford was able to have a script of his (titled Superman: The Man of Steel) accepted at the studio's offices in September 1998. Ford pitched his idea for a film series consisting of seven installments, and his approach impressed Warner Bros. and Peters, though he was later given a farewell due to creative differences. Ford said, [...] "I can tell <b>you</b> <b>they</b> don't know much about comics. Their audience isn't you and me who pay $7.00. It's for the parents who spend $60 on toys and lunchboxes.

500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image {{to take away from}} the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I did think with art films that they don't pay <b>you,</b> <b>they</b> don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm so happy to be here." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize <b>you?</b> <b>They</b> will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E

500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded <b>you.</b> <b>They</b> should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer."

500|$|Many of Potter's tales {{appealed to}} girls, but Mr. Tod {{had a strong}} {{following}} among boys, due perhaps to the lengthy fight {{at the end of}} the book accompanied by [...] "dreadful bad language". Six-year-old Harold Botcherby wrote to Potter asking if the fight between Tod and Brock was still raging. Potter replied; describing the end of the battle and the injuries to the combatants:I am sorry to tell <b>you</b> <b>they</b> are still quarreling. Mr. Tod has been living in the willow till he was flooded out; at present he is in the stick house with a bad cold in his head. As for the end of the fight [...] Mr. Tod had nearly half his hair pulled out of his brush [...] and five bad bites, especially one ear, which is scrumpled up (like you sometimes see nasty old Tom Cat's ears). the only misfortune to Tommy Brock [...] he had his jacket torn and lost one of his boots. So for a long time he went about with one of his feet bundled up in dirty rags, like an old beggar man. Then he found the boot in the quarry. There was a beetle in the boot and several slugs. Tommy Brock ate them. He is a nasty person. He will go on living in Mr. Tod's comfortable house till springtime [...] then he will move off into the woods & live out doors [...] and Mr. Tod will come back very, very cautiously [...] & there will need to be a big spring cleaning!" ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the ship was {{upgraded}} with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close In Weapon System Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. During the modernization Missouris [...] bell, which {{had been removed from}} the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. Missouri was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986.

It {{was one of those}} ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment." [...] Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv... anywhere music meant more than entertainment". He added [...] "to be able to address General Pinochet from the stage on live television in Chile and say, 'Give the dead back to the living. Please, General Pinochet, tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are.' That was an extraordinary moment... certainly in my life and U2's." [...] When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating [...] "it's proof to me that a rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings.... If they don't agree with <b>you,</b> <b>they</b> will let you know – but that doesn't mean they're not fans.... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us." [...] U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who {{was in the process of}} becoming a Senator for life after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.|$|E
