60|$|At {{first sight}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it did not. At first sight you would fancy that it spoke of God {{in quite a}} {{different}} tone from the second lesson.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Miss Briscoe," [...] he said, {{springing}} {{up to her}} side. [...] "I was a clumsy idiot, but I was afraid that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I had followed you. May I stay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It must be disheartening work {{learning}} a musical instrument. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Society, {{for its own}} sake, would do all it could to assist a man to acquire the art of playing a musical instrument. But it doesnâ€™t! ...|$|E
30|$|At first sight, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{definitely}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{he was an}} aborigine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou art a wild but a kind girl," [...] said Eveline; [...] "no {{one who did}} {{not know}} <b>thee</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> soft and childish {{exterior}} covered such a soul of fire. Thy mother must indeed have been the being of feeling and passion you paint her; for thy father--nay, nay, never arm in his defence until he be attacked--I only meant to say, that his solid sense and sound judgment are his most distinguished qualities." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> brow could e'er [...] Ungentle moods express, [...] Yet seemed it, in this troubled world, [...] Too calm for gentleness, [...] When {{the very}} star that shines from far [...] Shines {{trembling}} ne'ertheless.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{forget how}} ill I behaved,' said Guy, colouring. 'If {{you knew the}} madness of those first moments of provocation, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the penance of a lifetime, instead of only one winter, would scarce have been sufficient.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, mother," [...] Ned replied recklessly; [...] "if I am, I suppose I am. I know in {{your eyes}} he can do no wrong. And I believe if he beat you, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you {{deserved}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} dinna," [...] replied Babbie, in broad Scotch. [...] "Maybe, if you did, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's mair {{imprudent}} in me to stand here cracking clavers wi' the minister {{than for the}} minister to waste his time cracking wi' me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was {{a little}} play last Christmas,' {{continued}} Mrs. Cadurcis, 'and he acted quite delightfully. Now <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> {{from the way he}} sits upon that chair. Plantagenet, my dear, I do insist upon your behaving yourself. Sit like a man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, kisses, yes! If I didn't kiss <b>you</b> father <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we {{had already}} quarrelled. But {{it may be that}} we must do so. When I had told you everything, that you should rush up to London to look after me--as though you {{suspected}} me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Esther!' he began, 'there is {{something}} you ought to know. You know {{my father is a}} rich man, and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think,</b> now <b>that</b> we love each other, we might marry when we pleased. But I fear, darling, we may have long to wait, and shall want all our courage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{else can}} he do with decency?' Mrs. Nettlepoint went on. 'If, as my son, he were never {{to speak to her}} it would be very rude and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{stranger}} still. Then you would do what he does, and where would be the difference?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in {{all that}} you do {{you are dealing with}} my feelings, with my heartstrings, with my reputation. You cannot divide {{yourself}} from me; nor, for the value of it all, would I wish that such division were possible. You say that I am thin-skinned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well,--but you wouldn't like it. And {{then you would}} become unfair to what you saw. When some of our speechifying people talked to you about our {{institutions}} through their noses, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the institutions themselves must be bad. And {{we have nothing to}} show except our institutions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{your father}} <b>would</b> like it? <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> another man <b>would</b> be doing well for himself by marrying Miss Boncassen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what of that? To hear <b>you</b> talk, one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} nothing left of Greshamsbury. What's four-and-twenty {{thousand}} pounds? Does Scatcherd know what rent-roll is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Except,' said Gabriel, {{bending down}} yet more, and looking {{cautiously}} towards their silent neighhour, 'except {{in respect of}} the robber himself. What like was he, sir? Speak low, if you please. Barnaby means no harm, but I have watched him oftener than you, and I know, little as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it, <b>that</b> he's listening now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered. [...] "All {{those who}} have no use for them. About one per cent. of the population. To listen to Miss Tolley <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> half the women wanted a new husband every ten years. It's always the one per cent. that get {{themselves}} talked about. The other ninety-nine are too busy." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{this would}} make the coach top heavy, and so it does in some degree; but then {{the body of the}} coach below is so large and heavy, that the extra weight above is well counterpoised; and then, besides, the roads are so smooth and level, and withal so hard, that there is no danger of an upset.|$|E
6000|$|... "But if {{you were}} in my place,--if it were your father whose name was so bandied about in people's mouths, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it behoved him to do nothing, to go nowhere, till he had forced the world to confess his innocence. And this is ten times {{stronger}} with regard to a woman. I have given my mother my counsel, and I regret to say that she differs from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not speak}} {{any more of}} this to me now," [...] she said. [...] "I must have time. The {{instinct}} of years cannot be brushed away in a day. If you knew all the sins I have committed, perhaps <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> too <b>that</b> for such as I am there is no forgiveness and no hope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that is {{just what}} I knew <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I am coming to you now, and {{offering}} to make up matters between you and Clara because you are rich!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment and smiled, for there was in him a certain half-whimsical cruelty. [...] "Still, perhaps, it's a little rough on the {{excellent}} Potter, though from what <b>you</b> said one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had told him--something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't suppose <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> Millicent, if a burglar, who {{had taken}} one shot at you {{and was about to}} finish you with another, was cut short in the {{operation}} by a shot from my pistol. I believe that your relief and thankfulness would be so great that the idea that it was a shocking thing for me to do would not as much as enter your head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{would rather}} tell you," [...] Rupert said. [...] "I know none of <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Edgar {{would have done}} {{anything}} wrong, but all sorts of stories are certain to go about, and I would rather that {{the truth of the matter}} were known. You are the six head fellows of the house, and when I have told you the story you can do as you like about its going further." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They don't suggest it," [...] {{his chief}} answered, [...] "but I can't quite make out what's {{at the back}} of their heads. However, I won't bother you about that now. If I were to propound Heseltine's theory to you, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he had been reading the works of some of our enterprising young novelists. Things will have cleared up, I dare say, by next week. I am coming round to the House for a moment if you're not in a hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we know that," [...] the {{minister}} intervened, [...] "but {{it is perfectly}} astonishing that an island so large as Altruria should have been lost to {{the knowledge of the}} rest of the world ever since the beginning of our era. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there was a space of the ocean's surface a mile square which had not been traversed by a thousand keels since Columbus sailed westward." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in {{a little}} wee primer--for {{that is what the}} Autobiography is--a person with a tumultuous career of seventy years behind her could find room for two or three pages of padding of this kind, but such is the case. She evidently puts {{narrative}} together with difficulty and is not at home in it, and is glad to have something ready-made to fill in with. Another sample: ...|$|R
60|$|Warping is, of course, a {{very slow}} way of getting along, and is only {{practicable}} for short distances, and is most frequently employed in confined situations, {{where it would be}} unsafe to go fast. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>think,</b> too, <b>that</b> this process could only be resorted to near a shore, or a quay, or a great field of ice, where posts could be set to attach the lines to; but this, as will appear presently, is a mistake.|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> as {{the colors}} of the design are thus {{represented}} by separate pieces of glass, put in one after the other, the result would be a sort of mottled appearance, or at least that the gradations of hue would be sharp and harsh in their effect. But it is not so. The pieces are so small, and the different shades succeed each other so regularly, that when viewed from the ordinary distance, the junctions disappear altogether, and the shades mingle and blend together in the softest and most perfect manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like it," [...] she said. [...] "And don't you see," [...] she added, with animation, [...] "what an {{advantage}} I possess in having determined never to marry? Very few other girls {{would be willing}} to speak to you so plainly. They would be afraid <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they wanted you, but, as I don't want anybody, you and I can talk over things of this kind like free and equal human beings. So I will say again that I don't like your affection for Mrs. Chester. It disappoints me." ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{much for}} the more civilized apple-trees (urbaniores, as Pliny calls them). I love better {{to go through the}} old {{orchards}} of ungrafted apple-trees, at whatever season of the year,--so irregularly planted: sometimes two trees standing close together; and the rows so devious that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they not only had grown while the owner was sleeping, but had been set out by him in a somnambulic state. The rows of grafted fruit will never tempt me to wander amid them like these. But I now, alas, speak rather from memory than from any recent experience, such ravages have been made! ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a letter}} about The League of the Divine Wind, Isao's {{favorite}} book (a book which Mishima reproduces in full), Honda writes to him: [...] "At your age, however, every excitement is dangerous. Every excitement that can send one pitching headlong is dangerous. And some are especially dangerous. For example, judging from that light that flashes from {{your eyes to}} disconcert those around <b>you,</b> I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your very nature makes a tale of this sort 'unsuitable' for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Securities {{of various}} sorts." [...] He {{unfolded}} {{them one by}} one. [...] "Papers worth so much money each. Now here's a lot of turnpike bonds for one thing. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> each of these pieces of paper is worth two hundred pounds?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Jeffrey, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{you were}} in a monk's cell or in some great dame's bower? Hunt under the table, man; sure, you will find her lute and needlework. Whose {{portrait}} is <b>that,</b> <b>think</b> you?" [...] and he pointed to the Magdalene.|$|R
