Fanning called it [...] "a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, and it was on the back of this that Fanning wrote [...] "My Happiness". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song.|$|E

[...] Richard Roeper awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, [...] "When Ferreira finally appears and we learn the truth about where he's been all this time, it further serves Scorsese's central theme about the conflict between adhering to one's sacred vows and traditional beliefs and doing the right thing, the prudent thing, the moral thing, on a very pragmatic level." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{announced}} a world tour in April 2003. , [...] "" [...] was her most extensive tour, lasting over eight months and performing sixty-nine shows in venues worldwide. Before tickets {{went on sale}} in the US, venues were switched from large arenas to smaller, more intimate theater shows. According to Carey, the change was made {{in order to give}} fans a more intimate show, and something more Broadway-influenced. She said, [...] "It's much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an experience. <b>You</b> <b>experience</b> a night with me." [...] However, while smaller productions were booked for the US leg of the tour, Carey performed at stadia and arenas in Asia and Europe, and performed for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China. In the UK, it was Carey's first tour to feature shows outside London; she performed in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.|$|E
500|$|According to Michelle Grobbelaar {{from the}} CGS, [...] "There's {{a rule of}} thumb that if <b>you</b> <b>experience</b> an {{earthquake}} with a certain magnitude in the past, you can always expect an earthquake of a similar magnitude in that same area." [...] Grobbelaar and Denver Birch, also from the CGS, said that the cause of the earthquake was difficult to determine given that it occurred in a mining area and the lack of historical seismic data for the area. Ian Saunders from the CGS confirmed that a team would be sent to the area for further investigation, and Eldridge Kgaswane from the CGS said {{they should be able to}} determine the cause within a month. According to Kgaswane, [...] "The fact that the deepest mine shafts are shallower than the epicentre doesn't mean mining can be ruled out as a cause. Blasting in the vicinity of a big fault could have activated seismic activity." [...] On 18 August 2014 at a Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) seminar in Pretoria, the CGS confirmed that the earthquake was caused by mining-related activity, making it the biggest ever mining-related earthquake recorded in South Africa.|$|E

500|$|... "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz compared {{the direction in}} [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to the film-making of Sergio Leone, particularly in its [...] "extreme close-ups", [...] "tense silences" [...] and the [...] "saloon fight" [...] between Walter and Mike. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the filming techniques used in Jesse's party [...] "which starts off like a rap video then turns {{into some kind of}} distorted, jumpy tweak-vision" [...] effectively conveyed Jesse's frame of mind. He also liked the way the script conveyed Marie's [...] "increasing isolation" [...] in dealing with Hank. [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode a [...] "terrific, unsettling hour" [...] and particularly complimented director Michelle MacLaren and cinematographer Michael Slovis, especially for shooting Jesse's party scenes [...] "in a way that let <b>you</b> <b>experience</b> the chaos just as Jesse was trying to". Sepinwall strongly praised Aaron Paul, who he said [...] "keeps finding new layers of Jesse, and new talents to show them with". New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised the film noir elements in the episode's photography, and said the opening scene, with Walter staring into the mirror asking, [...] "So, how's it look?", refers to the season's ongoing theme of internal self-reflection and surveillance. Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff said while the episode didn't advance the plot very far, it included a great deal of internal development among the characters, which he called [...] "an interesting new dynamic for the show to explore". He also called Jesse's emotional breakdown at the end [...] "easily the most chilling thing so far this season".|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." [...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, <b>you</b> <b>experience</b> it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when you consider that [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner {{is one of the most}} magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{birth is}} the {{beginning}} of the separation between mother and child, breastfeeding slows this process, making the mother and infant connect physically continually, sometimes for years. [...] As a source of nourishment, the immediacy of this connection is intensified. [...] Breastfeeding has a sexual element as a result of physiological factors. [...] In a study conducted in 1999, approximately 33 to 50 percent of mothers found breast feeding erotic, and among them 25 percent felt guilty because of this. [...] This study corroborated a study in 1949 that found that in a few cases where the arousal was strong enough to induce orgasm, some nursing mothers abandoned breastfeeding altogether.
