2500|$|Geist {{described}} Ralph as [...] "not {{an idiot}} or a maniac" [...] but rather, in Ralph's own words, [...] "a typical 52-year-old working guy, a veteran, father, Little League baseball coach, churchgoer, the whole shot". [...] Geist {{goes on to}} say: [...] "The simple explanation, Ralph, is that <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> up the Chicago area's preeminent ghost: Resurrection Mary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others see the {{distinction}} as primarily historical. Huang Chien Liang, {{president of the}} United States Kuoshu Federation and The World Kuoshu Federation, notes that [...] "Kuoshu has another meaning as 'national art.' In 1928, the Central Kuoshu Academy was formed, and they sponsored a full-contact tournament, but when the Chinese Communist Party took over China, the Nationalist government moved to Taiwan, where, in 1955, they held a full-contact tournament, calling it lei tai. At that time, they used the original rules; no protection, and no weight class - whatever number <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> up, you fought together.|$|E
2500|$|... …The NFL didn’t {{like the}} idea of any player having a clause in his {{contract}} guaranteeing him more money than his teammates, and it made noises about voiding the deal. [...] That’s when Ralph Cindrich went on the warpath. [...] He asked, pointedly, if the league would have the same reservations if the clause had been in some quarterback’s contract. [...] He accused the league, {{in the pages of the}} New York Times, of “discrimination against offensive linemen.” [...] And the NFL let the deal slide, but only after saying no such deal would be permitted in the future. [...] “There’s a mentality about linemen that goes back to high school,” said Cindrich. [...] “When <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> your football team, these were the last guys picked.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Zhen Yi once {{brought his}} {{children}} to meet Liu Liang (劉良), a fortune teller, who commented on Lady Zhen, [...] "This girl will become very noble in the future." [...] Unlike many children of her age, the young Lady Zhen did not enjoy playing. Once, when she was eight years old, her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horse-riding performers outside their house but Lady Zhen did not join in. Her sisters were puzzled so they asked her, and she responded, [...] "Is this something a girl should watch?" [...] When she was nine years old, she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers' writing materials. Her brothers told her, [...] "You should be learning what women traditionally do (such as weaving). When <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> up reading, were you thinking of becoming a female academician?" [...] Lady Zhen replied, [...] "I heard that virtuous women in history learnt from the successes and failures of those who lived before them. If they didn't read, how did they learn all that?" ...|$|E
