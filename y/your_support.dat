500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling has given us an idea. What would {{you think of a}} training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, so it would be child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs {{in the name of the}} Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of Le Vélo and on <b>your</b> <b>support</b> for organising the start? ...|$|E

40|$|A {{new report}} {{has found the}} Liberal National Party (LNP) has little {{appetite}} for evidence-based measures to reduce alcohol harms; with the Newman Government (LNP) indicating full support for only one in ten alcohol policy measures proposed {{by a group of}} leading public health experts. The Queensland Greens, Labor and Katter’s Australian Party (KAP) all performed better, and the Queensland Coalition for Action on Alcohol (QCAA) says it is encouraged by the alcohol policy scorecard findings, and the growing support for more effective policy measures. Approach On 7 January 2015, the Queensland Coalition for Action on Alcohol (QCAA) wrote to the leaders and state offices of six political parties contesting the Queensland state election; the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Labor (Labor), Katter’s Australian Party (KAP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), Palmer United Party (PUP) and One Nation. The letter posed ten questions for the political parties on alcohol policy: 1. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> the development of a state-wide alcohol harm reduction plan that includes prevention, early intervention, treatment, monitoring and evaluation and also includes working with and supporting non-government organisations to provide alcohol and other drug services to reduce alcohol harm? 2. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> a reduction in trading hours for on-licence premises to no later than 3 am, the introduction of 1 am lockouts and recommencement of the moratorium on all applications for late night trading beyond midnight across Queensland? 3. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> the prohibition of the harmful discounting and promotion of alcohol products at both on-and off-licence premises and ban alcohol promotions on state property, including public transport? 4. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> the provision of $ 2 million over four years to support domestic violence services and alcohol and other drug services to develop shared models of care? 5. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> the provision of $ 1 million over four years to develop and implement a state-wide Queensland Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Action Plan? 6. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> the provision of $ 2 million over four years to fund a brief intervention program for alcohol in primary care and emergency department settings to support health professionals to talk to consumers about their alcohol consumption? 7. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> the provision of $ 4 million over four years to develop and fund an ongoing public education campaign on the negative health impacts from alcohol consumption and ways to avoid these risks? 8. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> the introduction of a policy that excludes alcohol industry involvement in policy development, in line with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation, and a ban on donations to Queensland political parties from the alcohol industry and their representatives? 9. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> the collection and public reporting of alcohol harms and compliance data, including police data on alcohol-related violence, to inform the development of alcohol policy and the evaluation of programs and services? 10. Will <b>your</b> Party <b>support</b> a comprehensive, independent evaluation of the Safe Night Out Strategy incorporating adequate consultation with people who have expertise in public health? Responses were received from four of six parties; the LNP, Labor, KAP and the Greens.
