6000|$|... 'Now look,' {{said her}} Daddy. 'S'pose <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> {{scratched}} {{by the side}} of a pool in the beaver-swamp?' And he drew this. (8.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> man day by day, {{sat with}} him night by night over your damned sack, and knew him not? Oddswounds, man, where were your eyes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{bring me}} a horn of ale quickly, for the Kings will {{be here in a}} [...] minute. Now I can listen. Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> morning? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I s'pose you {{remember}} that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me <b>this</b> afternoon, an' somebody told you that I was goin' to join the circus, didn't they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Douglas," [...] he explained, [...] "this is Miss Elizabeth Dalstan, whom <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> act <b>this</b> evening. We {{were married}} this afternoon. You can understand, can't you, just what your coming has meant for us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] {{said the}} attorney. [...] "Then tell me, Mr. Throgton, if <b>you</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> blue {{envelope}} before?" [...] He held {{up in his}} hand a long blue envelope.|$|R
6000|$|He {{spoke with}} such an air of {{finality}} that the officer looked at him suspiciously. [...] "I thought you said none of <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> happen," [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been fond of {{you ever}} since we came {{to live in this}} place," [...] he continued. [...] "You were a child when I came; and you used to like me, Fanny, until three or four days ago: until <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> gentleman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, by George!" [...] said Charnock. [...] "We owe him and Helen much, {{and the job}} is {{obviously}} mine--by joining Festing I give Wilkinson the lie. You're clever, and I expect <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this.</b> Anyhow, I'll start; but Festing's an obstinate fellow. Suppose he won't come back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder now," [...] he said, as {{they were}} sauntering on the poop, [...] "if <b>you</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> fellow Blood, who was at one time on your uncle's {{plantations}} as a slave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} Littlepage gal; if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> {{them out}} <b>this</b> morning in the carriage, <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> two York gals and parson Warren's da'ghter with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Florian, do {{you give}} me your most solemn {{assurance}} that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> nothing of <b>this</b> evil work while it was being perpetrated?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then my wish is, {{that you}} should forget these odious notions which you have imbibed, {{that you should}} dress and act as you used to do, before ever <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> woman, and that, in future, you confine your {{intercourse}} with her to such civilities as are necessary between neighbors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] Thorn agreed. [...] "But the {{important}} thing is <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> and didn't lose your nerve. Anyhow, if you had lost it, I couldn't have blamed you; I blame myself for my confounded thoughtlessness that let you run the risk. In fact, I'm dreadfully sorry and don't mind owning that I got a fright." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} about that," [...] Williams assented, [...] "but this time, Tallente, there's {{something}} in it. The Chief quarrelled with you {{for the sake of}} the old gang. Well, he made a bloomer. The old gang aren't worth six-pence. They're rather a hindrance than help to legislation, and when they're wanted they're wobbly, as <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> afternoon. Lethbridge went into the lobby with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} me a very wicked girl?" [...] she asked, coloring. [...] "You once thought me inconsistent, I believe, but I am not that. Have I done wrong in leading the Celebrity {{to the point}} where <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>this</b> morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{paint on}} this shoe," [...] he said vehemently. [...] "I {{tell you there}} was a splash of red paint across the toe. This man here will bear me out in <b>this.</b> <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> paint on <b>this</b> shoe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah how {{you hate}} them!" [...] she wailed again. [...] "I saw that when I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning. The whole place reeked of your aversion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'M. le Baron {{shall not}} have the opportunity,' said the Chevalier. 'He may abide by his decision, and what the younger one may tell him. Fear not, good man, it shall be made good to you, if you obey my commands. I have other work for you. But first repeat to me more fully {{what you told me}} before. Where was it that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> unhappy girl under the name of Esperance?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope I am as fond of {{my child}} as any mother, but I {{do not know}} that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and <b>you</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>this</b> morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin kicking about. I have not nerves for the sort of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dick,' she exclaimed, 'I am {{so glad to}} get a {{word with}} you; I am so happy, I have such a {{thousand}} things to say; and I {{want you to do}} me a favour. Imagine, he has come without a paint-box, without an easel; and I want him to have all. I want you to get them for me in Thymebury. <b>You</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>this</b> moment, how his heart turned to painting. They can't live without it,' she added; meaning perhaps Van Tromp and Michel Angelo.|$|E
6000|$|... "Any other boy!" [...] Tom thought, grating his teeth. [...] "Any boy in {{the whole}} town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day <b>you</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you out! I'll just take and--" ...|$|R
60|$|But by {{her still}} halting course and winding, woeful way, <b>you</b> plainly <b>saw</b> that <b>this</b> ship that so wept with spray, still {{remained}} without comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, {{because they were}} not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I never <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> like <b>this,</b> dear Alda,' said Wilmet, low and gently, but in decided repression. 'Come {{into our}} room, {{and let me}} try to understand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|KEITH. Good God! Why, I {{saw it in}} {{the paper}} this morning. They were talking of it in the Courts! [He snatches the evening paper from his armchair, and runs it over anal reads] Here it is again. [...] "Body of a man was found this morning under an archway in Glove Lane. From marks about the throat grave {{suspicion}} of foul play are entertained. The body had apparently been robbed." [...] My God! [Suddenly he turns] <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> in the paper and dreamed it. D'you understand, Larry?--you dreamed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{manage that}} ar; they 's young in the business, and must spect to work cheap," [...] said Marks, as he {{continued}} to read. [...] "Ther's three on 'em easy cases, 'cause all you've got to do is to shoot 'em, or swear they is shot; they couldn't, of course, charge much for that. Them other cases," [...] he said, folding the paper, [...] "will bear puttin' off a spell. So now let's come to the particulars. Now, Mr. Haley, <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> yer gal when she landed?" ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{told that}} down in Devonshire there are young ladies innumerable, who read crabbed manuscripts with the palms of their hands, and {{newspapers}} with their ankles, and so forth; and who are, so to speak, literary all over. I begin to understand what a blue-stocking means, and have not the smallest doubt that Lady ---- (for instance) could write quite as entertaining a book with the sole of her foot as ever she did with her head. I am a believer in earnest, and I am sure you would be if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> boy, under moderately favourable circumstances, as I hope you will, before he leaves England.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are those fellows I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> with <b>this</b> {{morning at}} the Milan in it? If so I am going to take Miss Parker away. There are limits--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I pray you to rest, fair sir," [...] said Aylward anxiously. [...] "The King's own leech <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning, and he {{said that}} if the bandage was torn from your head you would surely die." ...|$|R
6000|$|How he wept and stormed! 'Oh, {{light of}} my eyes,' he sobbed; 'I am indeed punished for my pride. I thought no one {{good enough to}} be your husband, and now you are lost {{in the depths of the}} sea, and have left me alone! As for all of <b>you</b> who <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> thing--away with <b>you!</b> Let them be put in irons and lock them up in prison, whilst I think how I can best put them to death!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, Li Wan," [...] he spoke decisively; [...] "you {{were a little}} bird in some life before, a little moose-bird, when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> thing, {{and the memory of}} it is with you yet. It is not strange. I was once a moose, and my father's father {{afterward}} became a bear--so said the shaman, and the shaman cannot lie. Thus, on the Trail of the Gods we pass from life to life, and the gods know only and understand. Dreams and the shadows of dreams be memories, nothing more, and the dog, whining asleep in the sun-warmth, doubtless sees and remembers things gone before. Bash, there, was a warrior once. I do firmly believe he was once a warrior." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{it is true}} that {{he threw}} the {{decanter}} at me. I heard him call my mistress a name, and I told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there. Then it was that he threw it at me. He might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone. He was forever ill-treating her, and she too proud to complain. She will not even tell me all that he has done to her. She never told me of those marks on her arm that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> morning, but I know very well that they come from a stab with a hatpin. The sly devil--God forgive me that I should speak of him so, now that he is dead! But a devil he was, if ever one walked the earth. He was all honey when first we met him--only eighteen months ago, and we both feel as if it were eighteen years. She had only just arrived in London. Yes, it was her first voyage--she had never been from home before. He won her with his title and his money and his false London ways. If she made a mistake she has paid for it, if ever a woman did. What month did we meet him? Well, I tell you it was just after we arrived. We arrived in June, and it was July. They were married in January of last year. Yes, she is down in the morning-room again, and I have no doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too much of her, for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> country. I {{think the}} scenery would delight you. At least it often brings to my {{recollection}} your glowing descriptions of your native country. To me {{it has in}} a great measure the charm of novelty. Of the Scottish hills, though born among them, as I have always been assured, I have but an indistinct recollection. Indeed, my memory rather dwells upon the blank which my youthful mind experienced in gazing on the levels of the isle of Zealand, than on anything which preceded that feeling; but I am confident, from that sensation {{as well as from the}} recollections which preceded it, that hills and rocks have been familiar to me at an early period, and that, though now only remembered by contrast, and by the blank which I felt while gazing around for them in vain, they must have made an indelible impression on my infant imagination. I remember, when we first mounted that celebrated pass in the Mysore country, while most of the others felt only awe and astonishment at the height and grandeur of the scenery, I rather shared your feelings and those of Cameron, whose admiration of such wild rocks was blended with familiar love, derived from early association. Despite my Dutch education, a blue hill to me is as a friend, and a roaring torrent like the sound of a domestic song that hath soothed my infancy. I never felt the impulse so strongly as in this land of lakes and mountains, and nothing grieves me so much as that duty prevents your being with me in my numerous excursions among recesses. Some drawings I have attempted, but I succeed vilely. Dudley, on the contrary, draws delightfully, with that rapid touch which seems like magic; while I labour and botch, and make this too heavy and that too light, and produce at last a base caricature. I must stick to the flageolet, for music is the only one of the fine arts which deigns to acknowledge me.|$|E
60|$|Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, {{and some}} few {{splintered}} planks, {{of what had}} once been a whale-boat; but <b>you</b> now <b>saw</b> through <b>this</b> wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, after all, you weren't successful. You {{need not}} tell me {{anything}} about that--I knew {{it as soon as}} I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning. But I will ask you to answer one thing: Is the decision final?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur Reetchie, {{you are my}} friend, my intimate" [...] (he put an {{aspirate}} on the word). [...] "I go to {{tell you}} one leetle secret. I find that I can repose confidence in you. My father does not understan' me, <b>you</b> <b>saw,</b> Monsieur, he does not appreciate--that is the Engleesh. Mon Dieu, <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>this</b> night. I, who spik to you, am made for a courtier, a noble. I have the gift. La Louisiane--she is not so big enough for me." [...] He lowered his voice still further, and bent nearer to me. [...] "Monsieur, I run away to France. My cousin the Marquis will help me. You will hear of Auguste de St. Gre at Versailles, at Trianon, at Chantilly, and peut-etre--" ...|$|R
