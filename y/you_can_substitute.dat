60|$|In {{order to}} form a good style, the primary rule and {{condition}} is, not to attempt to express ourselves in language before we thoroughly know our own meaning;--when a man perfectly understands himself, appropriate diction will generally be at his command either in writing or speaking. In such cases the thoughts and the words are associated. In the next place preciseness {{in the use of}} terms is required, and the test is whether you can translate the phrase adequately into simpler terms, regard being had to the feeling of the whole passage. Try this upon Shakspeare, or Milton, and see if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>substitute</b> other simpler words in any given passage without a violation of the meaning or tone. The source of bad writing is the desire to be something more than a man of sense,--the straining to be thought a genius; and it is just the same in speech making. If men would only say {{what they have to say}} in plain terms, how much more eloquent they would be! Another rule is to avoid converting mere abstractions into persons. I believe you will very rarely find in any great writer before the Revolution the possessive case of an inanimate noun used in prose instead of the dependent case, as 'the watch's hand,' for 'the hand of the watch.' The possessive or Saxon genitive was confined to persons, or at least to animated subjects. And I cannot conclude this Lecture without insisting on the importance of accuracy of style as being near akin to veracity and truthful habits of mind; he who thinks loosely will write loosely, and, perhaps, there is some moral inconvenience in the common forms of our grammars which give children so many obscure terms for material distinctions. Let me also exhort you to careful examination of what you read, if it be worth any perusal at all; such examination will be a safeguard from fanaticism, the universal origin of which is in the contemplation of phenomena without investigation into their causes.|$|E
60|$|Remember {{that the}} aim of your {{discipline}} should be to produce a self-governing being; not to produce a being to be governed by others. Were your children fated to pass their lives as slaves, you could not too much accustom them to slavery during their childhood; but as they are by and by to be free men, {{with no one to}} control their daily conduct, you cannot too much accustom them to self-control while they are still under your eye. This it is which makes the system of discipline by natural consequences so especially appropriate to the social state which we in England have now reached. In feudal times, when one of the chief evils the citizen had to fear was the anger of his superiors, it was well that during childhood, parental vengeance should be a chief means of government. But now that the citizen has little to fear from any one--now that the good or evil which he experiences is mainly that which in the order of things results from his own conduct, he should from his first years begin to learn, experimentally, the good or evil consequences which naturally follow this or that conduct. Aim, therefore, to diminish the parental government, as fast as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>substitute</b> for it in your child's mind that self-government arising from a foresight of results. During infancy a considerable amount of absolutism is necessary. A three-year old urchin playing with an open razor, cannot be allowed to learn by this discipline of consequences; for the consequences may be too serious. But as intelligence increases, the number of peremptory interferences may be, and should be, diminished, with the view of gradually ending them as maturity is approached. All transitions are dangerous; and the most dangerous is the transition from the restraint of the family circle to the non-restraint of the world. Hence the importance of pursuing the policy we advocate; which, by cultivating a boy's faculty of self-restraint, by continually increasing the degree in which he is left to his self-restraint, and by so bringing him, step by step, to a state of unaided self-restraint, obliterates the ordinary sudden and hazardous change from externally-governed youth to internally-governed maturity. Let the history of your domestic rule typify, in little, the history of our political rule: at the outset, autocratic control, where control is really needful; by and by an incipient constitutionalism, in which the liberty of the subject gains some express recognition; successive extensions of this liberty of the subject; gradually ending in parental abdication.|$|E

5000|$|A {{good rule}} of thumb when in doubt of a given clue/answer is to apply the 'substitution test': Create a {{sentence}} featuring the clue word(s) and then see if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>substitute</b> the answer and leave the parsing and meaning {{of the rest of the}} sentence unchanged. If not, the answer is almost certainly incorrect. For example, if you are unsure of the clue/answer combination [...] "Approach, perhaps" [...] = HIT ON, you could try substituting in the sentence [...] "The shy man jealously watched the smooth talkers effortlessly APPROACH women at the party" [...] / [...] "The shy man jealously watched the smooth talkers effortlessly HIT ON women at the party." [...] Since the meaning of the sentence remains unchanged, this would be a valid clue/answer combination (although not necessarily the correct one in a given puzzle).|$|E

API isn't as spiffy looking, but it's {{a lot less}} magical now. Completely re-worked RGB handling. Each RGB space now has its own class, inheriting from BaseRGBColor. Consequently, RGBColor is no more. In most cases, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>substitute</b> RGBColor with sRGBColor during your upgrade. RGB {{channels}} are now [0 [...] 1] instead of [1 [...] 255]. Can use BaseRGBColor. get_upscaled_value_tuple() to get the upscaled values.

HSL no longer accepts observer, illuminant or rgb_type kwargs. HSV no longer accepts observer, illuminant or rgb_type kwargs. CMY no longer accepts observer, illuminant or rgb_type kwargs. CMYK no longer accepts observer, illuminant or rgb_type kwargs. Removed 'debug' kwargs in favor of Python's logging. Completely re-worked exception list. Eliminated some redundant exceptions, re-named basically everything else. Features Python 3. 3 support added. Added tox. ini with supported environments. Removed the old custom test runner in favor of nose. Replacing simplified RGB->XYZ conversions with Bruce Lindbloom's. A round of PEP 8 work.
