500|$|In a January 1996 murder case, the {{defendant}} counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, {{claimed that the}} pair listened to [...] "Israel's Son", from Frogstomp, which contributed {{to the murder of}} Bassett's parents and a younger brother. McDonald's lawyer cited the lyrics [...] "'Hate is what I feel for you/I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want you dead'" [...] which were [...] "almost a script. They're relevant to everything that happened". The band's manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence. Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to [...] "steal money and belongings and run off to California." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{scene in}} the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech seems {{to have come from}} two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur Ivan Boesky (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, [...] "Greed is all right, by the way. I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E

2500|$|Early in the 1990s, Groth {{took issue}} with Sim's stance of self-publishing as the best option for creators, and began to {{disseminate}} the view that {{it was best to}} work for a publisher, mentioning Ivan Boesky's address to the University of California's commencement ceremony in May 1986, where Boesky informed his audience that [...] "greed is all right, by the way.

Revelli.” [...] Revelli sat down and said, “I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> coach my band exactly the same way you coach your football team. We’ll have discipline, and we’ll do it the way it’s supposed to be done!” [...] Revelli added, [...] "Anything you need from me or the band, all you need to do is ask." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{he settled}} at his sister's home in Philadelphia. Numerous {{celebrations}} {{were held in}} honor of Robeson {{over the next several}} years, including at public arenas that had previously shunned him, but he saw few visitors aside from close friends and gave few statements apart from messages to support current civil rights and international movements, feeling that his record [...] "spoke for itself". At a Carnegie Hall tribute to mark his 75th birthday in 1973, he was unable to attend, but a taped message from him was played that said: [...] "Though I {{have not been able to}} be active for several years, I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am the same Paul, dedicated as ever to the worldwide cause of humanity for freedom, peace and brotherhood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sometime afterward, Bobby Kennedy {{obtained}} King's {{release from}} prison. Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I just want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was thinking about you and Dr. King.

2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have no problem}} {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
2500|$|De Gaulle {{hosted a}} superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms {{limitation}} talks and détente {{efforts in the}} wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: [...] "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan." [...] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, [...] "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's [...] "unconditional support" [...] of the United States during that [...] "crucial time". De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the Élysée Palace to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved {{in the wake of}} the U-2 incident.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the second}} round of talks, a day before Croitoru's nomination, Băsescu noted: [...] "Some parties have {{proposed}} Klaus Iohannis. I would like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not rejected the possibility for him to become Prime Minister in the condition that my options would be directed towards other [...] solutions. But I have rejected such a proposal because it comes from PSD or another party [...] ", referring to his alleged constraint to consider a proposal of the largest party (PDL), constraint disputed by the other parties. The opposition criticized the President for not designating Iohannis. Social Democrat leader Mircea Geoană accused Băsescu of trying to influence the upcoming presidential elections by having them organised by a sympathetic government. Crin Antonescu, the leader of the National Liberals, vowed his party would derail other nominations but Iohannis'. After the nomination of Croitoru, Antonescu, a candidate in the presidential election, stated that he would nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister if elected President. Three days later, on 18 October Geoană suggested Antonescu was trying to use Iohannis as an [...] "electoral agent" [...] for Antonescu's bid for president. In response, Antonescu told the press that Iohannis [...] "is not the type of person that would let himself being used". Geoană and PSD leadership has held a second meeting with Iohannis in Bucharest in the evening of 18 October. UDMR, which the previous day announced it would also attend, declared in the morning that all their leaders are not in the city. PNL was present at the meeting by lower level representatives, after Antonescu announced in the morning he is on campaign in Cluj-Napoca. On 21 October the Parliament adopted with 252 votes for (of PSD, PNL, UDMR and minorities groups) and 2 against a declaration requesting the President to nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister.|$|E
