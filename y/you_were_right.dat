25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
500|$|... "What a video!" [...] Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody enthused to Q. [...] "I {{have become}} obsessed with it {{and not just because}} I'm in love with Kimbra. Gotye himself is an {{engaging}} character for sure... his solemnly expressive eyes finish a journey his lyrics only begin. 'Told myself that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> for me but felt so lonely in your company' – simple, pure, and devastating. None more than the title line when it speaks of the end of love with prosaic brutality: 'Now you're just somebody that I used to know.' Great video, powerful lyrics, and a stunning voice. Oh, and Kimbra... my poor heart..." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Brown coached {{dozens of}} {{successful}} teams {{at the high}} school, college and professional levels, his controlling personality and sharp criticisms made him unpopular with many players. Brown was a methodical and disciplined coach who tolerated no deviation from his system. His professional teams' planes did not wait for players who were late; anyone who missed the flight was forced to find one {{on his own and}} pay a fine to Brown. When the Browns practiced twice in a day in training camp, each session was exactly 55 minutes. Regular practices during the season lasted an hour and 12 minutes. Players who made mistakes in games were held up for ridicule during film review sessions. [...] "There got to be a saying", longtime Browns safety Ken Konz said years later. [...] "'There's a right way, a wrong way and the Paul Brown way.' If you did it the Paul Brown way, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> He was a very strict coach, and he expected you to toe the line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I protest <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right!</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right!</b> {{it never}} struck me before--see {{what it is}} to have younger eyes--A mitre--a mitre--it {{corresponds}} in every respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> There <b>is</b> no {{such great}} coincidence, {{when all is}} said. The name {{reminded}} me of a--a folly of my youth. 'Twas that that made impression." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, my dear, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> there,' said Miss La Creevy, 'in {{the main}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> there; though I don't allow {{that it is}} of such very great {{importance}} in the present case. Ah! The difficulties of Art, my dear, are great.' ...|$|R
2500|$|DiFranco {{issued an}} apology on January 2, 2014 {{following}} continued criticism. [...] In it, she wrote [...] "..i {{would like to}} say i am sincerely sorry. it is obvious to me now that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> - all those who said we can't in good conscience go to that place and support it or look past for one moment what it deeply represents. i needed a wake up call and you gave it to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{partisan}} {{nature of}} Smith's broadcast {{may well have}} been the start of Nixon's rehabilitation and ascent towards the presidency, with former Governor of New York and presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey writing to Nixon on November 15, that [...] "It seems to me that Howard K. Smith has been quite helpful, unwittingly." [...] Noting that many people were outraged by the broadcast, Dewey {{went on to say that}} [...] "Smith has proved <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> in your comments about the press".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{last night}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> Whatever {{may have been}} your father's conduct, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> to defend it; and, bad as it has been, I was wrong to speak of it as it {{deserved}} before you. I will not do so again." ...|$|E
50|$|MY DEAR MR. KENT: By George! <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen," [...] {{says the}} landlord, [...] "I {{reckoned}} you-all would be inquiring this morning. You-all dropped {{off of the}} nine-thirty train here last night; and <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> tight. Yes, <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> smart in liquor. I can inform <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> now {{in the town of}} Mountain Valley, in the State of Georgia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Pip," [...] Joe assented, {{as if he}} {{had been}} contending for that, all along; [...] "and what I say to <b>you</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> Pip." ...|$|R
60|$|HE [catching {{her hands}} and looking earnestly at her] <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> You are like Candida.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR JACK:--Forgive me. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> Meet me corner Madison and [...] ----th at 8.30 this morning. We {{leave at}} noon. PENITENT.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's nothing. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>right,</b> Mr. Jeff! I {{ought not}} to have walked down here alone. I'm very, very tired, and--so--so miserable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I own it is foolish--suppose it is,' said Ethelberta wearily, {{and with}} a {{readiness}} of misgiving that showed how recent and hasty was the scheme. 'Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> mother; anything rather than retreat. I wonder if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right!</b> Well, I will think again of it to-night. Do not let us speak more about it now.' ...|$|R
60|$|MALISE. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> Your {{words and}} mine will never kiss each other.|$|R
5000|$|Subject: {{yielding}} I cannot remember for certain. Maybe <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> I'm not sure.|$|R
60|$|PRES. Prince, {{this is most}} {{valuable}} information. Michael, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> If it is not to-night {{it will be too}} late. Read that.|$|E
60|$|MORELL (deadly white, {{putting an}} iron {{constraint}} on himself). Nothing but this: that either <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> this morning, or Candida is mad.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, very {{possibly}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> At any rate, {{you have}} the consolation of knowing that it's too late to help it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> my dear," [...] {{said the}} old Squire wearily. [...] "I only hope that my time may come first. I have lived here all my life, seventy years and more, and I know that I could not live {{anywhere}} else. But God's will be done. And now, my dear, go to bed." ...|$|R
60|$|STRAMMFEST [yielding the receiver]. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Be</b> civil to him. I should choke [he sits down].|$|R
60|$|JULIA (exhausted, {{allowing}} {{herself to}} take it). <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> I <b>am</b> a worthless woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> Even so, don't {{you think}} you waste a lot of thundering on one poor scared little town? Kind of mean!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] {{answered}} Ragnar, [...] "and {{never did}} man walk that bridge in better fashion. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> Would that I had not mocked him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{authorized}} you to suspect {{any part of}} this rhapsody to be true--I have not said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> in a single particular." ...|$|E
60|$|JULIA (with {{theatrical}} pathos). <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> there. I <b>am</b> indeed {{alone in}} the world.|$|R
60|$|I believe <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> again; and I thank God for {{his strong}} head and heart.|$|R
60|$|CZAR. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> If {{he really}} loved the people, {{he could not}} be my son.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Gascoyne. [...] "Well, I think <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right,</b> {{and again}} I am much obliged to you. Will {{you take me}} to Mrs. Hatherly?" ...|$|E
60|$|LADY (quietly, {{taking down}} {{her hands and}} showing {{that she is not}} crying, but only thinking). No. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> But I am sorry for you.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{are we to}} do, John?" [...] {{asked his}} wife. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> in that our best chance lies in {{maintaining}} a neutral position.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think so?" [...] said Psmith diffidently. [...] "Well, well, perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> Did <b>you</b> {{notice the}} hired ruffian in the flannel suit who just passed? He wore a baffled look, I fancy. And hark! Wasn't that a muttered 'Failed!' I heard? Or {{was it the}} breeze moaning in the tree-tops? To-night is a cold, disappointing night for Hired Ruffians, Comrade Windsor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> my dear sir, I fear <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> The studding-sails <b>are</b> now in, and. I will haul {{up for the}} highlands, and anchor under them, {{should it}} be necessary. We can then give this fellow Vattel in large quantities, for I hardly think he will venture to seize us while we have an anchor fast to good American ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As it happens, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> But, Miss Holmes, I {{should like}} you to {{understand}} that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> also <b>right</b> when <b>you</b> said I {{did not look like}} a betting man." [...] And I told her some of the story of Van Koop and the £250.|$|R
