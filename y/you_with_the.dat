Thou and its associated forms have fallen into disuse and are considered archaic, though it is often used in recreations of archaic-sounding speech.|$|E

He wrote two further plays, After <b>You</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Milk and Malacca Linda, in which he revisited the colonial Malaya of his youth. At 2013 neither has been staged in the West End.|$|E

500|$|... "Love <b>You</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Truth" [...] is a orchestral rock song, and {{has been}} {{described}} as a softer version of the music of Skillet. [...] "This Is Now" [...] and [...] "Dream for You" [...] utilize a mix of electric and acoustic guitars, with the latter noted as having a [...] "bluesy" [...] sound. [...] "Follow Me", a ballad with folk influences, is sung by Megan Garrett. [...] "House of Their Dreams" [...] thematically revolves around a family that has pursued material interests at the expense of being together; musically, the song was compared to a softer version of the band's song [...] "American Dream". [...] "Waiting on the Night to Fall" [...] is a warning against Satan, urging listeners not to become complacent.|$|E
500|$|... "Here I Go Again" [...] {{relates the}} story of a Christian, who instead of [...] "sharing the gospel" [...] with a friend, engages in [...] "mindless conversation". The song {{encourages}} listeners to overcome their fear of spreading the gospel in the chorus. The album's final 4 songs are all worship songs, with folk instruments incorporated in several of them. [...] "Praise <b>You</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Dance", sung by the female members of the band, {{has been described as a}} country rock song. The song also incorporates a violin solo of [...] "Lord of the Dance". [...] "Glory", described as a worship song, has been noted as displaying the [...] "distinctive production touch" [...] of Chapman. The album closes with a cover of Darrell Evans' song [...] "Your Love Is Extravagant"; it features harmony vocals from the band.|$|E
500|$|Form and Fuller {{recognized}} the iconic {{status of the}} music used {{in the first four}} Friday the 13th films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky [...] he wanted him to create something that Nispel could [...] "whistle when [...] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, [...] "I don't believe that, when you watch a Friday the 13th film, you want to feel like John Williams is sitting next to <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> London Symphony Orchestra".|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called The Holy Bible [...] "Richey James' last will and testament", concluding: [...] "Every song has a passage frightening in its imagery. Although the music itself isn't as scarily intense, its tight, terse hard rock and glam hooks accentuate the paranoia behind the songs, making the lyrics cut deeper." [...] Upon its re-release ten years later, Dan Martin of NME described The Holy Bible as [...] "a work of genuine genius". Joe Tangari of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "In a way, {{the story of}} Edwards' spiral into some unknown oblivion {{is tied to the}} experience of The Holy Bible, which in retrospect has become a sort of horror-show eulogy for a man who couldn't live with the world around him." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "even the pall of [...] absence can't cancel out the life-affirming force that hits <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> very first song".|$|E
500|$|Contrary to the lukewarm {{response}} to the pilot, [...] "Diversity Day" [...] earned positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode positive reviews, stating that: [...] "Think of the toss-off racism of the original, plopped into a PC-gone-wrong showcase that might be entitled The Accidental Bigot. As when the African-American diversity trainer introduces himself as Mr. Brown, and Scott assures him, 'I will not call you that.'" [...] Ricky Gervais, who was {{the lead in the}} British series, stated that, in comparison to the British version, [...] "It is as good. I love the fact that, apart from the first one, the scripts are all original. You've gone back to the blueprint of what the characters are and you've started from there, as opposed to copying anything." [...] Rolling Stone magazine named the scene wherein Michael shows the office his diversity video the third greatest Moment from The Office. The article particularly praised Michael's line: [...] "Abraham Lincoln once said, 'If you are a racist, I will attack <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> North.|$|E
500|$|Richard was nicknamed [...] "the Comet" [...] {{early in}} his career. When {{teammate}} Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard [...] "went in like a rocket" [...] {{as he approached the}} opposition goal, Richard was dubbed [...] "The Rocket" [...] by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the Montreal Star and Dink Carroll of the Montreal Gazette have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because [...] "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante declared {{it one of the most}} appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to [...] "the rocket's red glare" [...] referenced in [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Glenn Hall agreed: [...] "What I remember most about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying toward <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying." ...|$|E

500|$|Referring to {{the songs}} on the album, Jon Pareles of The New York Times said [...] "about half are worth the effort." [...] He {{observed}} that [...] "too often, [...] falls into American culture's Disney syndrome, idealizing childhood innocence above all." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying that while No Code [...] "cracks open their sound," [...] it [...] "becomes a collection of fragments that don't add up to much of anything, except {{a portrait of a}} musically disjointed band." [...] On the change in mood compared with the band’s previous releases, he said that [...] "the album leaves <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vaguely unsettling feeling that Pearl Jam without pain are like a pretzel without salt, or Seattle without rain." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called it [...] "a nice listen," [...] but stated that [...] "there's a ton of filler here. In fact, it's almost all filler." [...] Time reviewer Christopher John Farley said that the album [...] "makes it sound as if they're having a midlife crisis." [...] Farley added that [...] "too few of {{the songs on}} the Pearl Jam CD explore the musical possibilities they suggest in any kind of definitive or provocative manner." ...|$|E
500|$|The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998, {{three years}} after the release of the {{biography}} by Roger Lewis, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. [...] In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's [...] "life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong idea of her former husband, saying [...] "the film leaves <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers [...] "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the one thing you could never say about Peter." ...|$|E
