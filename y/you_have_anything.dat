500|$|The New York Times {{credited}} {{the series}} for its bold premise {{and noted that}} the show provided some insight into eating disorders while offering [...] "a few flashes of clever dialogue and satire." [...] Ultimately, however, the Times found that [...] "Starved relies too heavily on sight gags and gross-out farce." [...] The Los Angeles Times found the show [...] "vexing" [...] for being [...] "at once assured and shallow, accomplished and unconvincing, well-acted and empty." [...] The review singles out Schaeffer's character Sam as [...] "especially unappealing" [...] and points to Schaeffer's roles as creator, producer, writer and director as [...] "an object lesson in the wisdom {{of a system of}} checks and balances." [...] Perhaps most damningly, in noting Schaeffer's experiences with addiction, the reviewer writes that [...] "just because you’ve had an experience doesn’t mean <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> interesting to say about it or are able to articulate whatever interesting thing you have to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{small group}} of IRA members {{and members of the}} Citizens' Defence Committee took up {{positions}} in the church grounds and in adjoining streets. The IRA members were armed with M1 carbines and were led by Billy McKee, commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Also present was Billy Kelly, commander of the Belfast Brigade's 3rd Battalion. The IRA members fired at the loyalists, some of whom were positioned on the roofs opposite. Jim Magee, a local loyalist, said he saw wounded people lying on the road and asked the police (RUC) for help. According to Magee, [...] " [...] said 'if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything,</b> get it out and protect your people'. So we got an old rifle and went into Frazer Street and started firing back".|$|E
2500|$|In {{writing the}} episode, Roberts aimed {{to make the}} episode a [...] "big, fun, all-star murder mystery romp". He was {{influenced}} by advice given by Davies, who wanted Roberts to [...] "go funnier" [...] with every draft, and former Doctor Who script editor Douglas Adams' advice that [...] "a danger one runs is that the moment <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> in the script that's clearly meant to be funny in some way, everybody thinks 'oh well we can do silly voices and silly walks and so on', and I think that's exactly {{the wrong way to}} do it". Using this advice, he used the adage that in comedy, the characters do not realise the humour, and cited Basil Fawlty's mishaps in Fawlty Towers as an example.|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, 2013, Christie {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that Democrats were just playing {{politics}} by holding hearings into lane closures. [...] "Just because [...] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [...] Loretta Weinberg, it just shows that they really have nothing to do," [...] Christie said. Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved. When reporter Matt Katz asked, [...] "Governor, did <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do with these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge? Have you spoken to--" [...] Christie dismissively joked [...] "I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat. You really are not serious with that question." ...|$|E
2500|$|FBI agents twice {{visited the}} Paine home in early November, when Oswald was not present, {{and spoke to}} Mrs. Paine. Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about 2 to 3 weeks before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent James P. Hosty. When {{he was told that}} Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, {{according}} to the receptionist, read: [...] "Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife" [...] "Lee Harvey Oswald." [...] The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to [...] "blow up the FBI" [...] or merely [...] "report this to higher authorities". According to Hosty, the note said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities." [...] Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Lü Yi's {{abuses of}} power {{finally came to}} an end in 238 when Sun Quan learnt the truth about him and {{understood}} the gravity of the situation. Lü Yi was removed from office and imprisoned under the watch of the Ministry of Justice. Sun Quan then put Gu Yong in charge of investigating Lü Yi's crimes. While interrogating Lü Yi, Gu Yong maintained his composure and performed his job professionally. Before Lü Yi was escorted out, Gu Yong asked him, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> else to say?" [...] Lü Yi kowtowed and remained silent. When another official Huai Xu (懷叙) started scolding Lü Yi, Gu Yong sternly rebuked him, [...] "As government officials, we should follow the laws. Why must you do this?" [...] Some officials proposed that Lü Yi be executed by burning or dismemberment – so as to highlight the severity of his crimes – instead of beheading. When Sun Quan sought Kan Ze's opinion on this, the latter replied that burning and dismemberment should be not be used as means of execution in a civilised age. Sun Quan heeded his advice and probably had Lü Yi executed by beheading.|$|E

6000|$|... "As I {{told you}} before," [...] he said, [...] "no further {{conversation}} on the subject can be of avail. It does not suit me to be cross-examined as to what I knew or what I did not know. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> for me to hear, you can say it.
