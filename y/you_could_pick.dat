Campbell was the seventh son of 12 children. The family lived on a farm where they barely got by growing cotton, corn, watermelons and potatoes. [...] "We had no electricity," [...] he said, and money was scarce. [...] "A dollar in those days looked {{as big as a}} saddle blanket."

Sunny and Bobby were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a black metal band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track [...] "Deadly Sinners" [...] from the band's second release Advance and Vanquish appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and even three video games (Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Saints Row 2, and Brütal Legend), creating a huge press hype for the band that caused their popularity to skyrocket, with a slot on 2005's Road Rage tour in August (with bands like Machine Head and Chimaira) gaining them many new fans.|$|E

He had the mark of those dark and passionate Westland Scotch, who before Burns and after have given many such dark eyes and dark emotions to the world. But in him the unmistakable strain, Gaelic or whatever it is, was accentuated almost to oddity; and he looked like some swarthy elf. He was small, with a big head and a crescent of coal-black hair round {{the back of a}} vast dome of baldness. Immediately under his eyes his cheekbones had so high a colour that they might have been painted scarlet; three black tufts, two on the upper lip and one under the lower, seemed to touch up the face with the fierce moustaches of Mephistopheles. His eyes had that [...] "dancing madness" [...] in them which Stevenson saw in the Gaelic eyes of Alan Breck; but he sometimes distorted the expression by screwing a monstrous monocle into one of them. A man more unmistakable would have been hard to find. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> have <b>picked</b> him out in any crowd&mdash;so long as you had not seen his photograph.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel framework for training models to recognise simple spatial-motion events, {{such as those}} described by the verbs pick up, put down, push, pull, drop, tip, and tap and classifying novel observations into previously trained classes. Simple colour- and motionbased segmentation and tracking techniques are used to produce a time series of feature vectors constructed from the 2 D object positions, orientations, shapes, and sizes. Hidden Markov models are trained on this time series data and used to classify novel occurrences into previously trained classes. The particular choice of features used allows the system to construct meaningful semantic representations of the event classes that it has learned.

The spectator found now himself and now the scene incredible, and indeed they were hardly conceivable in relation to each other. A melancholy sense of the absurdity, of the incongruity, of the whole absorbed at last even {{a sense of the}} indecency. The audience was much the same in appearance as other audiences, witnessing like displays at the other theatres, and did not differ greatly from the usual theatrical house. Not so much fashion smiled upon the efforts of these young ladies, as upon the cancan of the Signorina Morlacchi a winter earlier; but there was a most fair appearance of honest-looking, handsomely dressed men and women; and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> out, all over the parquet, faces of one descent from the deaconship, which you wondered were not afraid to behold one another there. The truth is, we spectators, like the performers themselves, lacked that tradition of error, of transgression, which casts its romance about the people of a lighter race. We had not yet set off one corner of the Common for a Jardin Mabille; we had not even the concert-cellars of the gay and elegant New Yorker; and nothing, really, had happened in Boston to educate us to this new taste in theatricals, since the fair Quakers felt moved to testify in the streets and churches against our spiritual nakedness. Yet it was to be noted with regret that our innocence, our respectability, had no restraining influence upon the performance; and the fatuity of the hope cherished by some courageous people, that the presence of virtuous persons would reform the stage, was but too painfully evident. The doubt whether they were not nearer right who have denounced the theatre as essentially and incorrigibly bad would force itself upon the mind, though there was a little comfort in the thought that, if virtue had been actually allowed to frown upon these burlesques, the burlesques might have been abashed into propriety. The caressing arm of the law was cast very tenderly about the performers, and in the only case where a spectator presumed to hiss,--it was at a pas seul of the indescribable,--a policeman descended upon him, and with the succor of two friends of the free ballet, rent him from his place, and triumphed forth with him. Here was an end of ungenial criticism; we all applauded zealously after that.|$|E
