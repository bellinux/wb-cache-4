From 1909 to final publication in 1917, she painstakingly collected and edited a book of Stoddard's poetry, writing a foreword and joining her short memorial poem [...] "At Anchor" [...] to verse submitted by Stoddard's friends Joaquin Miller, George Sterling and Thomas Walsh. At the age of 80, McCracken wrote to Coolbrith to complain to her dear friend of still having {{to work for a}} living: [...] "The world has not used us well, Ina; California has been ungrateful to us. Of all the hundred thousands the state pays out in pensions of one kind and another, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be {{at the head of the}} pensioners, and I somewhere down below?" ...|$|E
2500|$|February {{continued}} the pace. She {{began a series}} before the new Chicago Culture Club at the Church of the Epiphany (Chicago), and {{less than a week}} later gave a talk on Hamlet, and then another for a benefit dinner. Just a few days later she gave a talk for the Menoken Club. She ended the Arché club series with a talk on [...] "Degas, Raffaelli, and their theories". There was an individual talk on March 10 on The Tempest, followed by a [...] "salon day" [...] for the Arché club. Then she announced another series of lectures and {{continued the}} individual talks. The first series of talks during some recitals at individual's homes on Bethoven, Wagner, and Schumann each a week apart in what is now the Prairie Avenue District. Meanwhile, she gave a talk on [...] "Shakespeare's women" [...] at the new YWCA in what is now the Historic Michigan Boulevard District, Then she lectured on the subject of [...] "American Colonists". A week later she was talking for the Arché club. The last few days of March she addressed and reviewed Chicago artists, in which she was quoted extensively for in a column in The Inter Ocean newspaper of Chicago. Papers also noted that by April the talks had outgrown the space of rooms in churches. Nevertheless, benefits were still held in churches, such as for the YWCA with a talk about John Ruskin, also a Spiritualist. Another publicized talk at a home was on [...] "French Women of the Salon". She made a trip outside Chicago to Sterling, IL for a talk the next day. But she was back in time to give a talk in a week, and in a few days was giving a new talk entitled [...] "Nibelungen Lied(sic)". In May she gave two lectures. A repeat of one of the recitals comes in early June, held at the Hotel Windermere (Chicago). In a new turn of events, Ford challenged the Inter Ocean art critic on the virtues of impressionism - the critic opens with a line from Ford's letter to her [...] "After having told the world what you see in Manet's pictures, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do the graceful thing and tell what the artist sees?". Together they reviewed an exhibition, out of which the critic concedes [...] "… and truth to tell (Manet's defender) took home the palm." ...|$|E

Yes, you have been foolish;--amusing yourself in a thoughtless way, you know, and, perhaps, a little piqued because a certain lady {{was not to be}} won so easily as your Royal Highness wished. Well, now, all that must be settled, you know, as quickly as possible.

At Pearl Jam's July 18, 2006 concert in San Francisco at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, Vedder said regarding McCready's lead guitar work, [...] "In the studio he played that part on that record...he played {{it with a}} Zippo lighter...an old Zippo lighter.

6000|$|The idea of Hetty {{had just}} crossed Mr. Irwine's mind {{as he looked}} inquiringly at Arthur, but his disclaiming {{indifferent}} answer confirmed the thought which had quickly followed--that there could be nothing serious in that direction. There was no probability that Arthur ever saw her except at church, and at her own home under the eye of Mrs. Poyser; and the hint he had given Arthur about her the other day had no more serious meaning than {{to prevent him from}} noticing her so as to rouse the little chit's vanity, and in this way perturb the rustic drama of her life. Arthur would soon join his regiment, and be far away: no, there could be no danger in that quarter, even if Arthur's character had not been a strong security against it. His honest, patronizing pride in the good-will and respect of everybody about him was a safeguard even against foolish romance, still more against a lower kind of folly. If there had been anything special on Arthur's mind in the previous conversation, it was clear he was not inclined to enter into details, and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to imply even a friendly curiosity. He perceived a change of subject would be welcome, and said, [...] "By the way, Arthur, at your colonel's birthday fete there were some transparencies that made a great effect in honour of Britannia, and Pitt, and the Loamshire Militia, and, above all, the 'generous youth,' the hero of the day.

In response, Whitaker cheered Ulliott on by cheering [...] "Go on the Devilfish." [...] The nickname was thought up by Stephen Au-Yeung early 1997, who ran a poker game that Ulliott had frequented in Birmingham UK, who later sold him the website DevilFishPoker.com in 2005; a devilfish (or fugu) is a poisonous fish that can kill when ingested, if not properly prepared. Ulliott reduced Nguyen's stack to one chip, and the tournament director insisted upon still taking a one-hour scheduled break, over Nguyen's protests. Ulliott turned to Nguyen and said, [...] "We’re taking the break, and in all fairness to <b>you,</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> go upstairs and <b>think</b> about your tactics." [...] Ulliott went on to win, and the headlines the next day read, Devilfish devours the Master.

Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be less curious than Pandora? If you were left alone with the box, might you not feel a little tempted to lift the lid? But you would not do it. Oh, fie! No, no! Only, if you thought there were toys in it, it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep! I know not whether Pandora expected any toys; for none had yet begun to be made, probably, in those days, when the world itself was one great plaything for the children that dwelt upon it. But Pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box; and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls, here around me, would have felt.
