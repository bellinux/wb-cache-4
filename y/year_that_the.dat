5|$|Until a 2011 reevaluation of {{the species}} by Phil R. Bell, S. angustoristris was not well-described. No autapomorphies, unique derived traits, had been {{established}} distinguishing it from S. osborni. Bell found in a publication earlier in the <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two previous studies of S. angustirostris, by Rozhdestvensky in 1952, and Maryanska and Osmolska in 1981, do not provide a comprehensive enough description to compare the species with S. osborni.|$|E
5|$|A new Commissioner's Trophy {{is created}} each year, {{much like the}} Lombardi Trophy and the O'Brien Trophy. In contrast, hockey's Stanley Cup is passed from {{champion}} to champion. Before 1997, the trophy was presented in the winners locker room. Since then the presentation occurs on the field if the champion clinches the title in their home stadium. Since its inception, the only <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Commissioner's Trophy has not been awarded was 1994, when the players' strike ended the season on August 11, resulting in the cancellation of the entire post-season. The New York Yankees have won the most Commissioner's Trophies, winning seven World Series since 1967. The St. Louis Cardinals have won four trophies, a National League record.|$|E

While studying Politics, Philosophy, and Economics at Oxford, he commuted to Italy to play professional basketball for Olimpia Milano during the 1965–66 season, where the team won a European Champions Cup (predecessor to the modern EuroLeague).|$|E
5|$|In 1821, the <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> War of Independence broke out, nine issues {{appeared}} between January and May. There is {{a special}} appendix {{to the issue of}} April 1, 1821, containing a Greek translation of an article dated March 29, taken from the Wiener Zeitung, which reports on the uprising of Alexandros Ypsilantis and Tudor Vladimirescu in the Danubian Principalities, that {{marked the beginning of the}} Greek War of Independence, and also states the official Austrian standpoint. In the issue of May 1, while Ypsilantis’ campaign was in full swing, the Austrian authorities required the editors to publish the excommunication issued by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Gregory V, against the architects of this uprising. This was the last issue of Hermes o Logios which then was closed down by the local authorities and Kokkinakis was arrested as a member of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, {{following}} the abdication of Amadeus, Duke of Aosta, as King (1870–1873) and with Spain's change from Kingdom to Republic, the Spanish government issued a new colonial flag for Puerto Rico.

Spain's flag once more flew over Puerto Rico with {{the restoration of the}} Spanish kingdom in 1873, until 1898 the <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> island became a possession of the United States {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris (1898) in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, {{the year}} that Jacob Rogers died and the same <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed through the merger of eight other {{locomotive}} manufacturers, the company reopened as the Rogers Locomotive Works. Reuben Wells was again the shop superintendent. But Rogers was at a competitive disadvantage. Not enough capital investment was made to purchase new equipment or in research and development. ALCO and Baldwin, the two companies that were {{at the time the}} largest locomotive manufacturers in North America, held too much of a lead in manufacturing and selling their own locomotives for Rogers to keep up. Compounding Rogers' troubles was the greater city of Paterson that had grown up around the shop. There was not any room for Rogers to expand.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference had an automatic bid to the Gator Bowl.

This was the final <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gator Bowl had first pick of eligible ACC teams, as contract renegotiations later resulted in the Gator Bowl slipping to the third selection, beginning with the 2006 {{college football}} season. Virginia Tech, losers of the 2005 ACC Championship Game, were chosen by the Gator Bowl Association to participate as the ACC's representative to the 2006 Gator Bowl.|$|E

5|$|The biggest festival yet {{was held}} in 1990; however, {{the day after the}} festival ended, {{violence}} – between the security guards and new age travellers (the so-called Battle of Yeoman's Bridge) – led to the organisers taking 1991 and 1996 off to rethink the festival. An expanded festival returned in 1992, and this proved a great success. 1992 was the first <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new age travellers were not initially allowed onto the site free, and a sturdier fence was designed. This success was carried through to 1993 which, like 1992, was hot and dry.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of Ellandun {{went beyond the}} immediate loss of Mercian power in the southeast. According to the Chronicle, the East Anglians asked for Ecgberht's protection against the Mercians in the same year, 825, though it may actually {{have been in the}} following <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> request was made. In 826 Beornwulf invaded East Anglia, presumably to recover his overlordship. He was slain, however, as was his successor, Ludeca, who invaded East Anglia in 827, evidently for the same reason. It may be that the Mercians were hoping for support from Kent: there was some reason to suppose that Wulfred, the Archbishop of Canterbury, might be discontented with West Saxon rule, as Ecgberht had terminated Wulfred's currency and had begun to mint his own, at Rochester and Canterbury, and it is known that Ecgberht seized property belonging to Canterbury. The outcome in East Anglia was a disaster for the Mercians which confirmed West Saxon power in the southeast.|$|E
