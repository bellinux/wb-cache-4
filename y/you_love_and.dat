In November, 1583, from his castle Arensberg in Westphalia, he wrote to Francis Walsingham, adviser and spymaster to Queen Elizabeth: [...] "Our needs are pressing, and you [...] and the Queen's other virtuous counsellors we believe can aid us; moreover, since God has called us to a knowledge of Himself, we have heard from our counsellors that <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> further the service of God." ...|$|E

He said that the episode was about love, and the choices that result from that, {{and that it was}} an extraordinary story about losing someone <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> having that person restored to you some time afterward. Following the death of Jadzia in the [...] finale, [...] "Tears of the Prophets", Farrell suggested that the symbiont could be moved to a male character resulting in a similar situation as [...] "Rejoined" [...] between the new Dax host and Worf, as the two were in a relationship at that point. Instead, the symbiont was placed in a new female host called Ezri, as the producers did not want Kira Nerys to be the only female main character.

500|$|According to IGN's {{review of}} the DVD release in 2004, [...] "After movies like Se7en, it may not pack the same subtle horror for today's audiences it did {{when it was first}} released, but it's still a great film." [...] IGN's review of Jacob's Ladders 2010 Blu-ray release called it is [...] "an emotionally poignant, creepy horror masterpiece." [...] According to Slant Magazine, Jacob's Ladder is [...] "a bizarrely {{cohesive}} hybrid of war movie, character study, art film, and horror flick" [...] and [...] "the very act of watching the film is so emotionally draining that the viewer leaves the film feeling worked-in; the thought of repeat viewings is daunting yet insatiable." [...] DVD Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2013-06-28}} In 2011, John Kenneth Muir called the film's nightmarish hospital scene [...] "one of the most terrifying moments in all of 1990s horror cinema." [...] Muir further wrote: [...] "In its musings about death, about the end we all fear, Jacob's Ladder proves a deeply affecting and meaningful motion picture. After a screening, you'll immediately want to hug the people <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> then go outside and breathe the fresh air, or otherwise affirm your very existence." ...|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E

Miriam asks if she enjoyed being hit, adding that she doesn't know any more if she enjoyed what happened to her.

2500|$|Lady Zhen bore Cao Pi {{a son and}} a daughter. Their son, Cao Rui, {{later became}} the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. Their daughter, whose {{personal}} name was not recorded in history, was referred to as [...] "Princess Dongxiang" [...] (東鄉公主; literally [...] "Princess of the East District") in historical records. Lady Zhen remained humble even though Cao Pi deeply fancied her. She provided encouragement to Cao Pi's other wives who were also adored by him, and comforted those whom he less favoured. She also often urged Cao Pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants, citing the example of the mythical Yellow Emperor. Cao Pi was very pleased. Once, Cao Pi wanted to send Lady Ren (任氏), one of his concubines who fell out favour with him, back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her. When Lady Zhen heard about it, she told her husband, [...] "Lady Ren comes from a reputable clan. I can't match her in terms of moral character and looks. Why do you want to send her away?" [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "She is unruly, impulsive and disobedient. She has made me angry many times before. I'm sending her away." [...] Lady Zhen wept and pleaded with her husband, [...] "Everyone knows that <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> adore me, and they'll think that you're sending Lady Ren away because of me. I fear that I'll be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me. Please consider your decision again carefully." [...] Cao Pi ignored her and sent Lady Ren away.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{pressure}} of matching [...] "Call Me Maybe"'s success, Jepsen recorded an entire indie-folk album during her run on Cinderella {{as an act of}} [...] "rebellion". The effort was scrapped as Jepsen felt like it was developed for the wrong reasons: [...] "I think there is a natural rebellion when you have success in one area to completely rebel against that. I needed to get that out of my system, I think. I made really weird music." [...] Her work on the musical provided valuable perspective in terms of being defined by a singular song, particularly from her costar Fran Drescher: [...] "Everyone still calls her 'the Nanny'. I realized you can't give in to other people's perception of you. Everyone's gonna be known for something."" [...] had to not be about trying to prove something. I feel like if you're writing music just to have a different identity in the public's eye, it's sort of the wrong motive. It's gotta be coming from a place of what <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> what you're passionate about."Jepsen sketched many of the album's demos on her tour bus while supporting Kiss, completing three by June 2013. Of these, [...] "Boy Problems" [...] would eventually finalize its form with Sia and Greg Kurstin. [...] "I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance" [...] existed as early as 2011 according to matching lyrics on a tweet authored by Jepsen. It would eventually be presented to Max Martin after the pair finished work on [...] "Tonight I'm Getting Over You" [...] in 2012; intending to cease their session at midnight, the song compelled Martin to stay for two extra hours. It was confirmed that she had worked with Josh Ramsay, Ryan Stewart, Benny Blanco and Stargate, though none of these producers appeared on the finalized project.|$|E
2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she did know that the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will get you on the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E
