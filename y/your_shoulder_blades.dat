When the rain {{stopped and the}} sun shone, {{it was like a}} hothouse, seething, humid, sultry, breathless, and you had a strange feeling that everything was growing with a savage violence. The natives, blithe and childlike by reputation, seemed then, with their tattooing and their dyed hair, to have something sinister in their appearance; and when they pattered along at your heels with their naked feet you looked back instinctively. You felt they might at any moment come behind you swiftly and thrust a long knife between <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades.</b> You could not tell what dark thoughts lurked behind their wide-set eyes. They had a little the look of ancient Egyptians painted on a temple wall, and there was about them the terror of what is immeasurably old.|$|E
5000|$|The Sit-Up: [...] "The sit-up event {{measures}} the endurance of the abdominal and hip-flexor muscles. On the command [...] "get set," [...] assume {{the starting position}} by lying {{on your back with}} your knees bent at a 45- degree angle. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. Another person will hold your ankles with the hands only. No other method of bracing or holding the feet is authorized. The heel is the only part of your foot that must stay in contact with the ground. Your fingers must be interlocked behind your head and the backs of your hands must touch the ground. Your arms and elbows need not touch the ground. On the command [...] "go," [...] begin raising your upper body forward to, or beyond, the vertical position. The vertical position means that the base of your neck is above the base of your spine. After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position, lower your body until the bottom of <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades</b> touch the ground. Your head, hands, arms, or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed. A repetition will not count if you fail to reach the vertical position, fail to keep your fingers interlocked behind your head, arch or bow your back and raise your buttocks off the ground to raise your upper body, or let your knees exceed a 90-degree angle. If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number of your last correctly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in the down (starting) position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull or push yourself up to the up (resting) position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so, your performance in the event will be terminated. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.".|$|E

25|$|The Roman {{physician}} Caelius Aurelianus (5th century) used pala {{to refer}} to the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> The name pala is normally used {{to refer to}} a spade in Latin and was therefore probably used by Caelius Aurelianus to describe the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> as both exhibit a flat curvature.|$|R
2500|$|After the Middle Ages, {{the name}} scapula for <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> became dominant. The word scapula can {{etymologically}} {{be explained by}} its relatedness to ancient Greek verb σκάπτειν, to dig. This relatedness give rise to several possible explanations. First, the noun σκάπετος, trench [...] derived from this verb, and the to scapula related noun σκαφη, similarly derived from the aforementioned verb, might connect scapula {{to the notion of}} (con)cavity. The name scapula might be related that due to existence of the spine of the scapula a concavity exist in the scapula. Otherwise, the designation scapulae is also seen as synonym of ancient Greek συνωμία, the space between the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blades,</b> that is obviously concave. Συνωμία consists of σύν, together with, and ὦμος, shoulder. Second, scapula, due to its relatedness to σκάπτειν might originally meant shovel. Similarly to the resemblance between the Latin pala (spade) and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade,</b> a resemblance might be felt between the shape of a shovel and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade.</b> Alternatively, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>blade</b> might be used originally for digging and shoveling.|$|R
