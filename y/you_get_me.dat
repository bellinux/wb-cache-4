500|$|According to Bill Lamb of About.com, {{the song}} [...] "crackle {{with the spirit}} and power {{of a woman who}} carries her {{sexuality}} and spirit with authority." [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] features Beyoncé as the female protagonist going out an evening; she is suitably dressed to make a lasting impression and get what she is looking for. She is determined to steam up any dance floor she steps onto and make sure that no one resists her call to [...] "get [...] bodied". The lyrics are constructed in the traditional verse-chorus form. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] begins with Beyoncé telling her birthdate [...] "9-4-8-1", followed by a group of male voices singing [...] "hey's" [...] and [...] "jump's" [...] for four bars; the first verse then begins. The verses are written like a list where she sings her missions before going to party. It is followed with the chorus and the hook, where Beyoncé sings: [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> bodied? I want to be myself tonight." [...] The second verse follows, the chorus repeats giving way to the bridge, and Beyoncé sings the chorus again, ending the song with [...] "hey!".|$|E
500|$|Fisher, Freeman, Gibson, and Candy {{were cast}} in non-musical {{supporting}} roles. The film is also notable {{for the number}} of cameo appearances by established celebrities and entertainment-industry figures, including Steve Lawrence as a booking agent, Twiggy as a [...] "chic lady" [...] in a Jaguar convertible whom Elwood propositions at a gas station, Steven Spielberg as the Cook County Assessor's clerk, John Landis as a state trooper in the mall chase, Paul Reubens (before Pee-wee Herman) as a waiter in the Chez Paul restaurant scene, Joe Walsh in a cameo as the first prisoner to jump up on a table in the final scene, and Chaka Khan as the soloist in the Triple Rock choir. Muppet performer Frank Oz plays a corrections officer, and in the scene where the brothers crash into Toys R Us, a Grover and Kermit the Frog toy can be spotted. Right before the brothers crash into the Toys R Us, a customer (played by stunt coordinator Gary McLarty) asks the cashier if they have a Miss Piggy doll, a Muppet character that is voiced by Oz. Singer/songwriter Stephen Bishop is a deputy sheriff who complains that Jake and Elwood broke his watch (a result of the car chase in the mall). Makeup artist Layne Britton is the old card player who asks Elwood, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> my Cheez Whiz, boy?" [...] The character portrayed by Cab Calloway is named Curtis as an homage to Curtis Salgado, a Portland, Oregon, blues musician who inspired Belushi while he was in Oregon filming Animal House.|$|E
500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not much money. You have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> 100 dollars and I'll make you a picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E

500|$|When bowling, Trumble {{made the}} most of his height, {{bringing}} the ball over the full extent of his right arm. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, Monty Noble, as [...] "sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird". He bowled off spinners with an impeccable length at medium pace and was able to swing the new ball. He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as Stanley Jackson, who said, [...] "You old devil. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> caught-and-bowled whenever you like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later." [...] He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day. In Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer [...] away five times out of six. Johnnie Moyes named him as an [...] "immortal of the art" [...] who succeeded by [...] "attacking the batsman's strength". W. G. Grace called him [...] "the best bowler Australia has sent us". While Trumble was able to score 1,183runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily. His long, [...] fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine slips fieldsman and {{he was the first to}} take 20catches in an Australian season. English cricketer Johnny Douglas said, [...] "Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field—his natural place would be up trees in the bush." [...] He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to [...] "snatch" [...] at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands.|$|E
