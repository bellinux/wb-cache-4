25|$|For Kangaroo Books (their logo looked amazingly {{like that}} of America's Pocket Books), McLoughlin painted a few {{paperback}} covers but primarily produced joke books. The publisher paid £18 each for these which included writing about 50 jokes, illustrating them, and producing the cover. After doing the first joke book, probably Laughter for the Home Front, solo, McLoughlin enlisted the aid of his brother Colin (b. 2 November 1925) with the writing chore. Thus began a working relationship between the McLoughlin brothers that would last at least into the 1950s and that produced New Laughs for All, Laugh While <b>You</b> <b>Work,</b> You've Had It, and This Is It for Kangaroo.|$|E
