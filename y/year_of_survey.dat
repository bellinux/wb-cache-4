40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} for low birth weight (LBW) among live births by vaginal delivery and {{to determine if the}} disappearance of the association between LBW and socioeconomic factors was due to confounding by cesarean section. METHODS: Data were obtained from two population-based cohorts of singleton live births in Ribeirão Preto, Southeastern Brazil. The first one comprised 4, 698 newborns from June 1978 to May 1979 and the second included 1, 399 infants born from May to August 1994. The risks for LBW were tested in a logistic model, including the interaction of the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> and all independent variables under analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of LBW among vaginal deliveries increased from 7. 8 % in 1978 [...] 79 to 10 % in 1994. The risk was higher for: female or preterm infants; newborns of non-cohabiting mothers; newborns whose mothers had fewer prenatal visits or few years of education; first-born infants; and those who had smoking mothers. The interaction of the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> with gestational age indicated that the risk of LBW among preterm infants fell from 17. 75 to 8. 71 in 15 years. The mean birth weight decreased more significantly among newborns from qualified families, who also had the highest increase in preterm birth and non-cohabitation. CONCLUSIONS: LBW among vaginal deliveries increased mainly due to a rise in the proportion of preterm births and non-cohabiting mothers. The association between cesarean section and LBW tended to cover up socioeconomic differences in the likelihood of LBW. When vaginal deliveries were analyzed independently, these socioeconomic differences come up again...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} self-report {{of heterosexual}} anal intercourse among male sex workers who sell sex to men, {{and to identify}} the socio-demographic characteristics associated with practice of the behavior. Two cross-sectional surveys of male sex workers who sell sex to men in Mombasa, Kenya. Male sex workers selling sex to men {{were invited to participate}} in surveys undertaken in 2006 and 2008. A structured questionnaire administered by trained interviewers was used to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, HIV and STI knowledge, and health service usage. Data were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics. Bivariate logistic regression, after controlling for <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey,</b> was used to identify socio-demographic characteristics associated with heterosexual anal intercourse. From a sample of 867 male sex workers, 297 men had sex with a woman during the previous 30 days - of whom 45 % did so with a female client and 86 % with a non-paying female partner. Within these groups, 66 % and 43 % of male sex workers had anal intercourse with a female client and non-paying partner respectively. Factors associated with reporting recent heterosexual anal intercourse in bivariate logistic regression after controlling for <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> participation were being Muslim, ever or currently married, living with wife only, living with a female partner only, living with more than one sexual partner, self-identifying as basha/king/bisexual, having one's own children, and lower education.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} factors associated with changes in self-reported dentifrice consumption in an urban population group over 13 years. This study evaluated two surveys of 671 and 688 households sampled in the urban area of a city from Southern Brazil in 1996 and 2009, respectively. The mother of the family was asked to answer a structured questionnaire about demographics, socioeconomic and behavioral variables. The primary outcome was obtained by questioning "how long does a dentifrice tube last in your house?" The cut-off point of duration was less than 1 month. It was used to determine high consumption of dentifrice (HCD). Associations between HCD and independent variables were evaluated by multivariable Poisson regression. There was a significant decrease of 20 % (81. 2 % to 61. 2 %) in the prevalence of HCD between 1996 and 2009, resulting in a crude annual decrease of 1. 54 %. Mother's age, family income, dental assistance, mother's brushing frequency and number of household members that use a toothbrush were significantly associated with HCD independent from the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey.</b> The prevalence ratio (PR) of HCD for the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> was 0. 75, indicating an overall decrease of 25 % in the probability of HCD from 1996 to 2009. Probabilities of HCD also decreased over the 13 years among the strata of education, number of household members and reason for choice of dentifrice. It may be concluded that the factors associated with the observed decrease were higher educational levels, larger number of household members and reasons for choosing a dentifrice related to preventive/therapeutic effects...|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Several {{recent reports}} show a {{negative}} association between asthma and family size or birth order, but this association was not detected in data collected between 10 and 30 years ago. This study compared {{the association between}} sibship size and asthma in three surveys using the same methodology in 1977, 1985 / 86, and 1993 / 94. DESIGN: Cross sectional comparison of the 1977, 1985 / 86, and 1993 / 94 surveys. SETTINGS: Study areas in England and Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of children between 5 to 11 years in England and Scotland were asked about asthma and bronchitis attacks in the last 12 months, and wheeze in their child. Approximately 9000 children participated {{in each of the}} surveys. RESULTS: The overall association between asthma, defined as asthma attacks or wheeze, and total number of siblings was not significant (p = 0. 22), but an only child had a higher prevalence of asthma than children with siblings (OR 0. 87 95 % CI 0. 76 to 0. 98). The interaction between <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> and sibship size on asthma was not significant (p = 0. 36). There was no association between asthma and birth order. A significant interaction between social class and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> on asthma was detected (p = 0. 004). In the 1993 / 94 survey children whose fathers had a semi or unskilled manual occupation had a higher prevalence of asthma (16 %) than children whose fathers belonged to other social classes (13 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides only marginal support for a change over time of the association between sibship size and asthma. Based on recent reports the nature of the exposure agent that may explain the association remains controversial. This study suggests a disproportionate increase of asthma in lower social classes...|$|E

3000|$|In our study, the [...] "ethnic-spatial {{weighted}} matrix" [...] {{is considered}} to be dynamic. Our matrix is constructed with micro data, based on the three conditions of 1 : 1) ethnic group, 2) region of residence, and 3) <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey.</b> Therefore, if immigrants were to shift location, the demographic composition of regions would alter (for example, the number of Chinese immigrants in a specific region would change). Our ethnic spatially weighted matrix, W, captures this dynamic aspect. In addition, since we derive W by normalizing the ethnic-spatial neighbourhood matrix, `E', through unifying the row sums, the elements of W always fall in the range of 0 and 1. As such, the row sum reflects for a typical immigrant, how many immigrants (from the same ethnic group) are living in the same place with that immigrant. Therefore, when the number of immigrants from a typical ethnic group in a specific region changes, the relative elements of W will be changed as well.|$|E
