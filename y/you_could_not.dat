5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
25|$|They are not mobile germ warfare laboratories. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{use them}} for making {{biological}} weapons. They do not even look like them. They are exactly what the Iraqis said they were – facilities {{for the production of}} hydrogen gas to fill balloons.|$|E
25|$|Since it puts {{a premium}} on {{conscious}} understanding of the case, the party restricts membership to those who can pass a membership test on the party’s policies and principles. For example, the satirist John Bird is quoted as saying, I {{was a member of}} something called the Socialist Party of Great Britain at school for a while. You had to pass an exam, you know. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> just join.|$|E

25|$|Edwin Beete, {{one of the}} British Guiana side, {{was later}} quoted as follows: On the Friday morning {{we went to the}} Garrison and practised on the pitch there. Consequently the islanders had to prepare a pitch on the Savannah. And such a pitch! The outfield was very high with grass, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> run after a ball. The pitch itself was so studded with small pieces of corral that the ball had to be changed twice in an innings which lasted about two hours and mangled balls were brought back as a memento. We practised on Saturday and the match was fixed for the Monday and Tuesday {{following}} but was postponed until the Wedmesday and Thursday.|$|E
25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> tell {{they were looking at}} you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E

It {{was natural}} that you should n't expect--simply on turning your head--to find me lying on the pebbles at Blanquais-les-Galets. You were a great {{surprise}} to me, as well; but I differ from you--I like surprises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Dick," [...] she said, [...] "there's {{not much}} comfort in that. Look at poor Bobby Surcingle, look at Oliver Semples and Victor Medallion; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> have better families. But if you 're {{sure he does}} n't drink!

25|$|The road {{began in}} the Forum Romanum, passed through the Servian Wall at the porta Capena, went through a cutting in the clivus Martis, and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the {{builders}} used the via Latina. The building of the Aurelian Wall centuries later required the placing of another gate, the Porta Appia. Outside of Rome the new via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the via Norba, the ancient track to the Alban hills, where Norba was situated. The road {{at the time was}} a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, cambered, drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The via Appia {{is believed to have been}} the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower privately disparaged Bricker's motives, {{suggesting}} Bricker's {{push for}} the Amendment was driven by [...] "his one hope of achieving at least a faint immortality in American history," [...] and considered the Amendment entirely unnecessary, telling Stephen Ambrose it was [...] "an addition to the Constitution that said <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> violate the Constitution." ...|$|E
500|$|Albania's bunkers {{have even}} {{become a symbol}} of sorts for the country. Pencil holders and {{ashtrays}} in the shape of bunkers have become one of the country's most popular tourist souvenirs. One such line of bunker souvenirs was promoted with a message to buyers: [...] "Greetings {{to the land of the}} bunkers. We assumed that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to buy a big one." ...|$|E

500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby in {{his book}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna commented that [...] "'Holiday' was as {{infectious}} as the plague. One listen and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get the damn hook out of your mind." [...] Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "Holiday" [...] satisfied the musical ear of both {{the sides of the}} Atlantic. While reviewing The Immaculate Collection album, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "Holiday" [...] was a [...] "spunky dance-beat trifle". He also complimented the song's expert production.|$|E
500|$|He went on {{to exhibit}} {{considerable}} pride in the Haitian plantation built {{with the help of}} his sons: I wish you would go there. [...] would give you the best in the house. You ought to go, to see how happy the human race can be. It is a fine, rich valley, about thirty miles from Port Platte; heavily timbered with mahogany all round; well watered; flowers so beautiful; fruits in abundance, so delicious that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> refrain from stopping to eat, till you could eat no more. My sons have laid out good roads, and built bridges and mills; the people are improving, and everything is prosperous.|$|E
500|$|In 1859, Sherman {{accepted}} {{a job as}} the first superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy in Pineville, a position he sought {{at the suggestion of}} Major D. C. Buell and secured because of General George Mason Graham. He proved an effective and popular leader of the institution, which later became Louisiana State University (LSU). Colonel Joseph P. Taylor, the brother of the late President Zachary Taylor, declared that [...] "if you had hunted the whole army, from one end of it to the other, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have found a man in it more admirably suited for the position in every respect than Sherman." ...|$|E

500|$|Grimsby made {{a strong}} {{challenge}} for promotion in 1951–52 but finished second, three points behind Lincoln City (only one team was promoted from Division Three North, with one from Division Three South). Shankly insisted in his autobiography that his Grimsby team was: [...] "Pound for pound, and class for class, the best football team I have seen in England since the war. In the league they were in, they played football nobody else could play. Everything was measured, planned and perfected and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> wish to see more entertaining football". Stephen Kelly quotes the [...] "pound for pound" [...] analysis but qualifies it as [...] "another slight exaggeration, but he meant well". Kelly went on: [...] "that kind of talk could only boost morale at the club".|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2007, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although [...] "nothing's official." [...] In TV Week on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released Family Guy feature film sometime [...] "within the next year." [...] He came up with an idea for the story, [...] "something that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> do on the show, which [...] is the only reason to do a movie." [...] He later went to say he imagines the film to be [...] "an old-style musical with dialogue" [...] similar to The Sound of Music, saying that he would [...] "really be trying to capture, musically, that feel." [...] On October 13, 2011, Seth MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a Family Guy film had been made, {{and that it would be}} written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt.|$|E
500|$|Sinden {{considered}} {{the first period}} of the first Swedish game the team's worst since the team was put together, but the team improved and started to take command. Henderson, Clarke, Cashman and Parise scored. Sinden criticized the German referees: [...] "...they were absolutely terrible. They couldn't even skate. They were miles behind the play all night and don't know the damn rules. Their incompetence helped the game become very bitter." [...] The players were also introduced to the style of play of the Swedes, who were well used to using stick work to throw off their opponents. [...] "They were spearing, holding, interfering, and most of all, backstabbing." [...] The Canadian players would retaliate and be penalized for their retribution. As {{an example of the}} referees' incompetence, Sinden pointed out that Esposito had been penalized for cross-checking, and given a misconduct for it. Sinden, who had played international ice hockey, knew that under international rules at the time, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> give a misconduct for cross-checking.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose we'd better," [...] she interrupted. [...] "Be lenient {{about the}} bathroom, please. And if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> manage <b>not</b> {{to notice that}} the dining room wants papering, you'd be an angel. This way." ...|$|R

500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
500|$|Marshall later conceded that, [...] "I {{had never}} heard of atomic fission but I did know that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> build much of a plant, much less four of them for $90million." [...] A single TNT plant that Nichols had {{recently}} built in Pennsylvania had cost $128million. Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests. A survey team from Stone & Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The War Production Board recommended sites around Knoxville, Tennessee, an isolated area where the Tennessee Valley Authority could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near Elza, Tennessee. Conant advised that it be acquired at once and Styer agreed but Marshall temporized, awaiting the results of Conant's reactor experiments before taking action. Of the prospective processes, only Lawrence's electromagnetic separation appeared sufficiently advanced for construction to commence.|$|E
