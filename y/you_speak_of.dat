Celia Sanchez and Vilma Espin were leading strategists and highly skilled combatants who held essential roles throughout the revolution. Tete Puebla, founding member and second in command of the Mariana Grajales Platoon, said of Celia Sanchez, “When <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Celia, you’ve got to speak of Fidel, and vice versa. Celia’s ideas touched almost everything in the Sierra.|$|E
500|$|Seward {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} {{about the man who}} had blocked him from the presidency. One story is that when Seward was told that to deny Carl Schurz an office would disappoint him, Seward angrily stated, [...] "Disappointment! [...] <b>You</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> me of disappointment! [...] To me, who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the presidency, and who had to stand aside and see it given to a little Illinois lawyer!" [...] Despite his initial reservations about Lincoln's abilities, he came to admire Lincoln as the president grew more confident in his job. [...] Seward wrote to his wife in June 1861, [...] "Executive skill and vigor are rare qualities. The President is the best of us, but he needs constant and assiduous cooperation." [...] According to Goodwin, [...] "Seward would become his most faithful ally in the cabinet... Seward's mortification at not having received his party's nomination never fully abated, but he no longer felt compelled to belittle Lincoln to ease his pain." [...] Lincoln, a one-term congressman, was inexperienced in Washington ways, and relied on Seward's advice on protocol and social etiquette.|$|E
2500|$|The jazz {{pianist and}} {{educator}} Kenny Barron commented, [...] "I have every record [...] ever made—and I try never {{to listen to}} them ... If I did, I'd throw up my hands and give up!" [...] Jean Cocteau dubbed Tatum [...] "a crazed Chopin". Count Basie called him the eighth wonder of the world. [...] Dave Brubeck observed, [...] "I don't think there's any more chance of another Tatum turning up than another Mozart." [...] Pianist Mulgrew Miller, commented on personal growth by saying, [...] "When I talk to the people I admire, they're always talking about continuous growth and development and I look at them and say, 'Well... what are YOU going to do?' But, as Harold Mabern says, 'There's always Art Tatum records around'". Dizzy Gillespie said, [...] "First <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Art Tatum, then take a long deep breath, and <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> the other pianists." ...|$|E
6000|$|Your grandfather's coachman? Alas, he {{died the}} day after Mr. Carvel, and was buried the same afternoon. Have <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>of</b> this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} heard <b>thee</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> thy nurse, Nicholas, and surely the lad looks not apt to {{learning}} the mysteries of a trade like thine." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Pickett {{looked at}} him as if he had {{disappointed}} her. [...] "I had always heard <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>of</b> as a man with common sense, Mr. Snyder." ...|$|R
2500|$|... “But now I {{must respond}} to the letters {{received}} from you and others. In your letter <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> your early training to have implicit faith in the testimonies and say, [...] "I was led to conclude and most firmly believe that every word that you ever spoke in public or private, that every letter you wrote under any and all circumstances, was as inspired as the Ten Commandments." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “When I {{was here}} before, the President {{gave me my}} country, and I put my stake down in a good place, and there I want to stay.... <b>You</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> another country, {{but it is not}} my country; it does not concern me, and I {{want nothing to do with}} it. I was not born there.... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When Oscar Peterson {{was still}} a boy, his father played him a {{recording}} of Tatum performing [...] "Tiger Rag". Once the young Peterson was finally persuaded that it was performed by a single person, he was so intimidated {{that he did not}} touch the piano for weeks. [...] Peterson also stated that, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> pianists, the most complete pianist that we have known and possibly will know, from what I've heard to date, is Art Tatum." [...] "Musically speaking, he was and is my musical God, and I feel honored to remain one of his humbly devoted disciples." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't let {{my mother}} hear <b>you</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> taking {{an old woman}} to that place," [...] Gavin said, looking anxiously up the stair. I cannot pretend that Margaret never listened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sancho," [...] {{said our}} heroine, {{blushing}} like the dawn, [...] "thou saidst that the Conde de Llera bade <b>thee</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> {{him to his}} aunt; did he mention no one else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whom are <b>you</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> as 'her'?" [...] Mrs. Brook {{asked as}} on feeling that {{something}} in her face had made him stop. [...] "I wasn't referring," [...] she explained, [...] "to his wife." ...|$|R
2500|$|... hen <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> us Republicans, {{you do so}} only to {{denounce}} us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to [...] "Black Republicans." ....But you will not abide {{the election of a}} Republican president! [...] In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! [...] That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, [...] "Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But are {{you sure}} of that?" [...] the Bishop ventured doubtfully. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Germany, <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> William of Hohenzollern and his clan. Is that Germany? Is theirs {{the voice of the}} people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|To this Mohi, {{with some}} ire, {{was about to}} make answer, when, flinging over his {{shoulder}} a new fold of his mantle, Babbalanja spoke thus: [...] "Peace, rivals. As Bardianna has it, like all who dispute upon pretensions of their own, you are each nearest the right, when <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> the other; and furthest therefrom, when <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> yourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank thee, friend, {{for telling}} me this. 'Tis {{a joy to}} hear <b>thee</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Him. It is so long since we talked of this matter. And--tell me yet again--thou wast in Jerusalem when He died?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ferd. As I am now; [...] Who wonders to hear <b>thee</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Savoy; [...] He does hear me, {{and that}} he does, I weep. [...] Myself am Savoy, whose fatal eyes (ne'er since at ebb) beheld [...] The duke, my father, wrecked.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have never, sir,'--she {{interposed}} with {{an altered}} manner and a firmer voice; 'I {{have never heard}} <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>of</b> in harsh or disrespectful terms. You do a great wrong to Edward's nature if you believe him capable of any mean or base proceeding.' ...|$|R
60|$|PURDIE (darkly). Don't be too sure. Was the man <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> {{a rather}} chop-fallen, gone-to-seed sort of person.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, young shaver;"--this was Mounser Green again;--"when <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> a {{young lady}} do you {{be a little more}} discreet." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{considered}} this with visible intensity. [...] "What you suggest {{is that the}} things <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> depend on other people?" ...|$|E
60|$|Fred. Do <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> well <b>of</b> {{my friend}} Love, and I'll try to <b>speak</b> well <b>of</b> your friend Devotion.|$|R
60|$|ROWLEY. Come Sir Oliver I know <b>you</b> cannot <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Charles's Follies with anger.|$|R
5000|$|Tu as parlé de {{quelque chose}} (You spoke <b>of</b> something/ <b>you</b> have <b>spoken</b> <b>of</b> something) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must presume, Mademoiselle," [...] I {{said in my}} most business-like manner, [...] "that the {{document}} <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> has been stolen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should love it--but I {{should have}} gone in for it earlier. But why"--Osmond reverted--"do <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> your friend as poor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! No! It's too dreadful {{to think}} of. Why, {{that would be}} murder. I--I can't {{understand}} how <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> it--so--so calmly." ...|$|E
60|$|MARY. I {{can make}} {{allowance}} for <b>thee,</b> Thou <b>speakest</b> <b>of</b> {{the enemy of}} thy king.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, madam. It {{only means}} that <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> {{severely}} <b>of</b> Doctor Fontaine's widow--without mentioning any facts that justify you." ...|$|R
60|$|C. Now, Lucius, <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> out <b>of</b> {{the remains}} of the old tyrannical barbarism, when the daughters were nothing but goods and chattels.|$|R
6000|$|Warn. Then I'll see if {{my project}} be luckier than thine. Where are the papers {{concerning}} the jointure I have heard <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You use the word, ma'am, I have myself used,' said Rokesmith, with {{a glance}} at Bella, 'when <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Miss Wilfer's attractions there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I cannot follow these {{domestic}} troubles of yours. And why do <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> your blue eye? Your eyes are brown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honest?" [...] echoed Rose, sadly, [...] "honest?--ah, Louis! I {{know you}} are {{thinking}} disparagingly of Charles's convictions, when <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> so <b>of</b> his mother's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dare?" [...] he mocked her, beside {{himself with}} passion. [...] "Is it <b>you</b> who <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> daring--you, the niece of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, a {{lady of the}} noble and illustrious house of Rovere, who cast {{yourself}} {{into the arms of}} a low-born vassal such as that, a masnadiero, a bandit, a bravo? And can <b>you</b> yet <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> daring, and take that tone with me, when shame should strike you either dead or dumb?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy, Sir Guy, {{that you}} are not greatly versed in female ways. A woman defends herself like a beleaguered fortress. She makes sorties and attacks, she {{endeavours}} to hide her weakness by her bravados, and when she replies most disdainfully to a summons to capitulate, is perhaps on the eve of surrender. To come to the point, then, are <b>you</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> my daughter?" ...|$|R
