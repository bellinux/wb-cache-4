25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Up! Live from Chicago {{received}} favorable critic reviews. Matt Bjorke of About.com {{reviewed the}} home release of Up! Close and Personal. He had not attended a Shania concert, nor seen the television special, {{and was surprised}} by the singer's stage presence. He believed that the video would make the singer's naysayers realize Shania's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd. Bjorke concluded, [...] "Up! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come." [...] Chris Jones of BBC noted the band's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country-influenced sound. However, Jones complimented the singer's incorporation of the audience, naming it her [...] "inimitable style". He added that the video was [...] "far from [...] sterile experience" [...] because of the live setting and crowd ambiance. However, he suspected Shania's [...] "photocopy-perfect" [...] vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post-production work. [...] "Overall, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what you're getting with Shania, and for her fans this is bound {{to be a very good}} thing indeed." [...] Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality, noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then-new son, Eja. He complimented the band's strong, yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life. However, he claimed Shania's vocal delivery was at times frail. Reed also noted the absence of guest stars, in contrast to her two previous concert specials, and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country-fair vibe. Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host. He continued, [...] "As the night wore on, Shania tried different ways, with varying degrees of success, to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen. Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things, but it often backfired." ...|$|E
2500|$|Todd Van DerWerff of Vox had a mixed {{review to}} season four, criticizing the {{repetitive}} and predictable {{nature of the}} series, writing: [...] "There's no such mystery with House of Cards, where <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what will happen as surely as you do on NCIS. Obstacles will present themselves, but Frank (the hammy Kevin Spacey) and Claire (the almost perfect Robin Wright) Underwood will overcome. What {{you see is what}} you get." ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul Gascoigne [...] "Brian Laudrup was {{an amazing}} player. In {{training}} even if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what Brian was about to do, you still couldn't stop him. I remember Stuart McCall {{trying to get the}} ball off him eight or nine times and he couldn't get near him, when all Brian was doing was the same trick each time." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{incident}} was transmuted from tragedy to morbid comedy material for American {{shows such as}} Seinfeld, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The Simpsons, and [...] "became deeply embedded in American pop culture" [...] with phrases such as [...] "A dingo's got my baby!" [...] serving as [...] "a punchline you probably remember hearing before <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what a dingo was." ...|$|R
50|$|At one time, it {{was assumed}} in the {{physical}} sciences that if the behavior observed in a system cannot be predicted, the problem is {{due to lack of}} fine-grained information, so that a sufficiently detailed investigation would eventually result in a deterministic theory ("If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> all the forces acting on the dice, you would be able to predict which number comes up").|$|R
2500|$|Glau {{trained with}} stunt {{coordinator}} Joel Kramer {{to prepare for}} the physical demands of her role. In learning martial arts for Serenity, Glau used her training in ballet to learn fight scenes by counts, as if they were choreographies. About bringing the practice to Terminator, Glau said, [...] "When you're working with a stunt guy ... and you need to anticipate every swing he's going to take at you ... it's important that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> the timing that it's all going to play out." [...] Training focused heavily on the destruction of breakable set pieces, safety in hand-to-hand fights and the use of a variety of firearms. Glau was challenged during fight scenes by not being able to move or act humanly by things such as pushing her hair out of her face. Glau modeled Cameron's walk after that of a dressage horse for its precision.|$|E
2500|$|After {{signing a}} {{publishing}} deal with independent label Albert Music in 2009, Paulini {{began to focus}} more on songwriting. She attended songwriting camps in Europe, New York City and Los Angeles, and collaborated with many songwriters such as Allan Eshuijs. Paulini co-wrote songs for South African recording artist Sasha-Lee Davids, German girl group Monrose, Spanish recording artist Edurne, and [...] winner Yoann Fréget, among others. During February–March 2009 and again in October, Paulini alongside Christine Anu, Grace Knight and Monica Trapaga embarked on the Ladies of Jazz Tour in New South Wales, where they performed jazz classics from the 30's and 40's, as well as modern jazz hits. In November 2009, Paulini released the single [...] "Scarless" [...] to help raise awareness and support for White Ribbon Day, an international day to prevent violence against women. The song is based on an abusive relationship Paulini was in and was written to help other victims of domestic violence. [...] "Scarless" [...] marked the first time Paulini released music independently. On being an independent artist, Paulini told Auspop: [...] "For the first time I feel like I'm in control of my music...with the independent thing, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what you're paying to who and you're in control from your music to what is written, to what you release out there – you're across it all, which is a great thing." [...] Upon its release, [...] "Scarless" [...] debuted at number 18 on the AIR Independent Radio Chart. Paulini was featured on Irish recording artist Ronan Keating's 2010 single [...] "Believe Again", which peaked at number 73 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was included on Keating's album Duet (2010).|$|E

60|$|Shelton {{thought of}} the unique hybrid breakfasting downstairs; he wished that Mrs. Dennant would show in him the {{interest}} she had manifested in the rose. But this was absurd of him, he knew, for the potent law of hobbies controlled the upper classes, forcing them to take more interest in birds, and roses, missionaries, or limited and highly-bound editions of old books (things, in a word, in treating which <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where <b>you</b> were) than in the manifestations of mere life that came before their eyes.|$|R
60|$|Fishing has {{one great}} {{peculiarity}} {{which makes it}} often vastly more interesting than hunting, gunning, or many other sports of the kind, {{and that is that}} <b>you</b> never <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what <b>you</b> are going to get.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there is}} a telegram, any {{communication}} from the Embassy, or telephone message, you will bring it to me yourself, at once, at number 17, Grosvenor Square. If any one should call to see me, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> where I am to be found." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That remark," [...] said Mr. Barclay, [...] "is to {{some extent}} justified. Over in Europe they say 'slow and sure,' though I don't suppose it's a maxim that's likely to appeal to young America. We'll {{paraphrase}} it into this form: 'Don't move until <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what you mean {{to do and how}} you're going to set about it, and then get at it like a battering ram.'" ...|$|E

"Dear Mary, if {{you will}} be a little patient with me <b>you</b> shall <b>know</b> {{everything}} I have to tell, and then <b>you</b> will <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> why I didn't come to you the moment I got back to town.

500|$|The result kept Burton in {{the lead}} in the Drivers' Championship. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was {{involved}} in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: [...] "This pretty much does it for us as far as I'm concerned for the championship. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> that something like that was going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, I have herein {{told you}} with great particularity all these {{circumstances}} of his early history so that <b>you</b> may <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> how {{it was that he}} was taken away into the lake, and why it was that he was afterward known as Sir Launcelot, surnamed of the Lake.|$|R

6000|$|Again {{the woman}} {{appeared}} to reflect [...] "Prosperity {{is apt to}} kill romance," [...] she said. [...] "One is never quite content, you know, and I feel now and then that Shafton scarcely understands me. That is a complaint people appear to find ludicrous, of course, though I really don't see why they should do so. Shafton is conventional and precise. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what {{he is going to}} do, and that it will be right, but one has longings now and then for something original and intense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do, Uncle Richard?" [...] said Mary, pausing {{about six}} feet away and holding out her hand. [...] "I heard you scolding my poor dad about his bow-window.

The fact is, my dear, that it's necessary {{there should}} be a sort of condescension on my part, and that I should show this young person that I am willing to take notice of her. There's a very respectable-looking young man,' added Mrs Nickleby, after a short consideration, 'who is conductor to one of the omnibuses that go by here, and who wears a glazed hat--your sister and I have noticed him very often--he has a wart upon his nose, Kate, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>exactly</b> like a gentleman's servant.' ...|$|E
