6000|$|... "I called," [...] said Miss Allsop, {{coming to}} the point at once, and {{speaking}} in her Sunday-school-teacher voice, [...] "to ask you if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Private Hotel scheme of your father's?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will place}} my {{evidence}} before you," [...] Captain Vere said; [...] "and {{it will be}} for you to decide upon it. Master Geoffrey Vickars, please to inform the governor what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> matter." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Chilian business?” Lord Cochrane asked Stephen as {{they walked}} up and down the deck together on the following morning.|$|R
50|$|Bet <b>you</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>about.....</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] he returned, as he {{took the}} {{communication}} and glanced at it. [...] "Why! what do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this?</b> Here {{we were just talking about}} Gif and Spouter, and here is a letter from Gif now," [...] he cried.|$|E
6000|$|She {{sat down}} on a stone bench outside the door. [...] "Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> poor man?" [...] she said. [...] "I don't ask out of idle curiosity--I have a better motive than that. Is he young or old?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{about the}} size of it, sir. They thought I was in a stupor when they left me, but {{as soon as they were}} gone I began to shift for myself. But I don't {{understand}} how <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> Captain Putnam." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> paragraph?" [...] she asked, {{touching it}} with her delicately-gloved forefinger. [...] "The one, I mean, which concerns the Count di Marioni?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jones," [...] Lady Fitzgerald {{had said}} to her, very earnestly, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> man than you are telling me, you are bound to speak out, {{and let me know}} everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before I begin," [...] {{continued}} my companion, slanting her hat so as {{to prevent}} the sun from meddling with the perfect tones of her complexion, [...] "tell me what <b>you</b> already <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> young lady. I {{do not wish to}} waste any information." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's {{news for}} you!" [...] shouted Andy, {{bursting}} {{in on the}} others the next noon. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this?</b> Say, I guess those fellows are going to catch it all right enough!" [...] {{and he began to}} dance around the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{going to}} run the risk, my dear." [...] His manner to her was {{anything}} but civil, anything but complimentary. If this was his Corsair humour, she was not sure that a Corsair might be agreeable to her. [...] "And now tell me what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> second robbery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hum! This {{might be}} worth looking into," [...] mused the rug dealer. [...] "Of course, these stocks may be all right. But it looks rather fishy to me. Years ago I bought some stocks like that and they proved to be utterly worthless. It {{certainly}} won't do any harm to tell old Mr. Fordham what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> man Haskers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Now <b>you</b> want to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> business, I guess,' he went on. 'You {{want to know}} jest {{where the}} {{reciprocity}} comes in, anyhow?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> Stowell?" [...] {{went on the}} professor, who had {{now come}} slowly {{to the top of}} the stairs, {{followed}} by Professor Grawson, who had come out of Colonel Colby's private office where he had been looking over some reports when the big snowball had landed with a thump against the desk at which he had been seated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only five left. The three must {{be among}} you. We have narrowed it down." [...] His hand moved to his belt. Something flashed, a rod of pale fire. He raised the rod, {{pointing}} it steadily at the five people. [...] "All right, {{the first one}} of you. What do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> destruction? Are you involved with the destruction of our city?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Gertie, I don't want to butt in, and I'm {{guessing}} at it, {{but looks}} to me as though one of these artistic grafters was working you. What do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Deitz person? Has she done anything worth while? And honestly, Gertie----By the way, I don't want to be brutal, but I don't think I could stand 'Eltruda.' It sounds like 'Tottykins.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Luncheon {{brought the}} whole family together; and Sir John, making room for his younger {{daughter}} beside him, said, 'Fan, did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>about</b> Coley?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A very {{determined}} young lady," [...] continued Lady Lufton. [...] "Of course, my dear Fanny, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all <b>this</b> <b>about</b> Ludovic and your sister-in-law?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had seen}} the lawyer's face light up for a moment, and then, {{at the sound of}} Jim's proviso, miserably fade. [...] "I guess <b>you</b> <b>know</b> more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> wreck than I do, Mr. Pinkerton," [...] said he. [...] "I only know that I was told to buy the thing, and tried, and couldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{ride away}} with Lassiter. Judkins, {{tell me all}} you saw--all <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> killing." [...] She realized, without wonder or amaze, how Judkins's one word, affirming the death of Dyer--that the {{catastrophe}} had fallen--had completed the change whereby she had been molded or beaten or broken into another woman. She felt calm, slightly cold, strong as {{she had not been}} strong since the first shadow fell upon her.|$|E
6000|$|Once, when Kennicott {{announced}} at noon-dinner, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this!</b> They say there's a chance {{we may get}} another factory--cream-separator works!" [...] he added, [...] "You might try to look interested, even if you ain't!" [...] The baby was frightened by the Jovian roar; ran wailing to hide his face in Carol's lap; and Kennicott had to make himself humble and court both mother and child. The dim injustice of not being understood even by his son left him irritable. He felt injured.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{this sounds}} well, and I am both willing and glad, chief, to receive {{you in the}} {{character}} in which you give me to understand you have now come. A warrior of Wyandotté's high name is too proud to carry a forked tongue in his mouth, and I shall hear nothing but truth. Tell me, then, all <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> party at the mill; what has brought it here, how you came to meet my son, and {{what will be the}} next step of his captors. Answer the questions in the order in which I put them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Wade {{could only}} stare vacantly, hopelessly. After a pause the man {{continued}} {{in a less}} aggressive manner and more confidential tone, which, however, only increased her terror. [...] "I ain't sayin' that <b>YOU</b> <b>knowed</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> ma'am, and whatever other folks might say when THEY know of it, I'll allers say that you didn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to explain {{everything}} by and by," [...] he said, [...] "but first of all I {{want to ask you}} one question. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>this</b> illness of your father's? Do you believe that it is a genuine thing, or that he has some motive of his own for keeping to his room?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That’s more like,” said Carnehan. “If {{you could}} think us a little more mad we would be more pleased. We have come to <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> country, {{to read a book}} about it, and to be shown maps. We want you to tell us that we are fools and to show us your books.” He turned to the book-cases.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, young man," [...] {{said the}} soldier, in a {{somewhat}} milder tone, [...] "you're a smart spark enough, and I am sorry for you; and your uncle here is a fine old Trojan, kinder, I see, to his guests than himself, for he gives us wine and drinks his own thin ale--tell me all <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Burley, what he said when you parted from him, where he went, and where he is likely now to be found; and, d--n it, I'll wink as hard on your share of the business as my duty will permit. There's a thousand merks on the murdering whigamore's head, an I could but light on it--Come, out with it--where did you part with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] said Arthur, {{with that}} {{dangerous}} quiet {{which was the}} only outward sign of interest and determination in his nature. [...] "I'm going up to One Horse Gulch to offer my services as counsel to Gabriel Conroy. Now for {{the details of this}} murder, which, by the way, I don't believe Gabriel committed, unless he's another man than the one I knew! After that you can tell me your business with me, for I don't suppose you telegraphed to me on his account solely. Of course, at first you felt it was to your interest to get him and his wife out of the way, now that Ramirez is gone. But now, if you please, let me know what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> murder." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{some critics}} {{as well as}} audiences were less pleased with the film; New York Daily News wrote that while the film does not suffer from the cinematography, acting, or setting, early on it [...] "seems that The Witch is tapping a higher metaphor for coming of age...or {{religious}} intolerance...or man's uneasy balance with nature...or something. It doesn't take long into the film's {{hour and a half}} running time, however, to break that spell." [...] Critics have noted that the film has received backlash from audiences regarding the film's themes and slow approach to horror; Lesley Coffin criticized A24, saying it was [...] "a huge mistake" [...] to market The Witch as a terrifying horror movie. [...] "Not because it doesn’t fit into the genre of horror, but because of the power of expectations. The less <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> movie the better your experience will be, but everyone who saw it opening weekend probably walked in with too much knowledge and hype to really get as much out of it as they could have if the film had the veil of mystery." [...] HitFix writer Chris Eggertson was critical of mainstream Hollywood and summarized that the film [...] "got under my skin profoundly, but it did not have the moment-to-moment, audience-pleasing shocks that moviegoers have become accustomed to thanks to movies like Sinister and The Purge and Paranormal Activity and every other Blumhouse and Platinum Dunes title in the canon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Relative? Why, {{she calls}} herself the Comtesse somebody!" [...] Lady Mary declared. [...] "I do {{wish you would}} tell me, Henry, exactly what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> and what <b>you</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> young man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's more like," [...] said Carnehan. [...] "If {{you could}} think us a little more mad we would be more pleased. We have come to <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> country, {{to read a book}} about it, and to be shown maps. We want you to tell us that we are fools and to show us your books." [...] He turned to the bookcases.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, half a glass. It is {{very hot}} {{for the time}} of year; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> my theory <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Norwood case?" ...|$|R
