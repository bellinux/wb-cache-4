500|$|Scenes were filmed {{primarily}} in Portland, Oregon. Stunt {{work was done}} mainly by the cast. The fight sequence between Gigandet and Pattinson's characters in a ballet studio, which was filmed {{during the first week}} of production, involved a substantial amount of wire work because the vampires in the story have superhuman strength and speed. Gigandet incorporated mixed martial arts fighting moves in this sequence, which involved chicken and honey as substitutes for flesh. Bella, the protagonist, is unconscious during these events, and since the novel is told from her point of view, such action sequences are illustrative and unique to the film. Pattinson noted that maintaining one's center of gravity is difficult when doing wire work [...] "because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> fight against it as well as letting it do what it needs to do."

She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided!

They <b>had</b> what <b>you</b> call tent shows before the main show, and the band would play in {{what they called the}} ‘valley,’ to get the people in the crowd interested enough to come into the tent. There were no microphones out there, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> dig down deep in your horn and get some volume. So it strengthened your chops and you were used to that big, full sound. When I was coming up in high school T.

But you tell a child about Satan and demons and saints and angels, and with a child's imagination, it just becomes a part of your mind.

5000|$|The {{ending of}} the A-side of the album is the punk song Los Paul, which begins with the {{striking}} line [...] "Go Paul, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> {{hit him in the}} balls!". In the verses, Krawinkel plays a single repetitive chord on the electric guitar, accompanied by a quick beat from the drums. Remmler sings a couple of phrases which are taken from the commentary of a football match. After the second chorus, the vocals stop. In the left stereo channel, clips of a real football commentary can be heard, in which video replays are analysed. At the same time, in the right stereo channel, multiple news readers are reporting one after the other about the attack on Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5000|$|According to McCartney, George Harrison [...] "didn't {{want to do}} it," [...] {{while an}} unnamed {{participant}} told the Daily Express: [...] "George just didn’t want to rework it because it’s {{not a matter of}} putting some vocals, or a bit of bass and drums to finish it. With this, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> build the song." [...] Producer Jeff Lynne reported that [...] "It was one day—one afternoon, really—messing with it. The song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn't finish." [...] An additional factor behind scrapping the song was a technical defect in the original recording. As with [...] "Real Love", a 60-cycle mains hum can be heard throughout Lennon's demo recording. However, it was noticeably louder on '"Now and Then", making it much harder to remove.|$|E
500|$|The {{documentary}} crew put wireless microphones {{on several}} of the actors and crew and followed them through the conception, pre-production, filming, editing, screening and reception of [...] "Subway".

Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, [...] "To pull off a show like this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>really,</b> really focused, and for me the thing with the documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus." ...|$|R

Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you <b>really</b> listen <b>to</b> the lyrics, it <b>has</b> nothing <b>to</b> do with money or luxury.
