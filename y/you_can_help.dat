500|$|By early July, {{refugee camps}} were filled to capacity. The prime {{minister}} made a long-awaited announcement {{saying that it}} was safe to return to the Swat Valley. The Pakistani military had pushed the Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first – to meet with a group of other grassroots activists that had been invited to see United States President Barack Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, [...] "Respected ambassador, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> us in our education, so please help us." [...] When her family finally did return home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage.|$|E

500|$|In September 2009, Watson {{announced}} her involvement with People Tree, a Fair trade fashion brand. Watson {{worked as a}} creative advisor {{for the company to}} create a spring line of clothing, which was released in February 2010; the range featured styles inspired by southern France and London. The collection, described by The Times as [...] "very clever" [...] despite their [...] "quiet hope that [...] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle", was widely publicised in magazines such as Teen Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration, admitted that competition for the range was minimal, but argued that [...] "Fashion {{is a great way to}} empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in"; adding, [...] "I think young people like me are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there." [...] Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in the release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{said that}} [...] "We only would cast someone {{if they came}} {{right out of the}} story," [...] while Sarah Noonan, vice {{president}} of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, said that guest star choices come from the writing staff and executive producer. Writer Steven Banks said, [...] "It's not just stunt casting to get publicity," [...] and that the reasoning is [...] " [...] do want to meet them [...] " [...] A number of guest stars have accepted to appear on the show after being persuaded by their children who are SpongeBob SquarePants fans. Some of them include Victoria Beckham, Amy Poehler and David Hasselhoff. Others accept to guest appear because they are fans of the show themselves. Actor Johnny Depp, who appeared as Jack Kahuna Laguna in the sixth-season episode [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One," [...] accepted the guest role on the show because he and his children are fans. Hillenburg described the process, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was hard to get}} people. Most of the people that allow themselves to be on have kids who like the show. Often, they're kids are fans. They're doing it because they want to please the family." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has a [...] "dream list" [...] of celebrities that the crew would like to appear on the show, which includes actors Michael Caine and Jerry Lewis. Noonan said, [...] "Let us know if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> us out with them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The player {{heads to}} Dowerton by train. He falls asleep, and awakens in a train tunnel, where {{he hears the}} voice of a young boy, Timothy Pike.

2500|$|King was {{starting}} to think about being an artist, though this was really a second choice. But art was something she could do with minimal resources, so {{long as she could}} support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, an important part of German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870–1938). The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it. King went to see the artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz’ advice to King about a career in art was “Don’t do it if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. It is so difficult”. Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: “I haven’t regretted it. I agree with her, it’s difficult.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Their primary {{assertion}} {{was that}} the bonds and emotional development made at home with parents during these years produced critical long-term results that were cut short by enrollment in schools, and could neither be replaced nor corrected in an institutional setting afterward. Recognizing a necessity for early out-of-home care for some children, particularly special needs and impoverished children and children from exceptionally inferior homes, they maintained {{that the vast majority}} of children were far better situated at home, even with mediocre parents, than with the most gifted and motivated teachers in a school setting. They described the difference as follows: [...] "This is like saying, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> a child by taking him off the cold street and housing him in a warm tent, then warm tents should be provided for all children – when obviously most children already have even more secure housing." ...|$|E

It is they {{who have to}} purify themselves. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> by your sympathy and your pen, but not by {{organizing}} the Movement and certainly not by offering Satyagraha. If you refer to the Congress resolution of Nagpur, it calls upon the Hindu Members to remove the curse of untouchability. Untouchability is the sin of the Hindus. They must suffer for it; they must pay the debt they owe to their suppressed brothers and sisters. Theirs is the shame and theirs must be the glory when they have purged themselves of the black sin. The silent loving suffering of one pure Hindu as such {{will be enough to}} melt the hearts of millions of Hindus, but the sufferings of thousands of non-Hindus on behalf of the untouchables will leave the Hindus unmoved. Their blind eyes will not be opened by outside interference, however well intentioned and generous it may be, for it will not bring home to them their sense of guilt. On the contrary, they would probably hug the sin, all the more, for such interference. All reforms to be sincere and lasting must come from within." ...|$|E
