He recalled sitting with Gaga and feeling a positive vibe, which led them to write the track described by Blair as [...] "upbeat and cool". Their camaraderie originated due to the [...] "terrible stuff {{going on in the}} world right now, it's like when you're a creative person you do <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> try and combat evil with creative stuff, so that was kind of the vibe." [...] Gaga and her team wanted to release the [...] "one-off" [...] single as soon as production was completed.|$|E
500|$|During Beyoncé's 2009 Las Vegas revue show, I Am... Yours, she {{performed}} the song {{live for the}} first time. Before performing the song, the singer described its meaning depth, stating: [...] "How {{many of you have}} ever been lied to? I'm sure everyone has —we all have. But this next song is from my last album, B'Day. And I never performed this song before, this is especially for Encore It talks about a relationship after you've been lied to. And you're trying <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> forgive. But it's difficult because you never forget. It's called 'Resentment'." [...] She additionally included the song on the 2009 [...] as the ninth track of the DVD/CD's first disc. During a Thanksgiving TV Special, Beyoncé aired I Am... Yours in its entirety which also featured her performance of [...] "Resentment". Nate Chinen of The New York Times said, [...] "There's exactly one human-scale moment in the concert, when she sits at the lip of the stage to sing an acoustic treatment of 'Resentment,' from her album 'B'Day.' And even then she makes it a showstopper." ...|$|E

500|$|Less than an {{hour before}} the {{independence}} ceremony a Belgian officer arrived to request that Lumumba depart for parliament. Kasongo was disturbed by what Lumumba planned to say and told Kanza as he left, [...] "I'm counting on you to do <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> tone down that speech." [...] As Lumumba dressed, Kanza and one of the secretaries, André Mandi, read through as much of the speech as they could, replacing some individual words with less inflammatory language and crossing out several full paragraphs deemed too difficult to temper. Lumumba then left in a motorcade for his official residence to rendezvous {{with the rest of his}} government. Kanza and Mandi followed in the second car, making additional revisions to the speech. These were so extensive that both feared Lumumba would be unable to clearly read his remarks. Upon their arrival at the residence, Kanza and Mandi briefly explained their alterations to Lumumba. Greatly pleased with the result, Lumumba stated that he would read some parts of the speech verbatim, then improvise to respond to the atmosphere in the room as he saw fit. He made his own alterations to the script during the speeches given by Baudouin and Kasa-Vubu.|$|E
500|$|As Lee {{continued}} his offensive at Gaines's Mill to the east, McClellan played a passive role, taking no initiative {{and waiting for}} events to unfold. He kept two thirds of his army out of action, fooled again by Magruder's theatrical diversionary tactics. That night, he decided to withdraw his army to a safer base, well below Richmond, on {{a portion of the}} James River that was under control of the Union Navy. In doing so, he may have unwittingly saved his army. Lee had assumed that the Union army would withdraw to the east toward its existing supply base and McClellan's move to the south delayed Lee's response for at least 24 hours. But McClellan was also tacitly acknowledging that he would {{no longer be able to}} invest Richmond, the object of his campaign; the heavy siege artillery required would be almost impossible to transport without the railroad connections available from his original supply base on the York River. In a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, reporting on these events, McClellan blamed the Lincoln administration for his reversals. [...] "If I save this army now, I tell you plainly I owe no thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington. You have done <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice this army." [...] Fortunately for McClellan, Lincoln never saw that inflammatory statement (at least at that time) because it was censored by the War Department telegrapher.|$|E
2500|$|The first Chinese {{historical}} archive {{also recorded}} that on 4 September 1730 AD (on the lunar calendar), Tian Wenjing, {{governor of the}} Eastern River, fell ill. Emperor Yongzheng sent a royal doctor to visit and provided him with 200g of GuilingJi. In red calligraphy it was written: [...] "Please try <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> recover. You should have told me sooner. Why are you looking all over? Here is your reward.” Imperial records show that Emperor Yongzheng usually rewarded ministers with only 5g of GuilingJi. By rewarding Tian Wenjing with not only 200g, but also the original GuilingJi prescription it showed the emperor highly valued Tian Wenjing.|$|E

2500|$|Hill was a Peace Corps {{volunteer}} in Cameroon from 1974 to 1976. Hill credits {{his work with}} the Peace Corps for teaching him his first lessons in diplomacy. As a volunteer, Hill worked with credit unions and when he discovered that one board of directors had stolen 60 percent of their members' money, he reported on the malfeasance to their members, who promptly re-elected them because the board reflected carefully balanced tribal interests and it really did not matter to the members if the board directors ran a good credit union or not. Hill said the lesson was that [...] "When something's happened, it's happened for a reason and you do <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> understand that reason. But don't necessarily think you can change it." [...] Hill took the Foreign Service exam while he was serving as a Peace Corps {{volunteer in}} Cameroon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{night of}} June 27, McClellan ordered his entire army to {{withdraw}} to a secure base at Harrison's Landing on the James River. His actions have puzzled military historians ever since. The Union army {{was in a}} good position, having withstood strong Confederate attacks while only deploying one of its five corps in battle. Porter had performed well against heavy odds. Furthermore, McClellan was aware that the War Department had created a new Army of Virginia and ordered it {{to be sent to}} the Peninsula to reinforce him. But Lee had unnerved him, and he surrendered the initiative. He sent a telegram to the Secretary of War that included the statement: [...] "If I save this Army now I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you or any other persons in Washingtonyou have done <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice this Army." [...] (The military telegraph department chose to omit this sentence from the copy given to the Secretary.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, Mailer was outspoken {{about his}} mistrust of {{politics}} in general {{as a way of}} meaningful change in America. [...] In Miami and the Siege of Chicago (1968) he explained his view of [...] "politics-as-property" [...] where he likened politicians to property holders who are [...] "never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own". [...] Thus politics is just people trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. [...] This cynical view of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on Watergate. [...] Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: [...] "If you played for a team, you did <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> play very well, but there was something obscene… with in starting to think there was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State." [...] Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. [...] President Johnson on the other hand, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had had good charisma so all was forgiven.|$|E
2500|$|Eagle Scout {{requirements}} {{have evolved}} since the award was conceived. A requirement to earn 11 specific merit badges was added in 1914, which underwent minor changes in 1915. The Life–Star order was reversed in 1924, apparently because the five-pointed {{star of the}} Star Scout insignia could {{be associated with the}} five merit badges required to earn the rank immediately following First Class Scout. In 1927, Eagle Scout began the transition from being a super merit badge to a rank. As a result, the first requirements for tenure were created and Scouts were required to be an active First Class Scout for one year. The initial requirements for what became the service project appeared with a requirement to show satisfactory service and the number of required merit badges increased to 12. In 1936, the ranks of Star and Life became mandatory, and the number of required merit badges rose to 13. It was at this time that Eagle Scout became a full-fledged rank. In 1952, age limits were set so that adults over 18 years of age could no longer earn Eagle Scout and the service project requirement was slightly expanded to [...] "do <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> help in your home, school, church or synagogue, and community." [...] In 1958, the number of required merit badges increased again to 16 of the 21 total merit badges needed to obtain Eagle, along with the first requirements for service and leadership.|$|E
2500|$|As chaos {{broke out}} {{throughout}} China {{towards the end}} of the Eastern Han dynasty, Pang Xi wanted to improve security within Baxi Commandery, so he recruited more men to serve as soldiers. Around the time, Liu Zhang heard rumours that Pang Xi was planning to rebel against him and became more suspicious of Pang. When Pang Xi heard about it, he became fearful and started making preparations to increase the strength of his military forces. He also sent Cheng Yu (程郁), Cheng Ji's son, who was serving in the commandery office, to persuade Cheng Ji to support him in rebelling against Liu Zhang. Cheng Ji wrote to Pang Xi, [...] "Your original intention in recruiting more soldiers was not to start a rebellion. There might have been some misunderstanding, but what is more important is you are performing your duties. If you are fearful and start thinking of rebelling, I will not listen to you." [...] He also wrote to Cheng Yu, [...] "I received grace from the provincial government, so I am obliged to do my best to serve the Governor. You are serving in the commandery office, so you should do <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> serve the Administrator. You should not be thinking of rebelling." [...] Pang Xi sent a message to Cheng Ji, [...] "Your son is serving in the commandery office. Your family will be in trouble if you do not obey the Administrator!" [...] Cheng Ji replied, [...] "Yue Yang (樂羊) ate his son's flesh not because he did not love his son, but because he was doing so for the sake of upholding righteousness. If you were to make me do the same thing, I'll do it." [...] Pang Xi realised that Cheng Ji would never support him, so he abandoned the idea of rebelling against Liu Zhang; instead, he apologised to Liu Zhang and was pardoned. When Liu Zhang heard about Cheng Ji's loyalty towards him, he promoted Cheng to serve as the Administrator of Jiangyang Commandery (江陽郡; around present-day Luzhou, Sichuan).|$|E

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
