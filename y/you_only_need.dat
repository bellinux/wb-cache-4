[...] According to the Spanish-speaking newspaper, Grillo repeatedly comes back to an idea: [...] "Wars start because people cannot feed their families. They start because people feel inferior, without rights, angry and frustrated. They want something bigger in their lives. And <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>need</b> a group people with moral depression {{to convince them that}} killing and dying spectacularly means glory. Islamic terrorist, kamikaze squads, street gangs, the cartels. They were all children at one time." [...] Goodreads said that Grillo did an [...] "incredible job" [...] for his book, where he [...] "synthesized traditional interviews, academic research, pop culture and WikiLeaks to create a powerful and alarming picture of the cartels of Mexico". He was also complimented for explaining the [...] "root causes" [...] that threaten Mexican society and [...] "probably have potential to be a disruptive force across the American continent and perhaps globally". Borderland Beat noted that Grillo seems to be [...] "tune with the realities on the ground in Mexico". In addition, it mentioned that the author takes the reader into the world of the [...] "narcocorridos", the drug ballads celebrating the exploits of the drug traffickers; Grillo also explores the [...] "Santa Muerte, the peculiarly Mexican church (or cult, depending on whom you ask), favored by the poor, the delinquent, and the dopers". The writer of the article in Borderland Beat mentioned that although Grillo believes that the Mexican drug cartels are closer to a [...] "criminal insurgency", he cannot buy the appellegation because the cartels do not have an ideology behind what they do, since their goal is making money.|$|E

60|$|It is {{remarkable}} how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the woods, and still sustain {{themselves in the}} neighborhood of towns, suspected by hunters only. How retired the otter manages to live here! He grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps without any human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly saw the raccoon in the woods behind where my house is built, and probably still heard their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an hour or two in the shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by a spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing from under Brister's Hill, half a mile from my field. The approach to this was through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young pitch pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very secluded and shaded spot, under a spreading white pine, there was yet a clean, firm sward to sit on. I had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful without roiling it, and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the woodcock led her brood, to probe the mud for worms, flying but a foot above them down the bank, while they ran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying me, she would leave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till within four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract my attention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up their march, with faint, wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as she directed. Or I heard the peep of the young when I could not see the parent bird. There too the turtle doves sat over the spring, or fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white pines over my head; or the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly familiar and inquisitive. <b>You</b> <b>only</b> <b>need</b> sit still long enough in some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns.|$|E
