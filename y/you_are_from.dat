500|$|Following {{a two-hour}} {{artillery}} barrage meant to soften up the Union defenses, the three divisions stepped off across open fields almost {{a mile from}} Cemetery Ridge. Pickett inspired his men by shouting, [...] "Up, Men, and to your posts! Don't forget today that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>from</b> Old Virginia." [...] Pickett's division, with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Armistead, Garnett, and Kemper, {{was on the right}} flank of the assault. It received punishing artillery fire, and then volleys of massed musket fire as it approached its objective. Armistead's brigade made the farthest progress through the Union lines. Armistead was mortally wounded, falling near [...] "The Angle", at what is now termed the [...] "High Water Mark of the Confederacy". Neither of the other two divisions made comparable progress across the fields; Armistead's success was not reinforced, and his men were quickly killed or captured.|$|E
2500|$|At roughly 2:30 PM, {{the attack}} commenced, led by General Pickett, who rode along his line shouting, [...] "Up, men, {{and to your}} posts! Let no man forget that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>from</b> Virginia!" [...] General Garnett formed his men for the attack and led {{them out of the}} treeline on Seminary Ridge. General Garnett was mounted; he had been {{recently}} kicked by a horse and was unable to walk without difficulty. Although he could easily have turned over command and sat out the charge, Garnett was desperate to clear his reputation after being court-martialed by Stonewall Jackson for an unauthorized withdrawal of his command at the Battle of Kernstown in 1862 (in reality, Garnett's withdrawal was entirely practical; his men were low on ammunition and his line about to be overwhelmed.) Still, Garnett believed the only way to clear his name was to lead the attack from the front and center.|$|E
2500|$|The working {{title for}} the first track [...] "Intro" [...] is [...] "Attempted Assassination". Papoose said he was using the song [...] "more as a {{preparing}} the listener for what type of album, what type of experience they [...] about to have. I’m just basically setting the stage then an interlude." [...] The intro features samples from Barack Obama and Martin Luther King Jr. speeches. The third track [...] "Mother Ghetto" [...] is about loving and representing where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>from.</b> Papoose being from Brooklyn, New York he said the song will give you and inside look to the city {{even if you have}} never been there. Papoose would say his Mobb Deep collaboration [...] "Aim, Shoot" [...] was recorded in 2012 even through the feud that went on between members Havoc and Prodigy. He also said they all recorded the song in the studio at the same time.|$|E

2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>from</b> the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E
