500|$|The Green Book's motto, {{displayed}} on the front cover, urged black travelers to [...] "Carry your Green Book with you – <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>need</b> it". The 1949 edition included a quote from Mark Twain: [...] "Travel is fatal to prejudice", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotton Seiler puts it, [...] "here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter." [...] Green commented in 1940 that the Green Book had given black Americans [...] "something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro." [...] Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: [...] "Where will you spend the night?" [...] As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs. The listings focused on four main categories– hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving {{the name and address}} of each business. For an extra payment, businesses could have their listing displayed in bold type or have a star next to it to denote that they were [...] "recommended".|$|E
2500|$|The new Pro mode was {{critically}} acclaimed {{as the primary}} feature that distinguished Rock Band 3 from other music games in the field. Minkley stated that the inclusions of Pro features [...] "at once dramatically expand {{the potential of the}} game and fundamentally change the approach required to play and enjoy it". Reviewers appreciated the training modes, including their integration into the overall game's career progression and the breadth of material that is covered. Nina Shen Rastogi of Slate commented that Rock Band 3s training modes [...] helps to overcome the discouraging early period of trying to learn guitar as [...] "the gaming elements will mask the rote, homeworklike nature of the guitar training process". Kuchera noted that the modes were aimed at those who have some understanding of music theory already; [...] "If this is your first introduction to music theory, though, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>need</b> a little more explanation", he concluded. This lament was similarly stated by Machkovech, who felt the lessons had [...] "text that was written by a musical savant" [...] that would be too confusing to those without musical backgrounds and too simple for those trained in music arts. [...] Chris Kohler of Wired described the experience he and a friend had where after playing though Devo's [...] "Whip It" [...] on Pro guitar and keyboard, they were able retain enough muscle memory to play their respective parts on real instruments, albeit not perfectly; Kohler summarized his experience that [...] "Just playing Rock Band 3 taught us a little bit of actual music".|$|E

This allows us to explain the general structure of the Lagrangian for a composite physical system, as well as some other artificial postulates behind the variational formulations of physical laws.

If fixed inputs are lumpy, adjustments to the scale of operations may be more significant than what is required to merely balance production capacity with demand. For example, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> only <b>need</b> to increase production by million units per year to keep up with demand, but the production equipment upgrades that are available may involve increasing productive capacity by 2 million units per year.|$|R
