2500|$|On a {{publicity}} tour for Past Mortem in 2004, Elton mused {{on the high}} school reunion theme and his own drama college reunion: We'd had a very happy time all together, so there were no old scores to be settled really, we'd been a pretty happy bunch. And yet one person, who'd been a bit of a golden boy – he certainly went out with a girl I was besotted and unrequitedly in love with – he came up and he said, 'Why did you come? Was it to show off?' That really surprised me, that anyone would think that ... he came kind of carrying my agenda. It was weird. I hasten to add I didn't think my life to be more successful than anybody else's. If you're happy and honest and fulfilled in what <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> you're having a successful life.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Then</b> I {{am quite}} sure that you are up to some {{mischief}} or other, Bob, or you wouldn't want me {{to help you with}} Carrie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>do!</b> But <b>you</b> don't want me to, as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>then.</b> <b>Do</b> you?" [...] She stopped {{abruptly}} and faced him full. [...] "Tell me, honestly!" ...|$|R
6000|$|ARETHUSA. Kit, {{you must}} judge me fairly. It {{was not my}} life that was at stake, it was yours. Had it been mine--mine, Kit--what had <b>you</b> <b>done,</b> <b>then?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it isn't that--it's {{something}} far deeper. But if it's nothing you have against me, what is it, Alma, {{that keeps you}} from caring for me now as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>then?</b> I haven't changed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to have two teachers?" [...] asked Mary Bell. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> we can't have any scholars;--for the baby is not old enough to go to school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} can <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>then?</b> What's {{the good of}} your coming up like this? How are you to get on here all alone? I can fight my own battles. You'd much better go back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I march {{upon the}} Great Place, {{it must be}} at midnight when none see me go," [...] said Hafela, [...] "and what will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>then,</b> Noma, who are too weary to travel again so soon?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Student: [...] "I just don't get it." [...] Teacher: [...] "Well, {{the first}} part is just like the last problem <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>Then</b> we add one more variable. See {{if you can find}} out what it is, and I'll come back in a few minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nigel {{stared at}} him, with a perplexed brow. [...] "Fair sir, my heart grows heavy as I hear <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>then</b> {{say that our}} chivalry can make no head against archers, billmen and the like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{hear that}} either," [...] he declared. [...] "Let bygones be bygones. What <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>then</b> is outlawed, anyway. Those were fierce times, and I want to forget them." [...] He looked about. [...] "Let me see this Miss Virginia and convey to her Mrs. Redfield's invitation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, mother. I don't know; I am not old enough. Still, don't {{leave me}} alone, for if <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> I am sure which I shall do," [...] and bending down {{he kissed her}} and left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "As a friend, I mean;--as a real friend. If {{it should}} be the case, Mrs. Crawley, that a jury should give a verdict against your husband,--what will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>then?</b> Perhaps I ought not to suppose that it is possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But suppose," [...] {{continued}} Ruth, [...] "that {{there were}} great {{difficulties in the}} way of doing that, and they felt as much objection to receive gratuitous victuals as money, what would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>then?</b> you would not let them starve, would you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' {{replied the}} young man, modestly, but with firmness, 'the same you knew in India; and who ventures to hope, that what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>then</b> know {{of him is}} not such as should prevent his {{requesting}} you would favour him with your attestation to his character as a gentleman and man of honour.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{look quite}} like yourself, in your {{portrait}} at home, Father," [...] Dick said. [...] "It is the shaving and cutting your hair, {{even more than}} getting off the dye, {{that has made the}} difference. I don't think you look much older than <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>then,</b> except that there are a few grey hairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{they have}} {{answered}} {{for their own}} sins. Is {{it possible that the}} Church has been mistaken in <b>you?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>then</b> refuse the first favour which she asks of you? You would accept her aid, and yet you would give none in return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} Maria and myself. But never mind that. Philip will, I suppose, {{be back in}} a few hours--oh, yes! he will be back," [...] and his eyes glinted unpleasantly, [...] "and what shall <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>then?</b> what course do you intend to take?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But to lose everything--everything," [...] said Penn. [...] "What can <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>then?</b> Once I"--the watery {{blue eyes}} stared up and down, as looking for {{something}} to steady them--"once I read--in a book, I think--of a boat where every one was run down--except some one--and he said to me--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not ring, Lady Hilda. If <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> all my earnest {{efforts to}} avoid a scandal will be frustrated. Give up the letter and all will be set right. If you will work with me I can arrange everything. If you work against me I must expose you." ...|$|E
60|$|Wife.--So then He never makee kill, never {{angry when}} <b>you</b> <b>do</b> wicked; <b>then</b> He no good Himself, or no great able.|$|R
60|$|Wife. So then {{he never}} makee kill, never angry when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> wicked; <b>then</b> he no good himself, or no great able.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] I returned, [...] "for {{the beauty}} of the present! <b>You</b> <b>do</b> see, <b>then,</b> that our psychologic glow doesn't, after all, prevent the thing----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>then!</b> I've {{heard so}} much, {{one way and}} the other. It's nice to know what those that's in it feel. But {{opinions}} vary, don't they? Mr Crich up at Highclose is all for it. Ay, poor man, I'm afraid he's not long for this world. He's very poorly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, dear Louise!" [...] {{cried the}} other, [...] "you choose {{something}} else too, don't you? You wish {{to meet him}} as if no unkindness had parted you, and {{as if you were}} to be always together after this? I hope <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> <b>Then</b> I should feel that all this suffering and, trouble was a mercy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pity her! poor mistaken woman, {{making of}} her will a Providence, rushing to doom. Pity her, {{but do not}} blame her overmuch, or if <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> blame Judith and Jephtha's {{daughter}} and Charlotte Corday, and all the glorious women who {{from time to time}} have risen on this sordid world of self, and given themselves as an offering upon the altars of their love, their religion, their honour or their country! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she said. [...] "I don't {{think either}} of us acted very well. I didn't know till aftawa'ds that I {{was glad to have}} you give up, the way <b>you</b> <b>did</b> in Florence. I was--bewild'ed. But I ought to have known, and I want you to undastand everything, now. I don't ca'e for you because I used to when I was almost a child, and I shouldn't want you to ca'e for me eitha, because <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>then.</b> That's why I wish you had neva felt that you had always ca'ed fo' me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Keano: [...] "Typical! If {{you fail}} to plan, then you’re {{planning}} to fail."Packie Bonnerus: [...] "But {{if you plan to}} fail, and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> fail, <b>then</b> surely <b>you</b> have succeeded?" ...|$|R

60|$|John. Why, {{what will}} <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>then,</b> brother? And what shall I do? for I am almost {{as bad as}} you. The people where I lodge are all gone into the country but a maid, and she is to go next week, and to shut the house quite up, so that I shall be turned adrift to the wide world before you, and I am {{resolved}} to go away too, if I knew but where to go.|$|E

60|$|Now conceit is {{the feeling}} that you know more than any one else. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Then</b> again, perhaps you don't. So {{sometimes}} it is best not to be too sure of your own opinion. Reddy was sure. He trotted along behind old Granny Fox and planned smart things to say to her when she found that there wasn't a chance to catch Quacker the Duck. I am afraid, very much afraid, that Reddy was planning to be saucy. People who think themselves smart are quite apt to be saucy.|$|E
5000|$|Van Morrison {{has placed}} the {{break-up}} of Them in context: [...] "There was no motive behind anything <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>then.</b> <b>You</b> just <b>did</b> it because <b>you</b> wanted to <b>do</b> it and <b>you</b> enjoyed <b>doing</b> it. That's {{the way the}} thing started, but it got twisted {{somewhere along the way}} and everybody involved in it got twisted as well, including me."(1967) [...] "You can't take something like that, put it in a box and place a neat little name on it, then try to sell it. That's what they tried to do. That's what killed Them." [...] (1973) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{woman ever}} has {{respected}} the law--ever," [...] she said. [...] "It's too silly.... The things it lets <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> And <b>then</b> pulls <b>you</b> up--like a mad nurse minding a child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I insist," [...] said Prince Marvel, [...] "upon your turning us into {{grasshoppers}} {{and your}} soldiers into June-bugs, as you promised. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not, <b>then</b> I will flog you--as I promised." ...|$|R
