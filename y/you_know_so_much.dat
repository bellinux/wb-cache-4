2500|$|Gordon Parks was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film, and though he was disillusioned by his experience {{with the release of}} his 1976 feature film Leadbelly, he anticipated a different experience in television. After not having directed a film in years, he returned to adapt the autobiography. The script mostly followed Northup's autobiography, though Parks had to change some parts. Parks said, [...] "Solomon was very tolerant in a terrible situation, and very fair in his reporting. I tried to remain fair in my reporting and not go overboard, although it's very difficult not to when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> happened that was so bad to so many people. But there were things I had to change." [...] Five historical advisers assisted with the film, though Parks said he felt pressured [...] "to keep it toned down".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, of course," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "And really, since <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> {{it is not}} {{necessary}} for me to tell you anything more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, mother," [...] cried Henry, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{about him}} {{you must know}} that, {{whatever}} he was in time past, he is the pirate Durward now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope not, for I {{have always}} loved you, and have always wished that <b>you</b> should <b>know</b> it. But <b>you</b> changed to me a little, shortly before you left home. Not that I {{wondered}} at it. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> and I <b>knew</b> <b>so</b> little, {{and it was}} so natural in many ways, going as you were among other friends, that I had nothing to complain of, and was not at all hurt.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, my boy. This is {{information}} worth having about his sight," [...] said Wilson. [...] "How came <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much?</b> Who are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> ... {{but perhaps it}} would not be right for me to say it ... I wish I knew--I wish I knew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, ma'am, since <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> you {{probably}} know also that I have sold my pension. How am I to live if I do not turn my hand to work?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I know I shall {{like you}} if--if {{you will not}} think me very stupid. I know so little, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> Must you always call me Miss Affleck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of my affairs, how do {{you know}} that this claim will ever be pressed for payment? How do you know it is not the advance of a--a--friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{while she}} deftly rearranged the bandages, {{the young man}} watched her curiously. Presently he asked, [...] "How came <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about these things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothin' except--But that doesn't matter," [...] replied Slone, cut to {{the quick}} by Bostil's scorn. [...] "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> an' <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are wrong, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in your views on the {{question}} itself--which, to tell the truth, I hardly understand as yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of Corphals, then," [...] he cried, [...] "you {{know that}} while no common man dare harm them {{they may be}} slain by {{the hand of a}} jeddak with impunity!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just tell me this," [...] said I, [...] "and since <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> you surely {{can tell}} it me--what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? What is he doing? Is he well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more {{on these}} {{subjects}} than I do, indeed, upon all subjects; {{you are so}} clever, that I do not despair, my dear Katherine, of your producing an impression on him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Verrian {{deferred}} {{a matter}} that would ordinarily have interested her supremely to an immediate curiosity. [...] "And how came she to think <b>you</b> would <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about Miss Shirley?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Keep {{your hair}} on! <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> jolly <b>much</b> more than I do. I {{tell you that}} she told me this {{and a lot more}} this morning when she asked me to marry her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{continued}} {{to handle the}} cigarette-case, without, however, having profited by its contents. [...] "I don't think that as regards Mr. Longdon and me <b>you</b> <b>know</b> quite <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as <b>you</b> suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, of course," [...] {{said the}} lady, vaguely, evidently assenting to the doctor's remark rather than expressing a {{conviction}} of her own. [...] "What profession would you advise for him? <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better than I." ...|$|E
6000|$|Clare {{lowered her}} eyes. Since Richter's visit, {{she had had}} {{disturbing}} doubts {{about the nature of}} Kenwardine's business; but after a few moments she asked in a hard, suspicious voice: [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about Mr. Brandon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} clever, and, as usual, wrong. Sir Charles {{has not gone}} to town. He has only gone to the railway station for some papers; he will be back for luncheon. How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of our affairs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Six feet {{forward of}} the boiler is where we must search, and I'd better make the first attempt, for I can tell just {{what part of the}} {{machinery}} is in our road, while the rest of <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It matters {{above all}} things;--above all things, because as to them you {{may come to}} {{something}} like certainty. Of {{the inside of her}} heart <b>you</b> cannot <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> The fact I take it is this--that you would wish to escape from this bondage." ...|$|R
6000|$|Marian looked incredulously at him. [...] "I am {{sure you}} are joking," [...] she said. [...] "Lord Carbury says <b>you</b> <b>know</b> ever <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more than he does. I suppose I asked a stupid question. What are those reels of green silk for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> you scoundrelly thief, {{you know}} that my father will not honor a draft for such a sum as you demand. I doubt if my father would pay a single dollar to save me from assassination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I did. 'Rast {{wanted to}} get her in at Elmhurst, to watch what Forbes was doing to defeat him, so he made me write the letter. But how'd <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about this girl?" [...] she inquired, with sudden suspicion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, very well, then!" [...] {{said the}} papa. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{more about it}} than I do! Who's telling this story, anyway? Now I shall {{have to go back}} to the beginning. Once there was a little Pony En--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{you about}} them, dear lady? Shall I carry {{perfumes}} to the rose? What can I {{tell you that}} <b>you</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better than myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{thought of}} you always. That's why I feel I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better now. I don't change. What I felt once, I feel always." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With disapproval. Who {{are those}} Puritans {{you are talking}} about? But wait--how did <b>you</b> come to <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about this family? Where did you get all this hearsay evidence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Please how do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> {{since my}} case {{has not yet}} arrived?' asked Tabitha, tossing her head a little disdainfully, but less than she might have done {{if he had not}} {{obtained}} a charter for his discourse by giving her the bracelet.|$|E
6000|$|He {{became quite}} serious. [...] "I {{wish you would}} advise me. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more about the whole subject than I do. I'm eager {{to get to work}} on the books. I suppose it is too much to expect that they will come up to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wanderer, {{there are}} such reasons; and since <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> you shall learn them also. Like that husband of mine, I have become mad. When first I saw the face of your companion, as I dragged him from the river, madness entered me, and I--I----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It costs a heap to go there--didn't <b>know</b> <b>you</b> had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money," [...] put in Guardley, with a {{smile that}} neither Earl nor Randy appreciated.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not <b>know</b> <b>you</b> cared <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{about them}} at Manchester," [...] said Endymion. [...] "I {{thought it was}} Birmingham that was chiefly {{interested}} about currency." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, uncle, I {{had almost}} {{forgotten}} about it, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I've been <b>so</b> <b>much</b> engaged {{during the last}} few days in visiting my old friends and college companions, that--" ...|$|R
