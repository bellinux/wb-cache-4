5|$|All {{candidate}} theories {{still have}} major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as <b>yet,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{no way to}} put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, {{but they are not}} a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. <b>Yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> at least one example of a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) preys on adult, nestling, and fledgling Australian ravens, while the little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides) also takes nestlings, and {{powerful}} owl (Ninox strenua) {{has been recorded}} killing adults; other birds of prey are seen as threats, <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no evidence they have successfully preyed on the ravens. The introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) competes with the Australian raven for carrion and can drive it off. It may also kill young birds that it catches on the ground. The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) has been recorded as a brood parasite.|$|E

5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{presents}} {{an illustration of}} unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. Weeders {{do not want to}} select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like cultivated plants, <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no other option. For example, the Echinochloa oryzoides plant, a species of grass found as a weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields, looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, {{as in the case of}} rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.|$|E
5|$|In 244 CE, Philip the Arab {{transformed}} Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis. It retained this status {{until the}} rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE. As <b>yet,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.|$|E

Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

5|$|TY Coronae Borealis is a {{pulsating}} {{white dwarf}} (of ZZ Ceti) type, which is around 70% as massive as the Sun, yet has only 1.1% of its diameter. Discovered in 1990, UW Coronae Borealis is a low-mass X-ray binary system {{composed of a}} star less massive than the Sun and a neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk that draws material from the companion star. It varies in brightness in an unusually complex manner: the two stars orbit each other every 111 minutes, <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> another cycle of 112.6 minutes, which corresponds to the orbit of the disk around the degenerate star. The beat period of 5.5 days indicates the time the accretion disk—which is asymmetrical—takes to precess around the star.|$|E

5|$|Roadways, wooden bridges, postal {{stations}}, and relay {{stations were}} occasionally repaired, while many new facilities {{such as these}} were established. As written by Han authors, roads built during the Han were tamped down with metal rammers, <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> uncertainty over the materials used; Joseph Needham speculates that they were rubble and gravel. The widths of roads ranged from narrow footpaths where only a single horse or oxen could pass at once to large highways that could accommodate the simultaneous passage of nine horse-drawn chariots abreast. Fortified Han roadways were built as far west as Shanshan (Loulan) near the Lop Desert, while Han forces utilized routes that traversed north of the Taklamakan Desert towards Kashgar. A vast network of roads, fortified passes, and wooden bridges built over rushing torrents in steep gorges of the Qin Mountains was consolidated during the Han, known as the gallery roads. During the reign of Emperor Wu, roads were built to connect newly conquered territories {{in what is now}} Yunnan in the far southwest as well as the Korean Peninsula in the far northeast.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the United Nations created Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 {{to improve}} {{maternal}} health. Target 5A sought to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters from 1990 to 2015, using two indicators, 5.1 the MMR and 5.2 {{the proportion of}} deliveries attended by skilled health personnel (physician, nurse or midwife). Early reports indicated MDG 5 had made the least progress of all MDGs. By the target date of 2015 the MMR had only declined by 45%, from 380 to 210, most of which occurred after 2000. However this improvement occurred across all regions, but the highest MMRs were still in Africa and Asia, although South Asia witnessed the largest fall, from 530 to 190 (64%). The smallest decline {{was seen in the}} developed countries, from 26 to 16 (37%). In terms of assisted births, this proportion had risen globally from 59 to 71%. Although the numbers were similar for both developed and developing regions, there were wide variations in the latter from 52% in South Asia to 100% in East Asia. The risks of dying in pregnancy in developing countries remains fourteen times higher than in developed countries, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the MMR is highest, the risk is 175 times higher. In setting the MDG targets, skilled assisted birth was considered a key strategy, but also an indicator of access to care and closely reflect mortality rates. There are also marked differences within regions with a 31% lower rate in rural areas of developing countries (56 vs. 87%), <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no difference in East Asia but a 52% difference in Central Africa (32 vs. 84%). With the completion of the MDG campaign in 2015, new targets are being set for 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals campaign. Maternal health is placed under Goal 3, Health, with the target being to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70. Amongst tools being developed to meet these targets is the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He (d. 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E
