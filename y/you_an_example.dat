No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that {{and get rid}} of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
500|$|The Gospels relate {{that on the}} eve of his Crucifixion, Jesus Christ ate a {{meal with}} his disciples. [...] After the meal, it is {{recorded}} that Jesus washed their feet, and gave them the following mandatum or command: [...] "If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. [...] For I have given <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> that ye should do as I have done unto you." [...] Mandatum is the derivation of the word [...] "Maundy", and the Royal Maundy service evolved from Jesus' command to his disciples.|$|E
2500|$|Fr. Hubert Célis of Halmaal {{was arrested}} for {{harbouring}} Jewish children, but was released after confronting his interrogator with the following words: [...] "You are a Catholic, and have forgotten that the Virgin was a Jewess, that Christ was Jewish, that He commanded us to love and help one another... That He told us: 'I have given <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> {{so that you do}} as I have done'... You are a Catholic, and you do not understand what a priest is! You do not understand that a priest does not betray!".|$|E

2500|$|As an Illinois State Senator, Obama {{supported}} Senate bill 0099 for [...] "age and developmentally appropriate" [...] sex education, {{which would}} have allowed parents to choose to withdraw their children from the classes. The bill was endorsed by the Illinois Parent Teacher Association, the Illinois State Medical Society, the Illinois Public Health Association, and the Illinois Education Association. In a debate in 2004, when questioned by Alan Keyes {{about what kind of}} sex education was [...] "age appropriate" [...] for kindergarteners, Obama said, [...] "I'll give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> because I have a six-year-old daughter and a three-year-old daughter, {{and one of the things}} my wife and I talked to our daughter about is the possibility of somebody touching them inappropriately, and what that might mean. And that was included specifically in the law, so that kindergarteners are able to exercise some possible protection against abuse...." [...] In 2007, in response to a similar attack from Mitt Romney, an Obama spokesperson stated his position that communities should determine the curriculum. The Illinois bill did not call for addressing all sex-related issues in kindergarten classes, and Obama has said that he [...] "does not support teaching explicit sex education to children in kindergarten." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When Jesus Christ took a {{towel and}} girded himself, poured water into a basin, and washed his disciples' feet, he {{performed}} a significant and sacramental act, which no man or woman should ever forget. If wealth and rank and power absolve from the services of life, then certainly were Jesus Christ absolved, as he says: 'Ye call me Master, and Lord. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> that ye should do as I have done to you.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seems to}} me (to speak with all reverence) as if God had said to the Jews, 'I have set you free. I will make of you a great nation; I will lead you into a good land and large.

You are determined to give me no information to the prejudice of Rosanna Spearman, because {{she has been a}} good girl to YOU, and because you pity her heartily. Those humane considerations do you a world of credit, but they happen in this instance to be humane considerations clean thrown away.

You're wrong, all wrong. You make the mistake of all Gringos in thinking a Mexican is a white man. He ain't. None of them ain't--Greasers, Spiggoties, Latin-Americans {{and all the rest of}} the cattle. Why, sir, they don't think like we think, or reason, or act. Even their multiplication table is different. You think seven times seven is forty-nine; but not them. They work it out different. And white isn't white to them, either.

60|$|Do you not {{understand}} me? Then I will give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example.</b> Suppose {{the case of}} a man hurting his health by self-indulgence of any kind. Then his adversaries are the laws of health. Let him agree with them quickly, while he has the power of conquering his bad habits, by recovering his health, lest the time come when his own sins deliver him up to God his judge; and God to His terrible officers of punishment, the laws of Disease; and they cast him into a prison of shame and misery from which there is no escape--shame and misery, most common perhaps among the lower classes: but not altogether confined to them--the weakened body, the bleared eye, the stupified brain, the premature death, the children unhealthy from their parents' sins, despising their parents, and perhaps copying their vices at the same time. Many a man have I seen in that prison, fast bound with misery though not with iron, and how he was to pay his debt and escape out of it I know not, though I hope that God does know.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is hard {{sense in}} {{all we have}} heard, but I think Leland's {{point of view is}} nearest the Academic one," [...] he said. [...] "Every honest man has a duty to the State, and it is {{certainly}} going to cost him more than he gains if he won't discharge it. There are probably more honest men than rogues everywhere, and yet one usually sees the rogues uppermost, for this reason: the honest man won't worry so long as they don't rob him, and his neighbour can't make a fight alone. Nobody is anxious to face the first blow {{for the benefit of the}} rest, and so the rogue gets bolder, until he becomes intolerable. Then the honest man stirs himself, and the rogues go down, though it causes ever so much more trouble than it would have done if the thing had been undertaken earlier. I'll give <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example.</b> Begbie hung a man in British Columbia, the first one who wanted it, and there was order at once. Coleman and his vigilantes, who were scarcely quick enough, had to hang them by the dozen in California.
