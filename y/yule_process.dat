There are many different ways to build a network with a power-law degree distribution. The <b>Yule</b> <b>process</b> is a canonical generative process for power laws, and has been known since 1925. However, it is known by many other names due to its frequent reinvention, e.g., The Gibrat principle by Herbert A.

Recently, Hyperbolic Geometric Graphs have been suggested as yet another way of constructing scale-free networks.|$|E

40|$|We are {{interested}} in {{a variation of the}} SIR (Susceptible/Infected/Recovered) dynamics on the complete graph, in which infected individuals may only spread to neighboring susceptible individuals at fixed rate λ> 0 while recovered individuals may only spread to neighboring infected individuals at fixed rate 1. This is also a variant of the so-called chase-escape process introduced by Kordzakhia and then Bordenave & Ganesan. Our work is the first study of this dynamics on complete graphs. Starting with one infected and one recovered individuals on the complete graph with N+ 2 vertices, and stopping the process when one type of individuals disappears, we study the asymptotic behavior of the probability that the infection spreads to the whole graph as N→∞ and show that for λ∈ (0, 1) (resp. for λ> 1), the infection dies out (resp. does not die out) with probability tending to one as N→∞, and that the probability that the infection dies out tends to 1 / 2 for λ= 1. We also establish limit theorems concerning the asymptotic state of the system in all regimes and show that two additional phase transitions occur in the subcritical phase λ∈ (0, 1) : at λ= 1 / 2 the behavior of the expected number of remaining infected individuals changes, while at λ=(√(5) - 1) / 2 the behavior of the expected number of remaining recovered individuals changes. We also study the outbreak sizes of the infection, and show that the outbreak sizes are small if λ∈(0, 1 / 2], exhibit a power-law behavior for 1 / 2 <λ< 1, and are pandemic for λ≥ 1.

40|$|Abstract. The {{history of}} life is the chronicle of diversification. Each taxonomic group {{originates}} from a single ancestor and diversifies {{into a number of}} species. The evolutionary process, with its two major components (speciation and extinction), is the force working behind. Several models, i. e. explicit mathematical statements of a hypothesis, have been developed in order to inspect the likely output of the evolutionary process and to compare it with actual diversity patterns observed in Nature. The British statistician George Udny Yule produced one of the earliest attempts of such models, now known as the <b>Yule</b> <b>Process,</b> which leads to the Yule-Simon Distribution. His model and the aforementioned probability distribution belong, as well as the Zeta Distribution used in this contribution, to the large family of Power Laws. It focuses on the distribution of the size (= number of species) of genera within a taxonomic group. Here, the data of the nonmarine ostracod family Candoninae are discussed {{within the framework of the}} <b>Yule</b> <b>Process.</b> Beyond explaining the mathematical basis of the model and how to estimate the parameter of both distributions, the fit or lack-of-fit of the <b>Yule</b> <b>Process</b> (the latter used as a neutral model) is further considered as a test for the suitability of the taxonomy of the group currently accepted. Biological/evolutionary factors (like the existence of large endemic flocks of species in ancient lakes) combined with socio-psychological factors (like the principle of Authority) are here reviewed as potential sources of taxonomic misrepresentation. Special attention is devoted to monotypic genera within the Candoninae; their relevance for understanding current taxonomic patterns is largely discussed. The utility of the <b>Yule</b> <b>Process,</b> namely, the Yule-Simon Distribution, as reference background against which to compare taxonomic patterns in the Candoninae, opens new possibilities for the analysis of the evolutionary and epistemological problems of ostracod studies. It is concluded, that the taxonomic system currently accepted for that subfamily must be renewed including: the re-examination of the diagnostic criteria used a restatement of the taxonomic meaning of the species-rich lineages endemic to ancient lakes, the increased cooperation between neontologists and palaeontologists to produce common-based taxonomic criteria, the addition of new sources of taxonomic information (morphometric, molecular, etc.) and the adoption of ideas and/or methods specific to phylogenetic systematics...|$|E
40|$|Consider {{the sum of}} $d$ many i. i. d. random {{permutation}} matrices on $n$ labels {{along with}} their transposes. The resulting matrix is the adjacency matrix of a random regular (multi) -graph of degree $ 2 d$ on $n$ vertices. It is known that the distribution of smooth linear eigenvalue statistics of this matrix is given asymptotically by sums of Poisson random variables. This is in contrast with Gaussian fluctuation of similar quantities {{in the case of}} Wigner matrices. It is also known that for Wigner matrices the joint fluctuation of linear eigenvalue statistics across minors of growing sizes can be expressed in terms of the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). In this article, we explore joint asymptotic (in $n$) fluctuation for a coupling of all random regular graphs of various degrees obtained by growing each component permutation according to the Chinese Restaurant Process. Our primary result is that the corresponding eigenvalue statistics can be expressed in terms of a family of independent <b>Yule</b> <b>processes</b> with immigration.

40|$|A single permutation, seen as {{union of}} {{disjoint}} cycles, represents a regular graph of degree two. Consider $d$ many independent random permutations and superimpose their graph structures. It {{is a common}} model of a random regular (multi-) graph of degree $ 2 d$. We consider the following dynamics. The dimension (i. e. size) of each permutation grows by coupled Chinese Restaurant Processes, while in time each permutation evolves according to the random transposition chain. Asymptotically {{in the size of}} the graph one observes a remarkable evolution of short cycles and linear eigenvalue statistics in dimension and time. In dimension, it was shown by Johnson and Pal (2014) that cycle counts are described by a Poisson field of <b>Yule</b> <b>processes.</b> Here, we give a Poisson random surface description in dimension and time of the limiting cycle counts for every $d$. As $d$ grows to infinity, the fluctuation of the limiting cycle counts, across dimension, converges to the Gaussian Free Field. In time this field is preserved by a stationary Gaussian dynamics. The laws of these processes are similar to eigenvalue fluctuations of the minor process of a real symmetric Wigner matrix whose coordinates evolve as i. i. d. stationary stochastic processes.

40|$|We use embeddings in {{continuous}} time Branching processes to derive asymptotics for various statistics associated with different models of preferential attachment. This powerful method {{allows us to}} deduce, with very little effort, under a common framework, not only local characteristics for a wide class of scale free trees, but also global characteristics such as {{the height of the}} tree, maximal degree, and the size and structure of the percolation component attached to the root. We exhibit our computations for a number of different graph models of preferential attachment. En-route we get exact results for a large number of preferential attachment models including not only the usual preferential attachment but also the preferential attachment with fitness as introduced by Barabasi et al ([6]) and the Competition Induced Preferential attachment of Berger et al ([5]) to name just two. While most of the techniques currently in vogue gain access to the asymptotic degree distribution of the tree, we show how the embedding techniques reveal significantly more information both on local and global characteristics of these trees. Again very soft arguments give us the asymptotic degree distribution and size of the maximal degree in some Preferential attachment network models (not just trees) formulated by Cooper and Frieze [11] and van der Hofstad et al [12].

After providing an introduction to Bayesian theory in this context, I attempt to tackle the problem mentioned most often in the literature: the "problem of the priors" —how to assign prior probabilities to tree hypotheses. I first argue that a recent objection— that an appropriate assignment of priors is impossible— is based on a misunderstanding of what ignorance and bias are. I then consider different methods of assigning prior probabilities to trees. I argue that priors need to be derived from an understanding of how distinct taxa have evolved and that the appropriate evolutionary model is captured by the <b>Yule</b> birth–death <b>process.</b> This process leads to a well-known statistical distribution over trees.

40|$|Human beings tend to {{cooperate}} with close friends, therefore they have to construct strong social relationships to recieve cooperation from others. Therefore they should have acquired their strategies of social relationship construction through an evolutionary process. The behavior of social relationship construction is know as "social grooming. " In this paper, we show that there are four classes including a human-like strategy in evolutionary dynamics of social grooming strategies based on an evolutionary game simulation. Social relationship strengths (as measured by frequency of social grooming) often show a much skewed distribution (a power law distribution). It {{may be due to}} time costs constraints on social grooming, because the costs are too large to ignore for having many strong social relationships. Evolution of humans' strategies of construction of social relationships may explain the origin of human intelligence based on a social brain hypothesis. We constructed an individual-based model to explore the evolutionary dynamics of social grooming strategies. The model is based on behavior to win over others by strengthening social relationships with cooperators. The results of evolutionary simulations show the four classes of evolutionary dynamics.

40|$|Word is {{an element}} of {{language}} that is used by human being to communicate in society. As an element of language, word occasionally experiences some alterations in entering the language. The phenomenon of new words appears not only in a real life but also in fiction. One of the phenomena of language development in a fiction is the existence of new words in a new language called Sindarin. Sindarin is a Grey-elven language, constructed deliberately to resemble Welsh phonologically and to have a relation to High-elven similar to that existing between British (properly so-called, sc. the Celtic languages spoken in this island {{at the time of the}} Roman Invasion) and Latin. This language is a kind of Elvish language written by J. R. R. Tolkien in his novel with the same title with the movie. This study aimed at analyzing word-formation processes on words in sindarin language that was used by the elf characters in the movie of “The Lord of The Rings – The Two Towers”. This research focused on finding the word- formation processes in sindarin words and the meanings of those words in the movie since those words were totally coming from a new language. The result of the study is expected to enrich the studies about linguistics. This study used descriptive qualitative research as the research design because it was intended to describe the current phenomenon. This research was intended to analyze the word-formation processes in Sindarin words used by the elf characters in the movie. The object of this study was the Sindarin language used by the elf characters in the movie. However, there was a non-elf character, Aragorn, who was able to speak sindarin based on the story. The involvement of this character as the object of study was because he had many dialogs using sindarin in the movie. As the research instrument, the writer was documenting script and film, since this research decided the Sindarin words used by the elf characters in the movie into word-formation processes as well as their meaning. There were found 115 Sindarin words in “The Lord of The Ring – The Two Towers” movie.
