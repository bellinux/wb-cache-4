I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
500|$|At the Stop the War Conference 2009, he {{described}} the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as [...] "Imperialist war(s)" [...] and discussed the killing of American and allied troops by Iraqi or foreign insurgents, questioning whether they were in fact freedom fighters, and comparing the insurgents to a British Dad's Army, saying: [...] "If you are invaded <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to self-defence, and this idea that people in Iraq and Afghanistan who are resisting the invasion are militant Muslim extremists is a complete bloody lie. I joined Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window. Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist?" ...|$|E
500|$|In June, a {{group of}} 132 {{supporters}} of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican party national convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Republican National Committee and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose Mitt Romney as the party’s presidential nominee. The suit alleged {{that there had been}} “a systematic campaign of election fraud at state conventions,” employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in procedural rules, allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor Doug Wead had voiced support for the legal action. Paul himself told CNN that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign’s strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, {{he was not going to}} tell his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. “If they’re not following the rules, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to stand up for the rules. I think for the most part these winning caucuses that we've been involved in we have followed the rules. And the other side has at times not followed the rules.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> {{to do what}} you please about it. It's none of the hands' {{business}} if you don't choose to ask them." ...|$|R
6000|$|She went away, {{and shortly}} {{returned}} with a dry--"Miss Marget, the lady {{will be glad to}} see you; and that's more, my young madam, than <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to count upon." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a March 2, 2011 interview, {{when asked}} whether the {{government}} should provide financial aid to a poor student with good grades who wants to further his education, Paul responded that no, the government should not because “nobody {{has a right to}} someone else's wealth. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to your life and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to your property but you don't have a – education isn't a right. Medical care isn't a right. These are things you have to earn." [...] (He went on to explain that there were no government loans when he went to school, yet education costs were much lower {{and he was able to}} finance his medical school education by obtaining private loans through the medical school.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Wales then {{provided}} further explanation, {{drawing a}} comparison with Wikipedia: [...] "You {{do not have}} a right to use the law to prevent Wikipedia editors from writing truthful information, nor do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to use the law to prevent Google from publishing truthful information." [...] Wales concluded with an indication of his ideal outcome: [...] "A part of the outcome should be the very strong implementation of a right to free speech in Europe—essentially the language of the First Amendment in the U.S." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Redford is, of course, {{ignorant of}} Mrs. Mannering's antecedents. What you may do {{yourself}} concerns no one. You {{make your own}} social laws, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to. But I {{do not think that}} even <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to pass Blanche Phillimore on to your friends, even under the shelter of Mannering's name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think we}} shall be jealous,' was the happy answer. 'Arthur is very proud of your admiration of Master Johnnie. <b>You</b> know we <b>have</b> always felt as if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> in him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were not}} doing what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to do. <b>You</b> were {{assisting}} to create a riot," [...] said the magistrate, with that indignation which a London magistrate should always know how to affect.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see it all!" [...] exclaimed the repentant Betts--"FEEL it all, dearest, dearest Mademoiselle Hennequin; and I {{hope this}} {{exquisite}} work, this refined taste brought all the comfort and reward <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to anticipate." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Mr. Brown, I {{have been}} seldom--never--so much surprised; certainly, sir, in {{whatever}} passed between us <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to command my favourable testimony.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to feel bitter, Uncle Lester," [...] {{returned}} Phil, {{who could}} realize how his relative had suffered. [...] "But it's all past now, {{and you must}} give up your life here and come home with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to forgive," [...] he insisted. [...] "You asked for an {{explanation}} to which <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right.</b> I <b>have</b> tried {{to give it to}} you. Indeed, Julia, <b>you</b> need <b>have</b> no fear. Whatever I decide in life will be what I think best for our cause." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have missed}} {{nothing of the}} {{slightest}} importance," [...] returned Sir Patrick. [...] "I <b>have</b> placed <b>you</b> in possession of facts which <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to know; and we have now only to return to our medical friend's report on Blanche's health. You were about to favor me, I think, with the Prognosis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You quite resent such a suggestion: <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to. I {{beg your}} pardon, not for {{speaking}} of it, but for thinking it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right,</b> my dear young friend. But Mr. Fitzgerald, {{for your}} own sake, for all our sakes, wait patiently for a few hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Reasonable--{{reasonable}}? Yes, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to say that, for you {{are full}} of reason. But so am I. What I ask is within reasonable limits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, madam, you've {{never been}} in bed this blessed night," [...] burst out Tantripp, looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea's face, which in spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater dolorosa. [...] "You'll kill {{yourself}}, you will. Anybody might think now <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to give yourself a little comfort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} failed," [...] he continued, [...] "in the {{courtesy}} and gratitude <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> {{to expect from}} me, because, knowing how you were situated with Mr. Sherwin's daughter, I thought any intrusion on my part, while you were with the young lady, {{might not be so}} acceptable as you, Sir, in your kindness, were willing to lead me to believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{formally}} made them,' said Albinia; 'but <b>you</b> cannot <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to the baptismal blessings, {{except on}} those conditions.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it is your}} bunk," [...] {{said the}} captain, sternly, [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to it. But perhaps you'll sell it to me? How much?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s your stable," [...] said Mr. Quince, {{opening his}} eyes and {{speaking}} with great deliberation, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to lock it up when you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Divorce!" [...] Elinor {{looked at}} him in dismay. He was unmoved. Then her gaze fell slowly, and she said: [...] "Yes: I suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to that." ...|$|E
60|$|That's {{the least}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to expect of me. I did {{you a great}} wrong in marrying you. I knew you didn't love me. You were dazzled by the circumstances. You didn't know what {{marriage}} was and how irksome it must be unless love makes its constraints sweeter than freedom. But I adored you. I thought love would come. With all my heart I ask you to forgive me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly so. Where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> clear <b>right</b> {{to forbid}} {{anything}} that might be hurtful to the settlement, I'd be sorry to interfere." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{man from}} Kansas, mind <b>you,</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to speak. He knew French. He had learned French--he {{told me so}} himself--good French, at the Fayetteville Classical Academy. Later on he had had the natural method [...] "off" [...] a man from New Orleans. It had cost him [...] "fifty cents a throw." [...] All this I have on his own word. But in France {{something}} seemed to go wrong with his French.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all, we {{are real}} friends.... We have this common memory.... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to know.... I don't {{want you to}} think----Life is such a muddle, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of {{your duty}} in that regard. She got on without you for ten years. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to {{consider}} yourself. You don't belong here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was stolen}} from you," [...] Weiss said. [...] "He may justly decline to treat with us; but it is your property, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... ”You are brave to fight. Good to fallen enemy. You are {{directed}} by the Great Spirit. Indians do not <b>have</b> pity on <b>a</b> fallen enemy. By our law, it is clear. It is contrary to our law to show foul play. She began with <b>you,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to kill her. Your noble spirit forbad you. When Indians fight, the conqueror gives or takes the life {{of his or her}} antagonist, and they seldom spare them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] Weiss said, [...] "what about that paper we signed? I can {{understand}} your wanting {{to hold it}} over us while we were at war. It was a fair weapon, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to it, but now we are united again you can see, of course, that although your name isn't on it, it would practically mean ruin to our interests if the other side once got hold of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucky for you you did. Lucky for <b>you</b> [...] <b>You</b> <b>had</b> us for <b>a</b> half-way station [...] To stop at. If {{you were}} {{the kind of man}} [...] Paid heed to women, you'd take my advice [...] And for your family's sake stay where you are. [...] But what good is my saying it over and over? [...] You've done more than <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to think [...] You could do--now. You know the risk you take [...] In going on." ...|$|R
