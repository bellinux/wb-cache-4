5000|$|In 2011, it was {{announced}} that actor-director Mel Gibson had commissioned a screenplay from Eszterhas: a historical biopic on Judah and The Maccabees, titled M.C.K.B.I. The film was to be distributed by Warner Bros. The announcement generated controversy. In a 2008 interview, Eszterhas had written that [...] "Mel shared the mind-set of Adolf Hitler." [...] In a February 2012 interview with Andrew Goldman of The New York Times, Goldman said to Eszterhas: [...] "Gibson's film The Passion of the Christ was widely considered anti-Semitic. Then, during a 2006 arrest for drunken driving, he ranted that 'the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.' Is he the right director?" [...] Eszterhas' reply was: [...] "... Adam Fogelson, Universal Pictures' chairman, said to Gibson, 'Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> story?" [...] Mel said, 'Because I think I should.' I liked that answer very much." [...] When asked about their shared Catholic faith, Eszterhas said of Gibson, [...] "In my mind, his Catholicism is a figment of his imagination." [...] By April 2012, Warner Bros. had cancelled the project; the film's last draft was dated February 20, 2012. Eszterhas claimed that the break was caused by Gibson's violent outbursts and anti-Semitism, while Gibson blamed a bad script. Eszterhas later wrote a book Heaven and Mel about his experiences working with Gibson.|$|E

[...] "I wasn't worried about whether the character was a gay person or not; the reason I turned it down, frankly, is I read the script and I didn't think much happened in it. I just thought it was kind of tame." [...] After he discussed the script with Carol Rossen, who was to become his second wife, she responded, [...] "You're going to get on the phone and call Hollywood and tell them <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> part before they give it to somebody else," [...] and Holbrook did just that. He felt an emotional connection to the character in the film because at the time he had separated from his first wife and he hadn't told his two young children about the split. [...] "It was very easy and natural for me to translate the emotional turmoil I personally was feeling into the turmoil Doug was feeling." [...] The film remains important to him because it meant so much to so many people. [...] "That's a good reason for being an actor, when you can do something decent that touches people's hearts and their minds, so you feel like you actually accomplished something," [...] he says.|$|E
5000|$|John Quiñones {{was born}} in San Antonio, Texas on May 23, 1952. He is a {{fifth-generation}} San Antonian and a fifth-generation American, Quiñones {{grew up in a}} Spanish-speaking household and did not learn English until he started school at age 6. When he was 13 years old, his father was laid off from his job as a janitor and John's family, including sisters Irma and Rosemary, joined a caravan of migrant farmworkers and journeyed to Traverse City, Michigan to harvest cherries. Later that summer, the Quiñones family followed the migrant route to pick tomatoes outside of Toledo, Ohio. John will never forget the words from his father, Bruno early one morning as they knelt on the cold, hard ground of Ohio's tomato fields. [...] "Juanito, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> {{for the rest of your}} life? Or, do you want to get a college education?" [...] It was a no-brainer. Determined to overcome the current Hispanic stereotypes of being uneducated, he decided to attend college. While attending Brackenridge High School in San Antonio, Quiñones was selected to take part in the federal anti-poverty program, Upward Bound, which prepared inner-city high school students for college. [...] "Upward Bound saved my life," [...] he says. John attended St. Mary's University, in San Antonio. As an undergraduate, Quiñones was also a member of the Sigma Beta-Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. After graduating from St. Mary's with a bachelor's degree in Speech Communication, Quiñones earned his master's degree from Columbia University's School of Journalism.|$|E

First we explain where the concurrency in a system comes from, and discuss the main ways to express concurrency. Then we describe the difference between ‘hard ’ and ‘easy ’ concurrency 1 : the latter is done by locking shared data before you touch it, the former in subtle ways that are so error-prone that simple prudence requires correctness proofs. We give the rules for easy concurrency using locks, and discuss various issues that complicate the easy life: scheduling, locking granularity, and deadlocks. Sources of concurrency Before studying concurrency in detail, it seems useful to consider how you might get concurrency in your system. Obviously if you have a multiprocessor or a distributed system you will have concurrency, since in these systems {{there is more than one}} CPU executing instructions. Similarly, most hardware has separate parts that can change state simultaneously and independently. But suppose your system consists of a single CPU running a program.

40|$|Background: Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{usually involves}} homework, {{the completion of}} which is a known predictor of a positive outcome. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in depressed people through the course of therapy. Methods: Working people with subthreshold depression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: "How strongly do you feel <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> homework?" and "How confident do you feel you can actually accomplish this homework?" at the end of each session. The outcome was the K 6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K 6 is an index of psychological distress including depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K 6 scores from session to session. Results: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of behavior therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K 6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K 6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. Conclusions: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week.

There’s no heat in this damned barracks and I’m {{freezing}} to death. I[t] must be forty below outside, and about fifty below in here. There’s {{something wrong with the}} hairy furnace. I guess I’ll just have to go down and fix it, or should I? Sorry I didn’t write last night, hon, but I planned to after the show, and it wasn’t over until after taps. As you know I saw “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo” it was wonderful. You ought to see it hon, it seemed to {{have a lot to do}} with us, angel, only I hope we have a happier ending than that. The weather has been lousey [sic] today, it’s been snowing off and on all day, and cold as hell. I didn’t fly today, but got in two hours of solo formation yesterday. How can I talk about the weather when I’m writing to you? Gosh I love you darling, if I could only tell or show you how much. Frank Sinatra is singing “Night 2 ̆ 6 Day” now. Gosh I {{wish you were}} here, I’m cold, and very lonely. Just like Frankie says, hon, I think of you Day and Night. The time we’re apart seems like an eternity to me. I just can’t seem to see enough of you. You’re so wonderful to be with. Every weekend I seem to find something new about you that makes me love you even more than before. You’re just too marvelous, darling. Too wonderful, too glamorous, and that old standby—amorous; to be true. Hmm—that line sound[s] familiar to me, but no matter who I stole it from it’s the truth;—the way I feel about you darling,—I love you: That’s the easiest way to explain it I guess.

I can talk to you Thursday about it sweetheart. There’s some lousey [sic] rumor monger around here sayin’ that we’re going to fly this weekend. Maybe we’ll have to, gosh I hope not, we’ve got such little time left, darling: but you can’t argue with the Army. Pray for good weather this week.

I didn’t do anything I had planned to. Was {{going to get}} all my Christmas cards addressed but maybe I’ll get that done tomorrow. Honestly, I just can’t understand where the day went. Whenever I’m home the day goes so much faster. Tomorrow I have an appointment for the doctor’s but I’m going to call him 2 ̆ 6 see if I can make it Wednesday instead. Golly, honey, I hope all this week will go as fast as today did. It’s wonderful how fast they [sic] days go. I’ll have to stay home from work more often—Hah— Just talked to Charlotte 2 ̆ 6 Bobbie. Gee, honey, I miss you so much. You’re so wonderful and it’s so hard to be away from you. I love you so. You’re a bad boy. Why didn’t you buy your own Christmas presents? Calling Bobby up 2 ̆ 6 getting her to do it. Fine thing. Honey, what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> weekend? Ace may be home on Saturday. He has a chance of getting three planes. I wish you were coming home for seven days now, honey. That would be marvelous. Well, we really did have a lot of time, I guess. I[t] doesn’t seem as though we did but I guess we were pretty lucky. Gee, honey, I love you so. It’s so lonesome without you. How many times have I said that 2 ̆ 6 that I love you—I wonder. Millions probably. Woody should call any minute now 2 ̆ 6 let me know how she made out in school today. She was really tired. I was too but I slept until nine today. It was nice to lie in bed and {{not have to worry about}} getting up. Eileen Billet announced her engagement this weekend—we beat her to it. I’ll have to read it again and see when they’re getting married. I wish we were getting married Christmas but I suppose everything happens for the best. Honey, do you think we’ll be able to go south for our honeymoon? I hope that you’re stationed down there 2 ̆ 6 we’ll be able to get there that way. Have your orders come through from Maxwell Field yet? I’ll be praying that they do before Friday. Today was a horrible day. Looked as though it would rain or snow any second. How was it up at Stewart? Did you fly today? I wish that you’d get those couple of hours in and be able to come home early for Christmas. Honey, I wish you were here now. Gee, we could have a fire in the fireplace 2 ̆ 6 lie in front of it. Just you and I and grandmaw—nice and cozy like. Vaughn Monroe is playing “The Love I Longed For. ” All we did this weekend was ride in taxis. Gee, I love you so. Honey, please get some sleep this week; you were so tired this weekend. Do your ears still ring? Gee, honey, I can’t consentrate [sic] on anything but you. I love you so. It’s getting worse 2 ̆ 6 worse—I can’t even read or write anyone but you. The letters I write are all about you or to you. Do you want to go to the Meadowbrook this weekend? Should I call 2 ̆ 6 make reservations? How do you make them[?] Just ask them for a table for four? I’ve never had to but I imagined that’s the way. Gee, I’ve been sitting here 2 ̆ 6 looking at my ring. It[‘s] so beautiful, honey. Gee, I love you so. It will be so nice to see you for a few days, I hope, this Christmas. I wish we never had to be separated. Hon, this war seems endless. It’s just been going on for so long that it doesn’t ever want to stop. Golly, I’ll be the happiest person in the world when this war ends 2 ̆ 6 we can be together forever. Won’t it be marvelous not to watch [the] clock 2 ̆ 6 rush to catch trains 2 ̆ 6 being able to be together whenever we want to be. Have to call your mother now. Be back in a while. I love you so, honey. Well, hon, I’m back again. I love you so. Think I’ll go to the city tomorrow 2 ̆ 6 do a little Christmas shopping. That should be a nice job for a commando. The stores are really mobbed at this time of year. You should see the millions of people in one store, all after the same thing—It’s murder. Honey, if you’re home after Christmas on Tuesday, we should go 2 ̆ 6 look at wedding rings. We won’t have time to do it in March. You[‘ll] want to get married the day you get home won’t you or would you rather wait a few days 2 ̆ 6 get rested from the trip? Woody was real tired and said she’d write Steve tonight. Gee, honey, I wish you were going to be home all this week 2 ̆ 6 next week and the week after that 2 ̆ 6 every week. Anyway, I wish we could be together forever. Honey, I wish I could decide what to get Nanny 2 ̆ 6 Mom. I guess maybe if I go 2 ̆ 6 look around I might find something. Gee, hon, I love you so. I’ll never be able to tell you how much. There just aren’t words enough. I’ll have to spend the rest of my life trying to. What a wonderful way to spend a lifetime. Steve 2 ̆ 6 Woody seem to be getting along rather well. Really in the groove or are they more in a rut. Just found out that I started to make a list of people to send Christmas cards to on this paper. What a dope I am. It wouldn’t erase very well so please just ignore it. Gee, honey, this weekend went so darned fast. This was worse than any of them because we couldn’t be out late Saturday night. That wasn’t fair at all. Can’t write much more because I haven’t any more paper around. I was a good girl today and stayed off my ankle almost all day. I should get a good conduct ribbon for that. Honey, when I’m with you I’m so happy. Everything is wonderful as long as we can be together. Wonder what you did today, honey? The only thing that I did well was miss you so much.

No one is in yet, honey, so I decided this would be about the best time to write a little to you. Golly, honey, I miss you so. I hope that you can get home this weekend. Everything has gone wrong. First of all {{yesterday}} was not one of my good days. You called and said you might have to fly on Sunday. That alone would have been enough bad news for a whole week but no. Everything else went wrong too. A couple of minor things happened and then another major catastrophe (words, why didn’t I learn to spell). It was about your Christmas present. The thing I wanted to get you, they didn’t have and would have to order. I don’t know what to do now. I don’t want to get anything else but it will be two or three weeks at least before they can get that. I’m so disappointed. Now I don’t know what to do. I’m very unhappy about the whole thing. Gee, honey, everything sure goes wrong at once. If you don’t get an overnight pass, honey, {{would you like me to}} come up for a while Saturday or Sunday or something? I just couldn’t stand a whole week or two weeks without seeing you. Gee, I miss you so, my darling. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to see you often enough. I fall in love with you all over again twice as much every time I see you though. I never believed that I could love anyone as much as I love you, honey. Gee, honey, the radio said it would be nice today and tomorrow, but they didn’t mention what would happen on Saturday. I’m praying for nice weather. How long did you fly last night? Hope you get in a lot of hours so that you get home this weekend. Golly, honey, I’ve just got to see you soon. I love you so, honey and it’s so lonesome being away from you even for a few hours. When it grows into days 2 ̆ 6 weeks, it’s awful. Will Steve get home this weekend? Woody is very unhappy—too—this weekend. Don’t remember what I was going to say but anyhoo, I’m home now darling. I’m in a much happier state now. Maybe soon I’ll be in the state of matrimony. Ah, yes. Well, my darling, guess what. I got your Christmas present. Two of them—one tonight quite unexpectedly and the other at noon today. It wasn’t quite what I wanted but it’s O. K. at least I hope you’ll like them. (Both of them—the one at night 2 ̆ 6 the noon one). Golly I’m tired and as you can see nothing makes sense that I write. What a conversation I could carry on. There’s a plane over here now 2 ̆ 6 I just turned out my light and looked for it but couldn’t see anything. Gee, I love you so. You’re so marvelous. I got your letter tonight, hon, and it was so very sweet. I wish I were there to keep you warm too. Now you be careful when it’s cold like that because your resistence [sic] is low, or isn’t it and I wouldn’t like you to catch a cold. Especially when I catch them so easily. It’s pretty cold around here but I’m awfully hot (no cracks!!). Have a sweater (nice and baggy) on and the heat is going on every few seconds. Well, honey, what happened. You finally learned to spell Tuesday! Congrats! I’m glad you liked “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. ” I’ll have to go see it. Well, it didn’t rain or anything today honey, but it was plenty cold. I’ll bet you froze there because it was 22 ° here. I wasn’t cold at all though. Must have my love to keep me warm now. The radio said it would be nice tomorrow. What’s going to happen Saturday is what worries me. I sure hope that it’s real nice Saturday 2 ̆ 6 you go on that cross country flight. How many hours have you gotten in now, honey? I sure hope that you don’t have to fly this weekend. I love you so, honey, and it would be so awful not to see you. I know I’ll never see enough of you, my darling. I’ll be trying all my life, though. Every time I’m with you I love you so much more. There are so many more things I love about you now than there were at first. You’re so wonderful. Your line certainly is improving with age or is it practice? Anyhoo, I love you, and I love your line too. Honey, what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> weekend? Should I call the Meadowbrook, honey, or what? I know Steve is coming down Saturday. He has a date with Woody. What’s this about his going back to the field Sunday morning? Gee, I hope you’re going to like your Christmas presents, darling. Your anniversary present isn’t quite ready yet but it will be soon. Does it seem to you that we’ve been officially engaged for almost a month? Gee, next week is Christmas. I just can’t believe it, darling. Well, my darling, I have to get a couple of things done. I’ll write again tomorrow, hon. I sure hope that you don’t have to fly this weekend. I love you so. Please let me know as soon as possible whether you can get home this weekend or not. If you can’t do you want me to come up? I love you so, honey. Please write whenever you can. I’m praying for good weather, hon. I miss you “awfully much!” You’re the only “thing” (get that) that I ever think about. I always do think about you, honey. I love you so. I’ll love you always, forever and always.

I just can’t believe that you’ll be home again tomorrow. That sounds so nice. Today has seemed like Monday all day. I was just as tired as I usually am on Mondays too. Charlotte 2 ̆ 6 I went to the movies last night 2 ̆ 6 saw “Gypsy Wildcat” 2 ̆ 6 Music in Manhattan. ” We both liked them a lot but I guess we’re easily pleased or something. Golly, I miss you so. I’m so glad that I don’t have to wait a whole week to see you again. I just can’t believe that you’re coming home again tomorrow night. I do wish you’d learn to spell Tuesday. You always have the worst time with that day. I haven’t much time to write tonight because I have to leave here at eight. It’s almost seven thirty now 2 ̆ 6 I have to eat yet. Honey, isn’t it wonderful now that your mother’s given her consent. It makes me feel so much better 2 ̆ 6 happier. You have to go on that cross-country flight tomorrow, so please be careful, darling. No more forced landings or anything. Hope that you get home early and that Steve doesn’t have to walk those tours. I do think he 2 ̆ 6 Woody will have a good time together. What do you mean that Ginis too childish? You sound as if you mean a few different things. I’ll ask you tomorrow anyway if I can remember. Oh, our engagement was in the paper. I just found out that the Mt. Vernon paper had it in last night. The Standard put it in tonight. The picture is so dark that you can’t see anything, which is probably the best thing. I’d send it to you but we only have one paper 2 ̆ 6 Daddy will want to see it. Haven’t seen the other one but Woody read it to me over the phone. Gee, I’d love to see a few people in Mt. Vernon when they read that! They spelled Stewart Field wrong, honey, (Stuart Field) oh, well. It doesn’t seems [sic] real still. Seeing it in the paper seems so much more unreal. I just had to go downstairs 2 ̆ 6 talk to mother—my grandmother hasn’t an ounce of brains, I’m almost sure. She tells mother how awful the picture looks 2 ̆ 6 how bad my ankle is 2 ̆ 6 gets her all upset. Honestly, there’s going to be a murder around here soon. It’s awfully hard to go up 2 ̆ 6 down stairs without stepping on my foot so she has me go down to talk to mother—women! She’s gotten mother all upset now.
