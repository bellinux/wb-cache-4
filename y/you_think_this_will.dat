60|$|As I {{was very}} well pleased, you may be sure at the {{launching}} of this man of war of mine, I was no less amazed to behold with what dexterity my man would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. 'Well Friday,' said I, 'what {{do you think of}} it now? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> carry us over? Yes, master, said he, me venture over well, though great blow wind. But my design was yet farther, which he was insensible of; and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at all to procure: so I fixed upon a strait young cedar-tree; which I found near the place, great plenty of it abounding in the island; and setting Friday to cut it down, I gave him particular directions how to shape and order it; but as to the sail, that I managed myself. I very well knew I had some old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six and twenty years by me; but not being careful to preserve them, as thinking I should have no occasion to use them any more, when I came to overlook them I found them almost all rotten, except two; and with these I went to work, and after a great deal of pains and aukward tedious stitching for want of needles, at length I finished a three-cornered ugly thing, like those which our long boats use, and which I very well knew how to manage, especially since it was like that which I had in my patron's fishing boat, when, with my boy Xury, I made my escape from the Barbarian shore.|$|E

Well, the fact of having met you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will be wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor.

40|$|<b>This</b> week we <b>will</b> {{look into}} {{implementing}} a probabilistic tracker based on particle filter. Consider {{the case where}} {{we are interested in}} locating the position of a fixed size object in a video, thus our state x = (u, v) is 2 D and contains the image coordinates of the center of the target. Implement the condensation algorithm in slide 52, lecture 10, with brownian motion as dynamics, and normalize cross-correation as likelihood. Implement resampling when necessary. Create your own video where given an existing video you superpose a template that has a parabolic motion (from one side of the image to the other). Show plots (as in page 55, lecture 10) as a function of time. Select a video where <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> algorithm <b>will</b> succeed, as well as one where it will failed. Run it and say whether your prediction was right. You should submit the videos, the code and a script to generate the plots and the results...|$|R
60|$|Every religion, {{apart from}} open devil worship, must {{appeal to a}} virtue or the pretence of a virtue. But a virtue, {{generally}} speaking, does some good to everybody. It is therefore necessary to distinguish among the people {{it was meant to}} benefit those whom it does benefit. Modern broad-mindedness benefits the rich; and benefits nobody else. It was meant to benefit the rich; and meant to benefit nobody else. And if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> unwarranted, I <b>will</b> put before you one plain question. There are some pleasures of the poor that may also mean profits for the rich: there are other pleasures of the poor which cannot mean profits for the rich? Watch this one contrast, and you will watch the whole creation of a careful slavery.|$|R

I am better informed now than when we met in your church-study, Mr. Clarke. I know, not merely Miss Lambert's secret, but your own.
