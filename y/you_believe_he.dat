6000|$|... "You {{are sure}} of this?" [...] John Dory asked eagerly. [...] "You are {{sure that the}} man Ruff does not suspect you? <b>You</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> means that you shall meet Fitzgerald?" ...|$|E
60|$|Vent. Would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> loved you? I {{read your}} answer in your eyes, you would. Not to conceal it longer, he has sent A {{messenger}} from Cæsar's camp, with letters.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, to <b>you</b> who <b>believe,</b> <b>He</b> is precious; but {{to those}} who are disobedient, ...|$|R
5000|$|Fellow {{television}} star Penelope Keith said, [...] "He {{was always}} courteous, always generous and always self-deprecating" [...] adding, [...] "He was also such a clever actor {{that he made}} you feel secure. <b>You</b> <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> was who he was portraying on the screen or on the stage... I just think of Richard and smile." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pafnutius: Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>He</b> {{overlooks the}} deeds of the wicked or that He metes out justice as is due? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> has {{all that}} plunder by him?" [...] asked Ricardo, rather perfunctorily, {{because the fact}} seemed to him {{extremely}} probable when looked at all round by his acute mind.|$|E
6000|$|VENTIDIUS. Would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> loved you? [...] I {{read your}} answer in your eyes, you would. [...] Not to conceal it longer, he has sent [...] A {{messenger}} from Caesar's camp, with letters.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a man HE is! THERE'S a whisker! As to Charley's legs, if {{they were}} only a pair (which they ain't), they'd defy competition. Would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> tried to do without me--in the Life-Guards, too?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Ventnor {{passed his}} hand over his whiskered face. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it; <b>he</b> hasn't a mag to his name. Fill your glass." ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010, Burstow {{said he was}} [...] "embarrassed" [...] {{after being}} {{secretly}} taped by The Daily Telegraph saying voters should not trust David Cameron. Burstow told undercover reporters: [...] "I don't want you to trust David Cameron... {{in the sense that}} <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he's</b> suddenly become a cuddly Liberal. Well, he hasn't. He's still a Conservative and he has values that I don't share." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is tremendously interesting," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "I've read it twice over--I have. Mind <b>you,</b> I <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> did it, after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, listen," [...] said Mrs. Atwell, recklessly. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> done it--and he no {{business}} to--why don't {{you just go}} to the dance, in 'em, and then give 'em back to him after it's ova? It would suv him right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no {{saying what}} he knew about anything," [...] said Mrs. Bread, with a mild head-shake. [...] "He was so mightily clever. He could make <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> knew things that he didn't, and that he didn't know others that he had better not have known." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the part}} he took {{was to help}} carry the pole from my house over to Hanover Street. Amos had charge of the whole matter, and yet <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> is {{friendly}} with the 'bloody backs,' just because he happens to have an uncle who is no honour to the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--but do {{you know}} him? That is--why {{do you think he}} has the power? Or what reason have <b>you</b> for <b>believing</b> <b>he</b> will {{remember}} his word?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to stop a moment and listen to me. I am sure you are wrong in this,--wrong for both your sakes. <b>You</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>he</b> loves you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why doesn't he act accordingly? Would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it; <b>he</b> {{never so}} much as asked me whether I had a mouth on. It was just luncheon time, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Common resort! Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> {{came here}} as {{to a place}} of common resort? Do you think that he had not tracked me out, and would not have done so, whether I had gone to Melbourne, or New York, or St. Petersburg? But the wonder is that he should spend his money in such a vain pursuit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, look here, Peter, don't talk nonsense," [...] expostulated Dan. [...] "The Awkward Man found Paddy {{this morning}} and had started to bring us word before Cecily ever thought of the wishbone. Do {{you mean to say}} <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't have come walking up our lane just when he did if she had never thought of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Benny {{jumped in}} by that time, but it wasn't any use. Oh! I seen the ocean, mother! Mr. Hingston took me 'n' Benny {{down on a}} boat; and I seen a stuffed {{elephant}} in a show, or a museum, they called it. Benny said {{it was just like}} the real one in the circus at Wheeling. Mother, do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> throwed hisself in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, dear," [...] she said, [...] "what are {{you crying}} about? You love Captain Niel, and <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>he</b> loves <b>you.</b> Surely {{there is nothing to}} cry about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, did {{you ever}} hear such impudence?' asked Hannah, turning to a neighbour. 'Just see that frightful dwarf--would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>he</b> wants me to think he is my son Jem?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In this case, whom is used {{correctly}} {{according to}} the traditional rules, since {{it is now the}} object of the verb believe. (One would write <b>You</b> <b>believe</b> him <b>he</b> (to be) a great composer.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{amount of}} all this, brigadier, {{is that you}} have little faith in monikin disinterestedness, in any shape; that <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> who is intrusted with power will abuse it; and therefore, you choose to divide the trust, in order to divide the abuses; that the love of money is an 'earthy' quality, and not to be confided in as the {{controlling}} power of a state; and, finally, that the social-stake system is radically wrong, inasmuch as it is no more than carrying out a principle that is in itself defective." ...|$|E
60|$|THE princes {{returned}} to Gluckstein on the carpet, {{and went to}} the best inn, where they dined together and slept. Next morning they, and the ambassador, who had been told all the story, and Lady Rosalind, floated comfortably on the carpet, back to Falkenstein, where the king wept like anything on the shoulders of Alphonso and Enrico. They could not make out why he cried so, nor why Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena cried; but soon they were all laughing and happy again. But then--would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> could be so mean?--he refused to keep his royal promise, and restore Prigio to his crown-princeship! Kings are like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am afraid; and that's {{just what}} I'm afraid of. I declare, my heart comes {{into my mouth}} {{whenever}} I think what an escape we had. I think of it whenever I look at him, and I couldn't talk to him without having that in my mind all the time. No, women can manage those things better. If <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> is going along on our account, so as to help us see Holland, and {{to keep us from}} getting into scrapes, you're the one to make it up to him. I don't care what you say to show him our gratitude. I reckon we will get into all sorts of trouble if we're left to ourselves. But if you think he's stayed because he wants to be with Ellen, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{want to keep}} an eye on Jimmy, Arthur," [...] said Sutton. [...] "He'll sand-bag you, {{and lift}} your watch as soon as look at <b>you.</b> I <b>believe</b> <b>he's</b> Arsene Lupin in disguise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>You</b> wish to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> {{committed}} the crime. <b>You</b> <b>believe</b> him capable of committing it. But your instinct tells you {{he did not}} commit it. It tells you more--shall I go on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{voice and}} {{expression}} changed. His face was serious. “Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in promises?” <b>he</b> asked. “Are they sacred things?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am; {{for every}} day convinces me that he has outlived the brief delusion, and longs for liberty, but dares not ask it. Ah! that pricks pride! But it is so. I have watched with jealous {{vigilance}} and let no sign escape me; because in his infidelity to you lay my chief hope. Has he not grown melancholy, cold, and silent? Does he not seek Babie and, of late, shun you? Will he not always yield his place to me without a token of displeasure or regret? Has he ever uttered reproach, warning, or command to you, although he knows I was and am your lover? Can you deny these proofs, or pause {{to ask if he}} will refuse to break the tie that binds him to a woman, whose superiority in all things keeps him a subject where he would be a king? You do not know the heart of man if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> will not bless you for his freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{wait any}} longer to see you, Flip, so I came here anyway," [...] he went on. [...] "I thought to hang round and {{get a chance to}} speak to you first, when I fell afoul of the old man. He didn't know me, and tumbled right in my little game. Why, do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> wants to hire me for my grub and liquor, to act as a sort of sentry over you and the ranch?" [...] And here he related with great gusto the {{substance}} of his interview. [...] "I reckon as he's that suspicious," [...] he concluded, [...] "I'd better play it out now as I've begun, only it's mighty hard I can't see you here before the fire in your fancy toggery, Flip, but must dodge {{in and out of the}} wet underbrush in these yer duds of yours that I picked up in the old place in the Gin and Ginger Woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|Back in the Maritime Capital, and oh, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly! They have sighted the Little Sally {{from the}} terrace! How happy I am! There will be letters from you, and I shall hear {{all that has}} {{happened}} in America, and I shall never again doubt that Altruria is real! I don't know how I shall get these letters of mine back to you, but somehow it can be managed. Perhaps the Saraband's crew will like to take the Little Sally home again; perhaps when Mr. Thrall knows the ship is here he will want to buy it and go back to his money in America and the misery of it! Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> will? Should I like to remind my husband of his promise to take me home on a visit? Oh, my heart misgives me! I wonder if the captain of the Little Sally has brought his wife and children with him, and is going to settle among us, or whether he has just let his men have the vessel, and they have come to Altruria without him? I dare not ask anything, I dare not think anything! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it!' <b>he</b> said. 'Why, someun {{even made}} offer fur to marry her! If a ship's cook that was turning settler, Mas'r Davy, didn't make offers fur to marry Missis Gummidge, I'm Gormed--and I can't say no fairer than that!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [FIFTH.] this {{doctrine}} makes Christ precious to the believers--'Unto <b>you</b> therefore which <b>believe,</b> <b>he</b> is precious' (1 Peter 2:7).|$|R
60|$|WISE MAN. If {{there is}} one amongst <b>you</b> that <b>believes,</b> <b>he</b> will be my best friend. Surely {{there is one}} amongst you. [They are all silent.] Surely what you learned at your mother's knees has not been so soon forgotten.|$|R
