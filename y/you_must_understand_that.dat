500|$|Roddenberry {{was raised}} a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he {{rejected}} religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around {{the age of}} 14, {{and came to the}} conclusion that it was [...] "nonsense". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marais sent {{a letter}} to Dr. Winifred de Kock in London about Maeterlinck, in which he wrote that The famous author had paid me the left-handed {{compliment}} of cribbing {{the most important part of}} my work... He clearly desired his readers to infer that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that he never saw a termite in his life. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it was not merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak. He has copied page after page verbally.|$|E

6000|$|... "A cow!" [...] sighed Mrs. Holt. [...] "Oh, dear, I {{might have}} known it. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand,</b> Honora, <b>that</b> {{every member of the}} Holt family has a hobby. Joshua's is Jerseys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{extremely}} {{charming and}} essentially admirable young girl (I am--as you see--old {{enough to be}} frank in my expressions) was referring to her own feelings. Surely <b>you</b> <b>must</b> have <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> much?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “So far, {{you have}} been able to get your son {{everything}} he wished for; but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> you can’t dispose of my daughter. Ruth shall please herself.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2.. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{this order}} is but additional, and now enjoined {{to fill up}} that which was begun as to holy {{exercise}} of religious worship by the churches long before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} they were all Englishmen, and {{that if she had}} been giving the party herself they would have smoked just as much. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> she never does give any parties." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Act III of Arthur Miller's The Crucible, Deputy Governor John Danforth states, [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand,</b> sir, <b>that</b> {{a person}} is either with this court or he must be counted against it, there is no road between." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{suppose that}} I were to marry my cousin George, and he {{were not to}} die after all, what would be my {{position}} then? <b>You</b> <b>must</b> clearly <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> to save us all from starvation, I would never be his wife." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{would see}} through {{that in an}} instant. And if he is still the false {{creature}} you think he is, we owe him the truth, {{more than any other}} kind of man. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> Basil!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, {{it will be}} {{no great}} loss. I mean the missing of her tea and only the ghost of it at that. As to the lady, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> she has her {{positive}} uses. See that, Razumov." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "I cannot do it; I {{must tell}} you the whole thing as I have it, {{arranged}} in my mind. Now, in the first place, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> this earth was once a comet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sandy Black," [...] said Lancey, rising {{with a look}} of dignity, [...] "you {{are very}} kind--just what I would 'ave {{expected}} of you--but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> clearly <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I will serve only in works of 'umanity. In a milingtary capacity I will serve neither the Turks nor the Roossians." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>must</b> first <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the easterly and {{westerly}} {{sides of}} this hill on which we worked, were very steep. On the easterly side, and near the foot, were brick kilns, clay pits, and much marshy land, while on the westerly side was the more central portion of the town itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> this, <b>that</b> I {{will never}} {{distrust}} you. I will never {{ask you to}} give me up again, or say that I could be happy without you. I could not live without you; that is, without the knowledge that you are mine. But I will never be impatient, never. Pray, pray believe me! Nothing shall make me distrust you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have always}} been very kind, and I {{appreciate}} it," [...] Hodder replied. [...] "I should be sorry to cause you any worry or annoyance. But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I cannot share the responsibility of my acts with any one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. There {{are some}} things gentlemen are very slow to learn. But you must sit down, Dr Crofts, and make {{yourself}} comfortable and polite; for <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> you are not master here any longer. I am out of bed now, and your reign is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Señor," [...] he said, [...] "I have a {{favor to}} ask; but the {{accident}} that I was thrown into Miss Sarmiento's company at the hacienda and Rio Frio {{has nothing to do}} with it. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> I want your consent to my marriage to your daughter." ...|$|E
60|$|With a laugh {{he swung}} {{off to a}} spring that bubbled {{at the foot of}} a rock hard by, and when he {{returned}} I had my bird plucked, singed, split open, and cleaned out. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand,</b> reader, <b>that</b> we were not particular. We were wont to grasp the feathers in large handfuls, and such as would not come off easily we singed off.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> clearly <b>understand,</b> <b>that</b> {{however much}} these coralline limestones have been upheaved {{since they were}} formed, yet the sea- bottom, while they were being formed, was sinking and not rising. [...] This is a fact which was first pointed out by Mr. Darwin, from the {{observations}} which he made in the world-famous Voyage of the Beagle; and the observations of subsequent great naturalists have all gone to corroborate his theory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most expedient," [...] said Harold Smith, {{shaking his}} head wisely. [...] "Well, Robarts, who is it now?" [...] This {{he said to his}} private secretary, who came to notice the arrival of some bigwig. [...] "Well, yes. I will say good morning, with your leave, for I am a little hurried. And remember, Mr. Robarts, I will do what I can for you; but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> {{distinctly}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> there is no promise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucille," [...] he said, [...] "you {{force me}} to {{disclose}} something which I have kept so far to myself. I wished to spare you anxiety, but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> your safety depends upon your remaining in this house, and in keeping apart from all association with--your husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As far as I am concerned,' Captain De Stancy's {{companion}} was saying, 'nothing {{would give}} me more unfeigned delight than that you should persevere and win her. But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I have no authority over her--nothing more than the natural influence that arises from my being her father's brother.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The population,' {{said the}} Chief slowly, 'were few but enorrmous. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> exceptin' the tin-mines, {{there is no}} special {{inducement}} to Europeans to reside in Larut. The climate is warm and remarkably like the climate o' Calcutta; and in regard to Calcutta, it cannot have escaped your obsairvation that--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I {{would see}} Colonel Askerton first, {{as you are}} staying at his house. And as for liberality,--there is nothing of the kind. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand,</b> Clara, <b>that</b> a fellow can't do what he likes with his own in this country. I have found myself so bullied by lawyers {{and that sort of}} people, that I have been obliged to yield to them. I wanted that you should have the old place, to do just what you pleased with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{remarkable}} as consarns Judith! Whey {{should she}} {{feel so much}} unsartainty about me?--Ah---I see how it is, now; yes, I see into the whole matter, now. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand,</b> Hetty, <b>that</b> your sister is oneasy lest Harry March should wake, and come blundering here {{into the hands of}} the inimy ag'in, under some idee that, being a travelling comrade, he ought to help me in this matter! Hurry is a blunderer, I will allow, but I don't think he'd risk as much for my sake, as he would for his own." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was turning}} {{the paper with}} the address on in his hand. [...] "You need not trouble to write to this gentleman," [...] he said. [...] "I shall not write to him. If you are fairly intelligent, Miss Affleck, and anxious to do your best, you will do very well, I dare say. References are of little use to me; I prefer to use my own judgment. But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> clearly <b>that</b> for every {{dereliction}} there is a fine, which is deducted from the salary. A printed copy of the rules will be given you. And you may be discharged at a moment's notice at any time." ...|$|R
60|$|Now <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{with the}} coming of this fleet we of Jamestown were told that the London Company had changed all the laws for us in Virginia, and that Lord De la Warr, who sailed on the ship from which nothing had been heard, was to be our governor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Isobel," [...] I said, [...] "if {{there is}} any difference--think! A year ago you were a child. To-day you are a woman. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> {{side by side with}} the {{pleasure}} of having you with us--the greatest pleasure that has ever come into our lives, Isobel--has come a certain amount of responsibility." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are, Mr. Ishmael, and that is quite enough. I {{do not wish to}} be unkind, or to say {{anything}} that will pain you, but please go away, and never try to speak to me again like this, as it is quite useless. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I will never marry you, never." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it does not, {{no other}} way, that I know of, will do so. As I told you before, {{it will be}} no easy task. Of course <b>you</b> <b>must</b> make her <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> her {{happiness}} shall be cared for; but that must not be put prominently forward as your object. Your first object is her money, and your only chance for success is in telling the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He shall {{give them}} back," [...] said Marietta, rising, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>understand,</b> Mr. Rooper, <b>that</b> {{in no way}} did Asaph {{interfere}} with your marrying me. That was a matter with which he did have and could have nothing to do. And now I wish you could get away without speaking to him. I do not want any quarrelling or high words here, and I will see him and arrange the matter better than you can do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are, Mr Morton, in this paper, proposals, {{as to the}} {{abstract}} propriety of which I must now waive delivering any opinion. Some of them appear to me reasonable and just; and, although I have no express instructions from the King upon the subject, yet I assure you, Mr Morton, and I pledge my honour, that I will interpose in your behalf, and use my utmost influence to procure you satisfaction from his Majesty. But <b>you</b> <b>must</b> distinctly <b>understand,</b> <b>that</b> I can only treat with supplicants, not with rebels; and, as a preliminary to every act of favour on my side, I must insist upon your followers laying down their arms and dispersing themselves." ...|$|R
