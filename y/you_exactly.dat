500|$|...hack//Mutation also {{received}} mixed reviews, and many critics complained that little {{was done to}} address the problems of its predecessor. Fennec Fox of Gamepro said that game, [...] "is simply an extension of Infection", with [...] "muddy graphics, questionable control, and a story concept that’s just interesting enough to keep you going." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot gave it a rating of 6.7 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "not only does it bring <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> the same sort of repetitive hack-and-slash gameplay, but it's also similarly short and simple and once again offers {{little in the way of}} plot or character development." [...] Nutt found the second game to be more addictive than the first, despite its numerous shortcomings such as obvious padding towards the end of the story. He praised the [...] "mixture of cool story and viscerally engaging RPG gameplay", the accelerating story, gameplay progression and memorable boss battles. Other reviewers were encouraged by the MMORPG-oriented details that contribute to the game's presentation and built excitement for the future of the series. IGN also named [...]hack//Mutation as PlayStation2 Game of the Month for May 2003.|$|E

2500|$|On February 4, 2009, Ackerman criticized SEC Officials {{over the}} {{handling}} of tips given {{to them about the}} Bernie Madoff scandal. Ackerman believed that he was reflecting the public's opinion, saying: [...] "How are they supposed to have confidence that if somebody goes to you with a complaint—gives it to you on a silver platter with all the investigations, with all the numbers, with all of the data, telling <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> what he did, how he did it, and why he did it and how he knows that—and after a period after half a dozen or eight years, you don't know anything?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Erin Kimmerle is a {{forensic}} anthropologist and University of South Florida Associate Professor who {{is leading a}} USF team of anthropologists, biologists, and archaeologists exploring the Marianna campus. The stories of the White House Boys piqued her interest. She was especially curious why there are no records of where those who died there are buried. Kimmerle commented, [...] "When {{you look at the}} state hospital, the state prisons, the other state institutions at the time, there are very meticulous plot maps you can reference. Or if you are a family member today, you can say, 'Where is my great-aunt buried?' and they can show <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> where. So, why that didn't happen here, I don't know. But that does stand out." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in the back of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E

[...] Eddie underwent surgery on his left hand in 2009, following some treatment for arthritis as he felt pain in his fingers during the 2007 tour.
