6000|$|... "So {{on the day}} of the accident--call it murder, if you will--I rode over on my machine, unannounced, to The Grange to see him. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was staying, <b>you</b> recollect--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{must leave}} you somewhere {{for a few}} minutes,' said the schoolmaster, at length {{breaking}} the silence into which they had fallen in their gladness.

6000|$|... "If {{there is}} a telegram, any {{communication}} from the Embassy, or telephone message, you will bring it to me yourself, at once, at number 17, Grosvenor Square. If any one should call to see me, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am to be found." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The matter {{on which}} I would see him," [...] said Sybil, [...] "is as urgent as the {{imagination}} can conceive, and it concerns {{you as well}} as himself; but if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> not <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can find him"--and she moved as if about to retire--"'tis of no use." ...|$|R

6000|$|The fellow called Jim {{emitted a}} mirthless laugh. [...] "Wal, he's been all my {{business}} these days.

6000|$|... "Oh, well--sure--Course {{you might}} say--" [...] Babbitt was {{conscious}} of how feeble he sounded, conscious of Gunch's mature and relentless eye.

6000|$|... "'Nothing,' says I; 'no insinuations. I'm stating a hypodermical case.
