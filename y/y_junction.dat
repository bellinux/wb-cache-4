40|$|International audiencePlasmonic waveguiding {{structures}} {{have the}} ability to confine and propagate light over short distances, typically less than a hundred micrometers. This short propagation length is the price that is paid for confininglight to dimensions on the order of a hundred of nanometers.

Although the dimensions involved in such structures are below the diffraction limit, large-scale optical characterization techniques, such as transmitted power, are still employed.

40|$|A new {{boundary}} condition algorithm is presented that passes outgoing radiation freely {{with a minimum}} reflection coefficient (typically 10 - 5) while inhibiting the flux of incoming radiation.

The potential applications of nonlinear directional couplers (NLDCs) in all-optical signal processing have attracted a great deal of research interest since they were first introduced by Jensen in 1982. 1 Several variations of the NLDC, such as <b>Y</b> <b>junctions,</b> 2 X junctions, 3 and bent couplers, 4 – 6 have been proposed since then. Usually, these devices can be used as, e. g., optical switches, optical limiters, optical intensity discriminators, and logic gates.

40|$|Junctions are {{important}} features for image analysis {{and form a}} critical aspect of image understanding tasks such as object recognition.

Our main contribution is a modeling of the junction which is complex enough to handle all these issues and yet simple enough to admit an effective dynamic programming solution. Broadly, we use a template deformation framework along with a gradient criterium to detect radial partitions of the template. We use the minimum description length principle to obtain the optimal number of partitions that best describes the junction. Kona [27] is an implementation of this model.

50|$|When the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway (later {{absorbed by}} the Great Northern) arrived in Bradford they {{initially}} built a terminus at Adolphus Street.

When the Queensbury Lines were constructed they entered Bradford from the west and passed under the L&YR line south of Mill Lane junction. They then formed a <b>Y</b> <b>junction</b> with the GN link line, just {{to the east of}} Mill Lane junction.

50|$|There {{are three}} basic switch designs for roller coasters. Flexing, substituting and table {{rotating}} rails {{have all been}} used. Flexing the entire rail truss, fixed at one end, to point towards an alternate destination requires manipulating a long segment of rail. Substituting a segment requires placing two or more segments of rail on flat plate that is moved in its entirety to provide straight or curved track. Alternatively these substitution track segments can be wrapped around a rotating cylinder, creating a triangular truss or a two sided plate. Rotating {{a table with a}} curved track segment in a <b>Y</b> <b>junction</b> is the less used third option. If the curved track turns the cars 60 degrees, and three rail lines meet as three equally spaced spokes, 120 degrees apart, then the curved track sitting on a turn table can be rotated to connect any two of the three rail lines at this junction, creating a triangle junction.|$|E
50|$|When scaled {{down to the}} microscale, fluid mixing behaves radically different. This is {{typically}} at sizes from a couple (2 or 3) millimeters down to the nanometer range. At this size range normal convection does not happen unless you force it. Diffusion is the dominate mechanism whereby two different fluids come together. Diffusion is a relatively slow process. Hence {{a number of researchers}} had to devise ways to get the two fluids to mix. This involved <b>Y</b> <b>junctions,</b> T junctions, three-way intersections and designs where the interfacial area between the two fluids is maximized. Beyond just interfacing the two liquids people also made twisting channels to force the two fluids to mix. These included multilayered devices where the fluids would corkscrew, looped devices where the fluids would flow around obstructions and wavy devices where the channel would constrict and flare out. Additionally channels with features on the walls like notches or groves were tried.|$|R
40|$|The RecG protein of Escherichia coli catalyses branch {{migration}} of Holliday junctions made by RecA and dissociates synthetic X junctions into duplex products in reactions that require hydrolysis of ATP. To investigate {{the mode of}} action of this enzyme a chromosomal mutation that inactivates recG (recG 162) was cloned and sequenced. The recG 162 mutation is a G:C to A:T transition, which produces an Ala 428 to Val substitution in the protein. This change affects a motif (motif III) in the protein that is highly conserved in DNA and RNA helicases. RecG 162 protein was purified and shown to retain the ability to bind synthetic X and <b>Y</b> <b>junctions.</b> However, it does not dissociate these junctions and fails to catalyse branch {{migration of}} Holliday junction intermediates purified from a RecA strand exchange reaction. RecG 162 retains a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, but this is much reduced relative to the wild-type protein, especially with single-stranded DNA as a co-factor. These results suggest that branch migration by RecG is related to a junction-targeted DNA helicase activity...|$|R
40|$|Common voles (Microtus arvalis) use {{networks}} of runways around their burrows, which are dug in meadows. Their orientation among such networks could {{be based on}} rigid "egocentred" routes (possibly {{through the use of}} olfactory "trails") or on more general, "allocentred" spatial representations (with distant visual cues). In this 5 -day study, male voles should reach food in the centre of a maze of three-way (<b>Y)</b> <b>junctions</b> offering similar local views but surrounded by distant visual cues. I tested whether the animals navigated using olfactory trails, implying one main direct foraging route, or allocentered representations, allowing flexibility among equivalent routes. Males quickly marked their environment, preferentially at the periphery, where they moved the most. However, during most direct trips between the nest and the food, they used one of the central shortest routes, which included the least scent-marked zones. Moreover, the voles preferred different shortest routes to go to the food and return from it, showing a bias in favour of the side where the distant goal (food or nest) was situated. This suggests that male common voles base their choices on the general direction of their goal rather than on trails. Finally, there was no major difference in initial exploration between a clean and a scent-marked maze. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
