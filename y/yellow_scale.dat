50|$|Aonidiella orientalis is {{a species}} of insect in the family Diaspididae, the armored scale insects. It is known {{commonly}} as the Oriental <b>yellow</b> <b>scale.</b> It is an agricultural pest {{on a wide variety}} of crop plants.|$|E
50|$|Scarus ghobban, {{also known}} as the blue-barred parrotfish, blue-barred parrotfish, blue trim parrotfish, cream parrotfish, globe-headed parrotfish, green blotched parrotfish, <b>yellow</b> <b>scale</b> parrotfish, and bluechin parrotfish, is a species of marine fish in the Scaridae family.|$|E
50|$|Several {{other animal}} species have been {{observed}} living within the gumboot's gills; the relationship {{is thought to be}} commensal: neither harmful nor helpful to the chiton. One researcher found that {{more than a quarter of}} gumboots hosted an Arctonoe vittata, a pale <b>yellow</b> <b>scale</b> worm which can grow up to 10 cm length. Opisthopus transversus, a small crab, is also sometimes found within the gills.|$|E
40|$|Two {{new species}} of Toxophora Meigen are {{described}} and illustrated-T. paulistana sp. nov. (Neotropical) and T. azteca sp. nov. (Nearctic and Neotropical). An identification key to the New World species is also presented. Morphological differences between populations of T. aurea Macquart (1848) are recorded, illustrated and added to the key. The new species are easily recognized by: scape with long, <b>yellow</b> <b>scales</b> laterally; presence of <b>yellow</b> <b>scales</b> on mesonotum margins; posterior margin of mesonotum with a pre-scutellar pair of setae; and <b>yellow</b> <b>scales</b> forming thin bands on posterior margins of abdominal tergites in T. paulistana sp. nov., and scape entirely covered with long dark-brown <b>scales</b> and <b>yellow</b> <b>scales</b> forming a broad, longitudinal stripe on center of abdominal tergites III-VII in T. azteca sp. nov...|$|R

40|$|Two neotropical {{species of}} Toxophora Meigen, 1848 are re{{described}} (T. aurea Macquart, 1848 and T. leucon Séguy, 1930) {{and the male}} terminalia, female spermathecae, and the eggs are described and illustrated. Both species can be easily segregated from the other congeners by the following features: T. leucon: body covered with dark brown scales, longitudinal stripe formed by <b>yellow</b> <b>scales</b> on center of mesonotum, scutellum and abdomen, and abdomen slender; T. aurea: antenna with short dark brown scales, body covered with <b>yellow</b> <b>scales</b> and spots of dark brown scales with greenish reflex, wings without inter-radial vein, femora with <b>yellow</b> <b>scales</b> and without setae on males, and abdomen stout...|$|R
5000|$|Xanthoria parietina is a foliose, or leafy, lichen. It has wide distribution, {{and many}} common {{names such as}} common orange lichen, <b>yellow</b> <b>scale,</b> {{maritime}} sunburst lichen and shore lichen. It can be found near the shore on rocks or walls (hence the epithet parietina meaning [...] "on walls"), and also on inland rocks, walls, or tree bark. It was chosen as a model organism for genomic sequencing (planned in 2006) by the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI). In the past it {{was used as a}} remedy for jaundice because of its yellow color.|$|E
5000|$|Kupka had {{a strong}} {{interest}} in color theory and freeing colors from descriptive associations (which is thought to have possibly influenced other artists like Robert Delaunay). Margit Rowell described his painting The <b>Yellow</b> <b>Scale</b> (c. 1907) as [...] "Kupka's first attempt {{to come to terms with}} color theory in which the result is both personal and successful". Although a self-portrait, the subject of the painting was the color yellow. Around 1910 he began developing his own color wheels, adapting a format previously explored by Sir Isaac Newton and Hermann von Helmholtz. This work in turn led Kupka to execute a series of paintings he called [...] "Discs of Newton" [...] (1911-12).|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 37 mm. The forewings are white with the faintest yellowish suffusion along {{the middle of}} the wing and beyond the cell. There are two large raised pale <b>yellow</b> <b>scale</b> tufts and two smaller white scale tufts alternating with the other, as well as two highly raised but loose tufts below the upper edge of the cell toward the base, with the upper half dark brown, the lower white and some brown scales scattered between these. The other markings are jet black, consisting of a costal irregular, and a median quadrate spot at the base, a wedge-shaped oblique larger mark at one-sixth of the costa and a round dot below the fold at one-fifth. There is also an irregular dark grey mark on two-thirds of the costa and a patch of irregular jet-black irroration with bluish reflections in the apex. A curved series of brownish-grey raised scales is found before {{the upper part of the}} termen. The hindwings are glossy golden whitish, irrorated with pale tawny. The extreme apex is suffused with jet black.|$|E

40|$|Organophosphate and {{carbamate}} insecticides {{have been used}} to treat citrus pest problems for more than 40 years. From 1990 to 1998, we documented California red scale and <b>yellow</b> <b>scale</b> resistance to these insecticides. Armored scale resistance is found on an estimated 40 % of 163, 000 acres of citrus in the San Joaquin Valley. Citrus growers have responded by either increasing their use of natural enemies, especially the parasitoid wasp Aphytis melinus, or by applying newly registered insect growth regulator or neonicotinoid insecticides. While the California red scale problem is, for the moment, greatly reduced, outbreaks of cottony cushion scale are occurring because the new insecticides are highly toxic to the predatory vedalia beetle...|$|E

40|$|A yellow-eyed mutant was {{discovered}} in a strain of Heliothis virescens, the tobacco budworm, that already exhibited a mutation for <b>yellow</b> <b>scale,</b> y. We investigated the inheritance of these visible mutations as candidate markers for transgenesis. Yellow eye was controlled by a single, recessive, autosomal factor, {{the same type of}} inheritance previously known for y. Presence of the recombinant mutants with yellow scales and wild type eyes in test crosses indicated independent segregation of genes for these traits. The recombinant class with wild type scales and yellow eyes was completely absent and there was a corresponding increase of the double mutant parental class having yellow scales and yellow eyes. These results indicated that a single factor for yellow eye also controlled yellow scales independently of y. This gene was named yes, for yellow eye and scale. We hypothesize that yes controls both eye and scale color through a deficiency in transport of pigment precursors in both the ommochrome and melanin pathways. The unlinked gene y likely controls an enzyme affecting the melanin pathway only. Both y and yes segregated independently of AceIn, acetylcholinesterase insensitivity, and sodium channel hscp, which are genes related to insecticide resistance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Crusted scabies is a severe, hyperkeratotic, psoriasiform {{disorder}} {{associated with}} immune suppression. Affected individuals typically present with crusted hyperkeratotic lesions {{in a variety}} of locations. This condition can lead to severe complications: institutional outbreaks and secondary bacterial infections associated with sepsis and high mortality. Main observations: A 37 -year-old woman with a 12 -year history of systemic lupus erythematosus treated with prednisone, methotrexate, and plaquenil presented with a three-week history of a painful scalp rash with adherent <b>yellow</b> <b>scale.</b> Skin biopsy and tissue culture were consistent with a diagnosis of crusted scabies with superficial bacterial infection. The patient was treated with oral ivermectin and permethrin cream, as well as ciprofloxacin for the bacterial infection. At one-week follow-up, the scalp was no longer tender and hyperkeratotic plaques had significantly improved. At one-month follow-up, the affected scalp demonstrated further improvement with decreasing erythema and alopecia with follicular ostia. Conclusions: Our case highlights the atypical presentation of crusted scabies with primary scalp involvement and need for vigilance in recognizing and appropriately treating this condition to prevent the consequences of longstanding infection. Combination treatment with ivermectin and permethrin is appropriate management for this condition...|$|E

40|$|My {{postcard}} pictures a dead tree," writes Jeannis Fritzner (rue Sylvio Gator/imp. Exumé 15, Delmas, Haïti), "but I sent it anyway, {{since it}} would please you more than {{a picture of a}} painted concrete cathedral. " "CTA equals the soil, the soil equals trees and trees equal life. I do not know why this tree is dead. If you could shed any light on the cause of its death, please tell me. It is a Azadirachta indica or neem tree. " It is difficult to tell from just a picture of the trunk what caused the death of the tree, Jeannis. In general, neem trees are real survivors - though they all die sometime. One thing they cannot stand is wet feet - a high groundwater table will affect them. Despite their insect-repelling characteristics, neem trees are prone to a few scale insects. The <b>yellow</b> <b>scale</b> insect (Aonidiella orientalis) has been a serious problem during high infestations in West and Central Africa, giving affected trees a burnt appearance. A more serious problem in Africa is 'decline', best defined as a combination of factors in a particular order which gradually cause the tree to deteriorate. General factors such as soil type, site or a genetic disorder, combined with insects, drought or pollutants, might cause a general decline in a certain tree population in a certain region.
