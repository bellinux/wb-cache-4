[...] "Our first need is a hiding-place until we get true knowledge of where the lad may be, and possibly <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>us</b> to some trusty person who, knowing all the circumstances, would give us shelter." ...|$|E

"You know, moreover, of what {{consequence}} it is, {{that the}} missioners, who {{are sent to}} the Indies, should be proper for the end proposed; and it is convenient, on that account, that you come to Portugal and Rome: for not only many more will be desirous of going on those missions, but you will make a better choice of missioners, and will see more clearly to what parts such and such are proper to be sent. You judge yourself of what consideration it is, not to be mistaken in these affairs; and whatsoever relation <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>us,</b> your letters are not sufficient {{to give us a}} true notion of what labourers are fitting for the Indies. It is necessary that you, or some one as intelligent as you, should know and practise those who are designed for those countries. Besides what it will be in your power to do for the common benefit of the East, you will warm the zeal of the king of Portugal, in relation to Ethiopia, which has been under consideration for so many years, but nothing yet performed. You will also be of no little use to the affairs of Congo and Brasil, on which you can have no influence in India, for want of commerce betwixt them and you. But if you think your presence may be necessary, for the government of those of the Society who are in the Indies, you may govern them more easily from Portugal, than you can from China or Japan. For what remains, I remit you to the Father, Master Polanque, and recommend myself most cordially to your good prayers, beseeching the Divine Goodness to multiply his favours on you; to the end, that we may understand his most holy will, and that we may perfectly perform it." ...|$|E

To be sure, I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I? and it only harasses me. You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest person. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> make little Charles do anything; he always minds you at a word. It {{will be a great}} deal better than leaving him only with Jemima. Oh! I shall {{certainly}} go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone. An excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne. I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> for <b>us,</b> <b>you</b> know, at a moment's notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you. I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child." ...|$|R

'You have {{no doubt}} ceased from your exertions {{in the way of}} finding [...] nurses, since the {{telegram}} has told you that the son and heir has [...] considerately saved trouble and expense by making his appearance on [...] Michaelmas morning. It was before there was time to fetch anybody [...] but the ancient village Bettina. Everything is most prosperous, and [...] I am almost as proud as the parents--and to see them gloat over the [...] morsel is a caution. They look at him as if such a being had never [...] been known on the earth before; and he really is a very fine healthy [...] creature, most ridiculously like the portrait of the original old [...] Michael Morton Northmoor in the full-bottomed wig. He seems to be [...] almost equally marvellous to the Ratzes population, being the first [...] infant seen there unswaddled--or washed. Bettina's horror at the [...] idea of washing him is worth seeing. Her brown old face was almost [...] convulsed, and she and our Frau-wirthin concurred in assuring me that [...] it would be fatal to der kleine baron if he were washed, except [...] with white wine and milk at a fortnight old; nor would they accept my [...] assurance that my three daughters and seven grandchildren had [...] survived the process. I have to do it myself, and dress him as I [...] can, for his wardrobe as made here is not complete, and whatever <b>you</b> [...] <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>us</b> will be highly acceptable. It is lucky that Northmoor is [...] a born nurse, for the women's fear of breaking the child is really [...] justifiable, as they never handled anything not made up into a mummy; [...] moreover, they wish to let all the world up into Mary's room to [...] behold the curiosity, I met the priest upon his way and turned him [...] back! So we have pretty well all the nursing on our hands, and [...] happily it is of the most satisfactory kind, with the one drawback [...] that we have to call in the services of a 'valia'; but on the other [...] hand we have all been so much interested in a poor little widow, [...] Hedwig Grantzen, whose husband was lost last spring in a snow-storm, [...] that it is pleasant to have some employment for her. Such a creature [...] as came over on chance and speculation--a great coarse handsome girl, [...] in exaggerated costume, all new, with lacy ribbons down her back; but [...] I rode over to Botzen, and interviewed her parish priest about her, [...] and that was enough to settle her. Every one is asleep except [...] myself, and Mary's face is one smile as she sleeps.|$|R

Italy Dear Friends, Thanks {{a lot for}} {{the candy}} you sent me for Christmas. The motto we have is “Don’t save {{anything}} for tomorrow that you can eat today,” so your candy was good. It is nice to know that you back home really are behind us. Nothing is more discouraging than to hear and read of strikes, etc. back home. But thank God that the number who hinder production, etc. are very few compared to those who are behind us 100 %. We need all the guns, tanks, radio parts, motors, etc. <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>us.</b> The more we get, the fewer the lives that we will lose. We also need good business men and women back home and that’s what your job at Bryant is. Do the very best you can as fast as you can. We beat the Italians because we are smarter than they are. Fascism suppressed education [...] we encourage it. We are beating the Germans and Japs because we are better educated than they. Schools and colleges in the States are doing their share for victory and the preservation of the peace to follow depends more on them than anything else. Thanks again 								Wes Crawley 								Class of ‘ 36 [Transcription ends...|$|E

The Rights of Way Improvement Plan (ROWIP) process, as required by the Welsh Assembly Government, is helping us to do this. This Draft Rights of Way Improvement Plan, will be published in the autumn 2007, following public consultation during the spring of 2007. I hope you will take time to read the plan, it is a result of a two year consultation period, started in the summer of 2005. We have consulted many different groups and people and we hope we have captured their priorities {{and put them in the}} Statement of Action. There are a number of options put forward in the plan and some of them will be difficult to achieve and fund, but we need your views. We know we can improve our rights of way service and we believe this plan sets out how we will do this. Please fill in the comments viewpoint at the back of the plan and send it back to us.
