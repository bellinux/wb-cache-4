50|$|At {{least five}} 80-tonners {{have been known}} to be in tourist service. These {{locomotives}} resided on the Virginia & Truckee Railroad. The D-1 was acquired in 2004 and was the mainstay of the fleet while the railroads 2-8-0 No. 29 and 2-6-2 No. 8 were being restored. Another 80-tonner, D-2, was only used in 2003, and its current disposition is unknown. The Valley Railroad in Essex, Connecticut owns a trio of 80-tonners, 0900, 0901, and 1606, for use on the Essex Clipper Dinner Train, as well as for <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> and work <b>train</b> service.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{industries}} in the Guild's Lake area was a sawmill built in the 1880s. Although {{large parts of the}} land remained undeveloped until the early 20thcentury, lumber mills, grain storage structures, railroads, and docks appeared along the waterfront. The Guild's Lake Rail Yard, built by the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1880s, became an important <b>switching</b> <b>yard</b> for <b>trains.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Union Pacific Railroad {{is perhaps}} the largest current user of the MP15DC, having 102 of the type in service (Strack, 2004). None were {{originally}} owned by the UP; instead, they were acquired by merger or takeover, or bought on the second-hand locomotive market. The vast majority (62) came from the Missouri Pacific Railroad, while locomotives were also acquired from the Chicago and North Western Railway (14) and Southern Pacific Railroad (9). A further 15 were acquired from the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, being surplus to their requirements, while a further two have been leased from Helm.The Alaska Railroad had four MP15DCs used as <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> engines, numbered 1551-1554. As of 2/28/2011 LEF&C (1551)#25 & (1552)#26, 1553, 1554 were sold to GATX, a RR leasing fleet. Two {{were obtained from the}} Lake Erie, Franklin and Clarion Railroad; the other two were obtained from the Kelley's Creek and Northwestern Railroad.Caltrain has two MP15DCs used for <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> and work <b>train</b> service, numbered 503 and 504.|$|R
60|$|Another.--I am {{studying}} the stars, under advantages, as I cross tonight. (It is late in February, and again extra clear.) High toward the west, the Pleiades, tremulous with delicate sparkle, {{in the soft}} heavens,--Aldebaran, leading the V-shaped Hyades--and overhead Capella and her kids. Most majestic of all, in full display in the high south, Orion, vast-spread, roomy, chief historian of the stage, with his shiny yellow rosette on his shoulder, and his three kings--and {{a little to the}} east, Sirius, calmly arrogant, most wondrous single star. Going late ashore, (I couldn't give up the beauty, and soothingness of the night,) as I staid around, or slowly wander'd I heard the echoing calls of the railroad men in the West Jersey depot <b>yard,</b> shifting and <b>switching</b> <b>trains,</b> engines, etc.; amid the general silence otherways, and something in the acoustic quality of the air, musical, emotional effects, never thought of before. I linger'd long and long, listening to them.|$|R
5000|$|The lake {{took its}} name from Peter Guild (pronounced guile), {{one of the first}} 19th-century {{settlers}} in the area. In 1847, he acquired nearly 600 acre of the wetlands through a donation land claim. After Guild's death in 1870, various landowners modified the area to accommodate sawmills, railroads, shipping docks, and Portland's city garbage incinerator. [...] The Guild's Lake Rail Yard, built by the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1880s, became an important <b>switching</b> <b>yard</b> for <b>trains.</b> Beginning in the 1890s, channel-deepening in the Willamette River improved the city's status as a deep-water seaport, as did completion in 1914 of a port terminal. These developments helped make nearby Guild's Lake the most important industrial area in Portland.|$|R

50|$|Currently {{there are}} CPR <b>switching</b> <b>yards</b> in the Central Industrial neighbourhood. The City of Saskatoon, Canadian Pacific Railway and the CNR are under {{negotiations}} currently to remove these <b>switching</b> <b>yards.</b> This {{would mean the}} CPR could use CNR rail lines through the city {{and be able to}} use the CN Chappell <b>Yards</b> for <b>switching.</b> Likeise the CNR could run trains along the CPR track through the city and use the Sutherland CPR <b>switching</b> <b>yards.</b> This would involve construction of a connecting <b>switching</b> <b>yard</b> between CP and CN rail lines near 11th Street and Dundonald which could be done as part of the new Circle Drive South Bridge extension project.|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce {{operating}} costs and increase safety and efficiency, U. S. Class I freight railroads have begun to use remotely controlled locomotives in and around railroad <b>switching</b> <b>yards.</b> To better understand the safety implications of implementing this technology, a human reliability assessment was conducted to compare remotely controlled locomotive operations with conventional (engineer onboard) <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> operations. This paper discusses application of the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) with 2 <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> employee subject matter experts. Each was asked to assess 11 conventional scenarios and 11 nearly-identical remote control scenarios. Human error probabilities were calculated for each scenario. The HEART assessment revealed no overall difference in human error probabilities between the 2 methods of operation. Additional analyses suggest significant variability between the two assessors. This paper explores differences in how assessors used HEART, including differences in selection of generic task types and error-producing conditions...|$|R

50|$|A yard slug is {{designed}} for switching, and therefore is built to increase visibility in low speed operation. It has a low body and no cab, allowing the engineer or driver in the powered unit to see past it. Mother-slug sets are used in heavy <b>switching,</b> hump <b>yard</b> <b>switching,</b> and transfer runs between yards. Some are radio controlled without an operating engineer present in the cab.|$|R

25|$|In the 1970s the Burntisland <b>yard</b> <b>switched</b> from {{shipbuilding}} to prefabricating modules of superstructure for {{offshore oil}} platforms, but orders were intermittent {{and by the}} 1980s the yard was largely idle. In 1990 new owners returned the yard to production as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab, resuming the manufacture of superstructure modules for oil platforms. Under a management buyout in 2001 the Burntisland yard returned to being an independent company.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, tenders with a sloped back {{were often}} used for {{locomotives}} in <b>yard</b> <b>switching</b> service, because they greatly improved the engineer's ability to see behind the locomotive when switching cars. The reduced water capacity was not a problem, as the tender's water tank could be frequently refilled in the rail yard. [...] In the 1880s, numerous locomotive manufacturers were offering tenders with this design on small switch engines.|$|R
5000|$|The Baldwin S-12 was a [...] {{diesel-electric}} locomotive {{intended for use}} in <b>yard</b> <b>switching.</b> Utilizing a turbocharged 6-cylinder version of the powerful 606A diesel prime mover, S-12s were known for their [...] "lugging" [...] power, despite being temperamental. Like most Baldwin switchers, the S-12 had AAR Type-A switcher trucks in a B-B wheel arrangement. 451 units were built between 1951 and 1956, when Baldwin left the locomotive market.|$|R

In North America this is also called an [...] "equilateral switch" [...] or [...] "equilateral turnout". Common switches are more often associated with mainline speeds, whereas wye switches are generally low-speed <b>yard</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R

It {{was determined by the}} RF&P that the land was worth more than the need for <b>yard</b> <b>switching.</b> The PRR's old catenary was dismantled in the 1980s. The facility was identified as a toxic waste site in 1987. The RF&P finally decommissioned it in 1989.
