Therefore, 80% of the emperor penguin population comprises adults five <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>older.</b>|$|E

Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>older,</b> spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, {{is the second most}} common language and the most widely taught second language.

5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then, only for players sixteen <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>older.</b> As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching. A FUTURO III regional course men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008. In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country. In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.|$|E
