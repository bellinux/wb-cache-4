500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas was filmed between August 20 and August 21, 2012 in Los Angeles. A cut from the video premiered on NBC's The Voice on September 17. A video teaser was released on Aguilera's YouTube channel on September 17, 2012. The official music video premiered on Vevo on September 28, 2012. Aguilera commented about the collaboration with Matsoukas, [...] "Once we started talking {{with each other and}} she heard 'Your Body,' she spun {{it in a way that}} you wouldn't expect at all. And I get to play this character that, yeah, she may be a little bit of a badass, she's very confident, self-assured, but she's super playful and super tongue-in-cheek. She laughs the whole way through the video. She's watching cartoons, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> doesn't take herself too seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Desperate Souls" [...] partly {{deals with}} the {{aftermath}} of Sheriff Graham's death from the previous episode. Though her character is associated with evil, actress Lana Parrilla attempted to keep Regina as human as possible. She clarified, [...] "You will see how there is a genuine love and care for Graham…There was a physical connection to the character. He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds. But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, as <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> really takes on these challenges full force." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} {{planning}} stages of season two, CBS executive Tony Barch suggested Mills {{for the role}} of Abby Cunningham. The character was initially conceived as the sister of Sid Fairgate (Don Murray), one of the central characters on the show, who was killed off in the next season. Casting agent Barbara Miller-Gidaly introduced Mills and Jacobs. After meeting with Miller-Gidaly, Jacobs decided to have Mills test for the role, which was unusual for an established actress. She auditioned shortly after and convinced the producers that she was the right person for the part. Jacobs said, [...] "She came back that afternoon and she read and she was great, and it meant reshaping the role a little bit, but, um, not that much. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> still came in, she drove up in the Volvo station wagon. She had the kids in the back. It was very middle class." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Surest thing. But I {{wanted a}} {{straight}} story about--about yourself, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> When a fellow had a girl--a steady girl--she's {{got to be}} all right, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>She's</b> got to be straight goods." ...|$|R

500|$|Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone {{appreciated}} André 3000's {{performance and}} the song itself, writing: [...] "André 3000 is sharp and effortlessly charismatic on his rapped verse, but the real attraction here is the track itself." [...] Similarly, David Amidon of PopMatters commented that the song features [...] "one of those rare 'look how effortless rapping is for me'." [...] This was echoed by Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media, who wrote that [...] " [...] carefree retro sensibility pops up on three more highlights, including 'Party', which combines a pitch-perfect André 3000 guest verse, a Slick Rick sample, [...] while its bounce provides prime summer barbecue background." [...] Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was also positive: [...] "'Party' sounds right out of The SOS Band's catalog (its plodding tempo {{is the only thing}} that lets <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> isn't quoting a particularly poetic, desperately meth-seeking craigslist m4m ad [...] )". Jon Caramainca of The New York Times wrote that Beyoncé sings the song [...] "in her best impression of naughtiness." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the minimal production and simplistic lyrics of [...] "Party" [...] further describing the song as being as [...] "simple as a Beyoncé song gets: a low-key, synth-y beat paired with inspired vocals by Beyoncé and a killer, fluid verse by Mr. Benjamin [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Rathbun {{was arrested}} on three occasions, with each arrest {{bringing}} increased local, national, and international media attention to the medical cannabis movement. [...] Her grandmotherly appearance generated public sympathy for her cause and undermined attempts by the district attorney's office to prosecute her for possession. [...] The City of San Francisco eventually gave Rathbun permission to distribute cannabis brownies to people with AIDS. [...] Her arrests generated interest {{in the medical community}} and motivated researchers to propose one of the first clinical trials to study the effects of cannabinoids in HIV-infected adults., DEA. : [...] "I spent about a year or so trying to find researchers willing to invest their time in this, and I couldn't find anybody. And then there was a report in the paper about a woman in California who, she was called [...] "Brownie Mary." [...] She made marijuana brownies for AIDS patients to help them with appetite. And she was arrested at—while she was getting marijuana to make into these brownies, and she worked at San Francisco General Hospital at the AIDS ward. And so I called doctors there, and I said one of your volunteers has just been arrested. Would you be interested in trying to do some research to show whether she was doing something that might actually have been helpful to these patients? She probably thought that it was helpful since, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> was permitted on the ward to do this. And so I spoke to a Dr. Donald Abrams {{and he said that he}} would be interested in trying to do research in this area, and so we started to collaborate"; Sheehy, 2000: [...] "According to Donald Abrams, MD, lead author of the study and professor of clinical medicine in the UCSF Positive Health Program at San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center, this was the first attempt to study the effects of marijuana in people with HIV and one of the most comprehensive studies about the effects of marijuana on the immune system." ...|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1999 book, Padre Pio: The Wonder Worker, {{a segment}} by Irish priest Malachy Gerard Carroll {{describes}} {{the story of}} Gemma de Giorgi, a Sicilian girl whose blindness was {{believed to have been}} cured during a visit to Padre Pio. Gemma, who was brought to San Giovanni Rotondo in 1947 by her grandmother, was born without pupils. During her trip to see Padre Pio, the little girl began to see objects, including a steamboat and the sea. Gemma's grandmother did not believe the child had been healed. After Gemma forgot to ask Padre Pio for grace during her confession, her grandmother implored the priest to ask God to restore her sight. Padre Pio told her, [...] "The child must not weep and neither must you for the child sees and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> sees." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s before her death, Washington {{occasionally}} {{performed on the}} Las Vegas Strip. Tony Bennett said of Washington during a recording session with Amy Winehouse: [...] "She {{was a good friend}} of mine, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> was great. She used to just come in with two suitcases in Vegas without being booked. And she'd just come in and put the suitcases down. And she'd say [...] "I'm here, boss". And she'd stay as long as she wanted. And all the kids in all the shows on the Strip would come that night. They'd hear that she's in town and it would be packed just for her performance". According to Richard S. Ginell at AllMusic: [...] " [...] was at once one of the most beloved and controversial singers of the mid-20th century – beloved to her fans, devotees, and fellow singers; controversial to critics who still accuse her of selling out her art to commerce and bad taste. Her principal sin, apparently, was to cultivate a distinctive vocal style that was at home in all kinds of music, be it R, blues, jazz, middle of the road pop – and she probably would have made a fine gospel or country singer had she the time. Hers was a gritty, salty, high-pitched voice, marked by absolute clarity of diction and clipped, bluesy phrasing..." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{definitely}} {{had a story}} for it – a specific story – that's why I {{felt that it was}} important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always have a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
