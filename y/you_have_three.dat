[...] A majority of Inside Man was scanned on a Northlight film scanner, while the interrogation scenes had to be scanned on a Spirit DataCine, as the negatives proved [...] "too dense for the Northlight to perform the task." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1954, the 49ers {{compiled}} their Million Dollar Backfield, {{which was}} composed of four future Hall of Famers: Tittle; fullbacks John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry; and halfback Hugh McElhenny. [...] "It made quarterbacking so easy because I just get in the huddle and call anything and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball," [...] Tittle reminisced in 2006. The team had aspirations for a championship run, but injuries, including McElhenny's separated shoulder in the sixth game of the season, ended those hopes and the 49ers {{finished third in the}} Western Division. Tittle starred in his second straight Pro Bowl appearance as he threw two touchdown passes, including one to 49ers teammate Billy Wilson, who was named the game's MVP.|$|E
500|$|For three seasons, {{the backfield}} {{challenged}} opposing defenses with Tittle's arm, Johnson's power, {{the speed of}} Perry, and the elusiveness of McElhenny. [...] "There was no greater running backs than Hugh McElhenny, John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry in the same backfield," [...] Tittle reminisced. [...] "It made quarterbacking so easy because I just get in the huddle and call anything and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball." [...] They achieved their greatest success during their first year together, in 1954, in which they shattered the team record for rushing yards in a season. The 49ers led the league with 2,498 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns, and averaged 5.7 yards per carry and 208.2 rushing yards per game. Perry, McElhenny, and Johnson each finished the season in the top ten in rushing yards, with Perry and Johnson finishing first and second, respectively. McElhenny ranked eighth despite playing in only six games before being sidelined by a season-ending shoulder injury. Tittle, Perry, Johnson, and Detroit Lions halfback Doak Walker comprised the starting backfield in the 1955 Pro Bowl, and Perry was deemed the NFL's Player of the Year by the United Press. With the highly potent offense, many thought San Francisco was due to win a NFL championship, but defensive problems landed the 49ers in third place behind the Lions and Bears in 1954. Moreover, the offense struggled after McElhenny's injury.|$|E

500|$|Growing up {{a fan of}} Disney films, Murphy {{had never}} wanted to play a princess, preferring {{characters}} who were adventurous and [...] "drove the action" [...] instead. In the actress' opinion, villains {{continue to be the}} most dynamic characters in Disney films. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney villain as a [...] "juicy" [...] experience, Murphy explained that this is because these characters are [...] "not bound by ethics or moral codes or concern for what someone thinks or how it might hurt someone else", providing actors with more freedom. Upon her first session, Murphy appreciated the directors for exposing her to early concepts and ideas about Gothel. However, Murphy was not provided with a complete script because [...] "They’re very protective about that." [...] Murphy was directed to lower the pitch of her voice in favor of demonstrating a rather [...] "flat" [...] sound. Although Murphy did not base her own performance on any one individual in particular, she admitted to Babble that she was somewhat inspired by Betty Lou Gerson's performance as Cruella de Vil in Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961). Comparing voice acting to Broadway, Murphy commented that, in animation, [...] "You’re recording and you’re discovering it and giving the performance all at the same time. It’s not like <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> weeks rehearsal." [...] Additionally, Murphy never worked with co-star Mandy Moore, voice of Rapunzel; instead, Murphy revealed that scenes with Gothel and Rapunzel were actually recorded opposite one of the directors impersonating Moore, who also explained to Murphy that Gothel's design will continue to evolve as the character begins to adapt the actress' mannerisms. Howard enthused that Murphy [...] "nailed" [...] Gothel, admitting to ultimately using 90% of the actress' original material and takes because [...] "The character just came right to life when she came in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hope {{was well}} known as an avid golfer, playing {{in as many as}} 150 charity tournaments a year. Introduced to the game in the 1930s while {{performing}} in Winnipeg, Canada, he eventually played to a four handicap. His love for the game—and the humor he could find in it—made him a sought-after foursome member. He once remarked that President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave up golf for painting-- [...] "Fewer strokes, you know." [...] He also was quoted as saying, [...] "It's wonderful how you can start out with three strangers in the morning, play 18 holes, {{and by the time the}} day is over <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> solid enemies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film also {{features}} two robots, CASE and TARS (as {{well as a}} dismantled third robot, KIPP). Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a [...] quadrilateral design. The director said: [...] "It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks {{and they can be}} joined in three ways. So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional." [...] Actor Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film and his voicing for CASE was replaced with actor Josh Stewart's voice.|$|E

She met Bernard on the set of Sommersby (1993) and was in a relationship with her from 1993 to 2008. In April 2014, Foster married actress and photographer Alexandra Hedison. She stated in 2011 that having children has made her take on fewer projects: [...] "It is a big sacrifice to leave home.

Even if you take the average movie shoot of four months – <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> weeks' prep, press duties here and abroad, dubbing and looping, magazine covers, events and premieres – that's eight months out of a year.
