500|$|Barrowman {{spent his}} senior year shovelling coal for an Illinois power company. His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> you want to do – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E

There {{is a great deal of}} flourishing about in carriages here, which it would be your doom to see without sharing it. You would have to be poor, without the means of hiding your poverty. Do you believe you could bear that patiently? Whatever woman may cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so, it is my intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented; and there is nothing I can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to fail in the effort. I know I should be much happier with you than the way I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you. What you have said to me may have been in the way of jest, or I may have misunderstood you. If so, then let it be forgotten; if otherwise, I much wish you would think seriously before <b>you</b> <b>decide.</b> <b>What</b> I have said I will most positively abide by, provided you wish it. My opinion is that you had better not do it. You have not been accustomed to hardship, and it may be more severe than you now imagine. I know you are capable of thinking correctly on any subject, and if you deliberate maturely upon this subject before you decide, then I am willing to abide your decision.|$|E

While gochūmon is {{acceptable}} with an honorific (as {{it refers to the}} order as belonging to the customer, who is the intended recipient of the honorific speech), prescriptivists argue that osoroi is incorrect because chūmon is the subject of the verb, and raising up the status of the order itself is not the intent: the literal interpretation would be [...] "Are your hon. orders all honoring us with their presence?"

60|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} measure of precaution on this point is the absolute exclusion of every thing like angry looks and words as accompaniments of punishment. If you find that any wrong which your child commits awakens irritation or anger in your mind, suspend your judgment of the case and postpone all action until the irritation and anger have subsided, and you can consider calmly and deliberately what to do, with a view, not of satisfying your own resentment, but of doing good to the child. Then, when <b>you</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> to do, carry your decision into effect in a good-natured manner--firmly and inflexibly--but still without any violence, or even harshness, of manner.|$|R
40|$|Alf Ross (1889 - 1979) is {{not only}} one of the most renowned figures of Scandinavian Legal Realism, but also an {{important}} name in 20 th Century theory of democracy. The Danish legal philosopher developed a procedural and value-free theory of democracy: Democracy, as form of government, is about how <b>you</b> <b>decide,</b> not <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide.</b> In this essay I investigate Ross’ theory of democracy, starting from his famous essay Why Democracy?, namely his contribution to what is now known as “the great Nordic debate on democracy” in which several members of the second generation of the Uppsala school took part. I shall try to illustrate the historical context in which this debate developed in order to shed new light on Ross’ theories; in particular, I aim to show how he combines procedural theory of democracy with the claim that shared values are necessary and the non-cognitivist thesis in the field of meta-ethics. Finally, I shall point out some possible implications...|$|R

5000|$|Professional(and some amateur) Bracket Racing {{has evolved}} over the years into a drivers sport.
