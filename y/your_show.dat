25|$|In 1996, the Writers Guild of America, West reunited Caesar {{with nine}} of his writers from <b>Your</b> <b>Show</b> of Shows and Caesar's Hour for a two-hour panel {{discussion}} featuring head writer Mel Tolkin, Caesar, Carl Reiner, Aaron Ruben, Larry Gelbart, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, Sheldon Keller, and Gary Belkin. The event was taped, broadcast on PBS in the United States and the BBC in the UK, and later released as a DVD titled Caesar's Writers.|$|E
25|$|On February 25, 1950, Caesar {{appeared}} in the first episode of <b>Your</b> <b>Show</b> of Shows, initially {{the second half of}} the two-hour umbrella show, Saturday Night Review; at the end of the 1950–51 season, <b>Your</b> <b>Show</b> of Shows became its own, 90-minute program. Burgess Meredith hosted the first two shows, and the premiere featured musical guests Gertrude Lawrence, Lily Pons and Robert Merrill. The show was a mix of sketch comedy, movie and television satires, Caesar's monologues, musical guests, and large production numbers. Guests included: Jackie Cooper, Robert Preston, Rex Harrison, Eddie Albert, Michael Redgrave, Basil Rathbone, Charlton Heston, Geraldine Page, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Pearl Bailey, Fred Allen, Benny Goodman, Lena Horne and many other stars of the time. It was also responsible for bringing together the comedy team of Caesar, Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris. Many writers also got their break creating the show's sketches, including Lucille Kallen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin and Sheldon Keller. Sid Caesar won his first Emmy in 1952. In 1951 and 1952, he was voted the United States' Best Comedian in Motion Picture Dailys TV poll. The show ended after almost 160 episodes on June 5, 1954.|$|E

25|$|Capp portrayed {{himself in}} a cameo role in the Bob Hope film That Certain Feeling, for which he also {{provided}} promotional art. He was interviewed live on Person to Person on November 27, 1959, by host Charles Collingwood. He also appeared as himself on The Ed Sullivan Show, Sid Caesar's <b>Your</b> <b>Show</b> of Shows, The Red Skelton Show, The Merv Griffin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, and guested on Ralph Edwards' This Is Your Life on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, {{in a wide variety}} of publications including Life, Show, Pageant, The Atlantic, Esquire, Coronet, and The Saturday Evening Post. Capp was impersonated by comedians Rich Little and David Frye. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends Milton Caniff and Walt Kelly), and—with an irony that would become apparent later—a brand of cigarettes, (Chesterfield).|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the film, Hillenburg {{wanted to end}} the series [...] "so [...] wouldn't jump the shark." [...] "We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [...] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now {{was a good time}} to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see <b>your</b> <b>show</b> anymore," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: [...] "The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to," [...] storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: [...] "I think [...] respect that my contribution is important. I think they would want to maintain the original concept and quality." [...] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer has a direct involvement in the production of SpongeBob SquarePants, he still retains a position as an executive producer and maintains an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, Hillenburg voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.|$|E
500|$|Rick Massimo, {{reviewing}} the concert for The Providence Journal, wrote {{that as a}} musical theater, the Monster Ball was not that exciting, but [...] "that leaves the music, and when you lay two hours of her songs end-to-end, it's easy to see the vision, the intelligence and a serious songwriting talent at work." [...] Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise {{was impressed with the}} show, saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge, but [...] "always danceable". Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the [...] "most entertaining". Toronto Stars Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming [...] "hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn’t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir." [...] Mariel Concepción from Billboard felt that Gaga [...] "may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over-the-top stage shows, but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night, the pop phenomenon proved she's a regular girl at heart." [...] The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as [...] "one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year, [...] stimulated the crowd's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can. She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul." [...] The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg, and commented that [...] "it takes a certain je ne sais quoi to open <b>your</b> <b>show</b> doing something that looks suspiciously like mime on a rickety metal staircase while wearing an outfit with shoulderpads the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, Caesar {{reunited with}} Imogene Coca {{for the stage}} play, The Prisoner of Second Avenue, written [...] in 1971 by Neil Simon. Their play opened in Chicago in August 1973. That same year, Caesar and Max Liebman mined their own {{personal}} kinescopes from <b>Your</b> <b>Show</b> of Shows (NBC had [...] "lost" [...] the studio copies) and they produced a feature film Ten From <b>Your</b> <b>Show</b> of Shows, a compilation {{of some of their}} best sketches. In 1974, Caesar said, [...] "I'd like to be back every week" [...] on TV and appeared in the NBC skit-based comedy television pilot called Hamburgers.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{his primary}} {{subjects}} were parodies and spoofs of various film genres, including gangster films, westerns, newspaper dramas, spy movies and other TV shows.
