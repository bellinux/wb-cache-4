5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
500|$|After {{nearly three}} hours of shouts from the angry crowd, {{officers}} moved in to quell the riot. Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape—preventing any identification—and attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons. As one man ignited the last police car he shouted to a reporter [...] "Make sure <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the paper that I ate too many Twinkies." [...] Sixty officers were injured, and about two dozen arrests were made.|$|E
500|$|Among other Harrison biographers' {{interpretations of}} the lyrics, Ian Inglis writes of Harrison's unwelcome [...] "evangelical" [...] message {{regarding}} [...] "the consequences of a life of selfishness and greed which finds no place for 'the Lord'". In contrast, Leng views the verses as [...] "the singer's inner conversation", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his own existence, {{at a time when}} he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> is what you get out,' so, at one level, it's more a matter of common sense than divine revelation." ...|$|E

What thrills me about Holby {{is that you}} get back what <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in.</b> The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{included}} known actors {{from the}} show such as David Duchovny as Fox Mulder, Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully, Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner and William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man, {{as well as new}} actors and characters to the franchise. These included Martin Landau and Blythe Danner. The signing of these actors broke with what had become tradition for The X-Files. Carter had purposely cast virtually unknown actors for the television series, to make it more believable; [...] "As soon as <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> an actor whose face is very recognizable, you've got a situation that works against the reality of the show." [...] He saw creating the film as a chance to break this rule. He offered Glenne Headly the small role of a bartender. A fan of the show, she accepted enthusiastically.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, in a {{discussion}} forum, Lee Kuan Yew was asked whether the emotional bonds of various ethnic groups in Singapore could be a hurdle to nation building, Lee replied: [...] "Yes, I think so, {{over a long period}} of time, and selectively. We must not make an error. If, for instance, <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that's a very tricky business. We've got to know his background.

I hated the trailers, too and the TV ads especially". Fox Filmed Entertainment chairman Tom Rothman conceded that the marketing campaign did not work and said, [...] "Office Space isn't like American Pie.
