25|$|YadA is {{a protein}} domain found in Gram-negative {{bacteria}} such as <b>Yersinia</b> <b>enterocolitica,</b> Yersinia pestis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. YadA stands for Yersinia adhesin protein A. This protein domain {{is an example}} of Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins, {{and it was the first}} TAA to be discovered. Like other TAAs, YadA also undergoes homotrimerisation to form a stable collagen-binding protein. Homotrimerisation is a process whereby three of the same subunits, associate to make a complex of three identical YadA proteins. Furthermore, just like other TAAs, it has a head-stalk-anchor protein architecture. The majority of TAAs share strong similarity in the C-terminal membrane anchor region, the only member to differ across TAAs is the head, neck, and stalk regions. The head region of YadA is composed of beta-helices further folded to create a nine-coiled left-handed parallel beta-roll (LPBR).|$|E

50|$|Salmonella encodes a LuxR homolog, SdiA, {{but does}} not encode an AHL synthase. SdiA detects AHLs {{produced}} by other species of bacteria including Aeromonas hydrophila, Hafnia alvei, and <b>Yersinia</b> <b>enterocolitica.</b> When AHL is detected, SdiA regulates the rck operon on the Salmonella virulence plasmid (pefI-srgD-srgA-srgB-rck-srgC) and a single gene horizontal acquisition in the chromosome srgE. Salmonella does not detect AHL when passing through the gastrointestinal tracts of several animal species, suggesting that the normal microbiota does not produce AHLs. However, SdiA does become activated when Salmonella transits through turtles colonized with Aeromonas hydrophila or mice infected with <b>Yersinia</b> <b>enterocolitica.</b> Therefore, Salmonella appears to use SdiA to detect the AHL production of other pathogens rather than the normal gut flora.|$|E

50|$|This family {{consists}} of several bacterial and phage Ail/Lom-like proteins. The <b>Yersinia</b> <b>enterocolitica</b> Ail protein is a known virulence factor. Proteins {{in this family}} are predicted to consist of eight transmembrane beta-sheets and four cell surface-exposed loops. It is thought that Ail directly promotes invasion and loop 2 contains an active site, perhaps a receptor-binding domain. The phage protein Lom is expressed during lysogeny, and encode host-cell envelope proteins. Lom {{is found in the}} bacterial outer membrane, and is homologous to virulence proteins of two other enterobacterial genera. It has been suggested that lysogeny may generally have a role in bacterial survival in animal hosts, and perhaps in pathogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Yersiniabactin (Ybt) is a {{siderophore}} {{found in}} the pathogenic bacteria Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and <b>Yersinia</b> <b>enterocolitica,</b> {{as well as several}} strains of enterobacteria including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Siderophores, compounds of low molecular mass with high affinities for ferric iron, are important virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. Iron, an essential element for life utilized by such cellular processes as respiration and DNA replication, is extensively chelated by host proteins like lactoferrin and ferritin; thus, the pathogen produces molecules with an even higher affinity for Fe3+ than these proteins in order to acquire sufficient iron for growth. As a part of such an iron-uptake system, yersiniabactin {{plays an important role in}} pathogenicity of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. entercolitica.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the haemolysin expression modulating protein {{family is}} a family of proteins. This family consists of haemolysin expression modulating protein (Hha) from Escherichia coli and its enterobacterial homologues, such as YmoA from <b>Yersinia</b> <b>enterocolitica,</b> and RmoA encoded on the R100 plasmid. These proteins act as modulators of bacterial gene expression. Members of this family act in conjunction {{with members of the}} H-NS family, participating in the thermoregulation of different virulence factors and in plasmid transfer. Hha, along with the chromatin-associated protein H-NS, is involved in the regulation of expression of the toxin alpha-haemolysin in response to osmolarity and temperature. YmoA modulates the expression of various virulence factors, such as Yop proteins and YadA adhesin, in response to temperature. RmoA is a plasmid R100 modulator involved in plasmid transfer. The HHA family of proteins display striking similarity to the oligomerisation domain of the H-NS proteins.|$|E
5000|$|Inflammatory response. Human {{cells have}} receptors that {{recognize}} pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). When bacteria bind to these receptors, they activate signaling cascades {{such as the}} NF-kB and MAPK pathways. This leads to expression of cytokines, immunomodulating agents, such as interleukins and interferons which regulate immune response to infection and inflammation. Several bacterial effectors affect NF-kB signaling. For instance, the EPEC/EHEC effectors NleE, NleB, NleC, NleH, and Tir are immunosuppressing effectors that target proteins in the NF-kB signaling pathway. NleC {{has been shown to}} cleave the NF-kB p65 subunit (RelA), blocking the production of IL-8 following infection. [...] NleH1, but not NleH2, blocks translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus. [...] The Tir effector protein inhibits cytokine production. [...] Similarly, YopE, YopP, and YopJ (in <b>Yersinia</b> <b>enterocolitica,</b> Yersinia pestis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis respectively) target the NF-kB pathway. YopE inhibits activation of NF-kB, which in part prevents the production of IL-8.|$|E
50|$|Cefodizime {{demonstrated}} superior clinical efficacy {{that what}} could be predicted from its in vitro experimental results. Certain immunomodulatory properties of the drug might account for its increased in vivo activity against specific bacterial species. These immunomodulatory properties stimulate some phagocyte and lymphocyte cellular functions when they have been impaired. It was shown in a 2004 study that cefodizime increased expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in neutrophils stimulated by Klebsiella pneumoniae infection which then affected the production of cytokines in the stimulated cells.A 1992 study conducted in vitro susceptibility studies for cefodizime and found that gram negative bacteria with consistent susceptibility include: Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Shigella sonnei, <b>Yersinia</b> <b>enterocolitica,</b> Salmonella, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis. In vitro susceptible gram positive bacteria include: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Cefodizime was shown to be ineffective in vitro against Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Gram positive bacteria it was inactive against include Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus. In this trial, bacteria were considered susceptible if 90% {{or more of the}} strains were inhibited by cefodizime concentrations of at least 8 mg/L in vitro.|$|E
