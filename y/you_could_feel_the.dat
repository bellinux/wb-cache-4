Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> weight of the world on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E

In spite of his clutch of which steadying truth, however, and in spite of his declaring to her, with many other angry protests and pleas, that the line of conduct she announced was worthy of a vindictive barmaid, a lurking fear in him, too deep to counsel mere defiance, made him appear to keep open a little, till he could somehow turn round again, the door of possible composition. He had scoffed at her claim, at her threat, at her thinking she could hustle and bully him--"Such a way, my eye, to call back to life a dead love!"--yet his instinct was ever, prudentially but helplessly, for gaining time, even if time only more wofully to quake, and he gained it now by not absolutely giving for his ultimatum that he wouldn't think of coming round. He didn't in the smallest degree mean to come round, but it was characteristic of him that he could for three or four days breathe a little easier by having left her under the impression that he perhaps might. At the same time he couldn't not have said--what had conduced to bring out, in retort, her own last word, the word on which they had parted--"Do you mean to say you yourself would now be willing to marry and live with a man of whom <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel,</b> <b>the</b> thing done, that he'd be all the while thinking of you in the light of a hideous coercion?"

[...] Schumacher's unusual driving style, based on his extraordinary feel for a car's performance made development for the B194 extremely limited; this gave him an advantage over his teammates.

The two artists are dressed in all-white pajamas, as they lay in the bed of a high-rise Los Angeles apartment performing their respective parts of the song. The song breaks multiple times in the video as Aiko answers questions from a reporter who is interviewing her. The video also features many comparisons to the videos of Lennon and Ono's Bed-In protests.
