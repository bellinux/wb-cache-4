[...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings." [...] Paar then asked, [...] "What did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> heard that Dr. King had been assassinated?"

You seem a stout fellow, and full of spirit, but, as yet, {{anything}} that may be going on is known but to a few, and will go no further until the time comes that all may be told. I think not so badly of men of our faith as to believe that any one would betray the secret for the sake of obtaining his own freedom and a big reward; but secrets, when known by many, are apt to leak out. A muttered word or two in sleep, or the ravings of one down with fever, might afford ground for suspicion, and torture would soon do the rest. I myself know nothing of the secret, but I do know that there is something going on which, if successful, will give us our freedom. I am content to know no more until the time comes; but there are few, save those engaged in the matter, that know as much as this, {{and you can see that}} it is better it should be so. Look at that man opposite; he has been here fifteen years; he seldom speaks; he does his work, but it is as a brute beast--despair has well nigh turned him into one. Think you that if such a man as that were to know that there is hope, he would not be so changed that even the dullest would observe it? I see you are a brisk young fellow, and I say to you, keep up your courage. The time is nearer than <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> will be free from these accursed shackles." ...|$|E

40|$|Visible facial {{differences}} (VFDs) {{can pose}} {{a number of}} psychosocial challenges for those affected by them. In particular, {{the experience of being}} stigmatised may have a harmful effect on the psychological adjustment of the individual concerned. This is especially pertinent for young people, who are at an age where appearance becomes increasingly central to social interaction and self-esteem. Suitable and effective interventions are needed to reduce stigma in general, {{but in the case of}} appearance-related discrimination the prevalence and the processes involved are poorly understood. The aim of this research was therefore to explore young people’s perceptions of visible difference. A mixed-methods online questionnaire was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 412 pupils aged 12 – 14 years, recruited from three UK schools. Participants were asked to look at five photographs of people with VFDs and to indicate their level of agreement with 30 statements using a 5 -point Likert scale. They were also asked to answer the open-ended question ‘What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see people with facial differences?’ Although quantitative responses were overwhelmingly neutral, inductive content analysis revealed a number of insights. Four main themes were identified: them and us, initial reactions, common assumptions and behavioural intentions. Participants reported a wide range of complex responses. Although negative reactions and judgements were described, these were often due to seeing something unusual, or to a lack of understanding, rather than to the intention to cause harm. Conflicting emotions led to uncertainty and lack of confidence about how best to behave around people with VFDs. The findings suggest the need for a two tiered approach to intervention: first, to raise awareness of VFDs and to facilitate the development of appropriate social skills within the general population, and secondly, to provide support to enable those with VFDs to cope with any negative reactions they may encounter...|$|E

Such old-fashioned conceptions to the contrary, taxonomy is alive today although constantly struggling for survival and recognition. The scientific community is losing valuable resources as taxonomy experts age and retire, and funding for morphological studies and species descriptions remains stagnant. At the same time, organismal knowledge (morphology, ecology, physiology) has never been more important: genomic studies are becoming more taxon focused, the scientific community is recognizing the limitations of traditional "model" organisms, and taxonomic expertise is desperately needed to fight against global biodiversity declines resulting from human impacts. There has never been a better time for a taxonomic renaissance...|$|R
