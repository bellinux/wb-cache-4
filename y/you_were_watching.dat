500|$|Among major {{metropolitan}} weeklies, David Edelstein of New York magazine called the film [...] "a shapely piece of mythmaking [...] Favreau doesn't {{go in for}} stylized comic-book frames, {{at least in the}} first half. He gets real with it – you'd think <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> a military thriller", while conversely, David Denby of The New Yorker put forth a negative review, claiming [...] "a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's girl Friday, who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted". IGN's Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as [...] "the best thing" [...] in a film that [...] "functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles". Noting the cultural elements of the film, Cristobal Giraldez Catalan of Bright Lights Film Journal wrote, [...] "Iron Man is far more than playboy fantasy; it is American foreign policy realized without context [...] with narrative and directorial precision, once again provides the high-fidelity misogyny and anti-Muslim rhetoric Hollywood is known for." ...|$|E

He called it his favorite moment of the episode, and praised its energy; he wrote that Quinn made a [...] "surprisingly good" [...] Magenta. Semigran also praised the number, and commended the performances by Morris, Monteith, Agron and particularly Colfer, who, she wrote, [...] "looked and sounded the part so well, you'd swear <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> the original Rocky Horror Picture Show". In a generally negative review of the episode, Reiter commented that despite her dissatisfaction, she found herself singing along to [...] "Time Warp" [...] with [...] "disconcerting enthusiasm", and was [...] "nostalgically transported against [...] better judgment". In contrast, VanDerWerff stated {{that he would have}} increased his review of the episode from an [...] "F" [...] to a [...] "D" [...] had [...] "Time Warp" [...] been better, as he had [...] "never seen a more lifeless version". Zoller Seitz similarly called it [...] "very possibly the weakest, most uninspired rendition" [...] he had ever seen, and criticized the side-lining of Colfer in favor of Monteith.|$|E
500|$|Relic did not {{specifically}} {{set out to}} create a real-time strategy game; Garden and Relic were primarily focused on making a game with exciting large-scale space battles, and chose the genre {{in order to support}} that. As a result, they did not try to make innovative gameplay changes in the real-time strategy genre, but instead worked on making implementing the genre in a fully-3D space to make the space battles they envisioned. Garden told Computer Games Magazine in 1998 that [...] "there's no sort of design philosophy behind it. The fact that it's real-time strategy was almost a fluke." [...] The original Star Wars film trilogy was one of the games primary inspirations, along with the 1970s television series Battlestar Galactica: in a 1998 interview with PC Zone, Garden stated that his original concept for the game was [...] "a 3D game that looked like <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> Star Wars but had a storyline like Battlestar Galactica". He drew further inspiration from correcting what he felt were the limitations of the first-person space flight game [...] He felt that having the player control a ship from a cockpit view detracted from the feeling of the overall battles, and so chose to have the player control a whole fleet from an external view.|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 11 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends." [...] James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, [...] "After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes {{leading up to the}} finale... "Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "Part of the fun of those early episodes – even when I really didn't like them – was that you never quite had a good sense of what the hell kind of show <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching.</b> The finale sticks us into {{what seems to be a}} pretty basic setup for season two." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Afterbirth" [...] "an exhilarating shocker." [...] Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a score eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He stated, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] was a very odd finale and I'm pretty sure that it was nothing like most of us thought it would be." ...|$|E

Crystal Bell of Huffington Post described it as [...] "heartfelt, comical and, yes, absolutely ridiculous", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called it a [...] "tearful and touching finale". Though she acknowledged exceptions, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone characterized the episode as a [...] "nonstop sapfest of too many tears and not enough nostalgia", while Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker said it had [...] "the perfect amount of flashbacks and revelations" [...] and described it as [...] "a season finale that sure felt like a series finale". Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that [...] "there simply isn't enough time to settle the fates of so many seniors in a mere hour", a sentiment also expressed by Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, who thought the episode might have [...] "felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe". Hankinson also said it left him with [...] "mostly questions" [...] but also [...] "some fury". TV Guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic: Kate Stanhope described is as a [...] "perfect mix of the kids' past, present and future", and Damian Holbrook wrote that the [...] "class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid, emotional and entertaining, you would have thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> one of the show's first 13 episodes".|$|E

2500|$|GameZone's Louis Bedigian {{scored the}} game 8.4 out of 10, feeling [...] "Dark Cloud 2 {{includes}} many annoyances {{that were not}} present in the first game, such as a longer, cheesier storyline; dorkier characters; and voice-overs that are so traumatizing you'll think <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> an episode of Blue's Clues." [...] He concluded that [...] "For all its annoyances, Dark Cloud 2 is still a really, really good game. [...] I love the battles, I love the Georama system, and I love being able to build my own weapons. But I am also very disappointed in the direction that was taken with the story.

2500|$|Electronic Gaming Monthly's November 2006 edition's [...] "The Rest of the Crap" [...] section, {{written by}} critic Seanbaby, {{described}} Seanbaby's own involvement.

Seanbaby said that he trains in muay thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, stating that [...] "boxing is to fighting what Hungry Hungry Hippos is to fighting", but that he was eager to fight Boll nonetheless.

2500|$|He has refined the {{explanation}} by shifting to {{the example of}} a [...] "Movitype" [...] screen, often used for advertisements and announcements in public places. A Movitype screen consists of a matrix—or [...] "raster" [...] as the neuroscientists prefer to call it (from the Latin rastrum, a [...] "rake"; think of the lines on a TV screen as [...] "raked" [...] across)—that is made up of an array of tiny light-sources. A computer-led input can excite these lights so as to give the impression of letters passing from right to left, or even, on the more advanced forms now commonly used in advertisements, to show moving pictures. Maund's point is as follows. It is obvious that there are two ways of describing what you are seeing. We could either adopt the everyday public language and say [...] "I saw some sentences, followed by a picture of a 7-Up can." [...] Although that is a perfectly adequate way of describing the sight, nevertheless, there is a scientific way of describing it which bears no relation whatsoever to this commonsense description. One could ask the electronics engineer to provide us with a computer print-out staged across the seconds that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> it of the point-states of the raster of lights. This would no doubt be a long and complex document, with the state of each tiny light-source given its place in the sequence. The interesting aspect of this list is that, although it would give a comprehensive and point-by-point-detailed description {{of the state of the}} screen, nowhere in that list would there be a mention of [...] "English sentences" [...] or [...] "a 7-Up can".|$|E

2500|$|These traits come to {{the fore}} in Hi, Mom!s [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{sequence}}. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience.

In Hi, Mom! for instance, there is a sequence where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> obviously <b>watching</b> a ridiculous documentary and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> told that and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> aware of it, but it still sucks <b>you</b> in.
