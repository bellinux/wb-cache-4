500|$|According to Roger Waters, Barrett {{came into}} {{what was to be}} their last {{practice}} session with a new song he had dubbed [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> <b>It</b> Yet?" [...] The song seemed simple enough when he first presented it, but it soon became impossibly difficult to learn and they eventually realised that while they were practising it, Barrett kept changing the arrangement. He would then play it again, with the arbitrary changes, and sing [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> yet?" [...] Eventually they realised they never would, and that they were simply bearing the brunt of Barrett's idiosyncratic sense of humour. Waters had called it [...] "a real act of mad genius".|$|E
500|$|Based on the premiere, Merrill Barr of Forbes {{felt that}} the show [...] "has grown up a lot since its first year, and with the start of season three, it's hard to imagine what {{complaints}} any fans could possibly still have. If you want overall continuity, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>it.</b> If you want people with super powers going crazy, it's there. If you want an ensemble cast that brings the broadcast television corner of the MCU to life, then look no further. The point is, with the new season of S.H.I.E.L.D., it's everything one could ask from the show." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow stated that the premiere was [...] "riddled with [...] visual signifiers, highlighting the ways Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gradually become sharper, sleeker, and more reliant on the bones of its comic-book source material." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Now That You Got It" [...] {{was written}} by Gwen Stefani, Sean Garrett and Swizz Beatz, with {{production}} being done by the latter two; Garrett also provided background vocals. The single version of the song features a [...] "loping hip-hop beat and a staccato piano sample" [...] while Stefani [...] "splits wailing time with a chorus of alarms," [...] according to Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork Media. It also presents elements of reggae music and [...] "military snare drums" [...] mixed with crunk militarism. Lyrically, on [...] "Now That You Got It", the singer tells her lover that {{even though he is}} with her, he still has to work hard to keep her and give her everything she wants. [...] "Now that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>it,</b> what you gon' do about it?", she repeatedly asks in the chorus.|$|E

500|$|Como {{competed with}} Jackie Gleason {{in what was}} billed as the [...] "Battle of the Giants" [...] and won. This is now rarely mentioned, in part because Como {{commonly}} downplayed his own achievements, and also because {{the two men were}} friends. The weekly ratings winner would phone the loser for some mock gloating. At the height of this television competition, Como asked Gleason a favor: to visit his home when his mother-in-law, a big Gleason fan, was there. Though Mrs. Belline spoke no English and Gleason no Italian, Roselle's mother was thrilled. Como's words to Gleason after the visit, [...] "Anything you want, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>it.</b> In fact, I'll even do one of your shows so the ratings will be better." [...] Como was among those who filled in for Gleason on The Jackie Gleason Show in 1954 when the entertainer suffered a broken ankle and leg in an on-air fall.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Marc Webb and Rich Lee was filmed in Budapest, Hungary between June 11 and June 14, 2007. [...] Lee made a guest appearance on MTV's Total Request Live (TRL) on September 10, 2007, to premier the video. A writer for MTV News found the video to be [...] "dark and cinematic, it's {{almost as if}} you swallowed an entire feature length film in 3 minutes." [...] Another writer for the rock magazine Blender was negative towards the video saying that it [...] "makes singer Amy Lee's soul bearing that much more drawn-out with ill-advised slow motion shots of (yep) decay and destruction. (Oh, {{look at the record}} melt!) Redemption? <b>You</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> in the form of CGI tree roots, a breaking sunrise and a sudden wet t-shirt contest.

500|$|Canadian singer Bryan Adams has {{released}} thirteen studio albums, six compilation albums, two soundtrack albums, four live albums, and sixty-nine singles. After {{the success of}} his debut single, [...] "Let Me Take You Dancing" [...] (1979), Adams signed a recording contract with A Records. Bryan Adams (1980), his debut album, peaked at number 69 on the Canadian RPM Albums Chart. Adams followed this with You Want It <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> <b>It</b> (1981), which peaked at number 118 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold in Canada. Cuts Like a Knife, his third release, became his first successful work outside Canada. The album charted within the top ten in Canada and the United States and was certified three-times platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Reckless (1984), his fourth studio album, selling over 12 million copies worldwide and featured the hit singles [...] "Run to You", [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Summer of '69". In 1987, he released Into the Fire, which reached platinum status in the United States and triple-platinum in Canada.|$|E

500|$|In December 1967, {{the group}} added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied {{with him at}} Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had {{performed}} at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week (...) , and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: [...] "The idea was that Dave would... cover for [...] eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd {{was just going to}} write. Just to try to keep him involved". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up [...] "Arnold Layne" [...] and [...] "See Emily Play", instead introduced [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> <b>It</b> Yet?" [...] to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.|$|E
500|$|Around Christmas 1967, guitarist David Gilmour, an {{old friend}} of Barrett's from Cambridge, was asked by the other members of Pink Floyd to join as a second guitarist, {{initially}} to not replace Barrett, but to cover for him, because his unpredictable behaviour prevented him from performing. For several shows Gilmour sang and played guitar while Barrett wandered around on stage, every now and then deciding to join in playing guitar and singing. Waters and fellow band members keyboardist Richard Wright and drummer Nick Mason soon grew weary of Barrett's on-stage antics and, on 26 January 1968, when Waters was driving his bandmates from London to a show at Southampton University, they all agreed to go without Barrett: according to Gilmour's recollection, one person asked, [...] "Shall we pick Syd up?" [...] and another said, [...] "Let's not bother." [...] Since Barrett had written or co-written 10 of the 11 songs on their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, as well as the band's three singles up to this point, the original plan was to keep him in the group as a non-touring member − in a similar arrangement to what The Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson − but this soon proved to be unworkable. At his last rehearsal with the band, he presented a new song entitled [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> <b>It</b> Yet?", which proved to be deliberately unplayable as the others attempted to join in, until they realised the joke of the title. On 6 April, the group officially announced that Barrett was no longer a member of Pink Floyd. Upon leaving the Floyd, Barrett said to Melody Maker: [...] "I suppose it was really just a matter of being a little offhand about things".|$|E

2500|$|Of {{his initial}} meeting with President Bush {{regarding}} the surge, Keane said {{he made a}} phone call to Newt Gingrich to ask his advice prior to the meeting. As Keane said in 2014, Gingrich gave me some good advice. He said, [...] "Look, Jack. Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table." [...] He said, [...] "Don’t leave anything on the table." [...] He said, [...] "You’re going to get about 15 minutes at best and put it all out there.

2500|$|Andrew Unterberger of {{the website}} PopDust wrote that Flo Rida was [...] "exactly" [...] what the {{original}} version of [...] "We Found Love" [...] was missing. He added, [...] "No Rihanna, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> backwards—it's Flo Rida who needs to have other, more talented people on his songs in order {{to turn them into}} hits, not the other way around... At least this remix does feature a sizeable contribution from Flo, as he shows up on both the intro and over the song's primary instrumental hook with his trademark unintelligble yammering, though he gets in at least one reference to rocking a party 'like I'm Mick Jagger.'" [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone praised the remix of the song, saying that [...] "once again, Flo Rida shows his true rapping skills over the beat of Rihanna's 'We Found Love'". Both Billboards Erika Ramirez and Spins Marc Hogan praised the remixed version calling it [...] "refreshing" [...] and [...] "interesting". However, Becky Bain of the website Idolator was more negative towards the remix. She noted, [...] "Being that Rihanna's 'We Found Love' has enough beats and synths to be its own remix, not to mention it couldn't possibly be even more popular on the Hot 100... we find it pointless to release {{a new version of the}} single with Flo Rida." ...|$|E
