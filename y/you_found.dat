In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

Traditionally, the MSE included the use of standard hypothetical questions such as [...] "what {{would you do if}} <b>you</b> <b>found</b> a stamped, addressed envelope lying in the street?"; however contemporary practice is to inquire about how the patient has responded or would respond to real-life challenges and contingencies. Assessment would take into account the individual's executive system capacity in terms of impulsiveness, social cognition, self-awareness and planning ability.|$|E
500|$|The tree photographed for {{the sleeve}} fell around 2000, yet the site remains a popular tourist {{attraction}} for U2 fans.

It is a common misconception that the site is within Joshua Tree National Park, when in fact it is over 200 miles away from the park. In 2011, Guus van Hove, the director of the Dutch music venue 013, and his girlfriend died of heat exhaustion in a remote part of that park, allegedly searching for the site of U2's tree.|$|E

500|$|As {{captain and}} first line centre for Team Canada, Crosby played with {{different}} line mates {{in almost every}} game as the coaching staff struggled to find players capable of keeping pace with the superstar centre at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, and again at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Crosby's fellow countryman and Olympic teammate, Rick Nash of the New York Rangers was questioned by the media about this, at one point saying, [...] "I think he's a tough guy to keep up with. He's so fast. The way he thinks about the game seems like it's far beyond everyone else's process.

His mother said that [...] "e was a challenging child. Where the other two boys would ask for permission to do stuff, Lonnie...would just do it, and when <b>you</b> <b>found</b> out about it, he would give you a big story." [...] Taylor concentrated on baseball as a youth, in which he played the position of catcher, and only began playing football at the advanced age of fifteen. He did not play organized high school football until the following year (eleventh grade), and was not heavily recruited coming out of high school.|$|E

500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me so much confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun.

500|$|GoldenEye 007 {{introduced}} stealth elements {{not seen}} in previous first-person shooter games. Doak explained how this was implemented: [...] "Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within {{a certain amount of}} time, it did a larger radius test and I think there was a third even larger radius after that. It meant if <b>you</b> <b>found</b> one guy and shot him in the head and then didn't fire again, the timer would reset". Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them while the player can. Though decidedly unrealistic, this was an intentional feature made to encourage the player to use windows to covertly spy on enemies. The game's multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis described it as [...] "a complete afterthought". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who [...] "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game." ...|$|E

2500|$|A common way to {{test whether}} an innate jealousy {{response}} exists between sexes {{is to use a}} forced-choice questionnaire. This style of questionnaire asks participants [...] "Yes or No" [...] and [...] "Response A or Response B" [...] style questions about certain scenarios. For example, a question might ask, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>found</b> your partner cheating on you would you be more upset by (A) the sexual involvement or (B) the emotional involvement". As the name implies, one is forced to choose between the two options. Many studies using forced choice questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women. [...] Furthermore, studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures, although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures.|$|E
