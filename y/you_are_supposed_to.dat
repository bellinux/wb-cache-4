500|$|The [...] "brainwashing" [...] {{reference}} {{had been}} an offhand, unplanned remark that came {{at the end of}} a long, behind-schedule day of campaigning. [...] By September 7, it found its way into prominence at The New York Times. [...] Eight other governors who had been on the same 1965 trip as Romney said no such activity had taken place, and one of them, Philip H. Hoff of Vermont, said Romney's remarks were [...] "outrageous, kind of stinking ... Either he's a most naïve man or he lacks judgment." [...] The connotations of brainwashing, following the experiences of American prisoners of war (highlighted by the 1962film The Manchurian Candidate), made Romney's comment devastating, especially as it reinforced the negative image of Romney's abilities that had already developed. [...] The topic of brainwashing quickly became newspaper editorial and television talk show fodder, and Romney bore the brunt of the topical humor. Senator Eugene McCarthy, running against Johnson for the Democratic nomination, said that in Romney's case, [...] "a light rinse would have been sufficient." [...] Republican Congressman Robert T. Stafford of Vermont sounded a common concern: [...] "If you're running for the presidency, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have too much on the ball to be brainwashed." [...] After the remark was aired, Romney's poll ratings nosedived, going from 11percent behind Nixon to 26percent behind.|$|E
2500|$|There {{became a}} {{concern in the}} U.S. that Mubarak {{believed}} {{that he had been}} publicly humiliated by the U.S. and would move toward reconciliation with other Arab states at the cost of relations with Israel and the U.S. which was seen as being determental to Middle East peace efforts and perhaps even another Arab-Israeli war. An unnamed Egyptian source told the New York Times [...] "Reagan has humiliated Mubarak and in the Arab world that is unheard of if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be a friend." ...|$|E
2500|$|Virtually all {{actors who}} worked with Ozu—including Chishu Ryu, who collaborated with the {{director}} on almost all his films—agree {{that he was an}} extremely demanding taskmaster. He would direct very simple actions by the performer [...] "to the centimeter." [...] As opposed to those of both Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ozu's characters, according to Sato, are [...] "usually calm... they not only move at the same pace but also speak at the same measured rate." [...] He insisted that his actors express emotions through action, even rote action, rather than by directly expressing their innermost feelings. Once, when the distinguished character actress Haruko Sugimura asked the director what her character was supposed to be feeling at a given moment, Ozu responded, “You are not supposed to feel, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do.” ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the study}} room, {{the group has}} used Jeff's {{suggestion}} to divide up, leaving Troy with Britta, Annie with Shirley, Todd with Jeff, and Abed with Pierce. Abed makes the mistake of saying he put the least popular and most popular people together, which leads the group to fight about who is more popular and who is more liked within their social circle. Annie says that Shirley is too religious, Shirley says Britta won't dissect anything with heads, and Annie says that people don't want to academically carry Jeff all year. The group fights over who's more popular and Todd tries to leave but Jeff won't let him until they've decided something. When Britta lights the results list on fire and almost kills Todd's turtle, Todd finally loses it. [...] "What <b>is</b> wrong with <b>you</b> people?
