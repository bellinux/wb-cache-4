[...] Saunders commented [...] "It's an epic story, but it's a very personal one. You awaken {{in a pool of}} your own blood. Your immediate goal is survival. The shard of the Sword of Gith has been ripped from <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> and in its place is a dark hunger, a craving that threatens to consume you. The early part of the game involves determining the source and implications of this craving." [...] Saunders also stated that the story, written by creative lead George Ziets, was [...] "very dark" [...] and that the ending would bring some closure to the story of the Shard-Bearer.|$|E

500|$|The Sands of Time {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon launch. Edge said that, despite difficulty spikes caused by respawning enemies, [...] "the game cannot be commended highly enough". IGN's Matt Casamassina found the entire experience enjoyable, saying that [...] "Whether you're a diehard Prince of Persia fan or {{somebody with a}} mild interest in action-adventures, The Sands of Time is a must own -- a soon-to-be-classic worthy of a permanent place in your collection". 1UP.com, while pointing out the camera control as [...] "tricky", said that the game [...] "will make <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> explode if you've got a heart condition (in a good way, of course)". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called it [...] "a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly". Both Eurogamer and Official PlayStation Magazine positively compared the game's aesthetics and presentation to Ico. Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a good review, praising the story and general gameplay, but finding the combat difficult at times and lack of new skills. In closing, she praised the game's lasting appeal: [...] "When {{the whole thing is}} over, it's perfectly timed to leave you wanting more. It's a stunning and rare achievement that makes you feel happy to be a gamer." [...] Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the PS2 version a good review, saying that the action was smooth and challenging, bearing similarities to the original Prince of Persia, and one reviewer found the Prince [...] "colourful".|$|E

Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] is an aggregation off [...] "distorted" [...] synthesisers derived from Joey Beltram's 1990 record [...] "Mentasm" [...] "until it sounds weird and disorientating". The Boston Globes James Reed labeled [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] as a club banger containing a heavy bass [...] "that rumbles more in <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> instead of rattling your feet." [...] Alex Macpherson of Fact wrote that on the song [...] "Rihanna sprays declamations like machine gun fire over what could pass for a lost early ’90s Prodigy rave anthem."

[...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Corpse Bride is a delightful mix of strange goings-on and imaginatively crafted puppetry, a wild ride through Burton's chaotic, splendidly original world."

[...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "Corpse Bride suffers from the same problem that has plagued Burton's recent live-action films: for all its formidable razzle-dazzle, it doesn't engage the heart."

The song was published as early as 1891.

Glenn Miller recorded the song in 1939.|$|E
2500|$|Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of The Chicagoist wrote, [...] "There is {{a moment}} in each {{installment}} of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in <b>your</b> <b>chest.</b> It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed {{to make me feel}} this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{extremely}} {{young or}} physically challenged players may use {{both hands to}} swing the ball forward from in between their legs. This kind of style has the bowler start close to the foul line, and is called the [...] "Granny style" [...] (after its similarity to the [...] "granny shot" [...] in amateur basketball) or the [...] "Pee-Wee method". In recent years, the new two-handed [...] "shovel" [...] style hook release is gaining more popularity, as it generates more revolutions and speed to knock down pins. Another method for novice bowlers is the [...] "bounce pass" [...] technique which is performed by thrusting the ball from <b>your</b> <b>chest</b> with two hands towards the pins. This technique is easily picked up by weaker players but is seldom used because it is frowned upon by the bowling community {{because of the potential}} to damage the lanes and/or ball. Some middle aged bowlers use the ramp in which a bowler will use two hands and push the ball down the ramp onto the lane.|$|E
2500|$|Allison Stewart of The Washington Post {{found the}} song to be [...] "galloping, out-of-place synth-rock number" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "even Adele can't save" [...] the song.

[...] He further called the song [...] "one of 21s angrier tracks" [...] and concluded: [...] "The chorus' hooks are crazy catchy, and by the final one Adele {{releases}} and her hurt slips through the anger {{to give you a}} damn real and forward show of emotion. I’d imagine seeing this song live or in a stripped down setting would make one bawl like a child. You’ll want to pump your fist and pound <b>your</b> <b>chest.</b> That’s a guarantee." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy praised the song saying, [...] "'It was dark and I was over/ Until you kissed my lips and saved me,' she admits over a gloomy piano riff, before launching into a ballsy, hands-in-the-air chorus. 'I set fire to the rain/ and I threw us into the flames,' she belts with growly vocals against cinematic strings. Rounding out with a suitably breathtaking blast from her impressive pipes and the result sounds like classic, though it's anything but camp." ...|$|E
