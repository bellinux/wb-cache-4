25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said I could not. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best.
