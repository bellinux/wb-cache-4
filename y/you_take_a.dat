25|$|The Gent tram is {{operated}} by De Lijn (the company which provides transport {{service in the}} whole of Flanders); the fare control system is the same as on all public transport in Flanders, and there are no turnstiles.

25|$|The axioms {{of a group}} formalize the {{essential}} aspects of symmetry. Symmetries form a group: they are closed because if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity {{comes from the fact}} that symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.|$|E

500|$|When two Canadian astronomers {{argued that}} they {{potentially}} discovered 234 extraterrestrial civilizations through analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database, Douglas Vakoch doubted their explanation for their findings, noting {{that it would be}} unusual for all of these stars to pulse at exactly the same frequency unless they were part a coordinated network: “If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> step back,” he said, “that would mean you have 234 independent stars that all decided to transmit the exact same way.” ...|$|E

[...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|Warhol clearly {{changed the}} concept of art appreciation. Instead of {{harmonious}} three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration {{with an emphasis on}} the packaging. His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty times, you are not interested in the retinal image. According to Marcel Duchamp, what interests you is the concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas." [...] The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{believed}} {{that one of}} the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that [...] "If you take life fairly easily, then <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way." [...] He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as [...] "making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher.|$|E

500|$|Lancaster, however, {{kept an eye}} on {{the public}} {{scrutiny}} surrounding Lopez. Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> celebrity into a commercial venture, which {{more and more people are}} doing, there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't take much to turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, like anything else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E
500|$|Albini {{sought to}} produce a record that sounded nothing like Nevermind. [...] He felt the sound of Nevermind was [...] "sort of a {{standard}} hack recording that {{has been turned into}} a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...] That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band." [...] Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound. [...] Albini refused to double-track Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room. [...] The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, [...] "There's a really dry, really loud voice at the end of 'Milk It'... that was also done at the end of 'Rape Me', where [...] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band." [...] Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural reverberation of the room. [...] Albini explained, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that sounds good acoustically and just record it, you've done your job." ...|$|E
500|$|Hutchinson {{described}} Steiger's {{mother as}} [...] "plump, energetic and small, with long auburn hair". She {{had a good}} singing voice and nearly became a Hollywood actress, but after a leg surgery permanently impaired her walking ability, she gave up acting and turned to alcohol. As a result, she quit show business and moved away from Westhampton to raise her son. They moved through several towns, including Irvington and Bloomfield, before settling in Newark, New Jersey. Her alcoholism caused Steiger much embarrassment, and the family was frequently mocked by other {{children and their parents}} within the community. At the age of five he was sexually abused by a pedophile who lured him in with a butterfly collection. Steiger said of his troubled family background: [...] "If you had the choice of having the childhood you experienced, with your alcoholic mother and being the famous actor you are today, or having a loving, secure childhood and not being famous, which would <b>you</b> <b>take?</b> <b>A</b> loving, secure childhood in a New York minute". During the last 11 years of her life, Steiger's mother stayed sober and regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Steiger recalled: [...] "I was so proud of her. She turned herself around. She came alive again".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{helped to}} solidify the {{different}} personalities of The Lone Gunmen. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained, [...] "Up , they {{were sort of}} interchangeable in the information they delivered. But then Vince, who loved the characters and really wanted a chance to dig more deeply into them, created a back story and they became a lot more interesting." [...] Actor Dean Haglund, who played Langly, said of the episode, [...] "What we read in the script wasn't really our origins as we'd imagined it. I'd thought we were all in a university garage band together or something. Bruce [...] thought he was a photocopier repair man." [...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. But I felt like the lead because it was my story about falling in love with this woman and then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just loved the idea of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy. That's just a fundamental drama where <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> character on a journey and the journey take him 180 degrees from who he original was." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was hard {{to find a way to}} sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough when <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E
