2500|$|Don and Phil, both guitarists, used vocal harmony mostly {{based on}} {{diatonic}} thirds. On most recordings, Don sang the baritone part and Phil the tenor harmony.

Although Don was mainly low, and Phil was mainly high, their voices overlap {{in a very}} intricate and almost subtle fashion. Another notable example is [...] "I'll See Your Light" [...] (1977). It {{is one of the}} few songs in which Phil consistently has the low harmony while Don is consistently high. Don usually sang most of the solo lines (for example, the verses of [...] "Bye Bye Love"); among the few exceptions is the 1965 single [...] "It's All Over," [...] on which Phil sang the song's solo lines.|$|E
