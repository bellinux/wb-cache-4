500|$|Shooting for {{the episode}} was a {{departure}} from the norm of the series, {{due to the fact that}} filming was not on the Dunder Mifflin set. Furthermore, the episode was not filmed during the day, but rather during the night, from 6pm to 6am. Principal filming took place in Long Beach Harbor, California. Because the episode took place on an actual boat, many cast members got sea sick. Rainn Wilson got especially nauseated on the second night; Jenna Fischer and David Denman felt nauseated on the last night of shooting. During the final sound mixing for the episode, Greg Daniels recalls yelling at the shot of Jim and Pam on deck. He noted that he had [...] "seen it many, many times, but I was yelling, 'Do it, <b>you</b> <b>idiot!</b> Kiss her!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Not suspecting {{anything}} untoward, I continued my level climb. All of {{a sudden}} there was a loud noise in my cockpit— I'd taken cannon [...] fire. The crate immediately flipped uncontrollably onto its back. Fuel gushed into the cockpit; it began smoking and then I completely lost control of the Bf 109, spiraling down on my back through the Curtisses. Over the intercom I heard the angry voice of Homuth: [...] "Which of <b>you</b> <b>idiots</b> just let himself get shot down?" ...|$|R

6000|$|The example proved inspiring.

Why, <b>you</b> <b>idiot,</b> the Devil himself could take you in. He has his fine moods, I suppose, talks like a saint, and says his prayers {{with the rest of}} us.
