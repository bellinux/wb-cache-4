the time he {{was the first}} man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt

Its almost like <b>youre</b> <b>looked</b> down upon, but no one actually talks about it."

Johnny 3 Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows.

5000|$|Prepositions [...] - As {{with many}} other {{language}}s, the correct use of prepositions in the English language is difficult to learn, and it can {{turn out to be}} quite a frustrating learning experience for ESL/EFL learners. For example, the prepositions [...] "on" [...] (rely on, fall on), [...] "of" [...] (think of, because of, in the vicinity of), and [...] "at" [...] (turn at, meet at, start at) are used in so many different ways and contexts, {{it is very difficult to}} remember the exact meaning for each one. Furthermore, the same words are often used as adverbs (come in, press on, listen in, step in) as part of a compound verb (make up, give up, get up, give in, turn in, put on), or in more than one way with different functions and meanings (look up, look on, give in) (He looked up her skirt/He looked up the spelling/Things are <b>looking</b> up/When <b>youre</b> in town, <b>look</b> me up!; He gave in his homework/First he refused but then he gave in; He got up at 6 oclock/He got up the hill/He got up a nativity play). Also, for some languages, such as Spanish, there is/are one/some prepositions that can mean multiple English prepositions (i.e. en in Spanish can mean on, in, or at). When translating back to the ESL learners respective L1, a particular prepositions translation may be correct in one instance, but when using the preposition in another sense, the meaning is sometimes quite different. [...] "One of my friends" [...] translates to (transliterated) wahed min isdiqai in Arabic. Min is the Arabic word for [...] "from", so it means one [...] "from" [...] my friends. [...] "I am on page 5" [...] translates to ich bin auf Seite 5 in German just fine, but in Arabic it is Ana fee safha raqm 5 (I am [...] "in" [...] page 5).|$|R

Verne Gay of Newsday praised the series, saying [...] "This {{is a solid}} and {{particularly}} well-produced cop show—and should be, with Jerry Bruckheimer topping the credits—although we take off points for extreme violence..."; he gave the show 83 out of 100. The Philadelphia Inquirers Jonathan Storm gave it 70 out of 100, saying [...] "If <b>youre</b> <b>looking</b> for unencumbered tough-guy entertainment, you wont be disappointed." [...] Mary McNamara at the Los Angeles Times also gave the series a 70, saying [...] "Its going to take more than an unshaven cheek and a few hollow coughs to make the character real, but Dark Blues great supporting cast and high production values may buy its star enough time to disappear as effectively into his role as his undercover team disappears into theirs." [...] The Boston Globe, however, criticized the show, saying [...] "The characters are not especially dimensional, and McDermotts flat edginess as Carter doesnt help. But whats worse about Dark Blue is the sloppy plotting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the more}} {{negative}} reviewers was Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Owen calls the show [...] "Greys Anatomy {{in a police}} station." [...] He did however hope to see some interaction between religion and police {{through one of the}} characters but stated [...] "Given the generally bland nature of Rookie Blue, thats probably too much to ask." [...] Paige Wiser from the Chicago Sun-Times describes the show as overly generic and claims that the rookies look more like puppies than police officers. She said [...] "if <b>youre</b> <b>looking</b> for a new cop drama to serve and protect your entertainment interests, leave the rookies alone to ripen, and go for a ride-along with Jason Lees Dwight." [...] Randee Dawn from The Hollywood Reporter was much harsher, calling the writing lazy and describing the motivation of the rookies as selfish, saying that they are there to make themselves feel good and not to protect the city. Dawn said [...] "at its core, Rookie is a terrible show." [...] Alex Strachan of Montreals The Gazette was unimpressed, stating that [...] "The acting is uneven, the writing and directing arent particularly stylish or inspired, and youve seen it countless times before." [...] Strachan {{went on to say that}} Rookie Blue is [...] "a harmless enough diversion on an otherwise lazy summer TV night." ...|$|E

[...] Though criticizing the graphics ability to [...] "get in the way at times," [...] the [...] "very vague" [...] mission briefings and the [...] "odd flying model for the planes," [...] the reviewer conceded that [...] "if youre a hardcore shooting fan, and <b>youre</b> <b>looking</b> for a good challenge, youll probably want to look into Incoming." [...] GameSpys review was harsher, describing the plot as [...] "the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type," [...] the multiplayer split screen mode as [...] "lame" [...] and the objectives as [...] "mundane." [...] The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as [...] "a bit dated," [...] the reviewer did acknowledge the [...] "nifty special effects" [...] and admitted that [...] "Incoming may be worth a rental... it is only slightly better than mediocre."

5000|$|Writing for Consequence of Sound, Sasha Geffen {{called the}} album [...] "OPN’s most {{emotional}} work {{to date and}} also his most ridiculous. Its tragedy is bound up with its humor; its sublimity comes from the places where it feels the most broken." [...] Uncut wrote that the album [...] "ultimately dissolves into a beautifully arranged and slightly sickly morass of curdled pop tropes, out of which spurt a bodacious riff or glossy rave arpeggio. Oddly no-one does this better." [...] John Garratt of PopMatters described the record as [...] "another adventure watching your own sense of subjectivity drown {{in a pool of}} confusion." [...] For The Line of Best Fit, Jennifer Johnson opined that [...] "GOD isn’t about sensory pleasure. It’s about sensory gluttony, auditory overload, and revelling in the difficulty of its pacing," [...] concluding that [...] "It isn’t so much an album as a junk shop: that proverbial collection of oddities whose perceived value reflects more about the patron than it does the owner who placed them there." [...] In a mixed review, The Guardians Paul McInnes wrote that [...] "Lopatin is never quite able to stand still and enjoy some of the sounds he creates. This remains a project for only a very particular kind of pop picker." [...] In another mixed review, Dusted Magazine wrote that [...] "at its best, you can get lost inside Garden of Delete’s rabbit hole of different directions and unexpected asides, but at other times its easy to feel shut-out, as if <b>youre</b> <b>looking</b> in at someones intellectual ADHD, but hes steadfastly refusing to meet your gaze." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{series is}} full of {{unreliable}} narrators who embroider the facts to suit their agenda, have their facts wrong, see only their part in events, or who miss out completely on what was important: i.e., another fictional historian is clearly fuzzy on facts that the reader has witnessed differently, though he admits it. Kaluta said they [...] "are the people we have living today, just regular people that {{have a way of}} kidding themselves about as much as they kid other people, sometimes maliciously, sometimes unknowingly." [...] Later Lee expanded this thought, saying, [...] "Thats something we tried to do throughout Starstruck. A character like Brucilla may exaggerate, others will outright lie and still others may be misinformed. Like life. When <b>youre</b> <b>looking</b> through the eyes of any one character, you’ll only get a fraction of the picture." [...] Much of the humor in Starstrucks dialogue lies in the contradictions of their perceptions and actions, as they improvise their way through erratic situations; this has drawn comparisons to director Robert Altman, who favored loose scripts where character interaction was brought out more naturally by improvisation and the overlap of spontaneous dialogue. Critic David Allan Jones wrote of the intricacies of the Starstruck discourse, [...] "The (Robert) Altman-esque dialogue style is also a joy to parse out- as confusing and disorienting as it sometimes can be, its always witty and clever." [...] The 1984 graphic novel was dedicated to Robert Altman and author Thomas Pynchon, to which Lee explained to an interviewer, [...] "If regular comics are like a Steven Spielberg movie, maybe this one is more like a Robert Altman movie." [...] She stated her admiration of Pynchons complex allusive style by saying, [...] "it is dense, it is packed with images. When youre reading Pynchon all sorts of doors open up in your brain." ...|$|E
5000|$|Trenton Webb {{reviewed}} Requiem: Grim Harvest for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Requiem: Grim Harvest is a boxed set containing three booklets: Death Triumphant, Necropolis and Requiem. Death Triumphant is {{the conclusion}} of the Grim Harvest campaign in which the player characters battle against Azalin, the Lich lord of Darkon. Necropolis is a geographical guide to the land where Death Triumphant is set. Requiem extrapolates from the partys position {{at the end of the}} campaign to create its own sub-game system. He quotes the George Romero zombie film line [...] "when Hell is full the dead will walk the earth" [...] and notes that with this [...] "This rather functional, if wonderfully horrific, philosophy ... Requiem: Grim Harvest enables Ravenlofters to experience a world in which something spookily similar is occurring. And its not very nice. Good fun, certainly, but not very nice." [...] Webb comments that [...] "This three-book boxed set - Death Triumphant, Necropolis and Requiem - is an odd mix" [...] and notes that the Necropolis book would be useful [...] "so that after the adventure has run its (un)natural course the party can continue to romp around this most gothic of countries", while [...] "Requiem, is a truly queer fish ... and it is breathtakingly different." [...] He comments on the adventure itself: [...] "As the final installment of the trilogy, Death Triumphant really delivers. Picking up the pace from the slightly more sedate second episode, the players are instantly thrown into conflict with the most powerful denizens of Ravenloft as they race against the clock to avert an apocalypse. With a heart-stopping (quite literally) midsection and an exciting closing chase, this adventure is a frantic and fitting climax to a truly excellent series." [...] Webb comments that [...] "Necropolis is a good guide, crammed with fine and highly transportable adventure seeds. So even if you never run another Darkon adventure, youll be able to plunder a few fine ideas and characters for other Ravenloft campaigns. The best of these being the absolutely ghastly Maggot Golem, which is pure Clive Barker and should definitely be used to turn players stomachs the length and breadth of the land immediately." [...] He comments that [...] "Requiem, however, presents many problems - not the least of which is that the sub-system evolves out of Death Triumphants climax, and so by describing its basis the adventures shocking twist would be ruined. Essentially, Requiem inverts one of the basic tenets of AD&D game mechanics with dramatic effects. The resultant system is elegant and well executed, although it does feel a little clinical and contrived at times. It would make an ideal holiday game when <b>youre</b> <b>looking</b> for a quick hit adventure with some temporary characters, but otherwise this fine design exercise doesnt really have the legs for long-term play." [...] Webb concludes the review by saying [...] "The introduction of a boxed set at the endgame of a trilogy seems a little mercenary, especially when the first two episodes are so good that both players and referees will be desperate to see the campaign through to the end. But this climactic adventure is well worth the expense on its own. With the added benefit of some excellent adventure ideas in Necropolis and the curious Requiem system, youd be mad not to inflict this most horrifying of sets on your players." ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explore the {{complexities}} surrounding organizations {{during the process of}} becoming multinational. Particularly, I look at complications that can arise and lead to the ultimate failure of a multinational venture. My analysis is two-fold. First, I looked at Target Corporation?s expansion into Canada as a rhetorical situation?full of exigencies audiences and constraints. Ultimately, I argue the biggest constraining factor was Target?s own rhetoric, which created expectations that they did not fulfill. The second way I approach Target?s unsuccessful entrance is through the lens of collective memory studies. Places inherently house memories and memory that, if for an entire collective, is co-produced. Target Canada did not become a solidified memory place because the experiential landscape was inconsistent. The way that consumers experienced Target during one visit was not consistent from one visit to another and from stores in the U. S. to stores in Canada. Thus, for Canadians, I ultimately argue, these aren?t the stores <b>you?re</b> <b>looking</b> for...|$|E
40|$|Africa?s {{regional}} centre for natural resource mapping Cue: For {{a country to}} develop, making best use of its resources is clearly essential. These will include natural resources such as water, timber and minerals {{as well as the}} skills, knowledge and labour of its people. But if natural resources are to contribute to long term development, careful planning is needed, based on accurate, detailed information including up-to-date maps. The Regional Centre for Resource Mapping for Development is an inter-government organisation based in Kenya that was set up to support responsible resource use in Africa. The organisation works at many levels, supporting government mapping departments as well as individual communities. Tesfaye Korme, one of the directors of the Centre, spoke recently to Susanna Thorp about its work. She began by asking him to explain the problems that have affected resource use in the continent, and how his Centre is helping to address them. IN:		?Africa has a lot of resources? OUT:	?should assure to the community. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Tesfaye Korme of the Regional Centre for Resource Mapping for Development talking to Susanna Thorp. Transcript Korme	Africa has a lot of resources, and we have big problem in managing our resources. First of all we don?t know how to explore resources. Once we discover resource we don?t care of environment. So we build the regional state capacities in how to protect the resource, use friendly the resource, explore the resources. Thorp	Give me an example perhaps in Southern Africa for instance, where you have helped a country really look at the resources available and allowed them to incorporate that into their planning. Korme	Well in Southern Africa region we have developed the local capacity of the national authorities like mapping authority. So we generally deliver them a satellite image, give training to their people and sometimes we do field work with them. Thorp	Now, Lesotho I know is a very small country. Does Lesotho have the capacity to do the type of planning and resource management that it needs? Korme	Fortunately the natural resource mapping doesn?t need a lot of human labour; most of the works are done using computers and the satellite data. So for small country, you don?t need hundreds of people, maybe five people can correctly map and prepare decision-support tools. For Lesotho we have trained five people and they are doing very well. For Botswana we were working with them on wetland, it?s the richest wetland in Africa in terms of flora and fauna. So that wetland needs very careful protection, so we help them in mapping it, we help them how to update gradually the maps. Thorp	So a lot of training and capacity building is obviously an important part of your work, but give me an example of a project perhaps that you?ve done this year where <b>you?re</b> <b>looking</b> at a particular natural resource and maybe helping to document that. Korme	In southern Kenya at the border between Kenya and Tanzania, the question was raised by the Masai people. They want to know the limit of their forest and everybody comes to the forest with guns and then they cut the timber and they go away. Nobody knows that the forest belongs to the society. Unfortunately in that place there were two communities both sharing the border, so we worked out a program with the Masai and we trained the local people, we organised them in such a way the data collection using GPS is conducted by themselves. The other communities started to fight, they said ?Who gave you the right to map this boundary? They don?t have the right to ask anyone, you are not the one to do it!? So they stopped us with violent reaction, we called the local authorities, the government body, to reconcile the two communities and then they show us the real boundary of the forest. Now it is an official border, that both communities accepted and now they consider the forest as their own property. So, what we say is we involve them at grass root level. In technical data producing they need training. Otherwise if you leave the technical work to them, it is a waste of money and time, because the data that will come up will not be sufficient to produce a standard product. So to share the information you should collect standard, understandable, and quality information. Someone who can understand that map can go to that place, can invest on minerals, can invest on forests, can invest on agriculture. So we have to produce something that everyone can understand. Thorp	That?s a very good point that you?ve just made, that people can go to the Internet and access that information, and we have had several concerns raised by the participants {{over the last couple of}} days, that by working with communities and asking them to express knowledge about their areas, that actually they can be releasing information that other people can come in and exploit, so local communities can actually make themselves very vulnerable. Korme	The best solution is you expose information, you discuss how to preserve it. There are two contradictory things; one is civilisation, development, the other is maintaining the tradition, the culture. We have to compromise one to the other. They have to use their resources for development and a better life. At minimum 80 % of the profit should go back to community development. That is the policy that the government should assure to the community. End of track. Supporting mapping for sustainable management of natural resources...|$|E
