6000|$|... 'I don't {{know if you}} young things realise that it's growing late. If {{you want}} us to dine at the Chien Noir, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>leave</b> us <b>now,</b> so that we can make {{ourselves}} tidy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Again {{wandering}} in thy mind, Pierre; no more--Come, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>leave</b> me, <b>now.</b> I am quite rested again. Quick, call my aunt, and leave me. Stay, this evening {{we are to}} look over the book of plates from the city, you know. Be early;--go now, Pierre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{time that}} we part. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>leave</b> me <b>now.</b> Take this, and keep it for ever. I shall be less unhappy in my terrible {{loneliness}} whilst it lasts if I know that this my gift, which {{for good or ill}} is a part of me as you know me, is close to you. It may be, my very dear, that some day you may be glad and even proud of this hour, as I am." [...] She kissed me as I took it.|$|R
50|$|I went to Sulaymaniyah and {{hit them}} with the special {{ammunition}} chemical weapons. That was my answer. We continued the deportations. I told the mustashars heads that they might say that they like their villages and that they won't leave. I said I cannot let your village stay because I will attack it with chemical weapons. Then {{you and your family}} will die. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>leave</b> right <b>now.</b> Because I cannot tell you the same day that I am going to attack with chemical weapons. I will kill them all with chemical weapons! Who is going to say anything? The international community? Fuck them! The international community and those who listen to them.... This is my intention, and I want you to take serious note of it. As soon as we complete the deportations, we will start attacking them everywhere according to a systematic military plan. Even their strongholds. In our attacks we will take back one third or one half of what is under their control. If we can try to take two-thirds, then we will surround them in a small pocket and attack them with chemical weapons. I will not attack them with chemicals just one day, but I will continue to attack them with chemicals for fifteen days. Then I will announce that anyone who wishes to surrender with his gun will be allowed to do so. Anyone willing to come back is welcome, {{and those who do not}} return will be attacked again with new, destructive chemicals. I will not mention the name of the chemical because that is classified information. But I will say with new destructive weapons that will destroy you. So I will threaten them and motivate them to surrender.|$|R
6000|$|After {{some moments}} of silence, she resumed: [...] "The father has said to-day {{that you came}} to us from an island where even the customs {{of the people are}} {{different}} from ours; and perhaps one of their unhappy methods is to seek to medicine a real misery by imagining some impossible and immeasurably greater one. In no other way can I account for your strange words to me; for I cannot believe that any race exists so debased as actually to practice the things you speak of. Remember that I do not ask or desire to be informed. We have a different way; for although it is conceivable that present misery might be mitigated, or forgotten for a season, by giving up the soul to delusions, even by summoning before the mind repulsive and horrible images, that would be to put to an unlawful use, and to pervert, the brightest faculties our Father has given us: therefore we seek no other support in all sufferings and calamities but that of reason only. If you wish for my affection, you will not speak of such things again, but will endeavor to purify yourself from a mental vice, which may sometimes, in periods of suffering, give you a false comfort for a brief season, only to degrade you, and sink you later in a deeper misery. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>now</b> <b>leave</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|The chief jumped {{straight}} into the canoe, and seizing the paddles pushed off from the shore, when to his joy and wonder he saw following him in another canoe exactly like his own the maiden for whose sake he had made this long journey. But they could not touch each other, for between them rolled great waves, which {{looked as if they}} would sink the boats, yet never did. And the young man and the maiden shrank with fear, for down {{in the depths of the}} water they saw the bones of those who had died before, and in the waves themselves men and women were struggling, and but few passed over. Only the children had no fear, and reached the other side in safety. Still, though the chief and the young girl quailed in terror at these horrible sights and sounds, no harm came to them, for their lives had been free from evil, and the Master of Life had said that no evil should happen unto them. So they reached unhurt the shore of the Happy Island, and wandered through the flowery fields and by the banks of rushing streams, and they knew not hunger nor thirst; neither cold nor heat. The air fed them and the sun warmed them, and they forgot the dead, for they saw no graves, and the young man's thoughts turned not to wars, neither to the hunting of animals. And gladly would these two have walked thus for ever, but in the murmur of the wind he heard the Master of Life saying to him, 'Return whither you came, for I have work for you to do, and your people need you, and for many years you shall rule over them. At the gate my messenger awaits you, and you shall take again your body which you left behind, and he will show you what you are to do. Listen to him, and have patience, and in time to come you shall rejoin her whom <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>now</b> <b>leave,</b> for she is accepted, and will remain ever young and beautiful, as when I called her hence from the Land of Snows.' ...|$|R
