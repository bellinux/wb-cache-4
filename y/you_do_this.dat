[...] That is what the West is expecting [...] us - to bring the killers of our brothers, to bring those who cut the noses of the Afghan women, to bring those who do suicide bombings in our wedding parties, to put them {{on the other side of}} the table and say, 'Brother, you represent our religion and I have lost my direction. Let us talk.' [...] That is because there is not much respect for the dignity of the nation called Afghanistan when it comes to geopolitics." ...|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{was also}} an {{advocate}} and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming {{to the defense of}} the cast and crew of Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would say such a thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: how could <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> to [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!" [...] He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [...] Eric Byler's Charlotte Sometimes).|$|E

In the steak restaurant, a photo of actor and comedian Tony Randall can be seen next to Barclay's photo. Homer's postcard, which reads [...] "Wish you were her", shows a picture of American model Bettie Page. In the scene where Homer drives Barclay's truck into the convoy, Navitron Autodrive System says [...] "I'm afraid I can't let <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> Red. The risk is unacceptable." [...] The line, {{as well as the}} Navitron Autodrive System's, is {{a reference}} to HAL 9000, the antagonist in the 1968 science fiction film [...] The episode also references media mogul Ted Turner, with a sign that reads [...] "Atlanta: the home of Ted Turner's mood swings". The title of the episode references the infamous 1986 Stephen King movie Maximum Overdrive, which was one of Simpsons cast member Yeardley Smith's first credited screen roles.|$|E

500|$|Because the {{population}} of Duttlenheim was short in numbers, it proved difficult to field a team of 11 players of equal ages; Wenger did not play for FC Duttlenheim {{until the age of}} 12. Claude Wenger, a teammate of Arsène's, noted his lack of pace as a player, which he made up for with his [...] "ability to guard the ball, [...] to have a complete vision of the pitch and having an influence among his team-mates", according to Marcel Brandner, the president of FC Duttlenheim. As a young teenager, he was called Petit; the nickname ceased when he had a growth spurt and broke into FC Duttlenheim's first team, aged 16. The team did not have a coach to prepare the players tactically, rather a person who supervised training sessions. Wenger took it upon himself to manage the side, with Claude stating [...] "Arsène wasn't the captain and yet he was. It was 'You do this, you do that, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> you do that.' He was the leader".|$|E
500|$|While these {{preparations}} were underway, Fox kept wavering in {{its commitment}} to Avatar because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, Titanic, even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped. Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future. In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron [...] "in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film," [...] so he began shopping it around to other studios, and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof-of-concept to then-chairman Dick Cook. However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal. In , Fox finally agreed to commit to making Avatar after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to {{less than half of}} the film's official $237million budget. After Fox accepted Avatar, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, [...] "I don't know if we're crazier for letting <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> or if you're crazier for thinking you can do this..." ...|$|E
500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you pay the taxes. ... <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> {{all the time in}} business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all the times I paid my taxes early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as of the time of the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E

500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Butler was {{scheduled}} to have made his directorial debut in January 1979 with Adrift & Beyond, but it never came to fruition.

Bill Paxton, {{the director of the}} former film, said, [...] "I was excited when Bill Butler who was the cinematographer on such classic films as Jaws and The Conversation came aboard as my director of photography for Frailty. And I really picked his brain, always asking 'how did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> shot?' and 'how did you figure that out?'"

2500|$|Copies of the SNCC speech were {{distributed}} on August 27, {{and met with}} immediate disapproval {{from many of the}} organizers. Archbishop Patrick O'Boyle objected most strenuously to a part of the speech that called for immediate action and disavowed [...] "patience".

That night, O'Boyle {{and other members of the}} Catholic delegation began preparing a statement announcing their withdrawal from the March. Reuther convinced them to wait and called Rustin; Rustin informed Lewis at 2 A.M. on August 28 that his speech was unacceptable to key members of the March.
