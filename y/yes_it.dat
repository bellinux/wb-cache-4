25|$|<b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> was difficult. The chemo really {{knocked me}} down, but I guess they {{almost have to}} kill you before you can start in your recovery.

25|$|I {{think it}} will be a very long time. But I would say this. Will the time ever come when we can say Hitler's shadow is gone? I think, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> will come when Israel is {{accepted}} in peace with its neighbor states. But it doesn't look like it will happen soon.|$|E
25|$|The Arab {{world is}} no longer across the oceans. It is also on our streets here. Millions of American {{citizens}} are of Arab descent. Millions more are here as workers and students. What happens over there matters here. Can America make these people proud and empower them against Muslim extremists by changing the American story and making us all safer? <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> can. It must.|$|E
25|$|I know you're {{thinking}} {{that there are}} considerable differences between T.S. Eliot and me. <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> is true that he was from St. Louis, which started calling itself the Gateway to the West after Eero Saarinen's Gateway Arch was erected, and I'm from Kansas City, where people think of St. Louis not as the Gateway to the West but as the Exit from the East.|$|E

"I think 'Don't Bother' {{has a lot}} of pain in it as a song, {{but also}} a lot of humour and sarcasm. <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> is a way of exorcising all of these feelings, a form of catharsis, getting rid of all of those {{emotions}} that torture us women at some point in our lives" ...|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh, {{while writing}} about the chances of its {{commercial}} success, said, [...] "Dor is a well-made film that caters to those with an appetite for qualitative cinema. Awards and glowing critical acclaim, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> {{has the power to}} win it. But, box-office rewards and a mandate from the aam junta (common man) will elude it. The lethargic pacing will also go against it." ...|$|E
500|$|The game won several {{publication}} awards, {{as well as}} the Computer Game of the Year Interactive Achievement Award of 2000 {{from the}} Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. The editors of PC Gamer US nominated Opposing Force as 1999's overall best game of the year, although it lost the award to Homeworld. They wrote that Opposing Force [...] "makes history by becoming the first expansion pack to be considered for Game of the Year. <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> really is that good." ...|$|E

500|$|Radiohead's six-album record {{contract}} with EMI {{ended with the}} release of Hail to the Thief. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one. And, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model." [...] In 2006, the New York Times described Radiohead as [...] "by far the world's most popular unsigned band".|$|E
500|$|As Radiohead's six-album {{contract}} with EMI ended after the 2003 release of Hail to the Thief, Radiohead recorded In Rainbows without a record contract. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I {{like the people}} at our record company, but the time is at hand {{when you have to}} ask why anyone needs one.

500|$|When {{it opened}} October 26, 1921, the 3,880 seat theater was {{promoted}} as the [...] "Wonder Theatre of the World". Capacity crowds packed the theater during its opening {{week for the}} First National Pictures feature The Sign on the Door starring Norma Talmadge. [...] Other attractions included a 50-piece orchestra, famed organist Jesse Crawford at the 26-rank Wurlitzer theatre organ—"Oh, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> was mighty," [...] recalled Orson Welles— and a live stage show. [...] Poet Carl Sandburg, reporting for the Chicago Tribune, wrote that mounted police were required for crowd control. The theater's strategy of enticing movie patrons with a plush environment and top notch service (including the pioneering use of air conditioning) was emulated nationwide.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Levine had {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding. He was quoted explaining: [...] "Eventually I {{want to focus on}} being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond". But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:"I love what I do and think that, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> might be tiring and complicated at times [...] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon". He has also turned down {{the idea of having a}} solo career, stating that [...] "there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band".|$|E
500|$|Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle {{wrote that}} he was [...] "only so-so" [...] about the episode, which he deemed [...] "uneven", but was still pleased that the series was back. Vanity Fair Brett Berk called the episode [...] "a bit haphazard", and commented: [...] "this kind of {{spiraling}} frenzy is not only unsustainable, but ultimately dizzying and, dare I say it, a little boring." [...] Randee Dawn of The Hollywood Reporter reported that [...] "Hell-O" [...] had a [...] "stagy quality", and was [...] "not an episode that would have sold the series early on". Dawn felt that {{there were too many}} musical performances, commenting: [...] "They might be fun performances, but they're not all necessary, and <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> is possible to have too much music even on a successful narrative musical TV series." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> did. So I had to pay. A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely." [...] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which [...] "helped [...] a lot" [...] and gave him [...] "more power" [...] to perform.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>yes.</b> <b>It's</b> a bit overdue," [...] {{said the}} doctor, glancing at {{a list of}} names in a note-book with a very shiny cover. [...] "Well, how is she?" ...|$|R

500|$|Reviewing {{the story}} for Doctor Who Magazine's 200 Golden Moments special edition, Jeremy Bentham {{described}} it as being epic in scale, suggesting it played to the original strengths of the series; [...] "performance, period set design and claustrophobic mood...". He likens Enlightenment {{to the work of}} Stanley Kubrick, saying [...] "...it felt grand, it felt lonely, and <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> felt epic." [...] On reappraising {{the story for}} the same magazine following its release on DVD, Gary Gillatt was equally as effusive, calling it [...] "...one of Doctor Who's finest serials." [...] He highlights the performance of Keith Barron as Captain Striker as being [...] "a master class of under-stated menace" [...] and [...] "pitch perfect", juxtaposing this with the over-the-top pantomime villainy of Lynda Baron as Captain Wrack, with the two captains balancing each other out perfectly.|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, Mercedes did {{not want}} to have an affair and was not [...] "looking for someone else", stating, [...] "Malachy's been working hard to provide for them and he hasn’t {{had a lot of time}} for her". Turning to Calvin, she confided in him and they kiss. Whittle added that the affair had become more serious and their {{chemistry}} was [...] "more than just physical". Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> is making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t help wondering what it would be like to be with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that she has to be retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive. Initially, she did not tell Malachy about it, but eventually [...] "snaps" [...] at him, telling him she [...] "won't forgive him" [...] if she has contracted HIV. The test was negative which was a [...] "huge relief" [...] for them.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} several {{differences}} from the novel, {{partly due to}} the different requirements of the two media. Diana Wynne Jones' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film. As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her. Jones discussed the film with Studio Ghibli representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying [...] "It's fantastic. No, I have no input—I write books, not films. <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> will be different from the book—in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film." ...|$|E
