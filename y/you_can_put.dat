[...] "It Just Won't Quit", Steinman explains, [...] "is {{about the fact that}} there are some things you never shake off... That's love, I guess." [...] "Out of the Frying Pan (And into the Fire)" [...] is a more upbeat song.|$|E

500|$|Around {{the same}} time, the EZPpay system was {{expanded}} for overseas {{use during the}} aftermath of the 1992-1995 War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where U.S. personnel were deployed on peace-keeping missions. [...] Named [...] "EagleCash", the overseas system functions similarly to the EZpay system, but with the added ability of soldiers to attach personal bank accounts to the card, allowing them to load, and reload, without having to access their financial institutions back home. [...] As 386th Air Expeditionary Wing financial manager, Catherine Miles explained in a 2007 article, [...] "It's like a gift card. [...] <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> as little or as much money as you want on it and it comes from your checking account." [...] Unlike regular debit cards, the Eagle Cash is managed on-base, using batch processing which ensures that the cards remained useful even when connections to banks and credit unions State-side are severed. [...] The system was given widespread acceptance in 1999, just before the War in Iraq; it has since been expanded to many military bases such as Camp Anaconda on the front lines.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus {{to use for}} the road trip based on his {{experience}} with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: [...] "I remember thinking, it's a road trip, what vehicle {{are you going to}} put them in? And [...] VW bus just seems logical, just because you have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> the camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody." [...] Five VW Microbuses were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques. Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers. During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming. Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Metallica was {{revealed}} to be in production when an analyst for Wedbush Morgan Securities discovered mention {{of the game in}} Activision's 2008 SEC filings, slated to be released in [...] "fiscal 2009". The band was approached in April 2008, who quickly agreed to the game as a [...] "no brainer". [...] Development for the game began {{in the second quarter of}} 2008, according to lead designer Alan Flores. [...] Two posts made to Metallica's website in June 2008 also referred to the [...] "not so top secret GH thing", and that Guitar Hero players could expect [...] "a pile of 'Tallica songs." [...] Lars Ulrich, when asked about the game during an interview with MTV, stated that [...] "the people at ‘Guitar Hero’ and Activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends in the world. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> the rest of it together yourself." [...] Ulrich stated that the idea for the Metallica-themed Guitar Hero game came from the influence the original Guitar Hero games had on Ulrich and James Hetfield's children, learning about music and older bands such as Deep Purple and Black Sabbath.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Mukerji {{replaced}} Aishwarya Rai to {{play the}} lead female role opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Aziz Mirza's romance Chalte Chalte. Media reports suggested that Rai was replaced after feuding with her then boyfriend Salman Khan on the film's sets, but Shah Rukh Khan insisted that Mukerji had been the original choice for the role. The film's concept was similar to Saathiya and dealt with misunderstandings between a married couple. Mukerji said, [...] ", Chalte Chalte deals with a more mature and deeper form of love. It is about how {{a man and woman}} react to situations. [...] You cannot really get very different with the characters, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> them against a different background". The film was well received by both critics and audiences, and the following year Mukerji received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Also that year, she starred in Milan Luthria's romantic comedy Chori Chori opposite Ajay Devgan, Sudhir Mishra's suspense drama Calcutta Mail, alongside Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala, and J.P. Dutta's ensemble war film LOC Kargil. None of these films fared well critically or commercially.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a lot of really good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of like a horse race in a way, especially when you know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a sense of power. I think Dodd comes off with a sense of power, and I thought that you have the chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2010, a fan-made mash-up of {{the video}} and a Sesame Street segment {{appeared}} online. The original Sesame Street clip featured a puppet portrayed as a young black girl proud of her hair. She flails her braids, cornrows, afro, and other ethnic hairstyles. According to the show's writer, Joey Mazzarino, the song was a tribute to his Ethiopian daughter's hair, writing it, stating {{that he wanted to}} say, [...] "Your hair is great. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> it in ponytails. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> it in cornrows.

Veronica Miller of NPR commented that with both clips, [...] "little black girls are having the best week ever", noting the rarity that [...] "little African-American girls are publicly celebrated for their uniqueness and beauty", due to non-positive comments about their physical appearance, making them question individual and collective beauty. On the single's video, Miller said, [...] "Little Willow is operating with a sort of empowerment that grown women can sense, admire, and in some cases, envy", stating, [...] "not many girls are taught that it's OK to openly love and affirm yourself." [...] Noting that the norm is not to be [...] "sassy" [...] or [...] "cute", she said that [...] "Whip My Hair" [...] is [...] "a celebration of little girls celebrating themselves".|$|E
