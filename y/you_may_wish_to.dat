500|$|According to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, {{there is}} circumstantial {{evidence}} encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, [...] "Love all, so that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> kill any." [...] Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He {{did not make}} Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it {{as a matter of}} principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.|$|R

"Perhaps, sir, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{make some}} corrections," [...] he began, {{with all his}} {{attention}} apparently fixed on the letter, and with every outward appearance of letting his sour temper again {{get the better of}} him.

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said. [...] "Pardon me; not yet. Don't commit {{yourself}} to expressions of sympathy which <b>you</b> <b>may</b> afterwards <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> recall. I have mentioned an accusation which has rested {{on me for}} years. There are circumstances in connexion with it that tell against me. I cannot bring myself to acknowledge what the accusation is. And I am incapable, perfectly incapable, of proving my innocence. I can only assert my innocence. I assert it, sir, on my oath, as a Christian. It is useless to appeal to my honour as a man." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} the misfortune (not, as these gentlemen think it, the glory) of this age, that {{everything}} is to be discussed, as if the Constitution of our country were to be always a subject rather of altercation than enjoyment. For this reason, {{as well as for}} the satisfaction of those among you (if any such you have among <b>you)</b> who <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> profit of examples, I venture to trouble you with a few thoughts upon each of these establishments. I do not think they were unwise in ancient Rome, who, when they <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> new-model their laws, sent commissioners to examine the best-constituted republics within their reach.|$|R

[...] "Chris, you're a good shit," [...] Bailey recalled saying, [...] "but you've got the balls of a stud field mouse." [...] Indignant, as Bailey expected, Darden {{asked him what he}} meant. [...] "You're not going to have our client try on these gloves, are you?" [...] he asked in response. [...] "They probably won't fit, and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> find out. But if, as I suspect, you lack the balls to find out, we might find out for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't {{forgive me}} for {{sweeping}} away your rose-coloured cloud of romance," [...] he declared, laughing. [...] "There are spades in the pack, however much <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> ignore 'em. You know very well you don't like these Quicksands people.

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to know {{anything}} which <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> tell me." [...] He {{did his best to}} make the reply in a tone of commonplace politeness--and he might have succeeded in deceiving a man. The woman's quicker ear told her that he was angry.

"Very soon," [...] Prince Shan promised, {{as he and}} Maggie leaned {{from the}} window of the car, [...] "I shall send the Black Dragon for you, Lord Dorminster, and for the one other whom I think <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> bring.

Tree farmers in Hawaii grow trees for many reasons: for forest restoration, for conservation of native species, for recreation, and as a business. If you are growing timber as an investment, {{you need to be}} able to analyze the profitability of your business. Economic decisions tree farmers face include which tree species to grow, when to harvest, and when <b>to</b> replant. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> also <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> compare the financial benefits you would obtain from your forestry activity with those you would obtain from other land use alternatives, such as ranching or hunting.

5000|$|If {{you were}} {{inspired}} by the message of [...] "An E-Mail from Hashem" [...] may I suggest that you contact the Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation. I have no affiliation with this organization, but they do terrific work in disseminating {{the legacy of the}} Chofetz Chaim, who fought so valiantly against loshon hora. In particular, I would encourage you to sign up for their daily e-mail and join the machsom lifi program. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> also <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> arrange a community wide machsom lifi campaign as well. (Participants in the machsom lifi program accept upon themselves to be extra careful with shimiras haloshon during a designated period of time each day as a tool to overall improvement.) What a great zechus (merit) this would be for Klal Yisrael during these perilous times if thousands of Jews become more careful in guarding their speech.|$|R

This version uses the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) [1] to represent {{many of the}} database objects. It uses the Routing Policy System Security (RPSS) [2] for authorisation. This means better security for Internet Routing Registries (IRR). It makes use of RPSL next generation specifications [14]. This means that you can register multicast and IPv 6 routing policies. Though this document is self-contained, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> also <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> read the RPSL [1] and RPSS [2] specifications.
