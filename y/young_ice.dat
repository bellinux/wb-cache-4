50|$|The {{age of the}} ice {{is another}} key {{descriptor}} {{of the state of}} the sea ice cover, since older ice tends to be thicker and more resilient than <b>younger</b> <b>ice.</b> Sea ice rejects salt over time and becomes less salty resulting in a higher melting point. A simple two-stage approach classifies sea ice into first year and multiyear ice. First-year is ice that has not yet survived a summer melt season, while multi-year ice has survived at least one summer and can be several years old.See sea ice growth processes.|$|R

The Esquimau immediately lay back almost at full length, with his heels firmly imbedded in two notches cut in the ice {{at the edge of}} the hole; the seal dived, and the man's waist seemed to be nearly cut in two. But the rope was tough and the man was stout, and although the seal was both, it was conquered in the course of a quarter of an hour, hauled out, and thrown exultingly upon the ice.|$|E

Further, a great anxiety brooded over the camp where the boats were built. Men worked frantically, early and late, {{at the height of}} their endurance, caulking, nailing, and pitching in a frenzy of haste for which adequate explanation was not far to seek.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the morphology and distribution of liquid inclusions in <b>young</b> sea <b>ice,</b> magnetic resonance imaging of an 18 cm sea ice core was done using a Siemens 3 T TIM TRIO human scanner.

Here we present the first three-dimensional reconstruction of a brine drainage channel network in <b>young</b> sea <b>ice</b> using magnetic resonance imaging. The magnetic resonance image sequence data presented here clearly illustrate that brine drainage channels are established relatively quickly during ice formation, and indicates the amount and location of vertical and horizontal fluid permeability in <b>young</b> sea <b>ice.</b> A simple analysis of the image sequence reveals that magnetic resonance imaging is useful in describing the vertical profile of liquid fraction that compares well to volumes calculated for similar sea ice temperatures. Future work in this vein may include three-dimensional magnetic resonance scans of sea ice cores at in situ temperatures using different magnetic resonance sequences in order to improve the observation of inclusions, though this will necessitate both access to a scanner and the construction of a cooling system compatible with a magnetic resonance imager...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the Arctic sea ice {{result in}} a thinner and <b>younger</b> <b>ice</b> cover with {{changing}} physical properties and strong impacts on the energy budget. In addition to long-term trends, the physical properties of sea ice and its snow cover underlay a strong seasonal and spatial variability that impact observations and conclusions. Here, I present methods and results of recent studies to observe the sea ice energy budget on different time and length scales. Radiation measurements over and under sea ice reveal changes in the optical properties of sea ice and their implications for the energy and mass budget. The combination of different measurement platforms, incl. remotely operated vehicles (ROV) and autonomous stations, with large-scale observations and parameterizations allows discussing key processes over large regions and during different seasons...|$|R

Get a tent pitched there, Mr Bolton, and bank it up with snow. You can leave Grim to superintend the unloading. Then, Mr Saunders, do you go and set a gang of men to cut a canal through the <b>young</b> <b>ice</b> from the ship to the island. Fortunately the floes there are wide enough apart to let our quarter-boats float between them. The unshipping won't take long.

60|$|Although {{strong enough}} to bear, the ice {{undulated}} terribly as they swept over it, and sent forth rending sounds, which cannot be conceived by those whose experience of <b>young</b> <b>ice</b> has been derived chiefly from lakelets and ponds. Dogs in such circumstances are apt to become terrified and to stop, in which case immersion is almost certain. But Ujarak gave his team no time to think. With lash and voice he urged them on until they were nearly frantic. The undulations became greater as they advanced, and the rending sounds continuous. Still the wizard plied his whip and shouted. Indeed it was his only chance. At {{the other side of}} the bay the old ice still adhered to the shore. If that could be reached, they would be safe. Eagerly the women strained their eyes, and even stretched out their hands as if to grasp the shore, for the fear of instant death had banished all other thoughts. A few minutes more, and Ujarak, standing up in his eagerness, flourishing the great whip, and shouting at the pitch of his voice, drove the yelling dogs off the crackling sheet of ice to a place of safety on the solid floe.|$|E
6000|$|In August {{the first}} frost came and formed [...] "young ice" [...] on the sea, but this lasted {{only for a}} brief hour or two, and was broken up by the tide and melted.

All the feathered tribes took their departure for less rigorous climes, {{with the exception of a}} small white bird about the size of a sparrow, called the snow-bird, which is the last to leave the icy north. Then a tremendous storm arose, and the sea became choked up with icebergs and floes which the frost soon locked together into a solid mass. Towards the close of the storm snow fell in great abundance, and when the mariners ventured again to put their heads up the opened hatchways, the decks were knee-deep, the drift to windward was almost level with the bulwarks, every yard was edged with white, every rope and cord had a light side and a dark, every point and truck had a white button on it, and every hole, corner, crack, and crevice was choked up.|$|E

60|$|Frank made no reply, but {{rose and}} {{approached}} the window. The view from {{it was a strange}} one. During the night a more than usually severe frost had congealed the water of the lake in the centre, and the icebergs that sailed towards the Caniapuscaw River in stately grandeur went crashing through this <b>young</b> <b>ice</b> {{as if it had been}} paper, their slow but steady progress receiving no perceptible check from its opposition. Some of these bergs were of great size, and in proceeding onwards they passed so close to the fort that the inhabitants feared more than once that a falling pinnacle might descend on the stores, which were built near to the water's edge, and crush them. As the tide gradually rose it rushed with violence into the cavities beneath the solid ice on the opposite shore, and finding no escape save through a few rents and fissures, sent up columns or spouts of white spray in all directions, which roared and shrieked as they flew upwards, as if the great ocean were maddened with anger at finding a power strong enough to restrain and curb its might. At intervals the main ice rent with a crash like the firing of artillery; and as if nature had designed to carry on and deepen this simile, the shore was lined with heaps of little blocks of ice which the constantly recurring action of the tide had moulded into the shape and size of cannon balls.|$|E

On the 30th he was in latitude 80d 13m; longitude 18d 48m E. among the islands and in the ice, with no appearance of an opening for the ships. The weather was exceedingly fine, mild, and unusually clear. Here they were becalmed in a large bay, with three apparent openings between the islands which formed it; but everywhere, as far as they could see, surrounded with ice. There was not a breath of air, the water was perfectly smooth, the ice covered with snow, low and even, except a few broken pieces near the edge; and the pools of water {{in the middle of the}} ice-fields just crusted over with <b>young</b> <b>ice.</b> On the next day the ice closed upon them, and no opening was to be seen anywhere, except a hole, or lake as it might be called, of about a mile and a half in circumference, where the ships lay fast to the ice with their ice-anchors. From these ice-fields they filled their casks with water, which was very pure and soft. The men were playing on the ice all day; but the Greenland pilots, who were further than they had ever been before, and considered that the season was far advancing, were alarmed at being thus beset.|$|E
50|$|<b>Young</b> <b>ice</b> is a {{transition}} stage between nilas and first-year ice, and ranges in thickness from 10 cm to 30 cm, <b>Young</b> <b>ice</b> {{can be further}} subdivided into grey ice - 10 cm to 15 cm in thickness, and grey-white ice - 15 cm to 30 cm in thickness. <b>Young</b> <b>ice</b> is not as flexible as nilas, but tends to break under wave action.

30|$|Because {{different}} ages of callus may show different competency for A. tumefaciens infection, we used 5 -, 7 -, 10 - or 14 -day-old callus to be co-incubated with 2.5 or 5 [*]×[*] 109 cfu mL− 1 bacteria solutions and examined their transformation rates. The highest transformation rate was with 5 -day-old callus co-cultured with 2.5 [*]×[*] 109 cfu mL− 1 and the transformation rates decreased with increasing age of callus (Fig.  1 b). These {{results suggest that}} <b>younger</b> <b>ice</b> plant callus may be more susceptible to A. tumefaciens infection. To increase the percentage of transformed callus, callus was transferred into liquid CIM containing timentin and kanamycin, and continued to grow for 4 passages.
