500|$|David Renwick {{made the}} {{decision}} to revive Jonathan Creek for a Christmas special as a means of [...] "deferring retirement". He considered the alternative of developing an entirely new series to be too lengthy a process, and regarded reviving Jonathan Creek as the [...] "safe decision". He described the process of formulating a plot for the episode as an [...] "agony" [...] and a [...] "torment", revealing that he had stopped writing the show in 2004 partly {{due to a lack of}} ideas. Renwick explained: [...] "Inevitably, <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a series which is all about impossibilities that then have to have a rational explanation, by definition it’s going to be pretty challenging stuff for a writer. So God knows why I ever embarked on it in the first place." [...] As well as writing, Renwick also directed the episode, which was produced by Nerys Evans; Jonathan Creeks former Producer Verity Lambert died of cancer in November 2007. Davies noted that he and Renwick met quite regularly following Lambert's death, and when Renwick suggested to the BBC that they revive Jonathan Creek, the broadcaster [...] "bit his hand off for it". [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was commissioned by Jane Tranter, Controller of BBC Fiction, with Lucy Lumsden, Controller of Comedy Commissioning, stating that the station was [...] "delighted to have Jonathan Creek back on BBC One". Renwick was prepared for a negative reaction to the show's revival, describing how: [...] "People say, Oh Jonathan Creeks coming back. Fantastic.' And then they watch it and go: 'God, what a mistake.' Which is what happened with One Foot in the Grave. So I tend to expect the worst." ...|$|E

"As you know, Dan, you and I {{were talking}} about missile defense before <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> High Frontier in September of '81...You and {{a small group of}} dedicated, {{determined}} people helped us move the SDI concept over all the roadblocks put up by people of less vision and belief in American capacity.

2500|$|Walter Hill thought [...] "the {{audience}} {{will go with}} you when <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> an abstract world with teenage values and play out a drama within this. It was kind of real but it wasn't really. I always said whenever someone says fantasy they immediately think of more Disney--esque. The idea of a hard hitting drama in a fantasy world, {{that was kind of}} different at the time... I always thought of it as a musical. They kind of saw it worked in the world of an MTV video.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show. Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now you have this character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes you a good guy or whether you should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way." [...] Abramowitz summarizes, [...] "Darius was the voice of God on the show, and then God died." ...|$|E
