2500|$|In 1915 the {{great-grandson}} of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton {{reported that}} when he was 7 years old and she was 97 years old (about 1854) she said, [...] "If anyone ever tells you that George Washington was not a communicant in the Church, you say that your great-grandmother told <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she 'had knelt at this chancel rail at his side and received with him the Holy Communion.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Following this speech, the Illinois {{delegation}} (led by Jacob Arvey) {{announced that}} they would place Stevenson's name in nomination, and Stevenson called President Truman to ask if [...] "he would be embarrassed" [...] if Stevenson formally announced his candidacy for the nomination. Truman told Stevenson [...] "I have been trying since January to get <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> Why should it embarrass me?" [...] Kefauver led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot. Historian John Frederick Martin says party leaders selected {{him because he was}} [...] "more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines—so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago." [...] Stevenson's 1952 running mate was Senator John Sparkman of Alabama.|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
