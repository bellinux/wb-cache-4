5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of an acceptable strength, which is related to a material's <b>yield</b> <b>strength.</b> In general, as the <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in fracture toughness.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{crystalline}} and amorphous materials can be engineered to increase their <b>yield</b> <b>strength.</b> By altering dislocation density, impurity levels, grain size (in crystalline materials), the <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> of the material can be fine tuned. This occurs typically by introducing defects such as impurities dislocations in the material. To move this defect (plastically deforming or yielding the material), a larger stress must be applied. This thus causes a higher yield stress in the material. While many material properties depend only on {{the composition of the}} bulk material, <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> is extremely sensitive to the materials processing as well.|$|E

Other factors are considered such as the vagaries of natural phenomena that might contribute to erroneous interpretations and measurements. Comparison of <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> of Martian and lunar flows with terrestrial flows suggests that the Martian and lunar flows are more akin to terrestrial basalts than they are to terrestrial andesites, trachytes, and rhyolites...|$|R
50|$|Dyneema and Spectra are {{lightweight}} high-strength oriented-strand gel spun {{through a}} spinneret. They have <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> {{as high as}} 2.4 GPa (350,000 psi) and specific gravity as low as 0.97 (for Dyneema SK75). High-strength steels have comparable <b>yield</b> <b>strengths,</b> and low-carbon steels have <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> much lower (around 0.5 GPa). Since steel has a specific gravity of roughly 7.8, this gives strength-to-weight ratios for these materials in a range from 8 to 15 times higher than steel. Strength-to-weight ratios for Dyneema are about 40% higher than for aramid. Dyneema was invented by Albert Pennings in 1963 but made commercially available by DSM in 1990.|$|R

25|$|The stress {{at which}} yield occurs is {{dependent}} on both the rate of deformation (strain rate) and, more significantly, the temperature at which the deformation occurs. In general, the <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> increases with strain rate and decreases with temperature. When the latter is not the case, the material is said to exhibit <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> anomaly, which is typical for superalloys and leads to their use in applications requiring high strength at high temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Quench factor {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} A 356 and A 357 aluminium casting alloys in order to model time-temperature-yield strength curves, to predict T 6 <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> {{as a function of}} continuous cooling quench rate and to examine quench sensitivity. The predicted T 6 <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> for given quench curves were typically within +/- 10 MPa of experimentally measured <b>yield</b> <b>strengths.</b> It was found that A 356 is more quench sensitive than A 357 at high quench rates, whereas A 357 is more sensitive at low quench rates. This is explained in terms of silicon clustering, which alters the matrix Mg/Si ratio and subsequent precipitation events. These observations were confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry...|$|R
40|$|After ageing {{low carbon}} steel specimens, given tensile, {{torsional}} or tension-torsion combined prestrains, the tensile stress-strain curves or the torsional stress-strain curves at various angles to the direction of prestrain were obtained, and from these curves 0. 03 % elastic limits and 0. 2 % <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> were determined and the activation energies in the rising process of these elastic limits and <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> were obtained. It is clarified from these results that the sharp yielding phenomena in {{low carbon steel}}s recovered by ageing and the activation energies in the rising process of the elastic limits and <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> in various directions to the prestrain are very {{closely related to the}} ainisotropy of the Bauschinger effect in the specimens caused by the prestrain...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{modified}} air blasting machine warm peening at 20 O C < T I 410 "C was feasible. An optimized peening temperature of about 310 "C was identified for a 450 "C quenched and tern-pered steel AISI 4140. Warm peening was also investigated for a normalized, a 650 "C quen-ched and tempered, and a martensitically hardened material state. The quasi static surface compressive <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> {{as well as}} the cyclic surface <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> were determined from residual stress relaxation tests conducted at different stress amplitudes and numbers of loading cycles. Dynamic and static strain aging effects acting during and after warm peening clearly increased the residual stress stability and the alternating bending strength for all material states. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>strength</b> testing {{involves}} {{taking a}} small sample with a fixed cross-section area, and then pulling it with a controlled, gradually increasing force until the sample changes shape or breaks.

25|$|Maximum Principal Stress Theory – by W.J.M Rankine(1850).

This theory gives good predictions for brittle materials.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>strength</b> is the {{critical}} material property exploited by many fundamental techniques of material-working: to reshape material with pressure (such as forging, rolling, pressing, or hydroforming), to separate material by cutting (such as machining) or shearing, and to join components rigidly with fasteners. Yield load can be taken as the load applied to the centre of a carriage spring to straighten its leaves.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of surface cracking under pulsed heat load was developed. The model correctly describes a smooth brittle–ductile transition. The elastic deformation {{is described in}} a thin-heated-layer approximation. The plastic deformation is described with the Hollomon equation. The time dependence of the deformation and stresses is described for one heating–cooling cycle for a material without initial plastic deformation. The model {{can be applied to}} tungsten manufactured according to ITER specifications. The model shows that the stability of stress-relieved tungsten deteriorates when the base temperature increases. This proved to be a result of the close ultimate tensile and <b>yield</b> <b>strengths.</b> For a heat load of arbitrary magnitude a stability criterion was obtained in the form of condition on the relation of the ultimate tensile and <b>yield</b> <b>strengths...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{nondestructive}} rod compression {{has been}} proposed as a new strength characterizing technique for in-service components. Using electrical discharge machining, milling machining, and stamping, {{it was possible to}} machine small rods, typically about 0. 5 mm in both diameter and height on the target surface. Static compressions of the rods were carried out using a flat punch and their deformation behaviors were recorded as load-displacement curves. Referring to initial dimension of the rods, engineering stress-strain curves implying the <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> were calculated from the deformation curves. Surface <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> from the rod compressions were directly compared with reference compression results and their slight discrepancies were discussed from the influences of pre-deformation and damage of the rod and additive compliance of the base...|$|R
25|$|In the ore environment, the {{metamorphism}} {{tends to}} remobilise the nickel sulfide which, during peak metamorphism, has the <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> and behaviour of toothpaste as conceptualised by workers within the field.

25|$|Where the {{presence}} of a secondary phase will increase <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> by blocking the motion of dislocations within the crystal. A line defect that, while moving through the matrix, will be forced against a small particle or precipitate of the material. Dislocations can move through this particle either by shearing the particle, or by a process known as bowing or ringing, in which a new ring of dislocations is created around the particle.|$|E
25|$|A <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> or {{yield stress}} is the {{material}} property {{defined as the}} stress at which a material begins to deform plastically whereas yield point is the point where nonlinear (elastic + plastic) deformation begins. Prior to the yield point the material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed. Once the yield point is passed, some fraction of the deformation will be permanent and non-reversible.|$|E

40|$|Near {{eutectoid}} fully pearlitic {{wire rod}} (5. 5 mm diameter) was taken through six stages of wire drawing (drawing strains of 0 to 2. 47). The as-drawn (AD) wires were further laboratory annealed (LA) to re-austenitize and reform the pearlite. AD and LA grades, for respective wire diameters, had similar pearlite microstructure: interlamellar spacing (lambda) and pearlite alignment with the wire axis. However, LA grade had lower hardness (for both phases) and slightly lower fiber texture and residual stresses in ferrite. Surprisingly, essentially identical tensile <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> in AD and LA wires, measured at equivalent spacing, were found. The work hardened AD had, as expected, higher torsional <b>yield</b> <b>strengths</b> and lower tensile and torsional ductilities than LA.
