25|$|Six and Out - If <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> {{over the}} fence you're out {{and you have to}} get the ball. The 6 runs are usually not awarded to the batsman unless agreed to by both teams. This rule is {{especially}} popular in small backyards (where the rule may be applied to any ball that lands {{over the fence}} - not just 6's), and encourages the batsman to exercise control and restraint by aiming for 4's instead of 6's. Six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out, even if no damage is evident.|$|E
500|$|Hanneman and King's dual guitar solos {{have been}} {{referred}} to as [...] "wildly chaotic," [...] and [...] "twisted genius." [...] Original drummer Lombardo would use two bass drums (instead of a double pedal, which is used on a single bass drum). Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the [...] "godfather of double bass" [...] by Drummerworld. Lombardo stated his reasons for using two bass drums: [...] "When you hit the bass drum, the head is still resonating. When <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> in the same place right after that, you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe." [...] When playing the two bass drums, Lombardo would use the [...] "heel-up" [...] technique.|$|E
500|$|Indifferent league {{performances}} that season meant that Ipswich finished just three points above the relegation zone, but the season ended in {{success in the}} FA Cup. Wark scored in a 3–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final, and appeared in the final at Wembley {{as part of a}} side that surprised favourites Arsenal, winning the game 1–0. Wark remarked, [...] "We were underdogs but on the day we hammered them." [...] Wark did not touch the ball for the first 18 minutes of the match, and as the players left the pitch at half-time, David Geddis said to Wark, [...] "Make sure <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> between the posts in the second-half. Avoid the white bits." [...] In {{the second half of the}} game, Wark [...] "ignored Geddis' advice and hit Pat Jennings' right post twice with almost identical swerving right-foot shots from outside the penalty area".|$|E
50|$|Backstops - With {{this rule}} {{in place the}} ball may <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> first, then your square. If you would like <b>you</b> may <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> an {{additional}} time after the backstop.|$|R
6000|$|... "If a {{child could}} not, then thou shouldst not," [...] said Sakr-el-Bahr, {{who had so}} placed himself that his body was now between Marzak and the {{palmetto}} bale. [...] "Let us see <b>thee</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it,</b> O Marzak." [...] And as he spoke he raised his cross-bow, and scarcely seeming to take aim, he loosed his shaft. It flashed away to be checked, quivering, in the branch he had indicated.|$|R
50|$|Disadvantages: <b>You</b> could <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> yourself, it inverts the {{controls}} for moving the car so left goes right and right goes left And Screen Turns Red.|$|R
2500|$|Bruce Springsteen would {{comment in}} 1985, after {{including}} [...] "Street Fighting Man" [...] in the encores {{of some of}} his Born in the U.S.A. Tour shows: [...] "That one line, 'What can a poor boy do but sing in a rock and roll band?' {{is one of the greatest}} rock and roll lines of all time. ... has that edge-of-the-cliff thing when <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> And it's funny; it's got humour to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Sebastian {{decided to}} record {{an album of}} Memphis soul {{classics}} it was suggested by Universal Music Publishing that Steve Cropper should be contacted {{to see if he}} would like to be involved. Cropper was interested, and he arranged for the other two members of The Mgs Donald 'Duck' Dunn and Steve Potts to participate. He also called in Lester Snell, who is a mainstay Memphis organ/keyboard player who has worked with artists including Eddie Floyd, David Porter and Isaac Hayes. The Memphis Album was recorded live on analogue tape at Ardent Studios Memphis in August 2007. The recording engineer Curry Weber explained the reason for this on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "Going to tape is just such a richer and warmer tone when <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> first of all. Not a lot of guys these days are talented enough to go to tape, cause it's so definitive and destructive. When you're on tape, it's on tape, and it's really hard to go in and fix a bunch of stuff like you can with computer these days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> But {{answer me}} this question: Isn't a social conscience, broadly speaking, {{the result of}} comfort and security?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. You might guess for a year, and I don't {{suppose that}} <b>you</b> would <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> It is rather a curious thing. Nearly twenty years ago--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you {{had come}} to us I always wished you to stay. I don't like changes of this sort. I suppose <b>you</b> didn't <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> off with Augusta. But she's gone now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Considering the bad {{light and}} the distance, it was a remarkably clean shot," [...] he said. [...] "I {{expected}} to see that <b>you</b> had <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> with only a stray pellet or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] gasped the unknown, [...] "a moll, swelp me! Welcome to our roost, 'bo! <b>You</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> right. This is Hoboes' Home. There's nine 'boes {{of us got}} a shack up ahead. Welcome, ma'am. What's your line? Con game or just busted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now follow this," [...] I {{whispered to}} Malooney. [...] "Don't notice merely what he does, but try and {{understand}} why he does it. Any fool--after a little practice, that is--can hit a ball. But why do <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it?</b> What happens after you've hit it? What--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{thinks it}} is {{perfectly}} safe," [...] I said. [...] "You might shoot until <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it,</b> or knock it down with a stick, {{and yet there is}} no more timorous creature among the undergrowth, unless it has a brood of chicks, when it will attack any one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Mr. Chipperton, {{his face}} beaming into a broad smile; [...] "I believe {{they would have}} said that very thing. <b>You</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> exactly. Let's go in to supper." ...|$|R
5000|$|Penalty {{points are}} {{counted in the}} {{following}} order:(if <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> the ball into someone else's square, and they miss it, the amount of points they lose depends on what body part <b>you</b> used to <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> with): ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't I say <b>you</b> couldn't <b>hit</b> me? What am I coachin' you for? <b>It's</b> because <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> crooked, ain't <b>it?</b> Wal, go ahaid an' {{break your}} back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Sam!" [...] he said cordially, [...] "this is great. Now for our {{interesting}} experiment. My idea is {{that you}} can hurt a coon's head with a stick if <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> hard enough. Keep quite still. Now. What, are you coming up? Sam, I hate to do it, but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you said}} {{reliable}} <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> It's {{a word that}} means a good deal; but couldn't you say {{a little more than}} well-conducted? From something your daughter learned by chance, his relatives are people of position in the old country. That counts for a little, though perhaps it shouldn't." ...|$|E
60|$|SHEMUS. I heard say There's {{something}} that appears {{like a white}} bird, A pigeon or a seagull or the like, But if <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> with a stone or a stick It clangs {{as though it had}} been made of brass; And that if you dig down where it was scratching You'll find a crock of gold.|$|E
60|$|KEEGAN. Yes you can. Now {{out with}} it; or I'll put this stick into your hand an make <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> me with <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The little fist doubled up again; {{the vacant}} face grew {{positively}} sweet. [...] "That's just <b>it!</b> <b>You</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>it!</b> How clever <b>you</b> are! I want all that. I suppose, Miss Wade, YOU {{never go out}} for private nursing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellent! <b>you</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> exactly," [...] said Grace; [...] "exactly {{the right}} {{proportion}} of seeds. I was hurrying," [...] she added, [...] "to get these flowers in water, because {{a letter from}} John is waiting to be read." ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{rubbed his}} hands together. 'That's just it. You're always clevah. <b>You</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> first shot. But there's wheah the point comes in. At first, I only thought of how we could {{circumvent}} yah. I treated yah as the enemy. Now, it's all the othah way. Miss Cayley, you're the cleverest woman I evah met in this world; you extort my admiration.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Without {{meaning to}} {{interfere}} with your liberty of action we are writing by the outgoing mail {{to some of our}} business friends there who may be of assistance to you. We desire you particularly to call on Mr. Jacobus, a prominent merchant and charterer. Should <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> off with him he may be able to put you in the way of profitable employment for the ship." ...|$|E
5000|$|American Clint Dempsey {{was more}} favorable. He said that, [...] "If <b>you</b> just <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> solid, <b>you</b> {{can get a}} good knuckle on the ball... you've just got to pay a little bit more, you know, {{attention}} when you pass the ball sometimes." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor stopped, smilingly clapped {{me on the}} {{shoulder}} again, and exclaimed, with a triumph most delightful to behold, as if I had penetrated to the profoundest depths of mortal sagacity, 'My dear young friend, <b>you</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> It IS the Dictionary!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] Bertie shouted, [...] "I have {{no doubt}} <b>you</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>it,</b> Harry. I believe, after all, {{that we are going}} to find it. That is splendid! I shall dance at your wedding, Harry, which I had begun to think I never should do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Billy," [...] said he, quickly, {{in a low}} but stern voice, [...] "it's of no use. I {{see what}} you are up to. Your steerin' clear o' that won't prevent this sloop from bein' at the bottom in quarter of an hour, if not sooner! If <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> you may save {{yourself}} and me a world of trouble. It's {{so much for your}} own interest, boy, to hit that bit of wreck, that I'll trust you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't he awfully like you," [...] Milly went on, [...] "and didn't {{he think}} {{you the most}} charming person I could {{possibly}} have referred him to for an account of me? Didn't <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> off tremendously together and in fact fall quite in love, {{so that it will}} really be a great advantage for you to have me as a common ground? You're going to make, I can see, no end of a good thing of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> just right," [...] {{cried the}} visitor, too exultant {{to take off}} his overcoat. [...] "I've been down through the Pelican, and there ain't been such {{excitement}} since Snow and Giddings had the fight for United States senator in the '80's. The place is all torn up, and you can't get a room there for love or money. They tell me they've been havin' conferences steady in Number Seven since the session closed, and Hilary Vane's sent for all the Federal and State office-holders to be here in the morning and lobby. Botcher and Jane and Bascom are circulatin' like hot water, tellin' everybody that because they wouldn't saddle the State with a debt with your bills you turned sour on 'em, and that you're more of a corporation and railroad man than any of 'em. They've got their machine to working a thousand to the minute, and everybody they have a slant on is going into line. One of them fellers, a conductor, told me he had to go with 'em. But our boys ain't idle, I can tell you that. I was {{in the back of the}} gallery when you spoke up, and I shook 'em off the leash right away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure that}} you are right, Mr. Holmes," [...] cried our client. [...] "A {{thousand}} things {{come back to me}} which make me certain that <b>you</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A hundred per cent? That {{sounds too}} much like {{something}} of Fillmore's for comfort. Let's say ninety-nine and be conservative. Ginger, <b>you</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>it.</b> Say no more. You shall be the Dog King, the biggest thingamajigger for dogs in the country. But how do you start?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not precisely," [...] {{returned}} his dragoman; [...] "and yet <b>you</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>it,</b> sir, for into their shells they certainly withdrew, refusing {{to have anything}} to do with this wicked world. Sufficient unto them was the voice within. They were not well treated by an unfeeling populace." ...|$|R
