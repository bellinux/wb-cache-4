"Well, Mr. Harrison," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "there is {{no doubt}} that you have done what you {{conceived}} to be your duty, although I must tell you frankly that I wish you had either kept what you know to yourself or taken the information somewhere else.

6000|$|... "If that {{is really}} your opinion of us, Prince," [...] he said, [...] "it is useless to enter into {{argument}} with you, especially as you have already acted upon your convictions.

6000|$|... "Prince," [...] he said, [...] "this {{is perhaps}} {{the last time that}} we shall all meet {{together}} in this way. You go from us direct to the seat of your Government. So far there has been very little plain speaking between us. It would perhaps be more in accord with etiquette if we let you go without a word, and waited for a formal interchange of communications between your Ambassador and ourselves. But we have a feeling, Sir Edward and I, that we should {{like to talk to you}} directly.

6000|$|I {{could say}} {{nothing for a}} minute, though I felt, as I held his hand and our eyes {{continued}} to meet, that my silence had all the air of admitting his charge and that nothing {{in the whole world}} of reality was perhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. [...] "Certainly you shall go back to school," [...] I said, [...] "if it be that that troubles you. But not to the old place--we must find another, a better.

[...] His clear, listening face, framed in its smooth whiteness, made him for the minute as appealing as some wistful patient in a children's hospital; and I would have given, as the resemblance came to me, all I possessed on earth really to be the nurse or the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him.

40|$|Social {{psychologists have}} usually {{hypothesized}} that attitudinal selectivity biases people’s memory {{in favor of}} information that is congenial to their attitudes, because they are motivated to defend their attitudes against uncongenial information. However, our meta-analysis found that such effects have been only inconsistently obtained. One reason for these inconsistencies is that the defense of attitudes against attacks does not necessarily entail avoiding the uncongenial information. As shown by our experiments, people often expose themselves to attitudinally uncongenial information, attend to it, scrutinize it carefully, encode it accurately, and remember it fairly well, even though they dislike the information and are not persuaded by it. Given sufficient motivation and capacity, people mount an active defense that enhances memory for the information. Keywords attitudes; memory; congeniality effect; memory for attituderelevant information Think about {{the last time you}} listened to a debate on a controversial issue. Which presentation was more memorable—the one by the person who agreed with your views or the one by the person who disagreed? Social psychologists have usually assumed that people remember information more easily if it is consistent with their attitudes. If this assumption is right, you would remember more of the points made by the person who had agreed with <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> <b>question</b> of whether attitudes bias memory (and cognitive processes more generally) in favor of attitudinally agreeable information has often been tested and is known in social psychology as the congeniality hypothesi...|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>question</b> in <b>this</b> {{meditation}} is [...] "What is my True Self before I was born?". <b>This</b> <b>question</b> is so profound and fundamental that, once <b>you</b> answer <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> <b>you</b> {{can reach the}} ultimate enlightenment.
