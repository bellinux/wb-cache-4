Additionally, an attempt will be made to determine the feasibility of progressively transferring increasing resolution by transferring the Fourier series in groups of most important to least important frequency components. 1...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{different perspectives}} and trends in social decision making, especially the actual processes used by humans {{when they make}} decisions in their everyday lives or in business situations. The chapter uses cognitive psychological techniques to break down these processes and set them in their social context. Most of our decisions are made in a social context and are therefore influenced by other people. If you are at an auction and bidding on a popular item, you will try to guess how long the others will keep in the bidding race. Likewise, when you and another person have to coordinate your decision to win a card game you will also try {{to think about what}} the other person know and what s/he will do, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>adjust</b> your choice. In other words, you are {{trying to come up with}} a model of the person and his decision-making process. This involves the capability to think about the thoughts and intentions of others, to put yourself in another person's shoes (perspective taking), and to think recursively about your and another person's over several steps (like in a game of chess). Especially, recursive social reasoning is one of the hallmarks of social decision-making. Whereas observational, competitive and cooperative decision-making can all be seen as trying to maximize the own reward or profit, altruistic decision-making blatantly violates this axiomatic principle of behavioral economics. Yet, altruistic behavior is quite common throughout human society...|$|E

40|$|Constructing {{efficient}} iterative simulation algorithms can be difficult, but inference {{and monitoring}} convergence are relatively easy. We first give our recommended strategy (following Section 11. 10 of Gelman et al., 2003) and then {{explain the reasons}} for our recommendations, illustrating with a relatively simple example from our recent research: a hierarchical model fit to public-opinion survey data. 6. 1 Quick Summary of Recommendations 1. Simulate three or more chains in parallel. We typically obtain starting points by adding random perturbations to crude estimates based on a simpler model or approximation. 2. Check convergence by discarding {{the first part of}} the simulations—we discard the first half, although that may be overly conservative—and using within-chain analysis to monitor stationarity and between/within chains comparisons to monitor mixing. 3. Once you have reached approximate convergence, mix all the simulations from the second halves of the chains together to summarize the target distribution. For most purposes there is no longer any need to worry about autocorrelations in the chains. 4. Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) —for example, tuning the jumping distribution of a Metropolis algorithm—can often be a good idea and presents no problems for convergence if you restart after adapting. For example, if you have already run 400 iterations and have not reached approximate convergence, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>adjust</b> your algorithm and run another 400 steps, discarding the earlier simulations. At the next step of adaptation, you can run another 400, and so forth, possibly adapting the adaptation time itself to balance the goals of rapid convergence and computational efficiency. (Newer, more sophisticated algorithms have the promise of allowing continuous adaptation and do not necessarily require discarding early iterations.) 5. If you have run your simulations for a while and they are not close to convergence, stop, look at plots of simulations from different chains, and go back and improve your algorithm, for example, by adding new kinds of jumps to get faste...|$|E
