5|$|A prophecy {{says that}} Troy will not fall if Troilus lives into adulthood. So the goddess Athena {{encourages}} the Greek warrior Achilles to seek him out {{early in the}} Trojan War. The <b>youth</b> <b>is</b> known to take great delight in his horses. Achilles ambushes him and his sister Polyxena when he has ridden with her for water from a well in the Thymbra – an area outside Troy {{where there is a}} temple of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating White Stag {{from any}} other {{leadership}} program for <b>youth</b> <b>is</b> its spirit and traditions, including campfires, ceremonies, skits, yells, cheers, and emblems, all of which give it a distinctive character. These are used to communicate an ethic of always striving for self-improvement and personal achievement, and values that include characteristics of servant leadership, compassion, enthusiasm, kindness, and selflessness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{narcissi}} are depicted {{in three different}} contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the <b>youth</b> <b>is</b> frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association. The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his Narcissus, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh's Undergrowth.|$|E

5|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} {{books of}} the Bhagavata Purana are widely {{considered to be a}} poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the Harivamsa. Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (lila), where his <b>youth</b> <b>is</b> set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in Harivamsa, but is a symbolic universe in the Bhagavata Purana, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The Bhagavata Purana manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.|$|E
5|$|Stela 4 {{was found}} in the {{northern}} part of the East Plaza. It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location. Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4. The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic text with a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's Emblem Glyph. This side of the stela depicts a Maya bloodletting ritual with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg. The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it. This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at Naranjo. The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile. A child or <b>youth</b> <b>is</b> seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold something in their hands that cannot now be distinguished. Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names. The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is different, with the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front. This probably indicates that both sides were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the floor level of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.|$|E

40|$|The author {{analyses}} methodological aspects {{for study}} of youth {{as a whole}} and village youth in particular. It is emphasized that the latter was studied {{for a long period of}} time, but the number of characteristics inherent in this category of <b>youth</b> <b>was</b> not taken into account, its main groups and cohorts where socialization and profession acquisition occurred in different ways were not completely represented, finally, the study of village <b>youth</b> <b>was</b> not of systemic character. In the paper, definitions of youth and village <b>youth</b> <b>are</b> specified, description of the latter as an object of research is given, and methods of the study of self-determination processes among different categories of village <b>youth</b> <b>are</b> described...|$|R

2500|$|The exaltation [...] "Sweet flattery!" [...] {{at the end}} of the sonnet {{indicates}} sarcasm, since [...] "flattery" [...] usually indicates dishonest beauty. The speaker {{makes the}} argument that since he and the <b>youth</b> <b>are</b> one, they must then share the same woman. Because the mistress and the <b>youth</b> <b>are</b> having an affair, the speaker comes to the logical conclusion that he and the <b>youth</b> <b>are</b> that much closer. Atkins illustrates this, [...] "…we are meant to understand…that the flattery exists nowhere outside the poet's imagination".|$|R

25|$|X-ray {{emission}} as {{an indicator}} of stellar <b>youth</b> <b>is</b> important for studies of star-forming regions. Most star-forming regions in the Milky Way Galaxy are projected on Galactic-Plane fields with numerous unrelated field stars. It is often impossible to distinguish members of a young stellar cluster from field-star contaminants using optical and infrared images alone. X-ray emission can easily penetrate moderate absorption from molecular clouds, and can be used to identify candidate cluster members.|$|E

25|$|In childhood, Vātsyāyana says, {{a person}} should {{learn how to}} make a living; <b>youth</b> <b>is</b> the time for pleasure, and as years pass one should {{concentrate}} on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth. The Kama Sutra acknowledges that the senses can be dangerous: 'Just as a horse in full gallop, blinded by the energy of his own speed, pays no attention to any post or hole or ditch on the path, so two lovers, blinded by passion, in the friction of sexual battle, are caught up in their fierce energy and pay no attention to danger' (2.7.33).|$|E
25|$|The Fountain of <b>Youth</b> <b>is</b> {{a spring}} that {{supposedly}} restores {{the youth of}} anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by Herodotus (5th century BC), the Alexander romance (3rd century AD), and the stories of Prester John (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean during the Age of Exploration (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers {{of the water in}} the mythical land of Bimini.|$|E
25|$|This {{illustration}} {{serves to}} show that the work is not intended for scholars alone, but also for popular instruction; and that the statement, so often repeated since the time of Meiri, that the Sheiltot was a book merely for the instruction of <b>youth,</b> <b>is</b> also baseless. It is more probable that it is a collection of aggadic-halakic sermons, which Aḥa delivered in Palestine, where certainly he was held in high regard. With the decline of rabbinical knowledge in Palestine, Aḥa would have found but few pupils for pure halakic instruction; and he therefore endeavored to add aggadic elements to his lectures, in obedience to the general disposition of the Palestinians, who just then favored Aggadah.|$|E

Male sex-offending and conduct-disordered <b>youth</b> <b>are</b> believed by clinicians to be more frequent consumers of aggressive, explicit, and sexually violent media than <b>are</b> normal <b>youth.</b> Conduct -disordered <b>youth</b> <b>are</b> seen as preferring aggressive media, while sex-offending <b>youth</b> <b>are</b> viewed as more likely to choose explicit or sexually violent media...|$|R
