500|$|In 2006, Frank was one {{of three}} Representatives to oppose the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, which {{restricted}} protests (notably those of Fred Phelps' Westboro Baptist Church) at soldiers' funerals. He opposed the bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, on civil liberties and constitutional grounds. Frank said of the vote, [...] "I think it's very likely to be found unconstitutional. [...] It's true that when you defend civil liberties you are typically defending people who do obnoxious things... You play into their hand when <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> provoke you into overdoing it. I don't want these thugs to [...] claim [...] America is hypocritical."

This won’t be solved unless <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> hurry up and die.” ...|$|E
2500|$|You {{all worked}} for Nazi Germany. And {{you tried to}} offer only a passive resistance. Certainly, to buy off your {{conscience}} you helped {{here and there a}} persecuted person, but millions of innocent human beings were allowed to be murdered without any kind of protest being uttered ... first you betrayed your friends, then your children in that <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> stake their lives on a criminal war– and finally that you betrayed Germany itself, because when the war was already quite hopeless, you did not once arm yourselves against the senseless destruction of Germany.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘You’re always a-being begged, and prayed, {{upon your}} bended knees you are,’ said the footman with great {{emphasis}} to Trotty Veck, ‘to let our door-steps be. Why don’t <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>’em</b> be? CAN’T <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>’em</b> be?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You tink me one divl?" [...] {{demanded the}} old woman indignantly. [...] "No, some o' dem pyrits not so bad as each oder. <b>You</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> alone; me <b>let</b> <b>you</b> alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have to report, sir, {{that your}} pard is captured--Jack Rasco; {{he had a}} fearful fight and the {{soldiers}} have him. Ha! ha! they will shoot Jack--if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em,</b> but I know you won't--will you now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I can't {{understand}} is, how <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> do it, {{with such}} a command as {{you have in the}} place, or should have {{with such a}} man as Bunce. I cannot understand why <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> do it." ...|$|E
60|$|Why did <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> dance together? You {{might easily}} {{have said it}} was too late and the band must go.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But,' {{said the}} captain less harshly, 'if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> {{discover}} any relations between us here, you will ruin the fairest prospects man ever had!' ...|$|E
6000|$|AFRICA [she prides {{herself on}} being [...] "quite the lady"]. Don't talk about 'em, dear. We had just such another. [She {{turns to a}} girl near her.] Oh, they'll run the whole show for <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very odd}} {{you should be}} so uncivil to the child in her presence, and so ecstatic now! However, take care you do not get too familiar. Remember, these Wardours are no relations, and I will not have <b>you</b> <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> call <b>you</b> by your Christian name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{goodness}} me," [...] said Mrs. Poyser, who {{had looked}} back {{while her husband}} was speaking, [...] "look where Molly is with them lads! They're the field's length behind us. How COULD <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> do so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set a pictur' to watch the children as you. Run back and tell 'em to come on." ...|$|R
60|$|RICHARD (gallantly). Well, {{you had a}} hand in it. It {{must have}} been a little for your sake. <b>You</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> take me, at all events.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} do you want?" [...] exclaimed Willems, looking towards the river. [...] "Where's that damned boat? Why did <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go away? You stupid!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> come up, master?" [...] Osgod asked. [...] "They are as treacherous as snakes. See {{how that}} boy led us astray in the bog." ...|$|E
6000|$|Caleb cried after him: [...] "If you won't {{have the}} dog don't let the lambs suffer but do as I tell 'ee.

If you don't do as I tell 'ee you'll have many blown." ...|$|R
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. I see. <b>You</b> will <b>let</b> <b>them</b> acquire {{half of the}} stock, {{in order}} {{that they may have}} an equal voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rum!" [...] said Kipps. A half-forgotten {{experience}} {{came back}} to him. [...] "I know," [...] he said, waving the reverend gentleman's card; [...] "'e give 'em the slip, that's what he'd done. Gone off while they was rapping before <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> in. It's a fair call, any'ow." [...] He felt a momentary base satisfaction at his absence. [...] "What did they talk about, Ann?" ...|$|R
6000|$|JUDITH. Oh, why {{will you}} not be simple with me--honest and straightforward? If {{you are so}} selfish as that, why did <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> take you last night? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why don't {{you save}} me? Why do <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> sell {{me to this}} dreadful man? He don't love me--he never will. Can't you take me away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why does}} the town stand either of them? Why do <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> torture {{innocent}} people? Why don't {{you put them in}} the insane hospital, where they belong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is regular assassination,' said Quin, {{starting}} back; 'there's two on 'em on me at once. Fagan, <b>you</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> murder me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll find Dennis up there. But I guess <b>you</b> better <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go till to-morrow. I {{always make}} it a rule to stop work when I'm done." ...|$|R

60|$|HYPATIA. The cat's {{out of the}} bag, Johnny, about everybody. They {{were all}} {{beforehand}} with you: papa, Lord Summerhays, Bentley and all. Dont <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> laugh at you.|$|E
6000|$|... "No quarrelling here. Now, Henri Marais, your conduct {{about these}} two young people who love each other is a scandal. Will <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> be married to-morrow or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{mean to say}} <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> {{know that}} I was coming home?" [...] Cyril said, {{in a tone of}} such alarm that Lord Oliphant laughed and Mr. Popham said apologetically,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What she's a {{doing with}} her heart ain't no {{business}} of yours, Captain Fooks. I'm her father, and I know what I'm about. I'll make that young man's life {{a burden to}} him, if 'e ain't on the square with my girl. You see if I don't. Mr. 'Orsball, I want a 'orse to go a 'unting on to-day. <b>You</b> <b>lets</b> <b>'em.</b> Just tell your man to get me a 'orse. I'll pay for him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then we'll {{send them}} up the creek {{and put them in}} the store. <b>You</b> can <b>let</b> <b>them</b> remain or take them, as you like. We have paid our debt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Never mind him; don't {{you give}} up anything. Don't <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> make you soft. When it comes to money nobody should give up anything. Now I'll tell you what I propose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> see the place, mother," [...] he said. [...] "It is only right. What {{class of}} people do you have, as a rule? Clergymen and ecclesiastical architects, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurry up," [...] he ses. [...] "It a’most {{seems to}} me that there’s {{somebody}} ringing the bell, and <b>you</b> can <b>let</b> <b>them</b> in same time as <b>you</b> <b>let</b> us out. Is it the bell, or is it my fancy, Joe?" [...] he ses, turning to the mate.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, my dear, {{depend on}} me. I've just thought I shall send the servant {{home on a}} holiday--I've promised her a good while. I'll send her away as soon as she's had her breakfast, and she'll have no {{occasion}} to know you're here. There's no holding servants' tongues, if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> know anything.
