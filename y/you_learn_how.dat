MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has [...] "sassy" [...] lyrics, but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that [...] "the track is actually kind of dirty". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is [...] "not-so-subtly" [...] instructing her lover within the lines [...] "It’s your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> / I'll stay".|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, when Thomas read Race and Economics by {{economist}} Thomas Sowell, {{he found}} an intellectual foundation for his philosophy. The book criticized social reforms by government and instead argued for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. He was also influenced by Ayn Rand, particularly The Fountainhead, and would later require his staffers to watch the 1949 film version. Thomas later said that novelist Richard Wright {{had been the most}} influential writer in his life; Wright's books Native Son and Black Boy [...] "capture a lot of the feelings that I had inside that <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to repress."

6000|$|But have we well {{considered}} a divergence in thought {{from what is}} the fact? Have we considered the man whose very thought is a lie to him and to us! He too is a frightful man; repeating about this Universe on every hand what is not, and driven to repeat it; the sure herald of ruin to all that follow him, that know with his knowledge! And would <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to get a mendacious thought, there is no surer recipe than carrying a loose tongue. The lying thought, you already either have it, or will soon get it by that method. He who lies with his very tongue, he clearly enough has long ceased to think truly in his mind. Does he, in any sense, [...] "think"? All his thoughts and imaginations, if they extend beyond mere beaverisms, astucities and sensualisms, are false, incomplete, perverse, untrue even to himself. He has become a false mirror of this Universe; not a small mirror only, but a crooked, bedimmed and utterly deranged one. But all loose tongues too are akin to lying ones; are insincere at the best, and go rattling with little meaning; the thought lying languid at a great distance behind them, if thought there be behind them at all. Gradually there will be none or little! How can the thought of such a man, what he calls thought, be other than false? ...|$|E
