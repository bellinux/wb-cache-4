6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Robina, [...] "I have." [...] I {{gathered}} from her tone that the Joan of Arc expression had departed.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC) on April 8, 2010, Pardy was interviewed regarding the case of Nazia Quazi, a dual Indian and Canadian citizen who, after visiting her father in Saudi Arabia, was unable to return to Canada, since her father was able to assume “guardianship” over her and block her exit from the country, in accordance with Islamic law and tradition. Pardy suggested that Canadian policy toward Israel was to blame for Ms. Quazi's situation. Pardy argued that [...] "the fact that we Canada have taken ourselves out as a balanced observer the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ... is not looked at with any degree of friendliness in Saudi Arabia.” When the host directly asked him [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> that Canada’s Israel policy could leave young Canadian women in limbo?", Mr. Pardy replied [...] "Yes." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} rumored that Sorge {{provided}} the exact date of [...] "Barbarossa", but historian Gordon Prange in 1984 {{concluded that the}} closest Sorge came was June 20, 1941 and that Sorge himself never claimed to have discovered the correct date (June 22) in advance. [...] The date of June 20 was given to Sorge by Oberstleutnant (lieutenant-colonel) Erwin Scholl, the deputy military attaché at the German embassy. Despite knowing Germany was going to invade the Soviet Union sometime in May or June 1941, Sorge was still shocked on 22 June 1941 when he learned of Operation Barbarossa, going to a bar to get drunk while repeating in English: “Hitler’s a fucking criminal! A murderer. But Stalin will teach the bastard a lesson. You just wait and see!”. The Soviet press reported in 1964 that on June 15, 1941, Sorge had sent a radio dispatch saying that [...] "The war will begin on June 22." [...] Prange, {{who did not have}} access to material released by the Russian authorities in the 1990s, did not accept the veracity of this report. Stalin was quoted as having ridiculed Sorge and his intelligence before [...] "Barbarossa": There's this bastard who's set up factories and brothels in Japan and even deigned to report the date of the German attack as 22 June. Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> I should believe him too? ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} act of the play, the {{characters}} spent much time debating whatever the rhinoceros that have mysteriously appeared in France are African or Asian rhinoceros and {{which of the two}} types were superior to the other, a debate that Ionesco meant to be a satire on racism. Regardless of whatever the rhinoceros are African or Asian, the French characters comfortably assume their superiority to the rhinoceros; ironically the same people all become rhinoceros. Bérenger's friend Jean judges the superiority of African vs. Asian rhinoceros by their number of horns (making him a caricature of those people who judge other people by the color of their skin) and at one point shouts at Bérenger: [...] "If anybody got horns, it is you! You are an Asiatic Mongol!". A recurring theme in Nazi propaganda were that the Jews were an [...] "Asiatic" [...] people who were unfortunately living in Europe who had horns, a message that many of the French become familiar with during the German occupation of 1940-44, which Ionesco alluded to by the way in Jean taunts Bérenger over his supposed horns and being [...] "Asiatic". Ionesco intended the character of Jean, an ambitious functionary whose careerism robs him of the ability to think critically to be satiric portrayal of the French civil servants who served Vichy. At various points in the play, Jean shouts out such lines as [...] "We need to go beyond moral standards!", [...] "Nature has its own laws. Morality against Nature!" [...] and [...] "We must go back to primeval integrity!". When Jean says [...] "humanism is all washed up", Bérenger asks: [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> we replace our moral laws with the law of the jungle?". Lines such as these show that Ionesco also created the character of Jean as a satire of the Iron Guard which all attacked all the humanist values of the modern West as [...] "Jewish inventions" [...] designed to destroy Romania and claimed there was a [...] "natural law" [...] in which [...] "true" [...] Romanians would discover their [...] "primal energy" [...] as the most purest section of the [...] "Latin race" [...] and assert their superiority over the [...] "lower races". Notably, the more Jean rants about [...] "natural laws" [...] trumping all, the more he transforms into a rhinoceros. When Romanian nationalism first emerged in the late 18th century-at a time when the Romanians in Bukovina and Transylvania were ruled by the Austrian Empire while the Romanians in Moldavia, Wallachia and the Dobruja were ruled by the Ottoman Empire-there was an intense emphasis on the Latinity of the Romanians, who were depicted as a lonely island of Latin civilization in Eastern Europe surrounded by [...] "Slavic and Turanian barbarians". The reference to [...] "Turanian barbarians" [...] was to both the Turks and the Magyars who both [...] "Turanian" [...] peoples from Asia. This tradition of seeing Romania as a bastion of Latinism threatened by enemies everywhere culminated in the 1930s where the Iron Guard argued there were [...] "natural laws" [...] that determined Romania's struggle for existence, which allowed the Legion to justify any act of violence no matter how amoral as necessary because of the [...] "natural laws". Ionesco parodied the Legion's talk of [...] "natural laws" [...] and [...] "primeval values" [...] by putting dialogue that closely resembled the Legion's rhetoric into Jean as he transforms into a green rhinoceros.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Mathematical {{thinking}} is understood and appreciated in academic circles. Such thinking differs from thinking in other subjects in its vocabulary, symbols, and grammar. It requires working with multiple solutions and problem generation by thinking across concepts {{and thinking about}} thinking in a more complex way. This article suggests ways that teachers can help students achieve their math potential, including teaching them in more enjoyable ways, and by addressing them through their preferred learning styles. “I try so very hard—why don’t all my students get it? ” “I show many examples in class yet, in general, why aren’t they interested in learning math?” These questions haunt math teachers around the world. “Math is boring. I don’t know {{why we have to}} learn these equations ” are the standard student concerns. Where does the problem lie? Is it the fault of the students or the teachers? I suggest that it is neither. The fault is in the content delivery process. One may ask, “Isn’t delivery of content basically the same for all content areas? Or are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> {{thinking is}} different for different types of content? ” Does one think differently when one studies English than when studying science, mathematics, or social sciences? Mathematical thinking, I believe, does differ significantly from thinking in other subjects, in certain, specific ways. This paper discusses some of these differences, and suggests ways to improve both the thinking and the enjoyment of the students while learning about math. I have been teaching mathematics for over 35 years at the secondary, tertiary, and graduate levels. Presented herein are some of the techniques I have used successfully to help my students develop mathematical thinking through experimentation. A few references are provided in the paper to support my ideas on improving students ’ mathematical thinking, and to show how other math teachers, to a great degree, think the same way...|$|E
