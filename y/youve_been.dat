5000|$|After a few months, Najwa had {{completed}} {{the rest of her}} new album, Shu Mghaira..!. Like Saharni, it was distinctly Lebanese, but {{it was more of a}} modern adaptation, with a reflective and sad overtone. Najwa continued her many live appearances to promote the album, and a notable event for 2004 was her sell-out concert in Carthage, Tunisia where she performed to thousands of enthusiastic fans. The tracks Bi Hawak (In your love) and Shu Mghaira (How <b>youve</b> changed) <b>were</b> shot in an expensive duel video clip which was riddled with special effects. It remained at the number 1 position for 6 weeks on the Rotana Top 20 Chart. The two songs were the most popular from the album, and Najwa was voted [...] "Female Artist of the Year" [...] from MusicanaNet.net, which was decided via a large scale internet poll.|$|R

Now, Ive been trying this out at home, and ... it works really, really well... its just superb fun.

5000|$|The {{album cover}} was stenciled by the {{graffiti}} artist Banksy. Despite Banksy stating that he normally avoids commercial work, he later defended {{his decision to}} do the cover, saying: [...] "Ive done {{a few things to}} pay the bills, and I did the Blur album. It was a good record and commission was quite a lot of money. I think thats a really important distinction to make. If its something you actually believe in, doing something commercial doesnt turn it to shit just because its commercial. Otherwise <b>youve</b> got to <b>be</b> a socialist rejecting capitalism altogether, because the idea that you can marry a quality product with a quality visual and {{be a part of that}} even though its capitalistic is sometimes a contradiction you cant live with. But sometimes its pretty symbiotic, like the Blur situation. The albums cover art sold at auction in 2007 for £75,000. The fold out booklet of the album features the text [...] "Celebrity Harvest" [...] which was the working name for a proposed, but ultimately unmade Gorillaz film.|$|R

Paste Magazines Jeff Vrabel {{referred to it as}} a [...] "panoramic dreamworld" [...] and wrote that [...] "Have One on Me is packed with magic." [...] Jim Scott of Under the Radar awarded the album 9 out of 10 stating that Newsom [...] "has never been one of those artists who leave the listener wanting more, knowing that theres more to give." [...] To him [...] "the massive amount of material contained in Have One On Me {{will take a long time}} to digest. Perhaps as long as it takes her to produce another album". Drowned In Sound also gave the same rating and praised Newsoms vocals and lyrics, while the former being described as [...] "winsome and technically much improved" [...] and the latter being pointed as [...] "one of her strongest points." [...] To the reviewer the album is [...] "for now, a stunning and ambitious piece of work; one for the ages". Sputnikmusic rated the album 4½ stars out of 5 commenting that [...] "its been a long time since an album like this was released: an album that is intensely personal even if you cant relate to the lyrics, even if <b>youve</b> never <b>been</b> in love, even if youve never lost something, even if youve never really felt alive." [...] To Chris Parkin of Yahoo! Have One on Me is [...] "nothing short of remarkable", while No Ripcord awarded the album a full score, a second for Newsom, referring to it as [...] "one of the finest albums of this, or any, year." ...|$|R

5000|$|Erin Hershey Presley {{was cast}} as Alison Barrington in 2000. For {{the first two}} years of her run, Alisons love {{interest}} was Jamal Woods. The character was crafted as, at first, shallow and spoiled. She then softened to be playful and charming. The breakup with Jamal and the romance with Rafe Kovich developed her into full adulthood. Rafe was created in 2001 as a vampire slayer and an angel. Brian Gaskill, who had portrayed an angel before in the short film Higher Grounds, was cast in the part. Gaskill told Soap Opera Weekly he was excited to be playing an angel again. [...] "Theres something about having that light," [...] he said in the interview. [...] "Playing someone who comes from there is very freeing." [...] Rafe was written as [...] "unconventional," [...] allowing Gaskill to infuse his own [...] "offbeatness" [...] into the role. On other programs, he was not allowed the same freedoms to make the acting choices he wanted. [...] "I would make choices on some shows and theyd say, Thats really quirky and interesting, but guess what? Not on this show! <b>Youve</b> got to <b>be</b> the good-looking cool guy." [...] Gaskill credited the role for helping him in his personal life as well as with his acting. [...] "It has opened me up as much as an actor and as a person in ways that I never expected," [...] he said in an interview with Soap Opera Update. [...] "Its been a little bit of back and forth between me and Rafe. Im bringing to Rafe, but Rafe is giving to me. Thats where Im at. Sort of a coming of age a little late." ...|$|R
