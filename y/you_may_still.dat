500|$|Matsoukas {{initially}} {{planned the}} music video to visualize Beyoncé winning the contest, {{where she would}} {{realize that it was}} meaningless to her. However, Beyoncé suggested that an albino should serve as the contest's winner instead. Speaking to MTV News, Matsoukas elaborated: [...] "We thought it was really important and interesting to break those ideas of what the classic beauty standards would be and to do this with this beautiful albino woman, I thought was really great. And to show 'Yeah she's not perfect, she doesn't always win and you put your best foot forward and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> lose.'" [...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E
2500|$|Like many Victorian scholars, Mandell Creighton {{assumed that}} his wife would be an {{accessory}} in his academic pursuits, {{and that he would}} have the upper hand in their intellectual relationship. [...] During their courtship, he had written to her: The nuisance of married life (is that) strive as I may, or as <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> <b>still</b> the practical side of life must be much more prominent to me than to you. [...] I shall have a number of things to do; whereas your sphere will be all within my reach and knowledge, mine on the other hand will not in your reach entirely.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} can. Nothing need be fixed for you till you have {{stood at the}} altar with a man and been made his wife. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> choose <b>still.</b> I can never choose again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{no cause}} for shame," [...] said he. [...] "As for your sorrow--why, if it will afford <b>you</b> solace--you <b>may</b> <b>still</b> count on me to do what man can to rescue him from this position." ...|$|R
6000|$|Don't {{part with}} your illusions. When {{they are gone}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> exist but you have ceased to live. [...] --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> hear {{unpleasant}} {{stories about}} me," [...] said Winston, {{with a note}} the girl had not heard before in his voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are some}} positions, Mr Rubb, {{in which no}} one but God can help one. But, perhaps--perhaps <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> do {{something}} for the children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} only {{understand}} the relief I feel at this moment, I am sure you would not wonder that I prevailed upon myself to speak to <b>you.</b> It <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be in my power, however, to prevent evil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Half-an-hour ago. She {{was taken}} ill {{yesterday}} morning immediately {{after you left}} her. She is insensible, but <b>you</b> <b>may</b> find her <b>still</b> living.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} foolish girl has not annoyed you--at {{such a time}} as this," [...] he said, very earnestly, when he {{returned}} to the sofa. [...] "I can't tell you how grieved I am at what has happened. I was careful to warn <b>you,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> remember. <b>Still,</b> if I could only have foreseen--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those men again!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "They {{say that}} Estermen never {{abandons}} a chase. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> find him {{waiting for you}} in your hotel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{things are}} {{possible}} with God, Vulcan. Keeping {{him and his}} commandments constantly in mind, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> hope to see your young mistress, and to share in her happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Margaret, {{to come to}} {{the point}} at once, the fact is this. You must renounce any idea that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> have of {{becoming}} my son's wife." [...] Then she paused.|$|E
6000|$|And ever, if you hearken well, [...] <b>You</b> <b>still</b> <b>may</b> hear its vesper bell, [...] And tread of high-souled men go by, [...] Their {{thoughts}} {{conversing with}} the sky.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{well for}} you that a low fever has forced you to abstain {{for the last three}} days: there would have been danger in {{yielding}} to the cravings of your appetite at first. Now <b>you</b> <b>may</b> eat, though <b>still</b> not immoderately." ...|$|R
60|$|Believe {{about this}} as <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> my friends, <b>still</b> I believe, and will believe; I preach, and will preach, this, and nought else but this:- That there is but one {{everlasting}} goodness, which is good in men, good in all rational beings--yea, good in God himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is this, Shepherdess," [...] Nam {{answered}} bowing; [...] "although you are dethroned as a goddess, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> shine as a {{queen and}} rule over {{us as the}} wife of our king." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps {{he would}} {{not go to the}} Embassy to-night, {{especially}} if he was in disguise. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be able to find him and repair the error.|$|E
6000|$|... "She doesn't take a guinea at the time, but <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> {{get your}} account," [...] the Duchess returned. [...] "Of course {{we know that}} the great {{business}} she does is in husbands and wives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May God forgive you, madam, for {{the manner}} in which you have treated me," [...] said Mr. Slope, looking at her with a very heavenly look; [...] "and {{remember}} this, madam, that <b>you</b> yourself <b>may</b> <b>still</b> have a fall;" [...] and he looked at her with a very worldly look. [...] "As to the bishop, I pity him!" [...] And so saying, Mr. Slope left the room. Thus ended the intimacy of the Bishop of Barchester with his first confidential chaplain.|$|R
5000|$|The Principle of the Wedge is {{that you}} should not act justly now for fear of raising {{expectations}} that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> act <b>still</b> more justly in the futureexpectations which you are afraid you {{will not have the}} courage to satisfy. A little reflection will make it evident that the Wedge argument implies the admission that the persons who use it cannot prove that the action is not just. If they could, that would be the sole and sufficient reason for not doing it, and this argument would be superfluous.|$|R
6000|$|Rod. I am here, dear lady. Do {{not fear}} me; I may not unmask even to <b>thee,</b> for spies <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be near me.

6000|$|... 'Spare {{to curse}} me, father, who am accursed {{by my own}} conscience. Turn your horses rather and ride for Yarmouth, for there his ship lies and thither he has gone with two hours' start. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> trap him before he sets sail.' ...|$|E
60|$|No {{length of}} time can make you quit Honour and virtue, sense and wit, Thus <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be young to me, While I can better hear than see: Oh, ne'er may fortune show her spite, To make me deaf, and mend my sight.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, George--you see I say George, and not Mr. Somerset, and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> {{draw your}} own inference--don't be so morbid in your reproaches! I have {{informed}} <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> write, or <b>still</b> better, telegraph, since the wire is so handy--on business. Well, of course, {{it is for}} you to judge whether you will add postscripts of another sort. There, you make me say more than a woman ought, because you are so obtuse and literal. Good afternoon--good-bye! This will be my address.' ...|$|R
6000|$|To this Beaumains replied, {{speaking}} {{still very}} calmly {{and with great}} courtesy: [...] "Lady, that shall be altogether as you ordain. And I venture {{to say to you}} that no matter into what dangers <b>you</b> <b>may</b> bring me, <b>still</b> I have great hope that I shall bring you out thence with safety and so be of service to you and your lady sister. Wherefore, whithersoever you lead, thither will I follow you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My love, I {{shall not}} be sorry to go myself," [...] {{he said to his}} daughter, [...] "and you, though the most affectionate of daughters, will console {{yourself}} after a while. Why should I, who am so old, be romantic? <b>You</b> <b>may,</b> who are <b>still</b> a young creature." [...] This he said, not meaning all he said, for the lady whom he addressed was a matter-of-fact little person, with very little romance in her nature.|$|R
6000|$|He {{rose with}} a laugh. [...] "Well, I'm going. All {{you have to}} do is to carry out my suggestions, and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> make {{yourself}} and your ranch a credit to the district. In the meanwhile, this place would be considerably improved by a little ventilation." ...|$|E
60|$|Now the {{operations}} of this modern infantry, which unlike any preceding infantry {{in the history of}} war does not fight in disciplined formations but as highly individualised specialists, are determined almost completely by the artillery preparation. Artillery is now the most essential instrument of war. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> get along with rather bad infantry; <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> hold out even after the loss of the aerial ascendancy, but so soon as your guns fail you approach defeat. The backbone process of the whole art of war is the manufacture in overwhelming quantities, the carriage and delivery of shell upon the vulnerable points of the enemy's positions. That is, so to speak, the essential blow. Even the infantryman is now hardly more than the residuary legatee after the guns have taken their toll.|$|E
6000|$|... "I trust <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>still</b> be comforted, Lady," [...] said Eustace. [...] "From {{what the}} good Fathers tell me, {{there is hope}} that Fulk may yet be an altered man, and when the pilgrimage to the Holy Land, which he has vowed, is concluded, may return in a holy temper." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this then, as if {{moved by}} {{his way of}} constantly--and more or less against his own contention--coming round to her, she showed how she could also always, and not less gently, come half way. [...] "I speak of it only as the missing GRACE--the grace that's in {{everything}} that Maggie does. It isn't my due"--she kept it up-- [...] "but, taking from <b>you</b> that we <b>may</b> <b>still</b> expect it, it will have the touch. It will be beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{the general}} wish, I believe, to get Rashleigh {{out of the}} house," [...] replied Miss Vernon. [...] "Although {{youngest}} of the family, he has somehow or other got the entire management of all the others; and every one is sensible of the subjection, though they cannot shake it off. If any one opposes him, he is sure to rue having done so before the year goes about; {{and if you do}} him a very important service, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> rue it <b>still</b> more." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{name of this}} Aurora I'll not mention, [...] Although I might, for she was nought to me [...] More {{than that}} patent work of God's invention, [...] A charming woman, whom we like to see; [...] But writing names would merit reprehension, [...] Yet {{if you like to}} find out this fair She, [...] At the next London or Parisian ball [...] <b>You</b> <b>still</b> <b>may</b> mark her cheek, out-blooming all.|$|R
