There is also a cost quantification of these different architectures by the way of a cost calculation software which has been developed to size and compare the considered solutions. For each strategy, we calculate investment costs and <b>yearly</b> costs (<b>maintenance</b> and energy cost).

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Although shortwave diathermy {{has been}} widely used by physiotherapists, {{there are a few}} studies {{assessing}} the performance of the equipment in use. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the proce-dures adopted by physiotherapists as users of shortwave diathermy continuous (CSWD), as well as to measure the power output and frequency of CSWD equipment. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-three physical therapists were interviewed and 23 CSWD equipment were evaluated. Admeasurement was carried out by using a standard phan-tom to simulate the electrode-skin distance, which ranged from 0. 5 to 3. 0 cm. Data analysis was performed by using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and a post-hoc Tukey’s test or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. [Results] The ques-tionnaires showed that 48 % of the interviewees use the correct electrode-skin distance, 70 % use a single electrical outlet, and 35 % use a grounded electrical outlet, and that 48 % of the physiotherapy tables and 61 % of the plinths were made of wood. However, only 13 % of the interviewees perform <b>yearly</b> preventive <b>maintenance.</b> The highest power (95. 56 W) was achieved at electrode-skin distances ranging from 1. 0 to 1. 5 cm, with distances of 2. 5 cm and 3. 0 cm being null in four and eight equipment, respectively. There was a negative correlation between power output and electrode-skin distance as well as between power output and purchase date. [Conclusion] The physiotherapists involved in this study had inadequate knowledge about the correct use of CSWD equipment, which may adversely affect its performance and patient safety...|$|R

The software industry spends {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars <b>yearly</b> on software <b>maintenance</b> and it is clear that there is no blueprint for how it should be performed. In this thesis we will look at performing software maintenance on a system called Joly. The first version of Joly was released in 2006, and it has been used at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo since then. Joly is written in Java and makes use of several pieces of Open-Source software. The main theme of this thesis is about how partially existing source code can be reconstructed by reverse engineering it through the use of a decompiler. And while there are many Java decompilers out there, few of them actually work. We look at how Open-Source software, which has become increasingly popular over the years, can affect software maintenance and what to keep in mind when deciding to use it. Joly has had different developers working on it to improve it over the years and we will see what impact this has made, and finally we look at how we can correct various errors in the system, with one particular error that is causing it to crash...|$|R
