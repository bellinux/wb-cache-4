5|$|I {{think we}} all know that we're going to hear {{announcements}} like this more often. A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

500|$|Scott Boras has {{represented}} Holliday as his agent since he turned professional. [...] Holliday described {{his relationship with}} Boras and his staff in that he [...] "enjoy(s) sitting down and talking to them. [...] Scott is as accessible as {{you want him to}} be. [...] I could call him right now. He's got a lot of clients and people say they don’t hear from Scott but he’ll give <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> or as little attention as you want." [...] Holliday further explained that due to the amenities the Boras Corporation provides, including a staff psychologist, research to assist players in prolonging careers, studies into arbitration cases, and statistical performance computation, he felt that Boras' agency gave him the best opportunities to succeed.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews; {{many critics}} praised {{the return of}} Fox Mulder, although others felt that the episode had various plot holes and was overcomplicated. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave [...] "Deadalive" [...] a full five stars and called its humor and simplistic plot the [...] "icing on the cake." [...] They praised its stylistic difference from the preceding episode, [...] "This Is Not Happening", which they described as [...] "atmospheric and doom-laden". The two called [...] "Deadalive" [...] a [...] "slice of sci-fi hokum, with action scenes, bits of grisly horror [...] a reexamination of the show's mythology". Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A−" [...] and wrote, [...] "Never go away again, David! I take back everything bad I ever said about you! I love <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as ever!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Charter {{called for}} the {{introduction}} of a constitutional monarchy, an independent judiciary, and a bicameral legislature composed of a lower house of elected representatives and an upper house of appointed legislators. The Charter also granted equal rights between men and women, and recognised all Bahraini citizens as having equal political rights, including the entitlement to elections and political candidacy. In the 8 February meeting, the government promised that [...] "the new political arrangements will not invalidate the 1973 constitution and that the upper appointed house will be for consultation only." [...] The next day, after leading Friday prayer, al-Jamri delivered a famous speech, starting with [...] "Allah is my witness, I have missed <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as Jacob missed Joseph", before Abdulwahab announced that the opposition had decided to accept the reform plan. The National Action Charter was voted on in a referendum on 14 and 15 February, gaining massive popular support (98.4%). In November 2001, the Al Wefaq Shia political society was founded, with al-Jamri being seen as its mentor.|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{had been}} with Charles Clasby's law firm for six months when Bob McNeally, a Democrat {{appointed}} as U.S. Attorney for Fairbanks during the Truman administration, informed U.S. District Judge Harry Pratt {{that he would be}} resigning effective August 15, 1953, having already delayed his resignation by several months at the request of Justice Department officials newly appointed by Eisenhower. The latter had asked McNeally to delay his resignation until Eisenhower could appoint a replacement. Despite Stevens's short tenure as an Alaska resident and his relative lack of trial or criminal law experience, Pratt asked Stevens to serve in the position until Eisenhower acted. Stevens agreed. [...] "I said, 'Sure, I'd like to do that,' [...] " [...] Stevens recalled years later. [...] "Clasby said, 'It's not going to pay <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> money, but, {{if you want to do}} it, that's your business.' He was very pissed that I decided to go." [...] Most members of the Fairbanks Bar Association were outraged at the appointment of a newcomer, and members in attendance at the association's meeting that December voted to support Carl Messenger for the permanent appointment, an endorsement seconded by the Alaska Republican Party Committee for the Fairbanks-area judicial division. However, Stevens was favored by Attorney General Herbert Brownell, by Senator William F. Knowland of California, and by the Republican National Committee, (Alaska itself had no Senators at this time, as it was still a territory). [...] Eisenhower sent Stevens's nomination to the U.S. Senate, which confirmed him on March 30, 1954.|$|E
