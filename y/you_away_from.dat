5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries <b>you</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} July, Wilson {{left the}} film because of {{scheduling}} conflicts {{brought on by the}} filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay's revised script. Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco. The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film, and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was [...] "pulled" [...] more into the MCU than Wright's version which [...] "was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films." [...] She added that, while Wright's version was [...] "incredible" [...] and would have been great to film and watch, [...] "it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it was. It just would have taken <b>you</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built." ...|$|E

2500|$|Members {{were drawn}} {{from all of the}} Protestant churches: from the Roman, Greek, Syrian and Armenian Catholic churches; from Theosophy, Christian Science and Spiritualism; and from many Oriental religions. [...] Cayce's {{philosophy}} was, if it makes you a better member of your church then it's good; if it takes <b>you</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> your church, it's bad. [...] The philosophy of the readings was that truth is one, each organization is part of this one, therefore the A.R.E. was not to function as a schism or in opposition to any religious organization. [...] The goal of the work was not something new but something ancient and universal.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "End of Time" [...] is a {{declaration}} of co-dependence; Knowles professes her everlasting love to her romantic interest. As stated by Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic, [...] "At the start, she's stricken by her own emotional vulnerability; by the end, she's empowered by it." [...] The song opens with [...] "spitfire drums" [...] while Knowles sings in an almost distorted fashion, with her vocals layered underneath until a [...] "dramatic explosion". As her vocals continue to build up, Knowles airily chants: [...] "Come take my hand / I won’t let you go / I’ll be your friend / I will love you so deeply / I {{will be the one}} to kiss you at night / I will love you till the end of time." [...] She continues her appeal as she sings to her love interest, [...] "Take <b>you</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> here / There's nothing between us but space and time". On the bridge, Knowles belts her vocal lines over a shooting horn sequence; with her multiple-layered vocals, she commands, [...] "Boy come to me", and towards the end, she repeatedly sings, [...] "Say you’ll never let me go". Knowles [...] "finds the strength in two" [...] as she affirms to her romantic interest, [...] "I just wanna be with you / I just wanna live for you / I'd never let you go!".|$|E
2500|$|When it debuted, Fallen Angels {{received}} mixed {{to critical}} notices. In his review for the Associated Press, Scott Williams wrote, 'We're {{asking a lot}} of TV to deliver entertainment about that stylish, moral abyss. Fallen Angels delivers. It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness". The Chicago Sun-Times gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, [...] "Part {{of the problem is}} the series' arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a '90s interpretation of film noir, [...] "Fallen Angels" [...] offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds". In his review for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor called it, [...] "uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level". In his review for the Houston Chronicle, Louis B. Parks wrote, [...] "The big problem with film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. Fallen Angels has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, [...] "Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now for the gifted artisans of Hollywood. Even by today's commonplace high standards, however, {{the look and feel of}} the six Fallen Angels films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, they at least look darn good". Newsweek magazine's David Gates wrote, [...] "no show this summer will do a better job of whisking <b>you</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the increasingly unacceptable '90s. These half hours are all too short". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don't be fooled, this is a boys' fantasy production) dressed up in their dads' big suits".|$|E

5000|$|Malone's {{position}} {{turned out}} to be somewhat controversial. In his revised edition in 1821, multiple notes appeared in response. The first, by George Steevens, offers an alternate reading of the passage: [...] "I suspect that the waggish Launcelot designed this for a broken sentence—and get thee—implying, get thee with child. Mr. Malone, however, supposes him to mean only—carry <b>thee</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> thy father's house." [...] As does another by John Monck Mason: ...|$|R
