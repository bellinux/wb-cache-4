We {{received}} <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and wait for you.|$|E

25|$|I also do {{not believe}} it would be {{appropriate}} for me to offer opinions, as <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> suggests the committee may seek, about the ultimate responsibility of senior White House officials for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity, or the sufficiency of the remedial measures that White House officials took after the leak. Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E

"Dear Lucy, <b>Your</b> <b>letter</b> gave {{me quite}} a shock, fancy you wanting to draw four pounds {{to buy a}} brooch, ring, bangle, work basket, tea set, etc, etc. [...] I am quite sure Mrs. Henry would expend the money {{carefully}} for you, but I {{must tell you that}} no Aborigine can draw 4/5 of their wages unless they are sick and in hospital and require the money to buy comforts...

500|$|Islamic historians often cite {{a letter}} that they claim Heraclius wrote to Muhammad: [...] "I have {{received}} <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> with your ambassador and I testify {{that you are the}} messenger of God found in our New Testament. Jesus, son of Mary, announced you." [...] According to the Muslim sources reported by El-Cheikh, he tried to convert the ruling class of the Empire, but they resisted so strongly that he reversed his course and claimed that he was just testing their faith in Christianity. El-Cheikh notes that these accounts of Heraclius add [...] "little to our historical knowledge" [...] of the emperor; rather, they {{are an important part of}} [...] "Islamic kerygma," [...] attempting to legitimate Muhammad's status as a prophet.|$|E

500|$|The ways {{in which}} St Vincent chose to {{communicate}} the rejections often depended {{on the number of}} letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. To the Earl of Portsmouth he wrote: [...] "I cannot possibly agree in opinion with your Lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime." [...] A harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. Yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: [...] "Although I cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of Captain (name unknown) , there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> of the 24th, which I lose no time in acknowledging;" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
