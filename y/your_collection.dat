500|$|He {{confirmed}} his reputation {{with the release}} of his fifth studio album, Historias. The album sold 2 million copies throughout Latin America and received twenty-seven platinum and two diamond certifications, including quadruple Platinum in Argentina. Historias reached No. 43 on Top Latin Albums and included the hit singles [...] "Te Conozco" [...] (No. 3 on Billboard Latin Songs) and [...] "Señora De Las Cuatro Décadas" [...] (No. 7 on Latin Songs). The Allmusic review by Jason Birchmeier awarded the album 4.5 stars stating that [...] "If you were to pick only one Arjona album for <b>your</b> <b>collection</b> that wasn't a greatest-hits compilation, this should be the one. Historias was a career-defining success for Arjona." [...] His fourth and fifth studio albums were the best-selling of his career.|$|E
2500|$|On release, Is This What You Want? {{received}} enthusiastic reviews. In a 1970 {{interview with}} Robert Greenfield of Rolling Stone, however, Lomax lamented that commentators {{tended to focus}} on the line-up of superstar backing musicians, saying, [...] "they're always talkin' about who's on the album and not the album itself." [...] Writing in ZigZag in July 1974, Andy Childs advised the magazine's readers: [...] "it's worth its weight in gold, so if it's absent from <b>your</b> <b>collection,</b> add it to your shopping list of second-hand records." [...] Greenfield and Childs both recognised Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as a highlight of the album.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a comment}} on the {{loudness}} war, Steven Wilson mentioned how he considered placing a message on record sleeves that reads as follows: [...] "Please note that this record may not be mastered as loudly {{as some of the}} other records in <b>your</b> <b>collection.</b> This is in order to retain the dynamic range and subtlety of the music. Please, use your volume knob." [...] Conversely, the CD version of the album has been proved to contain clipping and dynamic range compression, whereas the 5.1 surround mix on the DVD-A version does not. However, subsequent releases Fear of a Blank Planet and Nil Recurring are mastered at lower levels, preserving more of their original dynamic range.|$|E
