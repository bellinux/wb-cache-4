25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to you that you are not as committed to them as <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E
500|$|Wolpaw {{said that}} while many story {{elements}} of Portal are revisited in Portal 2, he avoided some of the memes—such as the frequently repeated [...] "the cake is a lie". He said, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> sick of the memes, I was sick of it way ahead of you". Wolpaw [...] "couldn't resist putting in just one" [...] cake joke. The writers {{did not try to}} predict or write new memes, and Wolpaw said, [...] "you can't really plan for [...] because if you do it probably seems weird and forced". Portal 2 produced its own memes, including a space-obsessed personality core. Valve later created a Space Core modification for the game [...] (see below), and the Space Core also appeared as a laser-based engraving on a panel manufactured by NASA for the International Space Station.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's mere speciousness. Before {{you knew}} {{anything}} of me, and while <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{the child of}} poverty on both sides, you were well enough; but ever since <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> more than that, you have led a life which is intolerable. What has become of your plan of alliance between the De Stancys and the Powers now? The man is gone upstairs who can overthrow it all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, I declare!' she exclaimed. 'From the way {{she talked}} about <b>you</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> old friends. Her name is Mrs. Sickles.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{saw your}} eyes open in the glass, but as they were closed when I looked round upon <b>you,</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> perhaps deceiving me.|$|R
6000|$|Madame de F. (with a sigh). I {{wish you}} could attend the {{services}} of a better church. And when <b>was</b> it <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> might <b>be</b> good, Ethel? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I {{never meant}} to be, but I am afraid it seemed so to my young sisters. I can quite see how <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> acting kindly." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thank you, Felix,' {{said the}} Curate; 'it {{is a great}} relief to me. I was afraid <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to bring a meddling fellow in upon you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> willing, {{until you}} knew the cost?" [...] Shillito rejoined. [...] "Then you saw you couldn't make good and {{resolved}} to turn me down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{not wanted}} to nurse the sick man, <b>were</b> <b>you?</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> one {{that was to be}} trusted. What more is there to do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|As chance {{arranged}} it, {{he met the}} Earl {{standing on}} the great steps before his own castle doors. [...] "What, Finn; <b>is</b> this <b>you?</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in Ireland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Avast there!" [...] cried Silver. [...] "Who <b>are</b> <b>you,</b> Tom Morgan? Maybe <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll {{teach you}} better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my sides! and some by the board, and all {{to feed the}} fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder what}} you do succeed in? Your book was very successful, wasn't it? <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to set the Thames on fire, and the book fell flat, flat, flat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I know you, Checco, {{and your}} pride! As Satan fell by pride, so may you, {{notwithstanding}} all your riches and power. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> my equal, {{and because you}} found me your master you gnashed your teeth and cursed me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poof! {{what are}} you but a pack of silly schoolboys?" [...] growled the German. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> doing a {{wonderful}} thing spying around our house and our barn? You didn't know we had someone watching you all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Lily, that love, {{from its}} very nature, must cease; or, rather, such {{love is not}} the same as that <b>you</b> felt when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to be his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ow {{many times}} have I got to tell <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> careful of them plates?" [...] said Keggs sternly. [...] "Who {{do you think you}} are--a juggler on the 'Alls, 'urling them about like that? Yes, I know all about that letter. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> very clever, I've no doubt. But let me tell you, young blighted Albert, that only the other evening 'er ladyship and Mr. Bevan 'ad a long and {{extended}} interview in spite of all your hefforts. I saw through your little game, and I proceeded and went and arranged the meeting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It never {{occurred}} to me that <b>you</b> honestly <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> acting rightly when you came and gave me a piece of your mind, as <b>you</b> call it. I <b>thought</b> your motives were simply malicious and uncharitable." ...|$|R
60|$|Why hesitate? You cannot {{possibly}} be {{implicated in the}} deed. You will enjoy a position nearly unique in human history. You will see the man, of whose murder <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> guilty, tried for the offence which you know was committed by your wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "You thought, Muscari, I was {{the failure}} among our schoolfellows," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the success. But I have succeeded {{more than you}} and fill a bigger place in history. I have been acting epics while you have been writing them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have read}} the {{inscription}} to your wife," [...] she answered; [...] "I have seen you while <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> alone; the mercy which has so long kept the truth from me is mercy wasted now. Your bonds are broken, Herbert. You are a free man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Wingfield, {{it is good}} to see <b>you!</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> pining {{again in}} a Yankee dungeon, or had got knocked on the head {{crossing}} the lines. Where have you sprung from, and when did you arrive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>thought,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>were</b> mistaken. I saw you {{creeping}} away {{round the}} point. When <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{out of sight}} I carried my kayak over the neck of land, and so got here before you." ...|$|R
50|$|Their {{performance}} at Club Foot was noteworthy. A live {{show in a}} small San Francisco underground club, the Psyclones played synth, tapes, echo trumpet, guitar, etc.....The show was industrial improvisational, but so subtle and fluid that <b>you</b> never <b>thought,</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> merely manipulated into thinking.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{is great}} news indeed, Mr Wegg. There's no denying it. But I could have wished you had told it me {{before you got}} your fright to-night, and I could have wished you had ever asked me as your partner what we were to do, before <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{dividing}} a responsibility.' ...|$|E
60|$|At last, {{the whole}} {{flotilla}} of trenchers--wrecks and all--were sent swimming to the further end of Lake Como; and thence removed, gave place to ruddy hillocks of fruit, and floating islands of flowers. Chief among the former, a quince-like, golden sphere, {{that filled the}} air with such fragrance, <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> tasting its flavor.|$|E
6000|$|He {{spoke with}} a quiet sadness in his voice, which meant far more to his sister than the simple words he uttered. Her eyes filled with tears; she turned for a moment from her lover, and took her brother's hand. [...] "Don't talk, Louis, as if <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to lose your sister, because--" [...] Her lips began to tremble, and she stopped suddenly.|$|E

60|$|ANNA--Well, when I {{made up my}} mind to come to see <b>you,</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> a yanitor--that you'd have a place where, maybe, if you didn't mind having me, I {{could visit}} a while and rest up--till I felt able {{to get back on the}} job again.|$|R

60|$|No severe or {{prolonged}} bodily illness {{followed this}} incident of the red- room; it only gave my nerves {{a shock of}} which I feel the reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> only uprooting my bad propensities.|$|E
6000|$|There were a {{few lines}} of postscript: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} the change would leave you more free to consult your own wishes in regard to {{continuing}} your friendship with Susy, and upon such a footing as may please you. I judge from Mrs. McClosky's conversation that she believed <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> only doing your duty in reporting to me, and that the circumstances had not altered the good terms in which you all three formerly stood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not impossible: {{have some}} energy, man. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> as dead as a herring two hours since, {{and you are}} all alive and talking now.

Jane" [...] (he turned to {{me for the first}} time since his re-entrance), [...] "take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk {{straight}} forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan, you're {{a little}} bit more of a real man than I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> willing to do {{anything}} against me and my brothers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Besides, mutual {{discipline}} {{is not a}} thing to upset. Lily, I revere <b>you!</b> I never <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to turn out}} such a sensible mother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would {{scarcely}} {{venture to}} tell <b>you</b> what I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> {{but it is}} in one respect consoling to find you real," [...] he said.|$|R
