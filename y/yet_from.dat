5|$|As {{its name}} implies, Parasaurolophus was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest. However, it was soon reassessed {{as a member of}} the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids—Saurolophus is an hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus, a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest <b>yet)</b> <b>from</b> the Amur region of northeastern China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. P. cyrtocristatus, with its short, rounder crest, may be the most basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species, or it may represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who served}} in {{government}} had a privileged position in Han society that was just one tier below the nobles (yet some high officials were also ennobled and had fiefs). They could not be arrested for crimes unless permission was granted by the emperor. However, when officials were arrested, they were imprisoned and fettered like commoners. Their punishments in court also had to gain {{the approval of the}} emperor. Officials were not exempt from execution, yet they were often given a chance to commit suicide as a dignified alternative. The most senior posts were the Three Excellencies—excluding the Grand Tutor, a post that was irregularly occupied. The individual titles and functions of the Three Excellencies changed from Western to Eastern Han. However, their annual salaries remained at 10,000 dan (石) of grain, largely commuted to payments in coin cash and luxury items like silk. Below them were the Nine Ministers, each of whom headed a major government bureau and earned 2,000 bushels a year. The lowest-paid government employees made Equivalent to 100 bushels annually. It was thought that wealthy officials would be less tempted by bribes. Therefore, {{in the beginning of the}} dynasty, having a total assessed taxable wealth of one hundred thousand coins was a prerequisite for holding office. This was reduced to forty thousand coins in 142 BCE, <b>yet</b> <b>from</b> Emperor Wu's reign onwards this policy was no longer enforced.|$|E

After guaranteeing Catholic freedom of worship, Gaiseric entered a peace treaty with the Byzantines in 474, which endured about sixty years.|$|E

25|$|As the {{commemorative}} coin act legislation was pending, the DAV announced in March 2008 an additional donation of $600,000—half of {{which came from}} the state chapter in California, and half {{of which was a}} matching donation by the DAV. But although the national DAV had pledged to match state donations up to $3 million (for a total DAV state and national contribution of $6 million), $2.4 million of the pledge was still unfulfilled by early 2008. A second major memorial donation came in April 2008 when businessman H. Ross Perot agreed to give three annual payments of $1 million each to the DVLMF. Perot's contribution (the largest <b>yet</b> <b>from</b> an individual or group not already associated with the memorial foundation) brought the total amount of funds raised for construction and maintenance to $55.1 million. At this point, the DVLMF still claimed they only needed $65 million to begin construction. News sources reported that the foundation intended to begin and finish construction in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle the Australians were left to {{speculate}} on the reason it occurred. One hypothesis was that the Viet Cong had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company. A second possibility was that they may have had the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the Viet Cong had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. The evidence suggested they intended an attack on Nui Dat in some form, while the lack of prepared positions from which to mount an ambush made this unlikely. Brigadier David Jackson—Commander 1 ATF—believed the Viet Cong had been on their way to attack Nui Dat on the night of 18/19 August when D Company intercepted them and this was supported by information from a prisoner captured afterwards. They were carrying large quantities of ammunition and may have had sufficient strength to seriously damage the base, even if its defences were likely strong enough to withstand such an attack. <b>Yet,</b> <b>from</b> the earliest Jackson had felt the Viet Cong would have to engage 1 ATF in a major battle if they wished to retain control of Phuoc Tuy, and this interpretation fitted his previous thinking. In dispatching patrols east of Nui Dat following the mortar attack on 16/17 August Jackson seemingly reacted to his opponent's first move, and he may have allowed himself to be shaped into responding as the Viet Cong had intended.|$|E

Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015.

500|$|On {{return to}} Australia the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade. The 1st Battalion was {{subsequently}} based in Ingleburn, New South Wales, and the 2nd Battalion at Puckapunyal, Victoria.

Alan Morrison, {{a former member of}} the regiment, later recalled that for the two battalions that returned to Australia [...] "...the first eighteen months of the regiment's existence were harrowing times".

[...] In an early (1818) history {{of the city of}} Dublin, the writers express awe at the scale of the monument, but are critical of several of its features: its proportions are described as [...] "ponderous", the pedestal as [...] "unsightly" [...] and the column itself as [...] "clumsy". However, the Hibernian Magazine thought the statue was a good likeness of its subject, and that the Pillar's position in the centre of the wide street gave the eye a focal point in what was otherwise [...] "wastes of pavements".|$|E
500|$|The Joshua Tree {{received}} critical acclaim, and {{the best}} reviews of U2's career to that point. Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "For a band that's always specialized in inspirational, larger-than-life gestures—a band utterly determined to be Important—The Joshua Tree could be the big one, and that's precisely what it sounds like." [...] The review described the album's sound as [...] "wed the diverse textures of The Unforgettable Fire to fully formed songs, many of them as aggressive as the hits on War". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe echoed these sentiments in his review, stating, [...] "It's another spiritual progress report, enwrapped in music that strikes a healthy balance between the lushness of their last album, 1984's The Unforgettable Fire, and the more volcanic rock of their early years." [...] Morse called it [...] "their most challenging work to date" [...] and the [...] "most rewarding rock record of the new year". NME praised the album as [...] "a better and braver record than anything else that's likely to appear in 1987... It's the sound of people still trying, still looking..." [...] Thom Duffy of the Orlando Sentinel said the songs have [...] "exultant power" [...] that, [...] "like the Joshua Tree's branches, stretch upward {{in stark contrast to}} their barren musical surroundings on rock radio". He praised the musicianship of the group members, calling Bono's vocals [...] "wrenching", the rhythm section of Mullen and Clayton [...] "razor-sharp", and the Edge's guitar playing [...] "never... better". The New Zealand Herald called The Joshua Tree [...] "the most compelling collection of music <b>yet</b> <b>from</b> a band that has cut its career with passionate, exciting slashes". It judged that the record's [...] "power lies in its restraint" [...] and that there is an [...] "urgency underlying virtually all of the 11 songs".|$|E
