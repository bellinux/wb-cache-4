500|$|When {{discussing}} his hopes for fan {{reaction to the}} second season's emphasis on the Kazon, Piller said: [...] "I'll be curious {{to know what the}} audience's perception is, if our investing in the Kazon this season worked." [...] In response to fans' concerns that Voyager did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous Star Trek installments, he believed that the growing focus on the Kazon would serve as the solution. Piller believed the alien species accentuated the show's futuristic storylines, explaining: [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} who don't consider a lot [...] science fiction." [...] He followed this up by saying: [...] "But certainly <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> case that facing the Kazon in battle is futurist storytelling." [...] Taylor viewed the second season as focused on [...] "character-driven, introspective" [...] stories, with a majority of the [...] "action-adventure" [...] aspects being conducted through the appearances of the Kazon.|$|E

Underwood said that when she heard first the song, she already had ideas of a possible video for it, and {{wanted it to be}} a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. The singer deemed it [...] "a visual song. You listen to it and you can see everything that is happening. It's so dramatic. I'm not a drama person, but when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> movie in song form in three-and-a-half minutes, it's surreal." [...] A sneak peek of the video was released on June 11, 2012. The music video premiered worldwide on July 30, during a 24-hour exclusive window domestically and internationally on E! News at 7 and 11:30p.m. ET/PT and on the homepage of E! Online. Prior to the E! premiere, Underwood held a private screening of the video with country radio station KJ97 for over 200 of their listeners in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{starting}} a book Wodehouse would write {{up to four}} hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that [...] "It's the plots that I find so hard to work out. It takes {{such a long time}} to work one out." [...] He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions. For a novel the note-writing process could take up to two years, and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously. After he had completed his notes, he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words, which ensured plot holes were avoided, and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop. When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that [...] "For a humorous novel you've got to have a scenario, and you've got to test it so that you know where the comedy comes in, where the situations come in... splitting it up into scenes (<b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> scene of almost anything) and have as little stuff in between as possible." [...] He preferred working between 4 and 7pm—but never after dinner—and would work seven days a week. In his younger years, he would write around two to three thousand words a day, although he slowed as he aged, so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand. The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books: when younger he would produce a novel in about three months, while Bachelors Anonymous, published in 1973, took around six months.|$|E

His own constituency effectively deselected him, although he continued to sit for Oldham until the next general election. In {{the months leading up}} to his ultimate change of party from the Conservatives to the Liberals, Churchill made a number of evocative speeches against the principles of Protectionism; 'to think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> man richer by putting on a tax is like a man thinking that he can stand in a bucket and lift himself up by the handle.' [...] As a result of his disagreement with leading members of the Conservative Party over tariff reform, he made the decision to cross the floor. After the Whitsun recess in 1904, he crossed the floor to sit as a member of the Liberal Party.|$|E

We islanders {{might begin to}} feel jealous, {{if we did not}} {{remember}} what a start Poe and Gaboriau gave our neighbours". The review questioned, [...] "whether <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> play out of theoretical analysis. The old melodramas based themselves upon passion: then – shall we say with William Gillette's Sherlock Holmes and Sir Gerald du Maurier's Raffles? – personality usurped its place. A pure problem has not the dramatic force of either. If we do not weary of Poirot shooting questions to left and right, Poirot with uplifted finger expounding his views to a half-circle of listeners, it is because Mr. Charles Laughton, {{with a little help from}} the text, makes a personality out of the fat and sentimental little ratiocinator. His Poirot is an admirable comedy sketch, convincingly gallic." [...] The review stated that Lady Tree had no scope within the part given to her to invest the part of Mrs. Ackroyd with personality but [...] "competence was all that was demanded from her, and from the rest of the cast, and it was generally forthcoming. One actor singled out for praise was Henry Daniell for his [...] "imperturbably natural butler" [...] however his [...] "mystery...was not...analysed enough".|$|E
2500|$|Dance {{competition}} {{had been}} a part of American television for decades before the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, but usually in the form of all-around talent searches, (such as Star Search, Soul Train, or Showtime at the Apollo). [...] However, [...] a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. [...] Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both {{within the context of the}} show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. [...] Series judge Mary Murphy says, for example, [...] "Of course you hope <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living at it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance as much as they can on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer who gets a full scholarship." [...] A number of dance-themed competition shows have been produced for American television since the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, including America's Best Dance Crew, Superstars of Dance, and Live to Dance.|$|E
