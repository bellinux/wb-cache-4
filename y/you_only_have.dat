500|$|To the Australian Daily Telegraph, Gaga {{explained}} that [...] "Paparazzi" [...] was about struggling to balance success and love. Further explanations {{said that the}} song was about trying to win the paparazzi and the media in one's favor. [...] "It's a love song for the cameras, but it's also a love song about fame or love – can you have both, or can <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> one", she concluded. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] was the album's third single in Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom, the fourth in Canada and the United States and the fifth in Australia, France and New Zealand. Although released on July 6, 2009, in the United Kingdom and four days later in Australia, [...] "LoveGame" [...] initially had been planned as the third single release in the former but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial, {{it was decided that}} [...] "Paparazzi" [...] would be released instead.|$|E
500|$|... "The Best Thing" [...] {{received}} favorable {{feedback from}} music critics. Frank Tortorici of MTV News used the track {{to prove that}} Ivy was much different than Schlesinger's other band Fountains of Wayne; he compared the sound to Blondie and called it [...] "bouncy". He also felt that the track would give Apartment Life the much [...] "needed push" [...] in order {{for it to be}} a successful release. In addition to [...] "The Best Thing" [...] (1997) and [...] "You Don't Know Anything" [...] (1999), AllMusic's Rabid called the single one of the [...] "pleasantly produced, precisely structured pop dreams that makes fans sing along" [...] on Apartment Life. An editor at ROCKRGRL felt that given [...] "This Is the Day", Ivy should have [...] "gained more than a moment's attention". Hans Koller and Joyce Grenfell, contributors to The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, considered [...] "This Is the Day" [...] and [...] "Baker" [...] as the two best tracks on Apartment Life. Additionally, a Sputnikmusic member noted in their album review that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> a dollar", the listener should [...] "download th track".|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bowie {{himself was}} quoted in a 1998 {{interview}} as saying [...] "I really did object to the impression that I did not write the songs on The Man Who Sold the World. <b>You</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> {{to check out the}} chord changes. No-one writes chord changes like that". [...] "The Width of a Circle" [...] and [...] "The Supermen", for example, were already in existence before the sessions began.

2500|$|In March 1956, Brel {{performed}} in North Africa, Amsterdam, Lausanne, and throughout Belgium. In July, while visiting Grenoble, he met François Rauber, a classical pianist {{who would become}} his accompanist on future recordings. Rauber {{played a major role}} in providing Brel with the formal musical training he was lacking and was responsible for Brel's musical arrangements. In September Brel recorded [...] "Quand on n'a que l'amour" [...] (When <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> love), which would prove to be his commercial breakthrough. The song was released in November on a Philips 7-inch EP Quand on n'a que l'amour. The song reached number three on the French music charts.|$|E
2500|$|Following the christening an American {{worker at}} the Bath Iron Works {{approached}} {{and asked the}} attending German journalists [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> Nazi heroes back home in Germany?" [...] US newspapers had introduced the namesake as a former Nazi sea hero. Present at the christening was a Bundeswehr helicopter which {{had been used to}} shuttle the official German government visitors around, and it bore the insignia of the Bundeswehr, a variant of the Iron Cross. When US radio reporters caught sight of the helicopter they mistakenly referred to the Iron Cross insignia as a swastika in their reports, thus further adding to the controversy.|$|E

Regarding his world allround title, Davis said, [...] "To me, this is bigger than the Olympics. [...] This medal is prestigious. [...] Not only do you have to skate 500 meters, but you have to skate 10000, you have to skate a 1500 and a 5000 and <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> two days to do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|From January 2002, until {{sometime}} in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to Father's Rights campaigners, {{and it was}} reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. [...] He said, [...] "I am heartbroken. I just cannot believe what happens to people, what is done to them {{in the name of the}} law. <b>You</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> to open your eyes to see what I call the 'Sad Dads on Sundays Syndrome'".

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Kasavin {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the combat system, arguing, [...] "The combat gets to be repetitive after a while. Since <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> direct control over one character, who'll mostly depend on the same basic attacks regardless of which weapons you've equipped, the battles don't feel particularly varied {{from one to the}} next." [...] He concluded, [...] "the PlayStation 2 has delivered an almost countless number of high-quality Japanese role-playing games, so all the past competition is really the main reason why Rogue Galaxy doesn't come off as a stunning accomplishment. On the other hand, though, this is a game that does enough differently or better than most of its PS2 predecessors that it's still well deserving of your consideration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beaver and Wally both attend {{public schools}} and are {{encouraged}} to pursue college educations {{as a means to}} prepare for their futures. Ward and June attended prep school and boarding school, respectively, and both attended college; their sons are expected to do the same. While both boys consider prep-school educations – Wally at the Bellport Military Academy and Beaver at an eastern school called Fallbrook – both remain at home and attend Mayfield High with their friends. School and homework are the bane of Beaver's existence. In [...] "Beaver's Secret Life", the boy decides to become a writer in adulthood because [...] "you don't {{have to go to school}} or know nothing ... <b>You</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> to make up adventures and get paid for it." [...] Beaver's attitude toward education provides comic counterpoint to the backgrounds, values and ambitions of his parents.|$|E

2500|$|In 1972 Brel {{signed a}} special 30-year {{contract}} with Barclay Records. Although {{there were no}} new songs to record, Barclay persuaded {{him to return to}} the studio to re-record 11 of the better-known songs he cut for Philips Records {{during the early years of}} his music career. The result was the album Ne me quitte pas (Don't leave me), which contained the title track, [...] "Marieke", [...] "Les Flamandes" [...] (Flemish women), [...] "Quand on n'a que l'amour" [...] (When <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> love), [...] "Les Biches" [...] (The does), [...] "Le Moribond" [...] (The dying man), [...] "La Valse à mille temps" [...] (The waltz in thousand time), and [...] "Je ne sais pas" [...] (I don't know).

2500|$|In 2010, Gifted, a {{novel by}} New Zealand {{academic}} and former Frame biographer Patrick Evans, was published and subsequently shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. The story is a fictionalised account {{of the relationship between}} Janet Frame and Frank Sargeson during her time living as a guest on his Takapuna property in 1955–56 – an era recounted in a number of works by Frame and her contemporaries and dramatised in Campion's film, An Angel At My Table (1990). In 2013, Evans' novel was adapted for the stage, premiering at the Christchurch Arts Festival on 22 August 2013, followed by extended tour of New Zealand's north and south islands. While garnering positive critical reviews, the promotion and staging of the production drew fierce criticism from Frame's literary executor and niece, Pamela Gordon, who maintained it [...] "was designed to demean Frame." [...] Gordon, who has also criticised Campion's film for inaccuracies in its portrayal of Frame, asserted that Evans' theatrical adaptation presented an unfaithful view of her famous relative. Festival organiser Philip Tremewan, defended the play, while director Conrad Newport maintained that Gordon was [...] "overprotective of [...] legacy." [...] Evans generally avoided the controversy, stating, [...] "I have publicised her work and popularised it for two to three generations of students. In Gifted, the play and novel, <b>you</b> <b>only</b> <b>have</b> to look at the title to see what my attitude is. I really don't think I have anything to apologise for." ...|$|E
