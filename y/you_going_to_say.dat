60|$|WILLIE. Didn't you, though?--Come, speak up, {{let us have}} it. The {{more the}} merrier. <b>You</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something.|$|R
6000|$|Clary {{knew that}} when she was called Clarissa by her sister {{something}} special was meant. [...] "What is it?" [...] she asked. [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> now?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Crying {{their eyes}} out," [...] said the doctor, wistfully; [...] "but they’ll dry them {{precious}} quick {{when we get}} back, and ask all sorts of questions. What are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Harry?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. Always in my pocket, <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I know <b>you</b> are; but you {{are always}} {{thinking}} away from me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed. <b>You</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I {{must have}} heard your criticisms in the train. You were very lenient, I thought." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you wish}} to speak to me," [...] said the other, trying in vain to conceal a trace of anxiety in his voice, [...] "it’s my duty to listen. What were <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you’ll {{look after}} your dooty, George, instead o’ interferin’ in matters that don’t concern you," [...] said the skipper in a choking voice, [...] "I shall be obliged. Now, then, you boy, what were <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I was like?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, proceed; you've {{interrupted}} yourself {{twice in}} what <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Perhaps it'll come {{out if you}} try it a third time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Tipping, scathingly, [...] "and {{you might}} as well talk about that as anything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right, lad; we {{all hope}} most {{sincerely}} {{that there will be}} no occasion for its provisions to be carried out, but it is always best that a man should get these things off his mind. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to us tonight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But style, but style!" [...] {{they might}} return. [...] "What about style? That {{was one of}} the miracles we asked you the sleight of, and are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing about that?

6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] said Otto. [...] "There's {{a little}} fly {{that has made}} up its mind to go into my nose.

6000|$|He joined her, {{and walked}} beside her. [...] "Well, Cynthy, what are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to me? I'm off for Cambridge again to-morrow morning, and I suppose we've got to {{understand}} each other. I came up here to put myself in your hands, to keep or to throw away, just as you please. Well? Have you thought about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] Sophy declared. [...] "If he is good, he {{can prove}} it and know it here. He will come {{to know the truth}} about himself. Besides, it isn't {{everything}} to possess the standard virtues. Louise, he will be here in a minute. You want to be left alone with him. What are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> when he asks you what you know he will ask you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{depends upon}} {{what else you}} say. Look here, now, Eunice!" [...] Dan said, with a {{laughing}} mixture of fun and earnest, [...] "what are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to mother? It's no use, being disagreeable, is it? Of course, I don't contend for ideal perfection anywhere, and I don't expect it. But there isn't anything experimental about this thing, and don't you think we had better all {{make the best of}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the {{meantime}} I’m {{living on the}} Wheelers," [...] said the girl, pressing her lips together; [...] "that was what <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> wasn’t it?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Leggett {{joined the}} Budokwai in London in 1932, {{training}} primarily under Yukio Tani, {{who would have}} a profound influence on the young man. Biographers Anthony Dunne and Richard Bowen (2003) relate that on one occasion, Leggett [...] "looked in at the Budokwai, but, feeling a bit off colour and deciding not to train, walked away. He met Tani who asked where he was going. Responding to the five feet three-inch Tani, Leggett said, 'Well, you know, I thought I'd give the training a miss tonight. I'm a bit off colour and a rest will do me good.' 'Now, Leggett San, if a man with evil intent rushes up {{to you in the}} street with a hammer, what are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> I'm sorry but I don't feel too good. Can you attack me next week?' Leggett turned on his heel {{and went back to the}} Budokwai. It was incidents of this nature, and there were a number, which made a major contribution to his steely self-control and determination" [...] (p. 325).|$|E
5000|$|Various {{media outlets}} {{initially}} characterised {{the issue as}} girlish rivalry but later blamed it on bullying and racism. As time progressed, the majority of media coverage of Jade became negative, although accusations of racism were superseded by those of bullying. An editorial published by The Daily Mirror on 18 January 2007 called Beauty v Bigot, deplored what they referred to as [...] "disgraceful racist bullying of Big Brothers Shilpa Shetty", and criticised Channel 4 management for maintaining {{that there was not}} a racial element to the bullying. The British tabloids mostly concentrated on the comments made by Jade, rather than those made by Jack, Danielle, and Jo and the bullying from them. For instance, when Jade and Shilpa were arguing over Oxo cubes, Shilpa pleaded with Jo for assistance by saying [...] "Jo, I mean, are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something here what is happening here?" [...] - to which Jo responded by bursting out laughing. Jermaine Jackson, another housemate witnessing the situation, later said, [...] "When all this was going on I saw Danielle and Jo laughing and then branded them as the allies".|$|E
5000|$|An amateur musician, {{the writer}} {{returned}} {{to the subject of}} music, and his life-long passion for folk music in particular, to write the biography of Bob Dylan {{on the occasion of the}} folk rock idol's seventieth birthday. Published in 2011 it was the first of Epstein's books to reach an extensive international audience, in editions published in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, and other languages. Since then he has been researching and writing a book about Benjamin Franklin's relationship with his son William, the last royal governor of New Jersey. Patriots and Renegades: The War in Ben Franklin's House is scheduled for publication in 2016. [...] Dawn to Twilight: New and Selected Poems will be published in the autumn of 2015. In an interview with Mara Meisel of the Pittsburgh Press in 1984 Epstein said: “I still have doubts about how permanent my poetry is going to be. But I always had confidence that poetry was the most important thing in my life…No great poet has not had an extraordinary command of the language, all of history and the manners and morals of his age. How are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something that’s going to be significant to people if you aren’t well-grounded in history and in a broad sense of human nature?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} how you see things. I thought <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> would marry me!" [...] Benyon rejoined, standing there still, though the dray had passed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know what}} <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> mother. I don't boast that I possess all these things; but I do say that I will {{endeavour}} to obtain them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Miss Nugent; [...] "but that isn't what <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>You</b> {{need not}} worry about me; I shall not do {{anything}} that would displease you." ...|$|R
