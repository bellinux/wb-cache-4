40|$|Abstract: In Bangladesh, jute mills are {{producing}} conventional yarns heavier than 275 tex. These {{are used as}} hessian, sacking, carpet backing cloth etc. For diversified uses <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> it is most essential to produce medium count <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> 241 to 275 tex. In this regard, slip draft spinning machine has been studied. This machine is capable to produce <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> 241 to 280 tex at flyer speed of 2900 rpm to 4850 rpm. But there is a relation between flyer speed and <b>yarn</b> breakages <b>of</b> the machine. In addition spinning efficiency of the machine also depends on the yarn breakages. Through a series of experiment, a relation has been established between flyer speed and <b>yarn</b> breakages <b>of</b> the experimental machine for production <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> <b>yarn...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fabrics were {{prepared}} by plain weaving with the blended <b>yarns</b> made <b>of</b> sulphonated <b>jute</b> fibre in different combination with cotton, rayon, acrylic, polyester and silk waste.

The dye ability of this blended fabrics was studied using a basic dye (Rhodamine-B red) and reactive dye (Procion-M red). The dye absorption <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> increases from 68 to 88 % as it was sulphonated and the sulphonated jute blended fabrics took up almost the same of amount of dyes which was around 70 % from both dye-bath, indicating that the accessibility of blended fabric samples to the dye molecules was practically the same. The colour shades on different fabric sample were almost similar in compare with dyed cotton fabrics. The colour fastness of the blended fabrics were also closed to the cotton fabrics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spindle {{speed is}} an {{important}} parameter for the production <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> [1]. An Apron Draft spinning frame was modified in to ring system by incorporating rings and travelers instead of flyers. The experiments were performed for investigating the effect of spindle speed on textile properties and productivity <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> 103 tex. The spindle speed was varied from 5000 rpm to 9000 rpm. The experiments were performed with Bangla White B (BWB) grade <b>jute</b> sliver <b>of</b> finisher drawing of linear density 2415 tex (70 lb/spy). The draft ratio and the twist used in the experiments were 23 and 240 tpm (turns per meter) respectively. The ring size was KW (4) 76 mm Ø. Steel travelers number 1, Type G, semicircular in shape {{were used in the}} experiment. Ten runs were performed for the experiment at the standard atmospheric condition, 20 + 2 ˚C, and relative humidity 65 % + 2 %. The nominal count <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> produced was 103 tex. The yarns produced through the experiments were tested for different textile properties. Analysis of the test results shows that the spindle speed greatly influences the textile properties, such as strength, elongation, yarn breakage, productivity, quality ratio etc. <b>of</b> produced <b>yarn.</b> In consideration <b>of</b> the productivity, quality and other textile properties <b>of</b> the <b>yarn,</b> the optimum spindle speed was determined for the production <b>of</b> fine <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> 103 tex...|$|R
30|$|In the {{experimental}} investigations {{conducted in the}} study, it was found that, the addition <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> contributes enriched results for mechanical properties of concrete composites for a particular yarn length and yarn content. More specifically, compressive, flexural, and tensile strength are found to enhance significantly for volume content of 0.1 and 0.25  % and the <b>yarn</b> cut length <b>of</b> 10 and 15  mm. However, with larger yarn length and content the mechanical properties were found to affect adversely. Finally the jute yarn shows the positive contribution to minimize irregular mixing disabilities of concrete composites that creates major problem regarding fibre reinforcement. So JYRCC can be developed with locally fabricated jute yarn in Bangladesh. The least cost <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> <b>yarn,</b> its being renewable resources, the reduced weight of the JYRCC and the environmental compatibility would clearly show the socioeconomic viability of JYRCC. This diversified use <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> may redeem the lost glory <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> in Bangladesh.|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the effect <b>of</b> introducing <b>jute</b> <b>yarn</b> on the mechanical properties <b>of</b> concrete. <b>Jute</b> fibre is produced abundantly in Bangladesh and hence, very cheap.

The treatment <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> with chitosan can appreciably enhance the uptake of dye by the fiber. Moreover, the color fastness property of dyed fabrics against washing and rubbing also exhibits within the acceptable range of good to excellent. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activities <b>of</b> <b>jute</b> fabric increase significantly due to the combined effect of natural dye henna and biopolymer chitosan.
