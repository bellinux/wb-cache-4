After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in Abner waned, and this showed in the strip itself," [...] according to Don Markstein's Toonopedia. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been {{the best he could}} manage due to declining health. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of humor about your strip—and I had a sense of humor about mine—you knew that for three or four years Abner was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have," [...] he admitted, adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. [...] "When he retired Li'l Abner, newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. People magazine ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free New York Times devoted nearly a full page to the event," [...] wrote publisher Denis Kitchen.|$|E

6000|$|... "It isn't easy {{to answer}} bluntly, and if I threw out any {{delicate}} suggestions, they'd probably be wasted. You saw {{a good deal}} of Flora Grant, and if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> recognized what kind of girl she is." ...|$|R

"If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of decency," [...] she said--"I {{say nothing}} {{of a sense of}} honor--you will leave this house, and your {{acquaintance}} with that lady will end here. Spare me your protests and excuses; I can place but one interpretation on what I saw when I opened that door." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pratt cut her short. [...] "I {{begin to}} understand. You'd better {{not let him}} mix in here--he's too young and too good-looking to conduct {{experiments}} of this kind with your girl. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense,</b> Clarke, you'd see that for yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|SHE. Oh, {{of course}} I'm afraid. So {{would you be}} if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> common <b>sense.</b> [She goes to the hearth, turning her back to him, and puts one tapping foot on the fender].|$|R
60|$|ARJILLAX. Skilful! You high-nosed idiot, I {{could turn}} such things {{out by the}} score with my eyes bandaged and one hand tied behind me. But what use would they be? They would bore me; and they would bore <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense.</b> Go in and look at my busts. Look at them again and yet again until you receive the full {{impression}} of the intensity of mind that is stamped on them; {{and then go back}} to the pretty-pretty confectionery you call sculpture, and see whether you can endure its vapid emptiness. [He mounts the altar impetuously] Listen to me, all of you; and do you, Ecrasia, be silent if you are capable of silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neale, you can't prove anything," [...] sneered Coffee. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> you'll shut up. I {{tell you}} {{this is only a}} LITTLE deal.

6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Stella {{answered}} coldly. [...] "I am at home here, and I mean to stay {{so long as}} I choose. It is you who are the intruder. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> at all, {{you will}} go away and play with your dolls.

If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> at all, you'd understand {{that the only thing}} worth doing in life is to get married. You bone-headed bachelors make me sick. Think what it would mean to <b>you,</b> <b>having</b> a wife. Think of going out on a cold winter's night to crack a crib, knowing {{that there would be a}} cup of hot soup waiting for you when you got back, and your slippers all warmed and comfortable. And then she'd sit on your knee, and you'd tell her how you shot the policeman, and you'd examine the swag together--! Why, I can't imagine anything cozier. Perhaps there would be little Spikes running about the house. Can't you see them jumping with joy as you slid in through the window, and told the great news? 'Fahzer's killed a pleeceman!' cry the tiny, eager voices. Candy is served out all round in honor of the event. Golden-haired little Jimmy Mullins, my god-son, gets a dime for having thrown a stone at a plain-clothes detective that afternoon. All is joy and wholesome revelry. Take my word for it, Spike, there's nothing like domesticity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly as {{it looked}} when I first came in," [...] I answered. [...] "I don't doubt the {{position}} you have gained in the town, and I don't wish to assail it even if I could. I came here because Sir Percival Glyde is, to my certain knowledge, your enemy, as well as mine. If I have a grudge against him, you have a grudge against him too. You may deny it if you like, you may distrust {{me as much as}} you please, you may be as angry as you will--but, of all the women in England, you, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of injury, are the woman who ought to help me to crush that man." ...|$|E

We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, whatever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cesspool.

6000|$|... "Mr. Kenton!" [...] she gasped, and she trembled {{in fear of}} him, {{even while}} she kept herself with {{difficulty}} from shaking him for his folly. [...] "Don't say such a thing! Can't you see {{that they want to}} talk it over? If he hasn't spoken to you it's because he wants to know how you took what she said." [...] Seeing the effect of these arguments, she pursued: [...] "Will <b>you</b> never <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense?</b> I will speak to Ellen the very minute I get her alone, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> just got to wait. Don't you suppose it's hard for me, too? Have I got nothing to bear?" ...|$|R
500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do it any other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Hosokawa {{made several}} {{unprecedented}} moves toward atonement with Japan's Asian neighbors during his term as prime minister. In his first {{news conference in}} office, he made an unprecedented statement acknowledging that Japan waged a war of aggression in World War II. He later said: [...] "You can obviously define 'aggression' {{in any number of}} ways, depending on context. But if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> common <b>sense,</b> <b>you</b> just cannot say in good conscience that Japan was not the aggressor when Japan did in fact cause tremendous anguish and loss of life in China, Korea and Southeast Asian nations in order to protect its own interests.

5000|$|... "'What's up Doc?' is a {{very simple}} thing. It's only funny because it's in a situation. It was an all Bugs Bunny line. It wasn't funny. If {{you put it in}} human terms; you come home late one night from work, you walk up to the gate in the yard, you walk through the gate and up into the front room, the door is partly open and there's some guy {{shooting}} under your living room. So what do you do? You run if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense,</b> the least you can do is call the cops. But what if you come up and tap him on the shoulder and look over and say 'What's up Doc?' You're interested in what he's doing. That's ridiculous. That's not what you say at a time like that. So that's why it's funny, I think. In other words it's asking a perfectly legitimate question in a perfectly illogical situation." [...] —Chuck Jones on Bugs Bunny's catchphrase [...] "What's up Doc?" [...] The carrot-chewing scenes are generally followed by Bugs' most well-known catchphrase, [...] "What's up, Doc?", which was written by director Tex Avery for his first Bugs Bunny film, A Wild Hare (1940). Avery explained later that it was a common expression in his native Texas and that he did not think much of the phrase. When the cartoon was first screened in theaters, the [...] "What's up, Doc?" [...] scene generated a tremendously positive audience reaction. As a result, the scene became a recurring element in subsequent cartoons. The phrase was sometimes modified for a situation. For example, Bugs says [...] "What's up, dogs?" [...] to the antagonists in A Hare Grows in Manhattan, [...] "What's up, Duke?" [...] to the knight in Knight-mare Hare, and [...] "What's up, prune-face?" [...] to the aged Elmer in The Old Grey Hare. He might also greet Daffy with [...] "What's up, Duck?" [...] He used one variation, [...] "What's all the hub-bub, bub?" [...] only once, in Falling Hare. Another variation is used in Looney Tunes: Back in Action when he greets a blaster-wielding Marvin the Martian saying [...] "What's up, Darth?" ...|$|E
40|$|Definition: The {{therapist}} repairs a rupture in {{the therapeutic}} {{alliance with the}} patient by using one or more different procedures. In confrontation ruptures the patient shows problems in the alliance by expressing hostility or criticism toward the therapist. In withdrawal ruptures the patient manifests alliance problems by withdrawing from the therapeutic process or by deferring or expressing negative feelings indirectly. Elements: a) The therapist senses a rupture in the therapeutic alliance, b) draws it to the patient’s attention (e. g. ‘I sense a feeling of tension in our relationship right now. Do you feel the same?’), c) explores the patient’s experience of the rupture (‘Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of what you’re experiencing right now?’), and d) tries to resolve the rupture in different ways such as 1) clarifying any misunderstanding, 2) reiterating the therapeutic rationale (`Exploring that’s going on {{between you and me}} may help us understand what’s going on in your relationship with other people’) in order to strengthen the alliance, 3) empathizing with the patient’s experience, 4) accepting responsibility for his/her own contribution to the rupture, 4) responding non-defensively to the patient’s concern, 5) collaborating with the patient to try to establish a shared perspective on what is taking place in the relationship (‘We’re both feeling criticized and trying to blame the other person for what’s taking place between us’). Related procedures: Transference interpretation, addressing empathic failures. Application: This therapeutic principle is relevant to a range of different therapeutic modalities. ...|$|E
