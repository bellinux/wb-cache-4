2500|$|Oates's novel them (1969) won the 1970 National Book Award for Fiction. It {{is set in}} Detroit {{during a}} time span from the 1930s to the 1960s, {{most of it in}} black ghetto neighborhoods, and deals openly with crime, drugs, and racial/class conflicts. Again, some of the key {{characters}} and events were based on real people whom Oates had known or heard of during her years in the city. Since then she has published an average of two books a year. Frequent topics in her work include rural poverty, sexual abuse, class tensions, desire for power, female childhood and adolescence, and occasionally the supernatural. Violence is a constant in her work, even leading Oates to have written an essay in response to the question, [...] "Why Is <b>Your</b> <b>Writing</b> So Violent?" [...] In 1990 she discussed her novel, Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart, which also deals with themes of racial tension, and described [...] "the experience of writing [...] " [...] as [...] "so intense it seemed almost electric". She is a fan of poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, describing Plath's sole novel The Bell Jar as a [...] "near perfect work of art", but though Oates has often been compared to Plath, she disavows Plath's romanticism about suicide, and among her characters, she favors cunning, hardy survivors, both women and men. In the early 1980s, Oates began writing stories in the Gothic and horror genres; in her foray into these genres, Oates said she was [...] "deeply influenced" [...] by Kafka and felt [...] "a writerly kinship" [...] with James Joyce.|$|E
