50|$|There {{have been}} several studies done on the habitat of the vole, given its very {{specific}} requirements, {{to find out if}} grazing or precipitation levels affect the vole populations so that we can protect them. It has been found that higher precipitation levels create increased availability of usable habitat for water voles. In years of that are wetter than usual it has been observed that <b>young</b> <b>water</b> voles become reproductively active sooner, and therefore can have more offspring. The mean number of pups in each litter increased as well. It has also been found that grazing affects the water vole populations as well. In areas of light or moderate grazing not as many young survived, and the population sizes tended to be much smaller than other colonies. Where there was severe grazing it affected the stream bank to an extent that it was no longer a suitable habitat. The presence of livestock presents numerous detrimental changes to the water vole’s habitat: altered abiotic characteristics, compacted soil, increased runoff, fractured stream banks, erosion, as well as loss of vegetation as protective cover and a food source. The abundance of ferns, mosses and shrubs are imperative as ground cover to protect water voles from predation, and in areas of grazing these plants were scarce or non-existent, and therefore water voles weren't often found in these areas.|$|E

The results obtained demonstrated that the entire water column of the Gulf of Elat was saturated with an excess of anthropogenic COz, indicating winter overtuming. In the Red Sea, the upper 200 rn are very young with a very uniform excess carbon dioxide signal close to zero (0 ± 7 J. Lmol kg- 1). The dL CO ~ values (the signal of anthropogenic COz penetration, after reaching maximum negative values ca. - 28 ± 5 j. lmol kg- 1 at 600 ± 100 rn, increase and remain almost constant at ca. - 15 ± 6 j. liDOl kg- 1 from 800 to 1 500 m. The increase of dL CO ~ values below 600 ± 100 rn in the northem Red Sea was explained by the influence of the overflow of <b>younger</b> <b>waters</b> from the Gulf of Elat over the sill in the Strait of Tiran ·and by the inflow of <b>young</b> <b>waters</b> from the Gulf of Suez.

40|$|Methods for {{estimating}} mean transit {{times from}} chemical or isotopic tracers (such as Cl −, δ 18 O, or δ 2 H) commonly assume that catchments are stationary (i. e., time-invariant) and homogeneous. Real catchments are neither. In a companion paper, I showed that catchment mean transit times estimated from seasonal tracer cycles are highly vulnerable to aggregation error, exhibiting strong bias and large scatter in spatially heterogeneous catchments. I proposed the <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fraction, which is virtually immune to aggregation error under spatial heterogeneity, as a better measure of transit times. Here I extend this analysis by exploring how nonstationarity affects mean transit times and <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fractions estimated from seasonal tracer cycles, using benchmark tests {{based on a}} simple two-box model. The model exhibits complex nonstationary behavior, with striking volatility in tracer concentrations, <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fractions, and mean transit times, driven by rapid shifts in the mixing ratios of fluxes from {{the upper and lower}} boxes. The transit-time distribution in streamflow becomes increasingly skewed at higher discharges, with marked increases in the <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fraction and decreases in the mean water age, reflecting the increased dominance of the upper box at higher flows. This simple two-box model exhibits strong equifinality, which can be partly resolved by simple parameter transformations. However, transit times are primarily determined by residual storage, which cannot be constrained through hydrograph calibration and must instead be estimated by tracer behavior. Seasonal tracer cycles in the two-box model are very poor predictors of mean transit times, with typical errors of several hundred percent. However, the same tracer cycles predict time-averaged <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fractions (F yw) within a few percent, even in model catchments that are both nonstationary and spatially heterogeneous (although they may be biased by roughly 0. 1 – 0. 2 at sites where strong precipitation seasonality is correlated with precipitation tracer concentrations). Flow-weighted fits to the seasonal tracer cycles accurately predict the flow-weighted average F yw in streamflow, while unweighted fits to the seasonal tracer cycles accurately predict the unweighted average F yw. <b>Young</b> <b>water</b> fractions can also be estimated separately for individual flow regimes, again with a precision of a few percent, allowing direct determination of how shifts in a catchment's hydraulic regime alter the fraction of water reaching the stream by fast flowpaths. One can also estimate the chemical composition of idealized "young water" and "old water" end-members, using relationships between <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fractions and solute concentrations across different flow regimes. These results demonstrate that mean transit times cannot be estimated reliably from seasonal tracer cycles and that, by contrast, the <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fraction is a robust and useful metric of transit times, even in catchments that exhibit strong nonstationarity and heterogeneity...|$|E

If the old fraction is free of CFCs, and no other processes affect their concentrations other than air–water equilibrium, the ratio CFC- 113 /CFC- 12 may be proved useful in dating mixtures of young and old water.

40|$|Environmental {{heterogeneity}} is ubiquitous, but environmental {{systems are}} often analyzed {{as if they}} were homogeneous instead, resulting in aggregation errors that are rarely explored and almost never quantified. Here I use simple benchmark tests to explore this general problem in one specific context: the use of seasonal cycles in chemical or isotopic tracers (such as Cl −, δ 18 O, or δ 2 H) to estimate timescales of storage in catchments. Timescales of catchment storage are typically quantified by the mean transit time, meaning the average time that elapses between parcels of water entering as precipitation and leaving again as streamflow. Longer mean transit times imply greater damping of seasonal tracer cycles. Thus, the amplitudes of tracer cycles in precipitation and streamflow are commonly used to calculate catchment mean transit times. Here I show that these calculations will typically be wrong by several hundred percent, when applied to catchments with realistic degrees of spatial heterogeneity. This aggregation bias arises from the strong nonlinearity in the relationship between tracer cycle amplitude and mean travel time. I propose an alternative storage metric, the <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fraction in streamflow, defined as the fraction of runoff with transit times of less than roughly 0. 2  years. I show that this <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fraction (not to be confused with event-based "new water" in hydrograph separations) is accurately predicted by seasonal tracer cycles within a precision of a few percent, across the entire range of mean transit times from almost zero to almost infinity. Importantly, this relationship is also virtually free from aggregation error. That is, seasonal tracer cycles also accurately predict the <b>young</b> <b>water</b> fraction in runoff from highly heterogeneous mixtures of subcatchments with strongly contrasting transit-time distributions. Thus, although tracer cycle amplitudes yield biased and unreliable estimates of catchment mean travel times in heterogeneous catchments, they can be used to reliably estimate the fraction of <b>young</b> <b>water</b> in runoff...|$|E
