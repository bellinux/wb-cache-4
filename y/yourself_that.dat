It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

500|$|Elysa Gardner from USA Today advised {{people who}} buy the album to skip the song. In his {{negative}} review for the album, Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine {{found it difficult to}} think of a song more unrefined or more irritating than [...] "Peacock". He believed all reviews of Teenage Dream will discuss the track, which will be because it is [...] "potentially historic in its badness, to the point that, once you've heard it, you too will have to describe it to other people just to convince <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> it really exists." [...] Spin magazine writer Mikael Wood remarked that the song contains a double entendre that even a performer such as Kesha could find crude.|$|E
500|$|Steinitz rated Anderssen {{as one of}} the two {{greatest}} attacking {{players of}} his time: [...] "We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king’s-side attack, and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough." [...] Although Anderssen is regarded {{as a member of the}} [...] "heroic" [...] attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: [...] "Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> you can derive immediate advantage by an attack", a principle more recently labelled [...] "Makogonov's rule". According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.|$|E

After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked so hard for this for so long."

500|$|René Pérez Joglar, who {{performs}} {{as the lead}} singer of Puerto Rican alternative hip hop band {{under the name of}} Residente, appears as a featured artist on the track [...] "Gordita". He explained the conception of the song, in which he raps about the fact that [...] "he liked Shakira better when — early in her career: she was chubbier, had dark hair and was a rock chick", by saying that [...] "I told her (Shakira) {{it was a good idea}} to make fun of <b>yourself.</b> <b>That</b> way the haters can't say anything, because you already said it". British rapper Dizzee Rascal appears as a featured artist on the English version of [...] "Loca". He said that he felt [...] "honoured" [...] that Shakira chose him for the song, by saying that [...] "She's a bit of a trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale. You'd expect her to use an American rapper (for the song), but she chose me. It meant a lot".|$|E
500|$|Although Gordon's lyrics on Experimental Jet Set {{addressed}} {{gender roles}} and stereotypes, her contributions to Washing Machine were considered more feminine and girl-oriented. Tom Moon of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "The title track is an odd, earnest love song; 'Panty Lies' is a playground taunt blown to absurd extremes; and ' Trouble Girl', the Spector sendup, is a dramatic, earnest coming-of-age story". The latter {{was described by}} David Browne of Entertainment Weekly as [...] "a teen-pregnancy lullaby" [...] and features vocals by Gordon and Kim Deal (of Pixies and the Breeders) along with other musicians. Gordon felt that Deal had an ideal voice for the melodic part and explained that the song was about [...] "wanting to be seen for who you really are, being able to express those parts of <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> aren't 'good girl' but that are just as real and true". Ranaldo contributed to two songs, [...] "Saucer-Like" [...] and [...] "Skip Tracer". The latter was co-written with Ranaldo's wife Leah Singer and inspired by a performance that the couple attended of riot grrrl duo Mecca Normal. The song alludes to the band's special relationship with the major labels.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what people {{would want to do}} in order to survive. We explored different ideas, and one of them was fashioning weapons to defend <b>yourself.</b> <b>That</b> was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E
500|$|The judge heard out the owners; after expressing initial reluctance, he {{took the}} job for seven years at a salary of $50,000, on {{condition}} he could remain on the federal bench. During Landis's time serving as both judge and commissioner, he allowed a $7,500 reduction in his salary as commissioner, to reflect his pay as judge. The appointment of Landis was met with acclaim in the press. [...] A tentative agreement was signed by the parties a month later—an agreement which itemized Landis's powers over baseball, and which was drafted by the judge. [...] The owners were {{still reeling from the}} perception that baseball was crooked, and accepted the agreement virtually without dissent. [...] Under the terms of the contract, Landis could not be dismissed by the team owners, have his pay reduced, or even be criticized by them in public. He also had nearly unlimited authority over every person employed in the major or minor leagues, from owners to batboys. [...] The owners waived any recourse to the courts to contest Landis's will. Humorist Will Rogers stated, [...] "on't kid <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> that old judicial bird isn't going to make those baseball birds walk the chalkline". [...] Player and manager Leo Durocher later stated, [...] "The legend has been spread that the owners hired the Judge off the federal bench. Don't you believe it. They got him right out of Dickens." ...|$|E
500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what you see {{and to be able to}} apply that to music".|$|E

The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can teach you how to hit, but not a lot of people can teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E
