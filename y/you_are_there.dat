25|$|A {{few years}} after Miró’s 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he {{finished}} a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents’ summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce’s Ulysses and described it by saying, “It has in it all that you feel about Spain when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> and all that {{you feel when you}} are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.” Miró annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Miró’s first works classified as Surrealist, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and The Tilled Field, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade.|$|E

In a later interview with Den of Geek, Nygard found that [...] "television episodes are {{the domain of the}} writer-producers. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> to service their vision. The Office is fully scripted, but there's always a little room to play when it's warranted. The first cuts are around 45 minutes, so you often have to cut the episodes in half for air." [...] Though [...] "Grief Counseling" [...] broadcast before the fifth episode, [...] "Initiation", its filming took place after that episode due to the availability of shooting on Dwight's fictional beet farm.|$|E
500|$|Chopin's successes as a {{composer}} and performer {{opened the door}} to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, [...] "into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever." [...] With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria again, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, [...] "I curse the moment of my departure." [...] When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: [...] "Oh God!... <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> and yet you do not take vengeance!" [...] Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing [...] "into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 24, 1953, Steiger {{played the}} title role in Paddy Chayefsky's [...] "Marty" [...] episode of the Goodyear Television Playhouse. The role had {{originally}} been intended for Martin Ritt, who later became a director. [...] "Marty" [...] {{is the story of}} a lonely and homely butcher from the Bronx in search of love. The play was a critical success that increased Steiger's public exposure; Tom Stempel noted that he brought [...] "striking intensity to his performance as Marty, particularly in giving us Marty's pain". As Steiger refused to sign a seven-year studio contract, he was replaced with Ernest Borgnine in the film Marty (1955), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as the Best Actor Oscar for Borgnine. 1953 proved to be Steiger's breakthrough year; he garnered Sylvania Awards for Marty and four other best performances of the year—as Vishinsky and Rudolph Hess in two episodes of <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>There,</b> as gangster Dutch Schultz in a thriller, and as a radar operator in My Brother's Keeper.|$|E

He said, [...] "The 3D intensifies Titanic. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>there.</b> Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns {{its place in the}} movie time capsule." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, [...] "For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive." [...] Richard Corliss of Time who was very critical in 1997 remained in the same mood, [...] "I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged." [...] In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the [...] "careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels." [...] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking [...] "whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't." [...] She further added that the [...] "3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition." ...|$|E
500|$|Steiger's early roles, {{although}} minor, were numerous, {{especially in}} television series {{during the early}} 1950s, when he appeared in more than 250 live television productions over a five-year period. He was spotted by Fred Coe, NBC's manager of program development, who increasingly gave him bigger parts. Steiger considered television to be what repertory theatre had been for an earlier generation, and {{saw it as a}} place where he could test his talent with a plethora of different roles. Soon afterward he began receiving positive reviews from critics such as John Crosby, who noted that Steiger regularly gave [...] "effortless persuasive performances". Among Steiger's credits were Danger (1950–53), Lux Video Theatre (1951), Out There (1951), Tales of Tomorrow (1952–53), The Gulf Playhouse (1953), Medallion Theatre (1953), Goodyear Television Playhouse (1953), and as Shakespeare's Romeo in [...] "The First Command Performance of Romeo and Juliet (1957)" [...] episode of <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>There</b> in 1954, under director Sidney Lumet. He continued to make appearances in various playhouse television productions, appearing in five episodes of Kraft Theatre (1952–54), which earned him praise from critics, six episodes of The Philco Television Playhouse (1951–55) and two episodes of Schlitz Playhouse of Stars (1957–58). Steiger made his big screen debut in 1953, with a small role in Fred Zinnemann's Teresa, shot in 1951. Steiger, who described himself as [...] "cocky", won over Zinnemann by praising his direction. Zinnemann recalled that Steiger was [...] "very popular, extremely articulate and full of remarkable memories", and the two remained highly respectful of each other for life.|$|E

It's like, “If I go crazy, will you still call me Superman?” It's asking, “If I'm down, will <b>you</b> still <b>be</b> <b>there</b> for me?” But at the same time, “If I'm alive and well, will <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> holding my hand?” That's kind of asking, “If I'm doing good, will <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> for me? Will <b>you</b> not <b>be</b> jealous of me?” That's the basic question that song's asking, and maybe throughout the years of singing that song, I might have come up with more meanings for it than it actually might have originally had." ...|$|R

2500|$|After {{these three}} novels, Beckett {{struggled}} {{for many years}} to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief [...] "stories" [...] later collected as Texts for Nothing. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, Comment c'est (1961; How It Is. An early variant version of Comment c'est, L'Image, was published in the British arts review, [...] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching telegraphese: [...] "You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> no more alive no more than again <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark" [...] Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. How It Is is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.|$|E
2500|$|About the performance-capture process Singer stated, [...] "It's fascinating... It {{takes you}} back to play-acting as a kid {{in your living room}} because you are running around and having to imagine that you are in Gantua and imagine that there are these weapons and all these giant things. But there's nothing when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> other than {{styrofoam}} and blocks. It forces the actors to regress to when they would play-act as kids or do minimalist theatre. But in that way it's fascinating - I can see why Robert Zemeckis and James Cameron have started to shoot pictures this way".|$|E
2500|$|Lumet {{began his}} career as a {{director}} with Off-Broadway productions and then evolved into a highly respected TV director. After working off-Broadway and in summer-stock, he began directing television in 1950, after working as an assistant to friend and then-director Yul Brynner. He soon developed a [...] "lightning quick" [...] method for shooting due to the high turnover required by television. As a result, while working for CBS he directed hundreds of episodes of Danger (1950–55), Mama (1949–57), and <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>There</b> (1953–57), a weekly series which co-starred Walter Cronkite in one of his earliest leading roles. He chose Cronkite for the role of anchorman [...] "because the premise of the show was so silly, was so outrageous, that we needed somebody with the most American, homespun, warm ease about him," [...] Lumet said.|$|E
