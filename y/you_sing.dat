25|$|Jules Ronjat {{has sought}} to {{characterize}} Occitan by 19 principal criteria, as generalized as possible. Of those, 11 are phonetic, five morphologic, one syntactic, and two lexical. Close rounded vowels are rare or absent in Occitan. This characteristic often carries through to an Occitan speaker's French, leading to a distinctive méridional accent. Unlike French, it is a pro-drop language, allowing the omission of the subject (canti: I sing; cantas <b>you</b> <b>sing).</b> Among these 19 discriminating criteria, 7 are different from Spanish, 8 from Italian, 12 from Franco-Provençal, and 16 from French.|$|E
25|$|In a dark, private lair in a tower {{high above}} the park, the Phantom (now {{revealed}} as Phantasma's owner and mastermind) interacts with an automaton that resembles Christine ("The Aerie"). In spite of the years that have passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til I Hear You Sing"). Meg intrudes and presses the Phantom for feedback on her performance, but he is distracted by his thoughts of Christine and dismisses Meg as an annoyance. Madame Giry is irritated that the Phantom still seems to think only of Christine after all that she and Meg have done for him over the years. Giry recounts how she and Meg helped smuggle him out of Paris and to a ship departing from Calais, on which they escaped to America. Ignoring her, the Phantom summons Miss Fleck, who appears with two other freak show performers, Dr. Gangle and Mr. Squelch. The Phantom has them dispatch a letter to Christine, inviting her to come and perform at Phantasma ("Giry confronts The Phantom/Til' I Hear <b>You</b> <b>Sing</b> (Reprise)").|$|E

500|$|Shaker, Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Sing</b> is Maya Angelou's fourth {{volume of}} poetry. [...] She studied and began writing poetry {{at a young}} age. [...] After her rape {{at the age of}} eight, as recounted in her first {{autobiography}} I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out of her self-imposed muteness.|$|E
500|$|Like her {{previous}} poetry collections, Angelou's fourth volume, Shaker, Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Sing?,</b> celebrates {{the ability to}} survive despite threatened freedom, lost love, and defeated dreams. Neubauer states that the poems in this volume are full of [...] "the control and confidence that have become characteristic of Angelou's work in general". Their tone moves from themes of strength to humor and satire, and captures both the loneliness of lovers and the sacrifice that many slaves experienced without succumbing to defeat or despair. The poems in Shaker emphasize determination despite the [...] "unabiding anguish over the oppression of the black race", {{and deal with the}} cruel treatment of slaves in the South.|$|E

When Madonna was talking to The Sun about her daughter's collaboration, she said: [...] " [...] just {{came over to the}} studio that day.

500|$|For the episode, McCreary {{composed}} a {{theme for the}} character of Akela Amador, a musical representation of her name with the notes arranged [...] "so that the syllables in her name land with the right emphasis. The melody basically suggests that <b>you</b> <b>sing</b> along with her name ... I also put two of the A’s and the D in Akela Amador’s name on those exact notes ... Starting with this association with her name was a fun way to kickstart my creative process, and it also produced a malleable melody that could be adapted to my needs throughout the episode." [...] The theme is initially used with low strings or brass to sound ominous, or even evil, but when she [...] "reunites with Coulson for an emotional conversation, the strings repeat her theme in twisting, circular statements, adding angst and heartbreak." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{publication}} of Shaker, Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Sing</b> occurred {{during one of}} the most productive periods of Angelou's career. [...] She had written songs for Roberta Flack and had composed movie scores. [...] She had written articles, short stories, TV scripts and documentaries, autobiographies, and poetry, she produced plays, and was named a visiting professor of several colleges and universities. [...] Angelou was given a multitude of awards during this period, including over thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities from all over the world. [...] In 1981, after ten years of marriage, Angelou and her husband Paul du Feu divorced. [...] Angelou returned to the southern United States, where she accepted the lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and taught a variety of subjects that reflected her interests, including philosophy, ethics, theology, science, theater, and writing.|$|E

500|$|Shaker, Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Sing?</b> {{is author}} and poet Maya Angelou's fourth volume of poetry, {{published}} by Random House in 1983. [...] It was published {{during one of}} the most productive periods in Angelou's career; she had written four autobiographies and published three other volumes of poetry up to that point. [...] Angelou considers herself a poet and a playwright, but is best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. [...] Many of the poems in Shaker focus on survival despite threatened freedom, lost love, and defeated dreams. [...] Over half of them are love poems, and emphasize the inevitable loss of love. [...] "Caged Bird", which refers to Angelou's first autobiography, is contained in this volume.|$|E
500|$|Early in {{her writing}} career she began {{alternating}} {{the publication of}} an autobiography and a volume of poetry.

[...] Also in the 1994 collection were her four previous collections, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975), And Still I Rise (1978), and Shaker, Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Sing?</b> (1983).

[...] Her first volume of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which {{was nominated for a}} Pulitzer Prize, followed her first autobiography, and Oh Pray followed the publication of her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name (1974).

500|$|Angelou's poems {{have been}} {{compared}} to music and musical forms. The poems in her fourth volume, Shaker, Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Sing?</b> (1983), have {{been compared to}} the music of French singer Édith Piaf. In her review of Shaker, Janet Blundell finds the best poems in the volume to be the ones that are structured like blues music. Critic Harold Bloom compares [...] "Times-Square-Shoeshine-Composition" [...] in Diiie to Langston Hughes' blues/protest poetry. He suggests {{that the best way to}} analyze the subjects, style, themes, and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou's poems is to use [...] "a blues-based model", since like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. Blundell, in her review of Angelou's third volume And Still I Rise (1978) in Library Journal, finds Angelou's poems which mimic speech patterns and songs the most effective. [...] However, she finds Angelou's other poems [...] "mired in hackneyed metaphor and forced rhyme".|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song <b>you</b> <b>sing</b> every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E

It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have a listen to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't <b>you</b> <b>sing</b> on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{wrote that}} [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is [...] "the most old-school work" [...] on Femme Fatale, with Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{considering}} the album's production [...] "polished, intriguing and – {{best of all}} – fun", exemplifying the piano breakdown in the song. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said he could [...] "completely hear this track blasting in a club, with Spears cooing 'I can be your treble' while the crowd screams back 'you can be my bass!'." [...] The Daily Collegians stated that the song is [...] "catchy", yet different from [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] and [...] "Hold It Against Me", and added that [...] "the combined star power of Spears and Will.i.am would have surely made it a radio hit." [...] The Independent journalist Andy Gill noted that the album sounds more programmed than natural, but said that the song [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound thought that the song [...] "might {{as well be a}} B-side to 'The Time (Dirty Bit)' (otherwise known as the most annoying Black Eyed Peas song ever created)." [...] Both Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic and About.com reviewer Bill Lamb selected it as a top song on Femme Fatale. Lamb further added that the song [...] "will leave you laughing as <b>you</b> <b>sing</b> along on the dance floor." ...|$|E
500|$|The rest of {{the poems}} in Shaker {{emphasize}} determination despite the [...] "unabiding anguish over the oppression of the black race", {{and deal with the}} cruel treatment of slaves in the South. [...] In the poem [...] "Family Affairs", Angelou uses the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] as a framework to summarize her painful origins of slavery and to compare Black/white tensions. [...] Critic J. T. Keefe calls it [...] "a wise and deeply felt poem". [...] Neubauer considers Angelou's poem [...] "Caged Bird", which she says [...] "inevitably brings Angelou's audience full circle" [...] with her first autobiography, as the most powerful poem in the volume. [...] Keefe agrees, and calls it Angelou's [...] "central motif" [...] and a rhythmical and hypnotic chant that cries out to be sung". [...] Neubauer states, [...] "Her poems in Shaker, Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Sing</b> imply that as long as such melodies are sung and heard, hope and strength will overcome defeated dreams". [...] Scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout agrees, and cites [...] "A Plagued Journey" [...] as an example of Angelou's themes of liberation found in all her poetry. [...] In the poem, Angelou calls for a reconsideration of the beliefs that limit human beings, and insists that [...] "hope allows action and forces engagement with the world".|$|E
