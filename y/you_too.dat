5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love <b>you</b> <b>too</b> so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|My dear friend, {{what is this}} our life? A {{boat that}} swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain {{about it is that}} one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to keep me from 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for <b>you,</b> <b>too,</b> and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E

500|$|His {{realistic}} approach, designing dances {{that were}} inspired by the way ordinary people behaved, led one critic to observe that [...] "Kidd is, in a way, the originator of the fantasy that if only your life shaped up and offered you the right moments, <b>you</b> <b>too</b> {{would be able to}} dance like a Hollywood star".|$|E

The note said: [...] "We worked for a year in Belzec. I don't know where they're taking us now. They say to Germany. In the freight cars there are dining tables.

500|$|Elysa Gardner from USA Today advised {{people who}} buy the album to skip the song. In his {{negative}} review for the album, Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine {{found it difficult to}} think of a song more unrefined or more irritating than [...] "Peacock". He believed all reviews of Teenage Dream will discuss the track, which will be because it is [...] "potentially historic in its badness, to the point that, once you've heard it, <b>you</b> <b>too</b> will have to describe it to other people just to convince yourself that it really exists." [...] Spin magazine writer Mikael Wood remarked that the song contains a double entendre that even a performer such as Kesha could find crude.|$|E

500|$|On 20 September 2007, Constantine and Woodall {{launched}} their own exclusive Littlewoods women's clothing range {{which consists of}} trousers, coats and tops which like their underwear range, are designed to make certain areas appear slimmer. A series of eight dresses, cashmere knitwear, faux fur and sequinned shrugs also feature in the range. She commented [...] "If you {{want to create a}} waist, there's a dress that's going to do that for <b>you</b> <b>too.</b> We've designed it very much around the female body."

By our oral teaching we encourage <b>you</b> <b>too</b> to strive that you may have part in His gifts and enjoy them, the gifts of which we, though unworthy, have been partakers through His unutterable goodness.

500|$|Goldfaden {{wrote that}} this {{attitude}} put him [...] "pure and simply {{at war with}} the public." [...] His stage was not to be merely [...] "a masquerade"; he continued: [...] "No, brothers. If I have arrived at having a stage, I want it to be a school for you. In youth you didn't have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and <b>you,</b> <b>too,</b> shall cry – while my heart shall be glad." [...] Nonetheless, his [...] "war with the public" [...] was based on understanding that public. He would also write, [...] "I wrote Di kishefmakhern (The Witch) in Romania, where the populace – Jews as much as Romanians – believe strongly in witches." [...] Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.|$|E
