5|$|I {{think when}} <b>you</b> <b>name</b> a record, {{you have to}} choose {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

Shawn Perry of Vintage Rock also admires {{the range of}} sounds, saying: [...] "incidental passages, scads of sitar, sarod and tabla, Dixieland cutaways, 'Cowboy Music,' church bells, chirps, acoustic guitar, space rock riffs, piano, horns – <b>you</b> <b>name</b> it and he threw it in."

Brooks had been a writer since high school, but he had never found 'his' genre: [...] "I tried my hand at science fiction, westerns, war stories, <b>you</b> <b>name</b> it. All those efforts ... weren't very good." [...] When he was starting college, he was given a copy of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to read for the first time. From then on, Brooks knew that he had found a genre he could write in. Writing Sword took seven years, as Brooks worked on it only sporadically while also completing his law school courses and rewrote it many times.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, {{art critic}} Camille Paglia praised {{the film in}} Glittering Images, {{comparing}} some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it [...] "the greatest work of art in recent memory". Paglia explained that the film's finale, [...] "has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than anything by the artists <b>you</b> <b>name.</b> It's because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. It's like the emperor's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off. Episode III epitomizes the modern digital art movement, more so than other piece from the last 30 years. I had considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book, but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness of Lucas's Revenge of the Sith." ...|$|E

[...] Marama Whyte of Hypable wrote, [...] "Critically, the key relationship in Meredith’s life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd, but her passionate, indestructible, absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina. Talk about relationship goals; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person. These two were the real powerhouse, and Shonda Rhimes didn’t shy away from making the audience remember this. Derek was the love of her life, but Cristina was her soul mate. More than anyone else, Cristina challenged Meredith, was honest with her, and inspired her. For these reasons, it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith’s character development, not Derek." ...|$|E

Someone had written down [...] "combat" [...] on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and then someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, [...] "just to be kind of weird". Steve Ritchie, a pinball designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word [...] "Kombat" [...] and said to Boon, 'Why don't <b>you</b> <b>name</b> it Mortal Kombat?' and that name [...] "just stuck".

500|$|Scott Derrickson {{did not see}} a lookbook for Doctor Strange, instead putting {{together}} his own presentation, with concept art and storyboards by himself and professionals he hired, to sell himself and {{his vision of the}} film to Marvel. In contrast, Marvel shared several different ideas for what Thor: Ragnarok could be with prospective filmmakers, who then went away and developed what they thought the film should be from that. Taika Waititi created a sizzle reel using clips from other films to present his vision based on Marvel's ideas, a practice that Marvel discourages as they [...] "oftentimes can be really terrible". However, Marvel thought Waititi's was [...] "amazing". Derrickson and Waititi were both eventually hired for the films. For Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Joe and Anthony Russo met with the studio four times over two months before they were hired, during which they [...] "kept getting more and more specific about what our vision was", {{putting together}} [...] "reference videos, storyboards, script pages, <b>you</b> <b>name</b> it.

[...] They also branded him as the reason Neighbours, in their opinion was good viewing in the 2000s adding: [...] "It's his cackling soap villain role that we love to hate him for: his return in 2004, torching Lassiter's and befriending Dylan, marked the start of Neighbours getting awesome in the mid-noughties. Although it's probably {{safe to say that}} period was over by the time he suffered amnesia of everything after 1989." [...] He has also been branded as a [...] "legend character". Entertainment reporting website Last Broadcast praised Paul's development, stating: [...] "As the kind of shady character who'd do anything to make a fast buck, he even planned to bulldoze Ramsay Street {{to make way for a}} new supermarket development. And that's not all: fraud, blackmail, murder; there is no level to which Paul wouldn't have sunk. Yet, the infamous bad boy of Erinsborough, has, thankfully, turned over a new leaf." ...|$|E
