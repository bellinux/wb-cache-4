500|$|Batman subdues the Joker {{and tells}} him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and {{suggests}} that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across!" [...] Batman chuckles at the punch line, and the two old foes laugh as the police arrive.|$|E
2500|$|When police {{displayed}} this warrant to Rose on 24 February, {{she turned}} pale, before becoming hysterical and shouting {{over her shoulder}} to her eldest son, Stephen, [...] "Get Fred!" [...] Rose became contradictory in her informal questioning as to the circumstances surrounding Heather's disappearance. When reminded of these contradictions, she became uptight and abusive, shouting at the officers: [...] "I can't fucking remember! It's a bloody long time ago! What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> A bloody computer?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{broadcast}} of January 8, 1950, journalist Drew Pearson {{was the subject}} of a joke gone wrong. Announcer Don Wilson was supposed to say he heard that Jack bought a new suit on Drew Pearson, but said the name wrong; Don said [...] "Drear Pewson". Later in the show, comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman. Changing his original response at the suggestion of the writers, Nelson said, [...] "Well, who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> Drear Pewson?" [...] The audience laughed for almost 30 seconds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Rivers? That flimsy, feather-headed, empty-hearted--eyes-maker! That frivolous, ridiculous--Pah! And did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{talking of}} her? Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in love with}} her?" ...|$|R

2500|$|On {{returning}} to Britain, {{she decided to}} train as a nurse at Guy's, a London hospital. Following her training, {{at the age of}} 65 she joined the military nursing service with the intention of working in the Crimea, despite the attempts of her sister Bridget to dissuade her. Florence Nightingale (who came from a privileged background) did not want the Welsh working-class Cadwaladr to go, saying that if Betsi went to the Crimea, it would be against her will, and that Betsi would have to be made over to another superintendent. Betsi responded, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a dog or an animal to make me over? I have a will of my own." [...] (Nightingale's opinion of the Welsh stemmed from the publication of a report – the so-called Treachery of the Blue Books – which portrayed the Welsh as lacking both basic education and morality.) ...|$|E

I don't know what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> How much farther do you' think you can go? No, you don't like {{reminding}} of us.

6000|$|PHOEBE (discovering {{only now}} what are the suspicions of her friends). Is that what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing, Miss Willoughby? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah--it isn't true!" [...] {{she said}} with gentle resentment. [...] "You are teasing me--that's all--because <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not happy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no! Please! Just another half-hour--till {{we reach}} that butte. I'm {{stronger}} than <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{accustomed to the}} whip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I did," [...] said Leonidas reproachfully. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} let her get bit? It might have killed her." ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{spoke as}} if the fact {{scarcely}} concerned her, and Lanfear drew a breath of relief in his surprise. He asked, at another tangent: [...] "What made <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sad yesterday?" ...|$|R
