40|$|International audienceObtaining the {{red color}} was a {{technical}} and economic {{challenge for the}} French faience manufactories in the 18 th and 19 th centuries. The tendency of the red hematite to turn into drab brown during the firing process explains the difficulty in obtaining this color. Red decorations in shards coming from the four production centers of faience manufacturing during this period – Rouen (northwest), Nevers (central), Thiviers (southwest) and Argonne (northeast) – have been studied by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Among them, Thiviers {{appears to be the}} leader thanks to a particular reddish sandstone called ‘Gr`es de Thiviers' (GT) available in the region. This material is composed of a-quartz grains cemented by goethite (a-FeOOH), leading to red hematite during the firing process.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the stages and the operations {{involved in the}} preservation and restoration of two icons on wooden support, from the XIX-th century, which {{are part of the}} heritage of the ”Sfinții Arhangheli Mihail and Gavriil” church, from Galați. The two icon have inventory numbers as part of the collection as followed: 112 for the first icon and 113 for the second one. Both icons have the same theme, ”The Grieving Mother from Rohia” and are made by anonymous painters in egg tempera, on lime wooden support, without ground. Being part of the same collection, they were deposited in the same place and as a direct consequence, they suffer from similar deteriorations and degradations that affect both the support and the painting layer. Both panels are attacked by xylophagous insects and the painting layer has detachments, gaps, cracks, clogged dirt and a cracked and degraded varnish layer. Ten samples taken from the already detached areas were analyzed by optical microscope, SEM-EDX and micro-FTIR. Based on the chemical elements identified in the EDX spectrums, the pigments used to create the painting layer are: ultramarine natural blue Na 8 - 10 Al 6 Si 6 O 24 S 2 - 4, carbon black, earth green, K[(Al,FeIII),(FeII,Mg) ](AlSi 3,Si 4) O 10 (OH) 2, ocher (FeO), burned or natural umber Fe 2 O 3 · H 2 O + MnO 2 ·n H 2 O+ Al 2 O 3, lead white (2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) and <b>yellow</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (Fe 2 O 3 · 4 H 2 O). It was also determined that the gold leaf usually used in byzantine icons was replaced in the case of both icons: the icon number 112 has silver leaf covered with varnish, while the halo of the icon number 113 was created with yellow metallic pigments (realgar or orpigment). The pigments were also identified by determining specific peaks in micro-FTIR spectrums. For natural ultramarine blue the peaks between 628 - 724 cm- 1 were assigned; the peaks in the interval 795 - 887 cm- 1 confirm the presence of carbonates (calcium and lead based). The earth green pigment (aluminum - silicates) had the peaks between 1464 - 1599, while the carbon black pigment was confirmed by the peaks in the interval 921 - 1060 cm- 1. After the pigments and the materials used by the author were identified, the restoration process begun with the following stages: consolidation of the painting layer (fish glue 8 % and japanese paper), stopping the xylophagous attack (encapsulation with nitrogen), consolidation of the wood supports (colophon and wax, 1 : 1), cleaning the painting layer (ethylic alcohol and distilled water, 1 : 1), filling the gaps and reintegrating the fillings in tratteggio, all followed by the process of varnishing the two icons...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Rapid {{discoloration}} {{and checking}} of wooden surfaces when exposed outdoors has caused wood {{to fall out}} of favor as an outdoor building material, especially in applications where appearance is important. The surface appearance of wood products exposed outdoors can be improved through the application of film forming coatings or by reducing exposure to solar radiation and moisture. A shift towards environmentally friendly building materials has renewed interest in the outdoor application of wood products, where both biotic and abiotic durability is required, often in the absence of large overhangs or maintenance-intensive film forming coatings. The deterioration processes of wood surfaces have been extensively investigated. It is generally accepted that the loss of lignin and hemicellulose from the surface due to free radical reactions initiated by UV light absorption and moisture leads to discoloration and erosion. In addition, it is thought that these chemical reactions also weaken the wood surface, resulting in checking. Further, a large body of research has been assembled investigating different treatments, primarily film forming, that prevent the effects of weathering. Yet, only chromic acid treatments have emerged as an economical means for reducing the effects of outdoor exposure without obscuring the natural figure of the wood. However, due to the toxic nature of these compounds, these treatments have never been commercialized. In this body of work, two outdoor screening weathering studies were conducted to investigate the interactions between the wood surface and four classes of promising surface protection compounds. Representative water repellents, pigments, organic UV inhibitors, and carbon based wood preservatives were selected for the initial study. Samples were pressure impregnated with the candidate systems and subjected to exterior exposure at two sites. Exposure sites were located in the high desert of Oregon and on the leeward side of the island of Hawaii. These locations represent the extremes experienced by most wood based building materials. The Oregon site has low rainfall but high UV exposure while the Hawaiian site has both high rainfall and high UV. Samples were removed from the Oregon site at predetermined radiation intervals over a one year period, while the samples exposed in Hawaii were removed after six months of weathering. Following exposure, the samples were evaluated for discoloration, checking and changes in the chemical composition of the surface. The results from this study indicated that none of the selected treatments completely prevented the effects of weathering on the wood surface; yet some fared better than others in {{at least some of the}} categories analyzed. The study also indicated that the mode of deterioration differed significantly between the two exposure locations and that chemical degradation of the surface did not necessarily correlate with checking or discoloration. Red and <b>yellow</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> impregnated loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) samples experienced less discoloration and reduced lignin loss during the first study at both exposure locations, suggesting that iron oxides may alter the interaction between UV light and the wood polymers. In a follow up, study loblolly pine samples were impregnated with iron oxide pigments differing in particle size, shape and loading to determine what characteristics of iron oxide influenced surface protection properties. These samples were only exposed at the eastern Oregon location and removed over a three month period at predetermined radiation intervals. The results from this work suggest that crystal shape, size and pigment concentration influenced polymer losses from the wood surface as well as surface discoloration. However, the results suggested that checking was not affected by any of the variables investigated. While these studies suggest that the abiotic deterioration of wood surfaces can be controlled through the application of different transparent and semitransparent treatments, no single compound was completely effective. This implies that combinations of partially effective compounds should be investigated. In addition, the data suggest that, lignin and hemicellulose loss do not substantially affect check formation during the first months of outdoor exposure. Instead, the data suggests that wood / water relations dominate. The different exposure locations used in the first study also highlighted differences in weathering characteristics caused by climate. More research must be conducted to understand the effects of different climates on performance and to use these data to tailor surface protection systems to match exposure conditions...|$|E

METHODS: The labeling of mesenchymal stem cells was performed using the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran complexed and not complexed to poly-L-lysine. Superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran was incubated with poly-L-lysine in an ultrasonic sonicator at 37 °C for 10 minutes for complex formation superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine by electrostatic interaction. Then, the mesenchymal stem cells were incubated overnight with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran. After the incubation period the mesenchymal stem cells were evaluated by internalization of the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran by Prussian Blue stain. Cellular viability of labeled mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated by cellular proliferation assay using 5, 6 -carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl ester method and apoptosis detection by Annexin V- Propidium Iodide assay. RESULTS: mesenchymal stem cells labeled with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran without poly-L-lysine not internalized efficiently the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to its low presence detected within cells. Mesenchymal stem cells labeled with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine efficiently internalized the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to greater presence in the cells interior. The viability and apoptosis assays demonstrated that the mesenchymal stem cells labeled and not labeled respectively with the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine continue to proliferate over seven days and the percentage of cells in early or late apoptosis is low compared to the percentage of live cells over the three days.

40|$|Copper, {{aluminum}} and iron concentrations were determined in four geochemical fractions {{of three different}} basaltic soils from the northwest region of the Parana State, Brazil. The fractions examined were the reducible manganese dioxide and amorphous <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> crystaline <b>iron</b> <b>oxide,</b> organic and residual. Metal concentrations were determined in the extracts by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. High Fe concentrations were extracted from the crystalline <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (> 20 %), {{as well as the}} amorphous <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (> 12 %). Copper was extracted from the amorphous and crystalline <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> in the range 5 to 12 %, but low concentrations were bound to organic matter.

Through a highly controllable and tunable chemical synthesis method utilizing reverse-micelle/sol-gel processes, phase and morphology of <b>Iron</b> (III) <b>Oxide</b> nanoparticles was controlled through variation of calcination temperature from 800 ºC - 1100 ºC. Four polymorphs of <b>Iron</b> (III) <b>Oxide</b> were observed. Furthermore, core-shell structures comprised of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> cores and silica shells were created with relatively high initial <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> concentrations, and densified via Current Activated Pressure Assisted Densification (CAPAD).

40|$|A facile {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the synthesis of nearly mono-dispersed <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanocrystals. The structural analysis of the synthesized <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanocrystals reveals the magnetite phase of Fe 3 O 4. The average particle size of the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> {{was estimated to be}} 8 +/- 2 nm. The observed particle size is in good correlation with the particle size estimated by magnetic measurements. Furthermore, these nanocrystals showed bi-functional ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic behavior below and above the blocking temperature, respectively. The potential use of these nanocrystals as an electrode for supercapacitors was examined by investigating the electrochemical behavior of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The CV characteristics of the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> electrode showed a typical pseudocapacitive behavior in 3 M KOH solution. Moreover, the specific capacitance of 185 F g(- 1) at the current of 1 mA was observed with excellent cyclic stability, which is much higher than the reported value for <b>iron</b> <b>oxide.</b> The higher specific capacitance is due to the uniform nano-size of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide.</b> This work provides an ultimate facile method to synthesize nanostructured <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> for application in next generation energy storage materials...|$|R

40|$|The reducibility of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) supported over few-layer thick graphite upon annealing in {{hydrogen is}} investigated by near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and high resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HR-TEM). It is found that {{the stability of the}} <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> NPs toward reduction is enhanced by the interaction with the graphene nanosheets, as compared to the bulk <b>iron</b> <b>oxide.</b> Post-annealing TEM micrographs reveal the existence of both core/shell and homogeneous <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> NPs, with the latter forming irregular trenches into the graphene sheets. EELS analysis and TEM images clearly demonstrate that the reducibility of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> particles depends on the specific graphene site on which they are attached.

It was recently reported that <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles attenuated antigen-specific immunity in vivo, though the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The present study investigates the direct effect of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles on antigen-specific cytokine expression by T cells, and potential underlying mechanisms. Methods: Ovalbumin-primed splenocytes were exposed to <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles, followed by restimulation with ovalbumin. Cell viability, cytokine production, and cellular levels of glutathione and reactive oxygen species were measured. Results: The splenocyte viability {{and the production of}} interleukin- 2 and interleukin- 4 were unaffected, whereas interferon-&gamma; production was markedly attenuated by <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles (10 &ndash; 100 &micro;g iron/mL) in a concentration-dependent manner. <b>Iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles also transiently diminished the intracellular level of glutathione, with a peak response at 6 hours posttreatment. The effects of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles on interferon-&gamma; and glutathione were attenuated by the presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a precursor of glutathione. However, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles did not influence the generation of reactive oxygen species. Conclusion: <b>Iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles induced a differential effect on antigen-specific cytokine expression by T cells, in which the T helper 1 cytokine IFN-&gamma; was sensitive, whereas the T helper 2 cytokine interleukin- 4 was refractory. In addition, the suppressive effect of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles on interferon-&gamma; was closely associated with the diminishment of glutathione.
