25|$|Similar to {{the other}} windows, this one shows four figures across the top portion. The first {{of these is the}} figure of the Victory of Peace, holding both a palm branch and the sword of judgement, while a dove flies overhead. The second person shown is that of Prosperity, who holds a wheat sheaf and a sicle, and, next to him, is Progress, bearing a winged wheel and with the Lamp of Knowledge above his head. The fourth figure is Plenty, symbolising the {{replenishment}} of both material and spirit through noble pursuit. Arranged in the lower portion of the window is a crowd of people assembled in peace and led by three figures in the foreground and bearing the symbols of their trades: Industry holds a mallet and dynamo, Agriculture bears a scythe, Honour carries a torch inscribed with words from John McCrae's poem In Flanders Fields: BE THE TORCH <b>YOURS</b> <b>TO</b> HOLD IT HIGH, and Motherhood, who is surrounded by children. At the base of the second and third panels are the phrases: HE MAKETH WARS TO CEASE, from Psalm 46:9, and JUDGEMENT SHALL RETURN UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS, from Psalm 94:15.|$|E

500|$|Bosanquet's {{performances}} {{during the}} season earned him a place on Warner's team for the first tour of Australia by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was to include Test matches. Warner later wrote that {{he was accused of}} selecting Bosanquet out of favouritism as they played on the same county team, and received [...] "a hail of criticism and disapprobation" [...] as a result. Before the tour began, Sussex and England batsman C. B. Fry wrote an open letter to Warner in the Daily Express, stating Warner [...] "must persuade that Bosanquet of <b>yours</b> <b>to</b> practise, practise, practise those funny 'googlies' of his till he is automatically certain of his length.

500|$|... "In Flanders Fields" [...] is {{very popular}} in Canada, where it is a staple of Remembrance Day ceremonies and {{may be the most}} well known {{literary}} piece among English Canadians. It has an official French adaptation, entitled , written by Jean Pariseau and used by the Canadian government in French and bilingual ceremonies. With an excerpted appearance on the ten-dollar bill from 2001 to 2013, the Royal Canadian Mint has released poppy-themed quarters on several occasions. A version minted in 2004 featured a red poppy in the centre and is considered the first multi-coloured circulation coin in the world. To mark the poem's centennial in 2015, a coloured and uncoloured poppy quarter and a [...] "toonie" [...] ($2 coin) were issued as circulation coins, as well as other collector coins.

500|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, rebel strength peaked at around 50,000 fighters. Despite their initial successes, the rebel leaders were seldom on good terms, and constant infighting plagued their camp. In {{the western part}} of the country, Jakov Nenadović was the principle figure. In the east, Milenko Stojković and Petar Dobrnjac held sway. The latter two opposed Karađorđe's attempts to create a centralized state, fearing that this would result in their own power being diminished. Others, such as Nenadović, complained that Karađorđe was becoming too authoritarian. Nenadović suggested that the rebels establish a central council to rein in Karađorđe's power and write up a constitution based on the rule of law. Karađorđe balked at the possibility. [...] "It's easy for this sovereign law of <b>yours</b> <b>to</b> rule in a warm room, behind this table," [...] he responded, [...] "but let us see tomorrow, when the Turks strike, who will meet them and beat them." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the levity on their first train ride, the company was downcast and exhausted en route from Cleveland to Boston for the final tryouts. The show opened previews in Boston on May 6. A majority of the Boston critics liked the show, and expressed confidence that Rodgers and Hammerstein could fix {{the problems with the}} plot. The pair took out one song, [...] "Meat and Potatoes", which was felt to be too raunchy. After watching it performed by Joan McCracken, who played Betty (Carmen in the play-within-the-play), the pair decided it had too many double entendres and cut it. It was replaced by [...] "We Deserve Each Other", which the pair had written in a Cleveland hotel room. Another cut song, [...] "You Never Had It So Good", included lyrics which satirized the duo's own earlier efforts. Its lyrics, [...] "I'll sew, I'll bake / I'll try to make your evenings all enchanted. / My honeycake, / I'm <b>yours</b> <b>to</b> take, but don't take me for granted", alluded to two songs from South Pacific, [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun". Audiences continued to greet the show warmly.|$|E
500|$|MacGregor {{said that}} he had come to London to attend King George IV's {{coronation}} on the Poyers' behalf, and to seek investment and immigrants for Poyais. He claimed to have inherited a democratic system of government there, with a basic civil service and military. To those interested MacGregor showed what he said was a copy of a printed proclamation he had issued to the Poyers on 13 April 1821. He therein announced the 1820 land grant, his departure for Europe to seek investors and colonists—"religious and moral instructors... and persons to guide and assist you"—and the appointment of Brigadier-General George Woodbine to be [...] "Vice-Cazique" [...] during his absence. [...] "POYERS!", the document concluded, [...] "I now bid you farewell for a while... I trust, that through the kindness of Almighty Providence, I shall be again enabled to return amongst you, and that then it will be my pleasing duty to hail you as affectionate friends, and <b>yours</b> <b>to</b> receive me as your faithful Cazique and Father."
