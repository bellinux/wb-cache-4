40|$|Approximately 140 {{million years}} ago, the Indian plate {{separated}} from Gondwana and migrated by almost 90 degrees latitude {{to its current}} location, forming the Himalayan-Tibetan system. Large discrepancies exist {{in the rate of}} migration of Indian plate during Phanerozoic. Here we describe a new approach to paleo-latitudinal reconstruction based on simultaneous determination of carbonate formation temperature and delta O- 18 of soil carbonates, constrained by the abundances of C- 13 -O- 18 bonds in palaeosol carbonates. Assuming that the palaeosol carbonates have a strong relationship with the composition of the meteoric water, delta O- 18 carbonate of palaeosol can constrain paleo-latitudinal position. Weighted mean annual rainfall delta O- 18 water values measured at several stations across the southern latitudes are used to derive a polynomial equation: delta(18) Ow = - 0. 006 x (LAT) (2) - 0. 294 x (LAT) - 5. 29 which is used for latitudinal reconstruction. We use this approach to show the northward migration of the Indian plate from 46. 8 +/- 5. 8 degrees S during the Permian (269 M. y.) to 30 +/- 11 degrees S during the Triassic (248 M. y.), 14. 7 +/- 8. 7 degrees S during the early Cretaceous (135 M. y.), and 28 +/- 8. 8 degrees S during the late Cretaceous (68 M. <b>y.).</b> <b>Soil</b> carbonate delta O- 18 provides an alternative method for tracing the latitudinal position of Indian plate in the past and the estimates are consistent with the paleo-magnetic records which document the position of Indian plate prior to 135 +/- 3 M. y...|$|E

40|$|Fast-growing forests such as {{tropical}} {{secondary forests}} can accumulate {{large amounts of}} carbon (C), and thereby {{play an important role}} in the atmospheric CO 2 balance. Because nitrogen (N) cycling is inextricably linked with C cycling, the question becomes: Where does the N come from to match high rates of C accumulation? In unique experimental 16 -y-old plantations established in abandoned pasture in lowland Costa Rica, we used a mass-balance approach to quantify N accumulation in vegetation, identify sources of N, and evaluate differences among tree species in N cycling. The replicated design contained four broad-leaved evergreen tree species growing under similar environmental conditions. Nitrogen uptake was rapid, reaching 409 (± 30) kg⋅ha− 1 ⋅y− 1, double the rate reported from a Puerto Rican forest and greater than four times that observed at Hubbard Brook Forest (New Hampshire, USA). Nitrogen amassed in vegetation was 874 (± 176) kg⋅ha− 1, whereas net losses of soil N (0 – 100 cm) varied from 217 (± 146) to 3, 354 (± 915) kg⋅ha− 1 (P = 0. 018) over 16 <b>y.</b> <b>Soil</b> C:N, δ 13 C values, and N budgets indicated that soil was the main source of biomass N.

Only soils with a very high water table were sources of CH 4; all others were sinks. Oxidation rates varied from 1 to nearly 200 μg CH 4 m− 2 h− 1; annual rates for sites measured for ≥ 1 y were 0. 1 – 9. 1 kg CH 4 ha− 1 y− 1, with a log-normal distribution (log-mean ≈ 1. 6 kg CH 4 ha− 1 y− 1).

Analysis of all available data for CH 4 oxidation rates in situ showed similar log-normal distributions to those obtained for our results, with generally little difference between different natural ecosystems, or between short-and longer-term studies. The overall global terrestrial sink was estimated at 29 Tg CH 4 y− 1, close to the current IPCC assessment, but with a much wider uncertainty range (7 to > 100 Tg CH 4 y− 1).

Rates of gross N mineralization were similar in forest, 4 - and 10 -yr-old pasture then declined in 21 -yr-old pasture. These findings indicate that when forests are converted to pasture, soil N turnover is maintained for a period of a decade or longer, but N turnover eventually slows in old pastures.

With the exception of field-moist Renfrow soil, neither chloroform fumigation nor toluene pretreatment of soil samples aected the activity of b-glucosaminidase significantly. The activity of this enzyme in field-moist Renfrow soil increased about 20 % upon fumigation or toluene treatment. Autoclaving the soils reduced b-glucosaminidase activity by about 58 % in the air-dried soils and 96 % in the field-moist soils.

These finger instabilities act as precursors for water channels, which serve as outlets for water drainage. We look into the characteristics of the homogeneous wetting front and channel size as well as estimate relevant time scales involved in the instability formation and the velocity of the channel fingertip. We compare our experimental results with that of the well-known prediction developed by Parlange and Hill [D. E. Hill and J. <b>Y.</b> Parlange, <b>Soil</b> Sci. Soc. Am. Proc. 36, 697 (1972) ].

Outbred Swiss-Webster mice with scarified skin patches were held on contaminated soil for 10 days and monitored for signs of illness. Following exposure to contaminated soil, one animal of 104 became infected with Y. pestis. None of the remaining animals seroconverted following a 21 -day holding period. Under our experimental conditions, which maximized the likelihood of contact between susceptible mice and contaminated soil, transmission efficiency from soil to mice was 0. 96 % (95 % CI 0. 17, 5. 25 %).

This study {{presents}} the statistical {{evaluation of the}} vegetative filter strip modeling system VFSMOD‐W {{as a tool to}} design vegetative filter strips to use in the mitigation plans required as a part of phosphate mining permitting process by the State of Florida. A two‐step statistical evaluation framework using global techniques is presented based on: (1) a screening method (Morris) for qualitative ranking of parameters, and (2) a variance‐based method (extended Fourier Analysis Sensitivity Test‐‐extended FAST) for quantitative sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Measured characteristics of the central Florida phosphate‐mining region are used to construct the 16 probability distributions of input factors. Two design filter lengths (3 and 6 m) and two model structures (VFSM‐‐the filter module alone, and UH/VFSM‐‐combined filter and source area components) are considered and compared to previous local “one‐parameter‐at‐a‐time ” (OAT) analyses. It was found that for this application the filter's saturated hydraulic conductivity (VKS) was the most important factor controlling the filter runoff response, explaining over 90 % of total output variance irrespective of model structure. In the case of the VFSM structure, sediment‐related outputs were mainly influenced by three parameters: sediment particle size diameter (DP), effective flow width of the strip (FWIDTH), and VKS. For UH/VFSM, there were six important parameters: DP, the source area erosion and runoff parameters (slope of the source area <b>Y,</b> USLE <b>soil</b> erodibility index K, and runoff curve number CN), FWIDTH, and VKS.

Baseflow on the larger PA basin and flow of one spring on a small WV basin showed no detectable seasonal fluctuations in oxygen- 18, indicating flow emanated from sources with mean transit times greater than about 5 y. Based upon this soil flow path approach, it was concluded that seasonal oxygen- 18 variations can be used to infer mean annual isotopic damping depths and diusivities for soil depths up to approximately 170 cm. # 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{severity}} of water repellency was investigated {{on a wide}} range of agricultural, horticultural and turf soils in New Zealand. All the soils studied had some degree of repellency, regardless of texture or land use. Techniques for repellency measurement and amelioration were evaluated and the organic component responsible for repellency development investigated. The temporal and extreme spatial variability of repellency expression was quantified using geostatistics. The 'repellency index' (RI) based upon soil intrinsic sorptivity was developed and evaluated on 14 New Zealand soils. The RI measured undisturbed cores of all the soils water repellent at field moisture conditions and was more sensitive than the MED or water drop penetration time (WDPT) tests. The RI was used to demonstrate that repellency reduced the short-time infiltration rate, i of all the soils by approximately an order of magnitude, including those which appeared to wet normally (i. e. low WDPT). Calculations identified that the reduction in i would be hydrologically significant under intense rainfall and many irrigation systems. Investigation of a development sequence of yellow-brown sands (Aquic Udipsamments) revealed maximum repellency in < 130 y old Waitarere sand, which had the lowest level of organic carbon. Repellency was also severe in the Motuiti and Himatangi sands (c. 500 y) but declined in the Foxton (1600 - 6000 y) and Koputaroa (10000 - 25000 <b>y)</b> <b>soils.</b> While water repellency (measured with the Molarity of Ethanol Droplet, MED test) of the Himatangi sand profile was correlated with organic carbon content, this was not the case with the other soils. Organic matter composition is a more likely determinant of the degree of repellency than organic matter quantity per se. Spectroscopic examination of extracts removed from Himatangi sand by an isopropanol/ammonia mixture using a soxhlet apparatus indicated a range of long chain organic compounds comprising esters and fatty acids as the cause of repellency. The spatial variability of volumetric soil water content (θ) to 200 mm depth at two adjacent sites (A and B) of Himatangi sand, each c. 860 m 2, was studied with geostatistical techniques. At both sites θ varied isotropically and generally followed a normal distribution. Variograms of θ changed over time and were not transferable between the two sites, although there was evidence of drift in the mean at site B. At site A, compared to an October analysis, in summer the coefficient of variation (C. V.) of θ increased and the range of θ spatial dependence, a decreased. Irrigation of both site A and B with a travelling boom slightly increased C. V. (θ), markedly increased the semivariance and slightly decreased a(θ) at site A. When a wetting agent was applied prior to irrigation of site A the C. V. (θ) halved, a(θ) increased and the θ increase was improved by 63 % over irrigation of site A and 206 % over irrigation of site B. Agitation of soil samples reduced repellency significantly, however the effect was somewhat reversible and field cultivation could be precluded by the degree and depth of the repellent topsoil. Soil wetting agents increased grass establishment and growth in both glasshouse and field experiments. In the glasshouse, wetting agent performance was not affected by delayed initial irrigation, however short irrigation return intervals improved plant growth in both untreated and wetting agent treated soil. A survey of golf courses throughout New Zealand found that repellency was a major management problem. Soil cores were removed from areas of greens displaying repellency symptoms ('dry patch') and from areas of compatatively healthy turf. No significant difference was found between the MED profile or the thatch content of the dry patch and non-dry patch cores. Dry patch areas were found to match the poorly irrigated areas of a green using a simple 'catch-can' test, which indicated that irrigation uniformity affected repellency expression in turf...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of root and litter exclusion on the rate of soil CO 2 efflux and microbial biomass at a soil depth of 25 cm in a secondary forest (dominated by Tabebuia heterophylla) and a pine (Pints caribaea) plantation in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico. The experimental plots were initially established in 1990, when root, forest floor mass and new litterfall were excluded for 7 <b>y</b> since then. <b>Soil</b> respiration was significantly reduced in the litter and root exclusion plots in both the secondary forest and the pine plantation compared with the control. Root exclusion had a greater effect on soil CO 2 efflux than the litter exclusion in the plantation, whereas a reversed pattern was observed in the secondary forest. The reduction of microbial biomass in the root exclusion plot was greater in the secondary forest (59 %) than in the plantation (31 %), while there was no difference of the reduction in the litter exclusion plots between these forests. Our results suggest that above-ground input and roots (root litter and exudates) differentially affect soil CO 2 efflux under different vegetation types. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Macroorganic {{matter of}} arable soils which had {{received}} different inputs of organic residues for 25 <b>y</b> and grassland <b>soils</b> {{that had been}} under grass for at least 8 y was fractionated into light, intermediate and heavy fractions using a stable silica suspension as heavy liquid. For all residue treatments, the C-to-N ratios of organic matter decreased in the order light, intermediate, heavy macroorganic matter (fraction > 150 μm) and non-macroorganic matter (fraction < 150 μm). Residue application had a stronger effect on the amount and C-to-N ratio of macroorganic matter fractions than on the amount and C-to-N ratio non-macroorganic matter. Textural effects were apparent with the proportions of soil N in the light and intermediate fractions being higher in coarse-textured grassland soils than in fine-textured grassland soils. C and N mineralization were positively correlated {{with the amount of}} C and N in the light fraction and the active microbial biomass. The correlation with mineralization decreased with increasing stability of the organic matter fractions. C and N mineralization per unit of total microbial biomass were lower in fine-textured soils than in coarse-textured soils. This is ascribed to a greater physical protection of the organic matter in fine-textured soils than in coarse-textured soils...|$|R

Our study {{compares the}} {{performances}} of two statistical methods, namely multiple linear regression and classification and regression trees, for deriving spatial models of soil reaction in the surface horizon. The applications were carried out within a 186 km 2 hydrographic basin situated in eastern Romania. Statistical models were computed from a sample of 235 soil profiles, scattered in {{the eastern half of}} the basin. An independent sample of 237 expeditionary pH measurements was used to validate the results within the interpolation area, whereas an independent sample of 50 soil profiles was used to validate the results within the extrapolation area (the western half of the basin). The predictors included geomorphometrical parameters, derived from a 10 x 10 m digital elevation model, X and <b>Y</b> coordinates of <b>soil</b> profiles and the main soil types for the regression trees approach. The stepwise selection procedure indicated Y coordinate, digital elevation model, wetness index and surface ratio as the best predictors for soil reaction. The correlation between observed and predicted pH values for the training sample suggests a much higher quality of the regression trees spatial model. However, the validation using the two independent samples points out the instability of this model and recommends the regression model more reliable...|$|R

Root elongation rate (∆l/∆t) decreased progressively with de-creasing Ψs and was associated with decreased Ψπ and de-creased turgor pressure (P). Osmotic adjustment occurred at Ψs < – 0. 2 MPa. Over a range in Ψs of – 0. 01 to – 1. 0 MPa, Ψπ fell 0. 3 MPa whereas P fell 0. 7 MPa. Mean Y in the solution ex-periment was 0. 37 MPa and {{did not differ significantly}} withΨs (P = 0. 10).

40|$|Abstract – The drought {{response}} of two Populus x euramericana clones cv Dorskamp and Luisa Avanzo was investigated using pot-ted cuttings growing in a greenhouse. The cv Dorskamp clone {{is known to}} be more tolerant than Luisa Avanzo under field condi-tions. Watering was withheld and several parameters followed during the onset of drought. The relation between predawn leaf water potential (<b>Y</b> wp) and <b>soil</b> water content differed between clones: (i) Y wp tended to decline when soil water content decreased below a threshold of 0. 11 v/v and 0. 13 v/v for Dorskamp and Luisa Avanzo, respectively; and (ii) Y wp of stressed cuttings reached – 3. 5 MPa and – 2. 5 MPa for Dorskamp and Luisa Avanzo, respectively. Under well watered conditions, Luisa Avanzo had greater relative rates of increase in number of leaves and leaf growth than in Dorskamp. In response to water stress, the relative rates of increase in num-ber of leaves and leaf growth did not significantly differ between the two clones for similar Y wp values. Thus, the growth advantage of Luisa Avanzo observed under control condition appeared counterbalanced by its higher susceptibility to water stress.

40|$|As human {{activity}} in the Arctic increases, so does the risk of hydrocarbon pollution events. On site bioremediation of contaminated soil is the only feasible clean up solution in these remote areas, but degradation rates vary widely between bioremediation treatments. Most previous {{studies have focused on}} the feasibility of on site clean-up and very little attention has been given to the microbial and functional communities involved and their ecology. Here, we ask the question: which microorganisms and functional genes are abundant and active during hydrocarbon degradation at cold temperature? To answer this question, we sequenced the soil metagenome of an ongoing bioremediation project in Alert, Canada through a time course. We also used reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) to quantify the expression of several hydrocarbon-degrading genes. Pseudomonas species appeared as the most abundant organisms in Alert soils right after contamination with diesel and excavation (t = 0) and one month after the start of the bioremediation treatment (t = 1 m), when degradation rates were at their highest, but decreased after one year (t = 1 <b>y),</b> when residual <b>soil</b> hydrocarbons were almost depleted. This trend was also reflected in hydrocarbon degrading genes, which were mainly affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria at t = 0 and t = 1 m and with Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria at t = 1 y. RT-qPCR assays confirmed that Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus species actively expressed hydrocarbon degradation genes in Arctic biopile soils. Taken together, these results indicated that biopile treatment leads to major shifts in soil microbial communities, favoring aerobic bacteria that can degrade hydrocarbons.

The area which is mostly underlain by granitoids, is characterized by extensive agricultural activities, soil erosion, land degradation and artisanal mining at places. The objectives were to determine the sources of these elements, and to evaluate the levels of trace element enrichments, pollution and potential risks in the area. The concentration values of the elements in the soils were compared to their respective background reference values to establish possible enrichments and pollution. The relative enrichments of the trace elements were evaluated using Enrichment Factor (EF) and geo-accumulation index (Igeo), while Pollution Load Index (PLI) {{was used to compare}} enrichments within the east and west zones of the study area. The results show that while the major elements reflect the bedrock compositions, the trace elements were derived from both natural sources such as weathering of underlying bedrocks, and anthropogenic sources such as mining and other land use activities. Elements such as Cr, Zn, As, Pb, Sn, Sr, Zr, Ba and Y were enriched by various degrees while V, Co, Ni, Cu and Ga were not.

En el presente estudio se investigó la hipótesis de que la disminución del C en la arcilla y limo a medida que el contenido de estas fracciones aumenta en los suelos se debe a una disminución en la superficie específica en las partículas de arcilla y limo. También se investigó la relación entre las tasas de mineralización de C y N con el grado de saturación con C en las partículas de arcilla y limo. Seis suelos cultivados (cereales) y tres suelos de praderas (Medicago sativa L.) fueron muestreados a 0 - 20 cm de profundidad.

In this study the authors investigated the hypothesis that the decline in the amount of C in clay and silt particles from coarse to fine textured soil is due to a reduction of the specific surface area of clay and silt fractions in clay soils. The relation between the mineralization rates of C and N to the degree of C saturation in the clay and silt particles was also investigated. Six cultivated soils (cereal) and three non-cultivated soils (Medicago sativa L.) were sampled at 0 - 20 cm depth. All soils were ultrasonically treated and gravimetrically separated into fractions > 50 µm (sand) and < 50 µm (clay and silt). All fractions and whole soils were analyzed for organic-C and the specific surface area with ethylene glycol monoethyl (EGME). Moreover, there was a close relation between the degree of C saturation and the mineralization rates. However, there also was a good relation between the total organic C of the soil and the mineralization rates. This coincided with the fact that a good relation between the soil organic carbon and the degree of carbon saturation was found.
