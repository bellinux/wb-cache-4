Regarding this, Stan said in a press release: [...] "I am the child of the sea, I feed myself with the sun, I love the energy of the water and I think that's what sea means: happiness, fun, where the stress disappears and also the ideal place to start relationships".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don't wish you to give me your opinion about it." ...|$|E

[...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E
