2500|$|On June 5, 2007, Justice Berry imposed three {{consecutive}} sentences on Garson, {{which resulted in}} an aggregate sentence of between 3.5 [...] and 10 years in prison. Garson cried in court, {{and said he was}} [...] "profoundly sorry" [...] for his actions. His lawyers pleaded for leniency {{on the basis of his}} reported alcoholism, bladder cancer, and other medical conditions. Berry rejected Garson's pleas for leniency, saying: <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> beyond reproach. The people of Brooklyn deserve more from you. You are not some bum. Youâ€™re an intelligent man. You went to Penn, and Penn Law School.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am very, very sorry, sir,' said Caldigate, {{turning to}} the old man, 'that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> troubled in so disagreeable a business.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> put {{in such a}} position. It was grossly unfair. I'll {{take care}} that {{nothing of the sort}} occurs again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur, I owe to {{you more}} than my life, for, <b>had</b> it not <b>been</b> for <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> forced into {{marriage}} with one whom I despise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} it is Hastings and I who <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> your supporters, and <b>you</b> who <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> our candidate," [...] Fischer {{suggested}} boldly. [...] "What about it? It isn't too late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know quite}} a lot," [...] Klaus said. [...] "Actually, you saw very little. Strange that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> such an acute observer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shouldn't {{have been}} {{thinking}} about your sleeves in Sunday school. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it." ...|$|E
6000|$|WILLIE. Very much as usual, I believe. But <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here {{ten minutes}} sooner, before {{we began to}} read the lessons. (Laughs.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You disturb me, Charlotte!" [...] he answered, {{his very}} voice {{trembling}} {{as if in}} sympathy with his frame: [...] "I do believe but for <b>you</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> long since in my grave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear sirs," [...] she said, as {{her husband}} {{presented}} the visitors to her, [...] "with what words can I {{thank you for the}} service that you have rendered me. But for <b>you</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> widowed and childless to-day!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so {{very ill}} in Italy, {{about the same}} time as poor Ferdinand was at Armine. Only think, how odd <b>you</b> <b>should</b> both <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so ill {{about the same time}}, and now that we should all be so intimate!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And this, then, is {{the cause}} of your quarrel? Methinks, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sure that the fair lady either desired or {{deserved}} your interference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The whole army, in short," [...] {{cried the}} boy, hastily--"you're so awfully slow, uncle, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{born in the}} last century, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{for your}} {{energies}} {{that is a}} good deal. Only think that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing anything for two hours before you begin to feed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{was just}} going to give her such a scolding for giggling in the garden," [...] said Flora, [...] "and to say we <b>had</b> <b>been</b> as bad as Miss Walkingham. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so awkward, Harry; you nearly betrayed yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "I {{dare say}}! I dare say they won't appear vital to you, Allen. Nothing does. And if I <b>had</b> told <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> met with ridicule, I suppose. But I knew BETTER than to tell; I {{respected}} myself too MUCH." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was {{confidence}} you meant; how much confidence <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> The medicine,--that <b>is</b> half a dollar a vial. Your box holds six." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To think,' said Traddles, 'that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so nearly {{coming home}} as {{you must have}} been, my dear old boy, and not at the ceremony!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] sneered Rotherby, [...] "I declare <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a lawyer. We haven't a pleader of such {{parts and}} such lucidity {{at the whole}} bar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But your firm,"--the {{woman was}} wailing to the {{furniture}} removals men--"your firm promised me everything {{should be in}} yesterday. And it's to-day! <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here yesterday!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said Grandfather Frog. [...] "Chug-a-rum! Be {{content with}} the blessings you have got, Peter Rabbit. Be {{content with the}} blessings you have got. No good comes of wishing for things which it never <b>was</b> meant that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> It <b>is</b> a bad habit and it makes discontent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] {{she said}} at last, turning slowly towards him, [...] "it must be 'No.' Indeed I am sorry, for you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very charming to me, and without <b>you</b> I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dull. But to come to your rooms and dine alone to-night, it is impossible." ...|$|R
60|$|TWISDEN. Yes! Mrs. Dedmond! There's {{the bedrock}} difficulty. As you haven't money, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> pretty. You're {{up against the}} world, and you'll get no mercy from it. We lawyers see too much of that. I'm putting it brutally, {{as a man of}} the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is evident}} {{to me that}} I am not a gentleman," [...] said Weeks. [...] "I don't see why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so {{surprised}} because I was a dissenter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you did it, Miss," [...] {{he said to}} Cecily, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> alone. That {{was what}} I meant. I suppose you think you've cheated me nicely." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lydia {{was about}} to reply sharply; but she checked herself; and her usual {{tranquil}} manner came back as she said, [...] "That {{is no reason why}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Pellissier," [...] he said impressively, [...] "this is an {{unexpected}} pleasure. Come in! Come in, do. I must apologize for my young puppy of a clerk. If I {{had known that}} you <b>were</b> here <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> kept waiting for a second." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> think I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> kept in {{ignorance of}} it, if my {{gamekeeper}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a drunkard? His fellow servants would have warned me." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Brain. If I {{could have}} {{imagined}} how base a fellow <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not then <b>have</b> <b>been</b> troubled with my company.|$|R
60|$|CZARE. No! The people reign now, by {{the grace}} of God.[20] <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> their shepherd; you have fled away like the hireling, and let the wolves in upon them.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is not at}} all to your credit," [...] {{observed}} Mrs. Archibald; [...] "and I do not see how {{you became}} a bishop, or why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Giles--you {{should have}} been my partner. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> my son-in-law," [...] {{the old man said}} at last. [...] "It would have been far better for her and for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "so far as I am concerned, {{you must}} never feel {{anything}} of the kind again. But I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> known it <b>was</b> quite unnecessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was all {{she could}} do to hinder her walk from losing its calm slowness, and before she could divest her {{intended}} reply of undignified sharpness, he continued: 'Who could have betrayed my presence? But for this, I meant that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aware that I was hovering near to watch over you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better to {{have had}} a dish of tea and a game at piquet with them than with some other folks," [...] says Lady Castlewood. [...] "If we had won enough to buy a paper of pins from <b>you</b> we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> content; but young gentlemen don't know what is for their own good," [...] says mamma.|$|R
