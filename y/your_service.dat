25|$|Many Hollywood {{cartoons}} {{from the}} 1930s {{are based on}} feature films. Therefore, it was only natural for Leon Schlesinger's cartoon studio to parody the 1936 Warner Bros. musical film The Green Pastures, itself an adaptation of a play by Marc Connelly which won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1930. The Green Pastures features an all-black cast and proved a success for Warner Bros., despite generating controversy. Animator Friz Freleng had directed the short Sunday Go to Meetin' Time in 1936. The cartoon lampoons African American religious beliefs to the backdrop of jazz music and {{tells the story of}} a rural black man who shirks church on Sunday in favor of worldly pastimes and finds himself in Hell as a result. Clean Pastures was thus keeping with his past work. Freleng even reuses animation of a jitterbugging couple from the Sunday Go to Meetin' Time in Clean Pastures. The short's use of caricatures of famous performers was in the same vein as such Freleng films as At <b>Your</b> <b>Service,</b> Madam and Coo-Coo Nut Grove.|$|E

500|$|The Daily Mail proprietor, Alfred Harmsworth, publicised {{efforts to}} help {{soldiers}} and their families. This drew the attention of Rudyard Kipling, who produced [...] "The Absent-Minded Beggar" [...] on 16 October 1899 and sent the verses to Harmsworth on 22 October with a note that [...] "they are at <b>your</b> <b>service.</b> ... turn [...] over {{to any one of}} the regularly ordained relief-funds, as a portion of your contribution. I don't want my name mixed up in the business except as it will help to get money. It's catchpenny verse and I want it to catch just as many pennies as it can. ... It isn't a thing I shall care to reprint; so there is no need of copyrighting it in America. If any one wants to sing it take care that the proceeds go to our men." [...] It was first published in the Daily Mail on 31 October 1899 and was an immediate success. Maud Tree, the wife of actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, recited it at the Palace Theatre, every night before the show, for fourteen months, and other performers recited it at music halls and elsewhere, giving part of the profits to the fund. The manuscript itself was auctioned for £500, and a Special Edition de Luxe was issued.|$|E
500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of <b>your</b> <b>service</b> and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E

2500|$|The words {{snap-dragon}} and flap-dragon {{can refer}} to the game, the raisins used in the game, or the bowl with brandy and raisins.

2500|$|Their next album, The Low End Theory, {{helped shape}} {{alternative}} hip-hop in the 1990s. It established {{a link between}} their hip hop based music and the jazz genre.

Beats, Rhymes and Life, their subsequent album which was released three years after Midnight Marauders, was considered their darkest work. It lacked the positive and joyful vibe present in their previous albums. Their fifth studio album followed, The Love Movement. It was regarded by critics as returning to the group's positive vibe.
