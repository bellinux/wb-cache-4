500|$|Rebel Heart {{opens with}} the song [...] "Living for Love". Composed in the house genre, it begins with Madonna singing over a [...] "regal" [...] piano line, {{eventually}} joined by percussion. Although a breakup song, [...] "Living for Love" [...] talks about being triumphant and hopeful. According to Dean Piper of The Daily Telegraph, the song has [...] "some classic Madonna traits: religious references, a gospel choir, 90s piano beats and a whirling bass". It was compared to her 1989 singles, [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard. The second track, [...] "Devil Pray", was inspired by how one could be enticed to partake of narcotics to achieve {{a higher level of}} consciousness and connect to God. Lyrically it asks for salvation from a variety of drug abuses, making allusions to Saint Mary and Lucifer, as well as the pain of healing from drug abuse. Produced by Madonna with Falk, Avicii, DJ Dahi, and Blood Diamonds, [...] "Devil Pray" [...] starts with gentle guitar sounds which build up to an electropop production, accompanied by a house beat. [...] "Ghosttown" [...] talks about civilizations ending and the world encountering an armageddon, but humans seeing hope amid the destruction. Written with Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, it is a power ballad song, which Madonna sings in [...] "piercing" [...] and [...] "warm" [...] vocals like those of Karen Carpenter's, and the production is comparable to her 1986 single, [...] "Live to Tell". According to Douglas, [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was written in three days, after Madonna personally requested studio time with him and the other songwriters. The fourth track, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch", has reggae, dancehall, and dubstep influences, and is a ska song where Madonna speaks negatively about a break-up and her lover, in lyrics such as: [...] "It might sound like I'm an Unapologetic Bitch but sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it like it is". Madonna explained that the song is about having fun irrespective of the situation one is in.|$|E

Traditionally, when lawyers give hourly rates, consumers have difficulty predicting how much a case will end up costing them, as many have little idea how long their case will take.|$|E
5000|$|Of his {{professional}} career in newspapers, LeDuff states: [...] "I’m not a journalist, I’m a reporter. The {{difference between a}} reporter and a journalist is that a journalist can type without looking. The problem with journalism is its self-importance. Like in the New York Times, there’s style guides; you can’t call a doctor a physician, you got to call him a doctor- too high falutin’. You can’t call an undertaker a mortician- too high falutin’; you got to call him an undertaker. You can’t call a lawyer an attorney, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him a lawyer. But somehow, since we control it, and we’re very self-important people, you can call a reporter a journalist." ...|$|E

[...] Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, [...] "CGI for car stunts doesnt make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? ... I dont think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in 92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2. And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, theres twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I dont feel it in my stomach. Its just action." ...|$|E

5000|$|Nicolas-Gatineau {{is one of}} {{the schools}} in Gatineau that now has a school uniform. The school was known to be against uniforms because they say that every student is {{different}} and they should be allowed to express themselves by the way they dress. On the other hand, the school has rules about clothes, for example: No sign of violence ( [...] skulls, guns...etc. [...] ) are allowed on clothes, shirts have to cover the stomach and must be 10 centimeters above the knee.

5000|$|Tor Books {{published}} The Incrementalists on September 24, 2013. The Winnipeg Free Press {{described it}} as [...] "witty, sometimes cheeky," [...] and Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "philosophical and inventive urban fantasy," [...] citing the cerebral appeal of its [...] "layered mystery, innovative concept, and fast-moving plot." [...] In a starred review in Booklist, David Pitt wrote that the novel was imaginative, but difficult to categorize: [...] "It's not quite a comedy, but bits of it are quite funny. It's a fantasy, to be sure, but it’s grounded in today's world and references real historical events. It's cleverly constructed, populated with characters readers will enjoy hanging out with, and packed with twists and nifty surprises. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it something, call it genius at work." [...] Library Journal called it [...] "an odd stepchild of magical realism, with hints of John Crowley, Tim Powers, and even a dash of Umberto Eco", while the Daytona Beach News-Journal found the book most reminiscent of a Roger Zelazny novel.|$|E
