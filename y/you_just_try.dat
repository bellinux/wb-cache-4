Speaking about his technique, Fonville said, [...] "You concentrateand then <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> to explode across the circle." [...] His coach, Ken Doherty, described Fonville as [...] "one of the hardest working, most studious athletes" [...] he had ever coached. Doherty also added that Fonville's technique distinguished him from most shot putters: [...] "Fonville drives completely across the ring in one continuous motion. Previously, most shotputters made their initial hop and hesitated before their final drive. ... Any track coach looking at him, would recognize all the points of good form.

[...] One columnist described Fonville's steady improvement from his freshman year in 1946 through his junior year in 1948 and concluded: [...] "Small as shot-putters go, Fonville is the greatest in the long history of sensational [...] heavers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, The Globe and Mail {{reported}} that Sonia Zhao quit her teaching position at McMaster University's Confucius Institute in Hamilton, Ontario, and sought political asylum in Canada based on religious discrimination. In a complaint filed to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Ms. Zhao stated {{she was forced}} to hide her belief in the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which the Chinese government calls an illegal [...] "evil cult", and argued that McMaster [...] "is giving legitimization to discrimination." [...] She told an interviewer that during her CI training in Beijing, she was told that if students asked about Tibet or other sensitive topics, [...] "Don’t talk about this. If the student insists, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> to change the topic, or say something the Chinese Communist Party would prefer." [...] Andrea Farquhar, McMaster’s assistant vice-president of public and government affairs, said the university was [...] "looking for clarity" [...] from its Chinese partners on aspects of their agreement, notably hiring practices. Having lent its name to the Confucius Institute on its campus, Ms. Farquhar said McMaster was insisting that Canadian laws and expectations be respected. In 2013, McMaster University announced they would close their Confucius Institute. Andrea Farquhar explained that after months of making a concerted effort to save their 5-year partnership with Hanban, [...] "We were uncomfortable, and felt that it didn’t reflect the way the university would do hiring", and explained that McMaster’s Chinese partners replied with a letter expressing [...] "some disappointment." [...] Ms. Zhao, a Chinese citizen, has since been granted refugee status in Canada.|$|E

5000|$|Duffy also {{ushered in}} the era of {{electronic}} trading at CME Group. An early advocate, he lobbied traders to adopt an electronic Eurodollar contract in the early 2000s, an unpopular view at the time. Duffy told Forbes, [...] "I can't regret what I did.

6000|$|The {{meeting at}} the station was a bright one, though so short, as {{scarcely}} to be worth the journey, if the value of such moments were to be reckoned by their number. There was Lord Marchmont to be spoken to, as well as Gerald, which broke into the time. Gerald looked very happy and pleasant. He said Edmund was the best fellow in the world, {{and that he had}} been very happy--shot lots of things--he wished he could stop to tell about it. Then Marian hurried what she had to say, while Lionel was looking after his luggage. [...] "Gerald, would <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> if you can do anything to spare Lionel's eyes?

I tell you, Peter Ivanovitch, that half a dozen young men do not come together nowadays in a shabby student's room without your name being whispered, not as a leader of thought, but as a centre of revolutionary energies--the centre of action. What else has drawn me near you, do you think? It is not what all the world knows of you, surely. It's precisely what the world at large does not know. I was irresistibly drawn-let us say impelled, yes, impelled; or, rather, compelled, driven--driven," [...] repented Razumov loudly, and ceased, as if startled by the hollow reverberation of the word [...] "driven" [...] along two bare corridors and in the great empty hall.|$|E

2500|$|Like Wooden, Scates {{established}} himself as an innovator, changing a deliberate game to the fast paced sport it is today. [...] "Until the late ’60s, the game was a very slow game,” Scates said. [...] "You didn’t try to deceive anybody. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> to set a high ball to the outside and if your hitter {{was better than the}} blockers you scored a point.

He laughed, because he said, you know, [...] "I'm one to talk." [...] And then he was actually the first one that told me about risking his life every night jumping whatever it was twenty feet in the last act of Hamlet. And the truth of it is I didn't just stay up three days and three nights for the scene; it was a good excuse, because these were the days of wine and roses in Studio 54.|$|E
50|$|I {{think one}} has {{to try to be}} as {{accurate}} as possible. You have to wear the right clothes, and in my case I wore a white wig, because I'm playing her as a mature Queen rather than when she was a younger woman.
