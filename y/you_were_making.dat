The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said [...] "you {{had to remind}} {{yourself}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> a film". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he [...] "brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance" [...] while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him [...] "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted that he [...] "plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful." [...] However, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt the performance {{was an example of}} [...] "hipsterism misdirected". He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Motion Picture Drama. The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million. Gosling's second on-screen appearance of 2010 was in the mystery film All Good Things with Kirsten Dunst, based on a true story. He played the role of New York real-estate heir Robert Durst, who was investigated for the disappearance of his wife (played by Dunst). Gosling found the filming process to be a [...] "dark experience" [...] and did not undertake any promotional duties for the film. When asked if he was proud of the film, he replied, [...] "I'm proud of what Kirsten does in the movie." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt he [...] "gets so deep into character you can feel his nerve endings." [...] Mick La Salle of the San Francisco Chronicle found the [...] "chameleonic Gosling is completely convincing as this empty shell of a man". Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film belonged to Dunst, but noted that Gosling [...] "is good too". The film grossed $644,535 worldwide.|$|E

From the Statement of Faith, to the replacement of a new pastor, the entire set of bylaws is listed {{in the back of}} this book. A significant part of the bylaws is the universal pay scale Haggard instituted for all pastoral staff. Including himself, all pastors were paid on the same scale so that the longer one was employed, the better the pay became. There were also provisions for numbers of children in a family and years of pastoral experience.
