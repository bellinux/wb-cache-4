My colleagues and I have already described a case of sclerosing peritonitis in a CAPD patient (1). You emphasized recurrent infections and use of acetate as possible explanations to gradual anatomic changes of the peritoneum. These two conditions were present in our patient. However, you did not mention certain characteristics of this condition, which were present particularly in the patients reported by Gandhi et at (2). In these observations of sclerosing peritonitis, the major mode of presentation was not the decrease in ultrafiltration. In our patient no mea-surements of the ultralfiltration rate were made but on clinical assessment, water balance seeemed adequate and thus we did not suspect thickened peritoneum. It was only when a laparotomy was performed because of persisting peritonitis that we disclosed the unsuspected presence of thickened peritoneum. Pathologic findings of sclerosing peritonitis are similar irrespective of the clinical presentation. I suggest that two clinical patterns of sclerosing peritonitis may exist in CAPD patients: a) those with a "progressive decrease in ultrafiltration rate " and b) those with "chronic (a) septic peritonitis " as its main presentation...|$|R
