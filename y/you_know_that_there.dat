Suppose <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> exists some real number x with p(x)=0 (for instance if n is odd and a'n is non-zero, then p(−M) and p(M) have opposite sign for sufficiently large absolute values of M, and then, {{because of the}} intermediate value theorem, there exists a root in between). The only possible rational roots of this polynomial equation are of the form r/s where r is a divisor of a0 and s is a divisor of a'n; there are only finitely so many such candidates you can check by hand. If neither {{of them is a}} root of p, then x must be irrational. For example, this technique can be used to show that x=(21/2+1)1/3 is irrational: we have (x3−1)2 = 2 and hence x6−2x3−1=0, and this latter polynomial does not have any rational roots (the only candidates to check are ±1).|$|E
