When Cao Ren hears that we've infiltrated his rear, he'll definitely retreat." [...] Zhou Yu agreed to Liu Bei's suggestion.|$|E

There's really no need to try to take a picture of someone—in fact, how can you prove the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?... And to install this stuff on anyone's computer and not notify them about, it is just begging for a world of pain." [...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X. Cringely wrote in InfoWorld: [...] Is there any reason why you'd need to take two weeks' worth of photos to locate a missing laptop, especially when you already have other ways of tracking it?
