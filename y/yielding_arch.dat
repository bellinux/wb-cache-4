40|$|<b>Yielding</b> <b>arch</b> support {{being used}} in German mining almost exclusively, more and more comes up against {{limiting}} factors. The consequence is lacking strata control, and hence {{a high rate of}} accident risk due to late bearing characteristics and, for that reason loosened surrounding rock. In addition to that setting the heavy support components means high physical stress to the heading worker. This work cannot be mechanized. A new support concept, canopy compound support, has been tested in scale models to optimize both its rock mechanical effect and ergonomy. To achieve these two aims, coordination of the support setting activities with the roadheading-system as a whole is crucial besides optimal handling capacity of the single components. The canopy compound support has been tested on a special test rig in scale 1 : 3. Already available experimental data concerning <b>yielding</b> <b>arch</b> support and roof-bolting, facilitated a direct comparison and hence a purposeful optimization of special support characteristics, e. g. yieldability after breaking of the surrounding rock. The experiments in scale 1 : 3 were prepared on a test rig in scale 1 : 20, which allowed for a great number of variants being tested, as well as load-control being optimized in advance. In addition to that, single components have been tested on their own: experiments have been carried out with scale models of the polygonsegments as well as with numerical models using FEM: several variants of arch legs have been tested. As a conclusion of the investigations to hand, which include an ergonomical study, as well, it can be said, that the canopy compound system is a promising support combining the advantages of both <b>yielding</b> <b>arch</b> support and roof-bolting. This should now be proved underground. (orig.)

40|$|Bumping {{is one of}} the nat ural hazards {{that occur}} in Polish collieries. It is a common {{phenomenon}} but difficult to predict and very often it causes huge losses in mining equipment and roadway structure. Death of miners working underground is most severe result of bumping. To re duce or even to eliminate results of bumping, especially fatal cases, many safety measures have been used. Frame of arch support {{is one of the}} measures applied to reduce dangerous results of bumping. Simulation test of impact load of arch yielding support was presented in the paper. The simulation of support load was realized in two stages. Static load of frame of <b>yielding</b> <b>arch</b> support was simulated at the first stage.

The systems SOUT (support choice and dimensioning, 1989), SOUT 2, PLANANK (planning of bolt-support), Exos (layout planning diagnosis, 1994), Sout 3 (1995) {{have been developed}} in close cooperation by CdF 1, INERIS 2, EMN 3 (France) and RAG 4, DMT 5, TH- Aachen 6 (Germany); ISLSP (Integrated Software for Layout and support planning) development is in progress (completion scheduled for July 1996). This new software technology in combination with conventional programming systems, numerical models and existing databases {{turned out to be}} suited for setting-up an intelligent decision aid for layout and roadway support planning. The system enhances reliability of planning and optimises the safety-to-cost ratio for: • deformation forecast for roadways in seam and surrounding rocks, consideration of the general position of the roadway in the rock mass (zones of increased pressure, position of operating and mined panels). • support dimensioning • <b>yielding</b> <b>arches,</b> rigid arches, porch sets, rigid rings, yielding rings and bolting / shotcreting for drifts • <b>yielding</b> <b>arches,</b> rigid arches and porch sets for roadways in seam • bolt support for gateroads (assessment of exclusion criteria and calculation of the bolting pattern) • bolting of face-end zones (feasibility and safety assessment; stability guarantee). 1 Charbonnages de France, French collieries. ^ Institut National de l'Environnement et des RISques industriels: National Institute for Environment an...|$|R
40|$|A Pd/C-HCl {{catalytic}} system is highly active and selective in the hydrogen transfer from H 2 -CO to ArCHOHCOOH for {{the synthesis of}} ArCH 2 COOH (Ar is para substituted with a OH group). Typical reaction conditions are: temperature 50 – 70 °C; PCO 20 – 80 atm; solvent; acetonitrile; substrate/Pd/HCl/H 2 O = 200 – 400 / 1 / 25 – 100 / 500 – 2000; [Pd] = 0. 6 − 1. 2 mmol•l− 1. The reaction rate is approximately of the first order with respect to ArCHOHCOOH. The yield increases with the increasing of PCO and of the temperature, as expected, and passes through a maximum with the increasing of the concentration of H 2 O and of HCl. The proposed catalytic cycle proceeds through the following steps. (i) H 2 O and CO interact with the metal giving rise to an intermediate having a Pd-COOH moiety, which, upon β-hydride abstraction, gives off CO 2 with formation of a Pd-H species. (ii) The starting substrate is in equilibrium, {{in the presence of}} HCl, with the corresponding chloride ArCHClCOOH, which adds to the metal forming an intermediate having a Pd-CH(Ar) COOH moiety. (iii) This species interacts with the hydride <b>yielding</b> the product <b>ArCH</b> 2 COOH and regenerating the catalyst.

As we saw above, § XIV., the round <b>arch</b> <b>yielding</b> to the Gothic, by allowing {{a point to}} emerge at its summit, so {{here we have the}} Gothic conceding something to the form which had been assumed by the round; and itself slightly altering its outline so as to meet the condescension of the round arch half way. At page 137 of the first volume, I have drawn to scale one of these minute concessions of the pointed arch, granted at Verona out of pure courtesy to the Venetian forms, by one of the purest Gothic ornaments in the world; and the small window here, fig. 6, is a similar example at Venice itself, from the Campo Santa Maria Mater Domini, where the reversed curve {{at the head of the}} pointed arch is just perceptible and no more. The other examples, figs. 3 and 7, the first from a small but very noble house in the Merceria, the second from an isolated palace at Murano, show more advanced conditions of the reversed curve, which, though still employing the broad decorated architrave of the earlier examples, are in all other respects prepared for the transition to the simple window of the fifth order.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{classification}} system for German coal mining {{is the result}} of approximately 100 years of experience in roadway development and longwall mining. It is also based on different research projects covered by national and European research programs. Over the past 30 years, more then 600, 000 m of road-ways have been driven and employed for mining activities. To properly describe the German rock mass {{classification system}}, therefore, it is useful {{to take a look at}} the main geomechanical preferences and common support systems. The decision about the most effective development technique and support system is based on a synthesis of rock mass classification and geomechanical analysis. The properties of surrounding rock, the in situ stress, and the influence of mining activities in several seams at each German mine must be considered for the evaluation of the expected deformation of the roadway. The mine layout, the requirements of ventilation and fire prevention, as well as the need to maintain emergency escape routes for the miners, require that the gate roads remain usable after the passage of the longwall face in most cases. Moreover, the gate roads must be maintained despite the high stresses that are applied during longwall retreat mining. Therefore, gate road design must address a broad spectrum of potential deformation environments. In the past, when gate roads were supported solely with <b>yielding</b> steel <b>arches,</b> lithologic descriptions of the surrounding strata conditions were adequate for the dimensioning of support and the prediction of the roadway deformation. The current conditions of multiple-seam mining at depths of up to 1, 700 m require combined support systems, including pattern bolting and backfilled steel arches. Rock bolt support is used for development, after which (typically 50 - 100 m outby the face) the steel arches are installed and backfilled with building material (concrete) in order to achieve an optimized development rate. The rock mass classification system described below was developed especially for the conditions of German hard-coal mining. It includes the stress distribution caused by multiseam workings (including crossing goaf edges of former longwalls), as well as in situ stresses due to greatdepth and the presence of tectonic faults. It is based on the evaluation of four parameters: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical analysis of drill cores 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical observation of the development face 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical classification of tectonic structures (faults) 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Standard classification derived from geotechnical assessment and evaluation of stress conditions (using numerical modeling for stress calculation) ROCK STRENGTH One of the most important input parameters for describing strata conditions is the strength of the rock. The German classification system is based on a description of lithotypes. This method has been used successfully since the 1950 s and is based mainly on the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the material. An evaluation of the rock strength observed in a survey of approximately 82, 500 samples of rock core yielded the results shown in Figure 1. The three most common coal measure rock types are mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Each shows a specific mean UCS level and a different spread between the minimum and maximum values. Sandstones, in particular, have a wide spectrum of compressive strength, ranging from approximately 40 MPa to greater than 130 MPa, with an average of 85 MPa. The causes of this wide range include different sedimento-logical preconditions, facies, and digenetic processes. [...|$|R
