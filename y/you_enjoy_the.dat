2500|$|On Question Time on 20 January 1994, Archer {{said that}} 18 {{should be the}} age of consent for gay sex, as opposed to 21, which {{it was at the}} time. Archer though was opposed to the age of consent for gay men being 16. Historian David Starkey was on the same edition, and said of Archer: [...] "Englishmen like you enjoy sitting on the fence so much because <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> sensation." [...] Archer has also {{consistently}} been an opponent of a return to capital punishment.|$|E
2500|$|... (Under {{the orders}} of your gallant {{commander}} chef de bataillon Dominé, you 600 men held off an entire army for 36 days, in a small outpost overlooked from all sides. [...] You victoriously repelled seven assaults. [...] One man in every three of you and nearly all your officers were scorched by mines or struck by Chinese bullets and shells; but {{the bodies of the}} enemy still choke the three breaches vainly made in the fortress's defences. [...] Today, <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> admiration of the brave soldiers who have relieved you at the cost of so much hardship and bloodshed. [...] Tomorrow, all France will applaud you. [...] Furthermore, you will all be able to say with pride: [...] "I served in the Tuyen Quang garrison; I was on the gunboat Mitrailleuse.") ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] the Marquis conceded. [...] "I may {{be wrong}} to ignore the {{literature}} of the present day, but such attempts as I have made to appreciate it have been unsatisfactory. <b>You</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>the</b> play, dear?" ...|$|R

60|$|As for the trifling petulance {{which the}} rage of party stirs up in little minds, though it should show itself even in this court, it has not made the {{slightest}} impression on me.

As a general principle, the root vowel of a [...] word was broadly sounded, and the rest slurred over.

60|$|DON JUAN. Senor Commander: I do {{not blame}} your disgust: a picture gallery is a dull {{place for a}} blind man. But even as <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> contemplation of such romantic mirages as beauty and pleasure; so would I enjoy the contemplation of that which {{interests}} me above all things namely, Life: the force that ever strives to attain greater power of contemplating itself. What made this brain of mine, do you think? Not the need to move my limbs; for a rat with half my brains moves as well as I. Not merely the need to do, but the {{need to know what}} I do, lest in my blind efforts to live I should be slaying myself.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Dishart," [...] I said solemnly, {{rising and}} facing him, and {{disregarding}} his question, [...] "if that woman {{is to be}} your wife, {{it will be at}} a cost you cannot estimate till you return to Thrums. Do you think that if your congregation knew of this gypsy marriage they would have you for their minister for another day? Do <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> prospect of taking one who might be an earl's wife into poverty--ay, and disgraceful poverty? Do you know your mother so little as to think she could survive your shame? Let me warn you, sir, of what I see. I see another minister in the Auld Licht kirk, I see you and your wife stoned through our wynds, stoned from Thrums, as malefactors have--been chased out of it ere now; and as certainly as I see these things I see a hearse standing at the manse door, and stern men denying a son's right to help to carry his mother's coffin to it. Go your way, sir; but first count the cost." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Reverend Samuel {{appeared}} silently at {{the carriage}} door, and assisted {{his mother to}} get out ("Did <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> drive, Sammy?" [...] asked the old lady. [...] "Beautiful scenery, my dear, wasn't it?") Young Pedgift, on whom the arrangements for exploring the Broads devolved, hustled about, giving his orders to the boatman. Major Milroy, placid and patient, sat apart on an overturned punt, and privately looked at his watch. Was it past noon already? More than an hour past. For the first time, for many a long year, the famous clock at home had struck in an empty workshop. Time had lifted his wonderful scythe, and the corporal and his men had relieved guard, with no master's eye to watch their performances, with no master's hand {{to encourage them to}} do their best. The major sighed as he put his watch back in his pocket. [...] "I'm afraid I'm too old for this sort of thing," [...] thought the good man, looking about him dreamily. [...] "I don't find I enjoy it as much as I thought I should. When are we going on the water, I wonder? Where's Neelie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 134. And here it may {{be noted}} in passing, that, if <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> pursuit of analogies and types, and have any {{ingenuity}} of judgment in discerning them, you may always accurately ascertain what are the noble characters {{in a piece of}} painting by merely considering what are the noble characters of man in his association with his fellows. What grace of manner and refinement of habit are in society, grace of line and refinement of form are in the association of visible objects. What advantage or harm there may be in sharpness, ruggedness, or quaintness in the dealings or conversations of men; precisely that relative degree of advantage or harm there is in them as elements of pictorial composition. What power is in liberty or relaxation to strengthen or relieve human souls; that power precisely in the same relative degree, play and laxity of line have to strengthen or refresh the expression of a picture. And what goodness or greatness we can conceive to arise in companies of men, from chastity of thought, regularity of life, simplicity of custom, and balance of authority; precisely that kind of goodness and greatness may be given to a picture by the purity of its color, the severity of its forms, and the symmetry of its masses.|$|E

60|$|Facing again then to Florence proper {{you have}} local colour enough and to spare--which <b>you</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> more, doubtless, from {{standing}} {{off to get}} your light and your point of view. The elder streets abutting on all this newness bore away {{into the heart of}} the city in narrow, dusky perspectives that quite refine, in certain places, by an art of their own, on the romantic appeal. There are temporal and other accidents thanks to which, as you pause to look down them and to penetrate the deepening shadows that accompany their retreat, they resemble little corridors leading out from the past, mystical like the ladder in Jacob's dream; so that when you see a single figure advance and draw nearer you are half afraid to wait till it arrives--it must be too much of the nature of a ghost, a messenger from an underworld. However this may be, a place paved with such great mosaics of slabs and lined with palaces of so massive a tradition, structures which, in their large dependence on pure proportion for interest and beauty, reproduce more than other modern styles the simple nobleness of Greek architecture, must ever have placed dignity first in the scale of invoked effect and laid up no great treasure of that ragged picturesqueness--the picturesqueness of large poverty--on which we feast our idle eyes at Rome and Naples. Except in the unfinished fronts of the churches, which, however, unfortunately, are mere ugly blankness, one finds less of the poetry of ancient over-use, or in other words less romantic southern shabbiness, than in most Italian cities. At two or three points, none the less, this sinister grace exists in perfection--just such perfection as so often proves that what is literally hideous may be constructively delightful and what is intrinsically tragic play on the finest chords of appreciation. On the north side of the Arno, between Ponte Vecchio and Ponte Santa Trinita, is a row of immemorial houses that back on the river, in whose yellow flood they bathe their sore old feet. Anything more battered and befouled, more cracked and disjointed, dirtier, drearier, poorer, it would be impossible to conceive. They look as if fifty years ago the liquid mud had risen over their chimneys and then subsided again and left them coated for ever with its unsightly slime. And yet forsooth, because the river is yellow, and the light is yellow, and here and there, elsewhere, some mellow mouldering surface, some hint of colour, some accident of atmosphere, takes up the foolish tale and repeats the note--because, in short, it is Florence, it is Italy, and the fond appraiser, the infatuated alien, may have had in his eyes, at birth and afterwards, the micaceous sparkle of brown- stone fronts no more interesting than so much sand-paper, these miserable dwellings, instead of suggesting mental invocations to an enterprising board of health, simply create their own standard of felicity and shamelessly live in it. Lately, during the misty autumn nights, the moon has shone on them faintly and refined their shabbiness away into something ineffably strange and spectral. The turbid stream sweeps along without a sound, and the pale tenements hang above it like a vague miasmatic exhalation. The dimmest back-scene at the opera, when the tenor is singing his sweetest, seems hardly to belong to a world more detached from responsibility.|$|E
