25|$|Columbia University Professor John McWhorter {{has pointed}} out that Shakespeare’s {{language}} is no longer entirely ours. Granted, he says, with the help of notes and time to study them, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre {{in a matter of seconds}} while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that will do for a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.|$|E

500|$|Foster {{signed for}} League Two side Rotherham United on 20 June 2011. He signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club, with an option of a second year. Foster made his debut for the club in a 3–0 home victory against Gillingham on 27 August 2011, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Rotherham already holding a three-goal advantage. After making no further first-team appearances the following month, Foster was made available for loan by manager Andy Scott. Scott stated Foster lacked both desire and fitness since signing for the club — [...] "If {{you want to be}} match fit, you get yourself match fit. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> in training, you can stay behind, you have days off, you can get yourself fit. Luke has not been in the side and that tells you everything you need to know". However, no loan move materialised, and Foster made his second appearance for Rotherham in a 3–3 away draw at Morecambe on 25 October 2011. He appeared as a 27th-minute substitute in the club's following match four days later, a 1–1 draw against Northampton Town, and subsequently made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Aldershot Town on 5 November — Rotherham's first win in 10 matches. In December 2011, Rotherham manager Andy Scott revealed that Foster would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season {{as a result of a}} cruciate ligament damage sustained in a match against Hereford United on 10 December 2011. He was released by Rotherham in May 2012, having made six appearances for the club.|$|E

500|$|On January 7, 1986, John Poindexter {{proposed}} {{to the president}} a modification of the approved plan: instead of negotiating with the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian political group, the United States would negotiate with [...] "moderate" [...] members of the Iranian government. Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government, so {{with the hope of}} the release of the hostages, Reagan approved this plan as well. Throughout February 1986, weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the United States (as part of Oliver North's plan, without the knowledge of President Reagan) and none of the hostages were released. Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another international voyage, this one to Tehran; bringing with him a gift of a bible having a handwritten inscription by Ronald Reagan; and, according to George Cave a cake baked {{in the shape of a}} key. Howard Teicher described the cake as a joke between North and Ghorbanifar. He met directly with Iranian officials associated with Rafsanjani that sought to establish U.S.-Iranian relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages. [...] The American delegation comprised McFarlane, North, Cave (a retired CIA agent who worked in Iran in the 1960s–70s), Teicher, an Israeli diplomat Amiram Nir and a CIA translator [...] arrived in Tehran in an Israeli plane carrying forged Irish passports on 25 May 1986. This meeting also failed. Much to McFarlane's disgust, he did not meet ministers, and instead met in his words [...] "third and fourth level officials". At one point, an angry McFarlane shouted: [...] "As I am a Minister, I expect to meet with decision-makers. Otherwise, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> with my staff". The Iranians requested concessions such as Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which the United States rejected. More importantly, McFarlane refused to ship spare parts for the Hawk missiles until the Iranians had Hezbollah release the American hostages whereas the Iranians wanted to reverse that sequence with the spare parts being shipped first before the hostages were freed. The differing negotiating positions led to McFarlane mission going home after four days. After the failure of the secret visit to Tehran, McFarlane advised Reagan not to talk to the Iranians anymore, advice that was disregarded.|$|E

2500|$|In {{collaboration}} with his close friend, George deBenneville Keim—who had bought Gowen's Pottsville home in 1864, and was subsequently appointed {{first president of}} the Coal & Iron Co.—Gowen's perhaps most crucial business bet was made upon these lands: [...] development of the Pottsville Twin Shaft Colliery. [...] This enterprise was based on a theory of mining the Schuylkill Basin coal field promoted by Eli Bowen in his 1862 book, Coal, and the Coal Trade, where he called for [...] "large capital" [...] to sink two [...] "enormously deep and permanent shafts" [...] to a depth of two thousand feet [...] "before a single pound of coal is allowed to be sent to market." [...] "ith night and day shifts,” Bowen estimated, the shafts “could be sunk down within two or three years." [...] Shafts once sunk, the [...] "mining would be carried on night and day, with three eight-hour shifts." [...] "fterwards <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> it like a machine." [...] The object of these deep diggings was to reach the famous Mammoth Vein, an undulating seam of high-quality anthracite twenty-five feet thick, projected as providing a virtually inexhaustible supply. [...] This indeed was the shared vision and plan of Gowen and Keim from the outset of the Coal & Iron Co.|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff {{was known}} for his {{technical}} ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. “Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina,” he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. [...] "There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I think I just have more than most other players." [...] On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: [...] "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate." [...] As Van Basten noted, “Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being interested in that aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That’s why he’s been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was always the one to decide how the game should be played.” In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, [...] "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports." [...] Sports writer David Miller believed Cruyff superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him [...] "Pythagoras in boots" [...] for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, [...] "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another." ...|$|E
