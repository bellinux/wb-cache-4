60|$|Your several despatches received. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> on General Halleck. Telegraph him at once. I have telegraphed {{him that}} you are in trouble.|$|E
6000|$|... "The chef <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> him," [...] she answered. [...] "A {{very clever}} man, no doubt, in his way, but {{takes a lot}} of keeping in order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it absurd," [...] I said, smiling {{with an air}} of superiority. [...] "I {{arrived here}} in a {{perfectly}} comfortable condition, neither heated nor wearied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, admitting this, {{where there}} are two captains, one must outrank the other, and the senior commands. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> be <b>called</b> Commodore Marble." ...|$|R
60|$|APOLLODORUS. I {{have only}} one word of blame, most beautiful. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> have <b>called</b> upon me, your knight; and in fair duel I should have slain the slanderer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wildrake!" [...] said Markham--"Wildgoose <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be <b>called.</b> <b>You</b> {{have been}} {{moistening}} your own throat to some purpose, {{and using it}} to gabble tunes very suitable to the times, to be sure!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said 'Manda Grier judicially, [...] "I she'd {{think it}} was 'bout time they was both of 'em dropped, 'T any rate, I don't want <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> me Miss Grier--Lemuel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ask that}} {{question}} of you, Gallus. What now? Marcus, whom <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> no ill name, and who was overwhelmed {{through no fault of}} his own, fighting like a hero, has vanished----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] she remarked, [...] "that, as you decline to {{recognize}} the name given to that young woman by our institution, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> her Miss Raynor; but I will say no more of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really don't see," [...] I began, just {{a little}} annoyed, [...] "why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> feel <b>called</b> upon to {{interfere}} in an English election at all, unless it is to help a friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>called</b> me, Miss Mysie, and I'd have sorted her well! You kenned well 'tis a thing {{not to be}} {{done and}} at your age; ye should have minded your duties better.' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Should</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> me, or <b>should</b> me <b>call</b> <b>you.</b> - Object pronoun of gapping {{functioning}} as subject ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gillie-blackfoot <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> him, Janet," [...] was my response, [...] "for he {{is neither}} more nor {{less than an}} imp of the devil, come to torment me for COPY, for so the {{printers}} call a supply of manuscript for the press." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Tom, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> him out. It is {{just the}} {{position}} in which a brother is bound to {{do that kind of}} thing for his sister. When he has been called out, then probably he'll come round, and all will be well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> him a recreant knight, I cannot for {{the life}} of me understand," [...] she said. [...] "But it seems that Sir Francis, who is not exactly in his first youth, is {{supposed}} to be as attentive as a young turtle dove." ...|$|E
6000|$|Erling {{thought in}} his own mind, [...] "One false step always necessitates another; <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>called</b> {{a meeting of the}} Thing before putting down anyone;" [...] however, he did not give {{utterance}} to the thought, but said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped for}} a moment, and then she said: [...] "You know I told <b>you</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>call</b> me Kate, being so much younger; but, as you are so much younger, you may kiss me if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do not {{understand}} this riddle of Destiny,' continued the young Queen. 'If you, Parcæ, have predestined that a man should commit a crime, {{it appears to me}} very unjust that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> afterwards <b>call</b> upon the Furies to punish him for its commission.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> her a weird Gawd-help-us, either. A very {{charming and}} {{beautiful}} girl. Odd {{in some of}} her views perhaps--one does not quite {{see eye to eye}} with her in the matter of stars and rabbits--but not a weird Gawd-help-us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Though {{certainly}} I don't {{know why}} you should,' said Dora, or why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it a happiness at all. But of course you don't mean what you say. And I am sure no one doubts your being at liberty to do whatever you like. Jip, you naughty boy, come here!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because his {{occupation}} is reading. He {{does nothing}} else. Always {{there is a}} book {{in his hand and}} always he is thinking of the things he reads. He does not often speak, even to his daughter; he does not have friends who visit him. If <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> at the mansion, then you will be the first people who have done so for three years." ...|$|E
60|$|I shall take {{pleasure}} in giving any further information in my power <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> on me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{was telling}} that story {{to our new}} neighbour, Colonel Quaritch, last night--a very nice fellow, by the way; <b>you</b> <b>should</b> go and <b>call</b> upon him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} <b>you</b> what I <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it, Mr. Cuthbert," [...] she said, [...] "I {{will tell you}} what I believe it is! It is blood-money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{got into}} a very bad scrape," [...] Ronald answered, [...] "a scrape that has spoilt my whole life; but we will not talk about that. But I would rather, if you don't mind, that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> me by my own name now we are together. If {{we get out of}} this I shall be Sergeant Blunt again, but I should like you to call me Ronald now." ...|$|E
6000|$|II. There is righteousness {{put into}} them, before they act righteous things. A righteousness, I say, put into them; or I had rather that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it a {{principle}} of righteousness; for it is {{a principle of}} life to righteousness. Before man's conversion, there is in him a principle of death by sin; but when he is converted to Christ, there is put into him a principle of righteousness, that he may bring forth fruit unto God. (Rom 7:4-6) ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{suddenly}} appeared to her young friend {{that there was}} something helpless, confused and even slightly comical in her state. The impression was mollifying, and he too, like Lord Canterville, had begun to long for a short cut. He relaxed a moment and, leaning toward his hostess with a smile and his hands on his little knees, he said softly: “It seems to me a question of no importance. All I desire is that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> me your son-in-law.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's nonsense, Mr. Clavering. My falsehood, if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{choose to}} <b>call</b> me false, is {{of a very}} {{different}} nature, and is pardonable by all laws known to the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, if I'd had {{the naming}} of <b>you</b> I <b>should</b> have <b>called</b> <b>you</b> Maria of the Soapsuds. You're always torturing these wretched brats with soap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I {{would not}} like that," [...] she wrote quickly, with a distressed look on her face. [...] "Nobody ever calls me that. It would make me feel as if I were not myself but {{somebody}} else. And you do not seem like a stranger to me. Is there any reason why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>call</b> me Kilmeny?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The epithet {{applied to}} Minna, aggravated by the {{deliberate}} emphasis laid on it, jarred on Mr. Keller's sense of justice. [...] "It appears to me," [...] he said, [...] "that your daughter acted in this matter, {{not only with}} the truest kindness, but with the utmost good sense. Mrs. Wagner and my sister's physician were both present at the time, and both agreed with me in admiring her conduct. What has she done to deserve that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> her thoughtless?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Come night, come darkness, for you cannot {{come too}} soon or stay too long {{by such a}} place as this! Come, straggling lights into {{the windows of the}} ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at least with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so sullenly above the iron gate, on which the {{poisoned}} air deposits its witch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> to every passerby, [...] "Look here!" ...|$|E
60|$|Secondly, There is righteousness {{put into}} them, before they act righteous things. A righteousness, I say, put into them; or I had rather that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it a {{principle}} of righteousness; for it is {{a principle of}} life to righteousness. Before man's conversion, there is in him a principle of death to sin; but when he is converted to Christ, there is put in him a principle of righteousness, that he may bring forth fruit unto God; Rom. vii. 4-6.|$|E
6000|$|But this barely {{struck her}} now. [...] "What, in that case, <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> counting? You haven't come {{out where you}} are, I think, to please ME." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What a droll {{thing is}} history,' said Fakredeen. 'Ah! if I were only acquainted with it, my {{education}} would be complete. <b>Should</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> me a Gentile?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Two {{weeks before}} his murder, Peter had confronted his son about his {{dishonesty}} in an email: [...] "Did you forge my signature as a co-signer?... What {{the hell are}} <b>you</b> doing? <b>You</b> <b>should</b> have <b>called</b> me to discuss it... I'm calling Citibank this morning {{to find out what}} you have done and am going to tell them I'm not to be on it as a co-signer." ...|$|R
