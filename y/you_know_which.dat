5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.|$|E

Brooks' romantic comedy How Do <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> <b>which</b> starred Witherspoon {{as a former}} {{national}} softball player who struggles to choose between a baseball star boyfriend (Owen Wilson) and a business executive being investigated for white-collar crime (Paul Rudd). The movie was filmed in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. {{during the summer and}} fall of 2009 and released on December 17, 2010. The movie was both a critical and box office failure. Despite a budget of more than $100 million, the film earned only $7.6 million in its opening weekend, leading the Los Angeles Times to call it [...] "one of the year's biggest flops". The movie earned mainly negative reviews from critics, scoring 35% on Rotten Tomatoes with 111 reviews as of late December 2010.|$|E

Dalley notes [...] "She was obsessed with meeting Hitler, so she really set out to stalk him." [...] Pryce Jones elaborates: [...] She set her mind on getting Hitler, and she discovered that Hitler's movements could be ascertained. It's one of the extraordinary things about Hitler's daily life that he was so available to the public. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> café he'd be in, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> restaurant he'd be in, which hotel, and he would just go and meet people over sticky buns and cakes, and it was possible to meet him like that.
