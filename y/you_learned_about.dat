40|$|Background. The {{concept of}} the `heartsink patient' is well known and much used when talking about general practice. The {{opposite}} {{of this type of}} patient, however, has been little explored. Objective. To identify patient characteristics valued by GPs. Methods. Structured interview to collect narratives from GPs of individual patients, analysed qualitatively through thematic analysis and word frequency. Setting. Primary Care in Ireland. Participants. GP trainers. Main outcome measures. Emergent themes from four lead questions: Tell me about a patient you like, Tell me about the patient's personality, What have <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> yourself as a GP?, What is different about being a GP as opposed to any other kind of doctor? In addition, a corpus linguistic analysis of word frequencies disclosed further themes, not identifiable on the surface of discourse. Results. Ten themes were identified: GPs valued patients who were likeable, a challenge, involved them in negotiation of the doctor-patient relationship, were interesting or virtuous and had a positive effect. GPs valued their profession in that they were facilitators, gave and elicited loyalty, formed personal attachments and had a different perspective. Conclusions. `Heartlift patients' may be a robust concept, to counterbalance heartsink patients. Data collected are suitable for training, and could help GPs enhance a sense of vocation...|$|E

40|$|In {{chapter 3}} of the lecture notes, <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the prism {{compressor}} and grating compressor. Both compressor types use geometrical path length differences to generate negative group delay dispersion. (a) Read the paper O. E. Martinez et. al., ’Negative group-velocity dispersion using refraction’, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 1 (10), 1003 - 1006 (1984) to get {{familiar with the}} idea that refraction as well as diffraction off a grating will always result in negative group delay dispersion (GDD). Show that this is the case for the grating compressor. If one wants to do chirped-pulse amplification as mentioned in the lecture notes or one wants to compress pulses in the anomalous dispersion regime of optical materials (e. g. pulses in the 1. 3 µm to 1. 6 µm wavelength range, where almost all transparent materials exhibit anomalous dispersion), large amounts of adjustable positive dispersion is required. Here, we will find out how to obtain positive GDD from a grating arrangement. (b) Use the above mentioned paper by Martinez to derive the GDD of a grating compressor. Hint: you just have to do the calculation for a two-grating compressor arrangement- the full GDD of a four-grating compressor is twice the result you will get. (c) Now, modify your equation for the case of an arrangement as shown in Fig. 2 of the Martinez paper (grating- telescope- grating). Show that this modified optical setup can be used to produce positive GDD. (d) How would one choose the magnification factor in a real-world implementation of such a pulse stretcher? And where would you put the grating if you wanted to implement an optical pulse shaper...|$|E

30|$|Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications (CRPI) {{is a new}} journal with ambitions. Not only do we want {{to publish}} first-rate {{cognitive}} research, we want to change the standard way that our discipline thinks about basic and applied research. The standard view is dichotomous: Is your research basic, fundamental, and pure or applied, translational, and practical? We know about dichotomies in our trade. Remember when <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the nature-nurture debate? The topic might have been intelligence or mental illness, and the question was framed in terms of whether this attribute of our lives was due to our genetic endowment or to what we had learned in the world. Some cases were reasonably clear: eye color — nature; memory for the names of U.S. Republican presidential candidates — nurture. However, for the more interesting cases, we learned soon enough that the correct answer is almost never nature or nurture; it is both. Having gotten that question right on the midterm, we moved on to a discussion of how much of intelligence or mental illness or whatever can be attributed to genes and how much to environment. Eye color and Republican candidates’ names hold down the two ends of a nature-nurture continuum, but where is something like intelligence on that continuum? The press and the Internet are fond of this exercise. “Thank your parents if you are smart,” says the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail, because “up to 40  % of a child’s intelligence is inherited.” What does such a claim mean? The article does go on {{to say that this is}} an estimate of how much variance is explained by genetics. Interestingly, these discussions of apportioning variance tend to stick with the main effects and never discuss the interaction term in this implicit two-way analysis of variance, though much of the action presumably lies in that interaction term.|$|E
40|$|For {{teachers}} {{from within the}} early childhood education and care sector, working with children and families in the current societal context has become increasingly problematic (Gardner, 1999, 2003; Prout, 2003 a, 2003 b). From one standpoint, {{research has indicated that}} much of the difficulty associated with working in this field is symptomatic of the uncertainty, discontinuity and insecurity characteristic of the post-modern condition (Dahlgren & Chiriac, 2009; Hulqvist & Dahlberg, 2001; Jenks, 1996 a, 1996 b; Lyotard, 1984; Prout, 2003 a, 2003 b). As authors of this paper, whilst we agree with this particular standpoint, {{it can be argued that}} the aforementioned perspective can be seen as an over-simplification of the problems in the ECEC field. While the characteristics of the post-modern condition may be considered to be at the heart of some of these problems, the complexities of current policy reform, the demands of neo-liberal approaches to the provision of care and education (Ball, 2003; Beck, 1999; Hulqvist, 1998; Popkewitz, 2000; Rose, 1999, 2000), as well as a lack of understanding of current contexts for children and their families compound the present state of play across the sector (Moss, 2003; Prout, 2003 a). Thus, new demands are evident for teachers in the ECEC field in relation to both personal and professional skill development. Therefore preparation for understanding the impact these contexts have on their identity development is critical to evaluating pre-service educator’s university experiences in contract with the reality of the rural practice context. On the grounds that learners view and interpret new information and experiences through their existing network of knowledge, experience and beliefs (Dahlgren & Chiriac, 2009; Darling-Hammond, 1997; Helm, 2006), the project’s design acknowledges and anticipates that the beginner teachers' experiences will be shaped, in part, by what they 'bring' to those experiences, including their initial choices to enter the profession, and their prior conceptions and expectations about teaching and initial teacher preparation (Helm, 2006). In this case study, juxtaposition between preconceptions and expectations of pre-service teacher education and early experiences as beginning teacher in a rural Australian context are explored and the key research questions guiding data interrogation include: o	What are the connections between your initial expectations about becoming a teacher and commencing your university studies and the reality of teaching in a rural context? o	How has this influenced or shaped your professional identity and learning? o	How has the rural context impacted upon the manifestation of the curriculum, impacting your professional decisions and development? o	How do you use the knowledge, skills and abilities developed at University in your professional context? o	What have <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> yourself as an individual as well as you as a professional? What will you do differently now as an outcome of your professional learning thus far? A model of critical reflection is used to interrogate the data from interviews and facebook postings over a 2 year period. Key themes emerged and these relate to the concept of teacher identity, the role of relationships, a sense of agency, the notion of relevance, and the central presence of emotion. In this paper these themes are presented as core features of the experience of 'becoming a teacher'. ...|$|E
