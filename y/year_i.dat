This {{particular}} flat has many memories {{for me and}} {{is a very interesting}} part of our history. In what would have been John's 70th <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> am grateful to you all for commemorating John and this particular part of his London life, one which spawned so much of his great music and great art.|$|E

5|$|In 1952 {{the company}} moved its Cardiff venue to the Sophia Gardens Pavilion (built for the Festival of Britain), with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra as the company's orchestra, {{replacing}} the previous ad hoc ensemble. The Pavilion was acoustically mediocre and lacked an orchestra pit; {{two years later}} the company moved again, to the New Theatre where it played Cardiff seasons across the next fifty years. The 1952 season attracted particular interest because it included {{what was then a}} rarity: Verdi's Nabucco. The company built a reputation for staging seldom-seen Verdi works, including The Sicilian Vespers staged in the same <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> Lombardi in 1956, and The Battle of Legnano, under the shortened title The Battle, in 1960. The 1952 Nabucco was the WNO's first production for which costumes and scenery were specially designed (by Patrick Robertson) rather than hired.|$|E

It was ratified by public referendum, but normal legal processes were suspended before it could take effect.|$|E

Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1987, Fältskog {{travelled}} to Malibu, California, to record her fourth post-ABBA solo album, I Stand Alone, produced by Peter Cetera (formerly of the band Chicago) and Bruce Gaitsch, who had collaborated on Madonna's La Isla Bonita. Released in November of that <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> Stand Alone was a minor hit in Europe, except in Sweden where it spent eight weeks at No. 1 and became the best-selling album of 1988. More than 300,000 copies were sold throughout Scandinavia. According to Hans Englund, the Swedish head of WEA, more than 800,000 copies were sold globally. However, chart-wise outside of Scandinavia, the results were less impressive.|$|E
25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when I mention that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last <b>year</b> <b>I</b> rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised.

25|$|The first {{attempts}} to bring platform games into 3D used 2D graphics and an isometric perspective. These games are nearly {{as old as}} the genre itself, one of the earliest examples being Sega's Congo Bongo in 1983. The first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was Konami's platform game Antarctic Adventure, where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles. Originally released in 1983 for the MSX computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year, including an arcade version, NES, and ColecoVision. That same <b>year,</b> <b>I,</b> Robot, though not a platformer, featured filled 3D polygonal graphics, flat shading, and camera control options, which were not widely adopted by platformers until the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Jobs then {{learned his}} family history. Six {{months after he}} was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, {{and they had a}} daughter, Mona. Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a <b>year.</b> <b>I</b> organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.|$|E

In his sophomore year, he was absent from required chapel attendance 14 times and from classes 56 times. In his last year there, he wrote, [...] "During Freshman <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> did nothing, during Sophomore <b>year</b> <b>I</b> did nothing, during Junior <b>year</b> <b>I</b> did nothing, and during Senior <b>year</b> <b>I</b> have thus far done nothing in the way of college studies." [...] In his senior year, {{he became one of the}} editors of Harvardiana literary magazine, to which he contributed prose and poetry that he admitted was of low quality. As he said later, [...] "I was as great an ass as ever brayed & thought it singing." [...] During his undergraduate years, Lowell was a member of Hasty Pudding and served both as Secretary and Poet.|$|E

500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the <b>year</b> <b>I</b> started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the <b>year</b> <b>I</b> started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E

West, who was vocal in his displeasure with past award snubs, responded onstage during a concert on the Watch the Throne Tour, saying [...] "That's my fault for dropping Watch the Throne and Dark Fantasy the same <b>year.</b> <b>I</b> should've just spaced it out, {{just a little bit}} more." ...|$|E
