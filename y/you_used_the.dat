This license of expression in relation to what you have seen in the precincts of a convent proves to me that you are out of the pale of the Holy Catholic Church. You have no right, therefore, to expect any explanation; but I will give you one, nevertheless, as a favor. The slain man died, unabsolved, in the commission of mortal sin. We infer so much from the paper which we found on his body; and we know, by the evidence of our own eyes and ears, that he was killed on the territories of the Church, and in the act of committing direct violation of those special laws against the crime of dueling, the strict enforcement of which the holy father himself has urged on the faithful throughout his dominions by letters signed with his own hand. Inside this convent the ground is consecrated, and we Catholics are not accustomed to bury the outlaws of our religion, the enemies of our holy father, and the violators of our most sacred laws in consecrated ground. Outside this convent we have no rights and no power; and, if we had both, we should remember that we are monks, not grave-diggers, and that the only burial with which we can have any concern is burial with the prayers of the Church. That is all the explanation I think it necessary to give. Wait for me here, and you shall see the paper." [...] With those words the father superior left the room as quietly as he had entered it.|$|E

Instead, you closed on the target and blatantly disobeyed the direction to [...] "hold fire." [...] Your failure to follow that order is inexcusable. I do not believe you acted in defense of Major Umbach or yourself.

5000|$|Games are {{the main}} example {{considered}} by Wittgenstein in his text where he also mentions numbers and makes an analogy with a thread. He develops his argument further by insisting that in such cases {{there is not a}} clear cut boundary but there arises some ambiguity if this indefiniteness can be separated from the main point.In §66 Wittgenstein invites us to [...] consider for example the proceedings that we call [...] "games"...to look and see whether there is anything common to all. The section mentions card games, board games, ball games, games like ring-a-ring-a-roses and concludes: And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; we can see how similarities crop up and disappear.And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network ofsimilarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities. The following §67 begins by stating: I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than [...] "family resemblances"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way. - And I shall say: [...] "games" [...] form a family. and extends the illustration for instance the kinds of number form a family in the same way. Why do we call something a [...] "number"? Well, perhaps because it has a direct relationship with several things that have hitherto been called number; and this can be said to give it an indirect relationship to other things we call the same name. And we extend our concept of number as in spinning a thread we twist fibre on fibre. And the strength of the thread does not reside in the fact that some one fibre runs through its whole length, but in the overlapping of many fibres. The problem of boundaries begins in §68 I can give the concept 'number' rigid limits ... that is, use the word [...] "number" [...] for a rigidly limited concept, but I can also use it so that the extension of the concept is not closed by a frontier. And this is how we do use the word [...] "game". For how is the concept of a game bounded? What still counts as a game and what no longer does? Can you give the boundary? No. You can draw one; for none has so far been drawn. (But that never troubled you before when <b>you</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "game".) ...|$|E
