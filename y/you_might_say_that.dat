500|$|Coward was {{homosexual}} but, {{following the}} convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned. The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 {{was close to}} an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: [...] "Forty years ago he was Slightly in Peter Pan, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he has been wholly in Peter Pan ever since. No private considerations {{have been allowed to}} deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E

This guy wears bad luck like the grimy trenchcoats of his protagonists, only his zipper's stuck and he can't seem to shake the damn thing off." [...] In expressing his negativity, he {{believed}} [...] "Dark City looks like a million bucks (or rather, a million bucks gone to compost), but at its dark heart it's a tedious, bewildering affair, lovely to look at {{but with all the}} substance of a dissipating dream." [...] Left equally disappointed was John Anderson of the Los Angeles Times. Commenting on the directing, he thought [...] "If you had to guess, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Proyas came out of the world of comic art himself, rather than music videos and advertising. Dark City is constructed like panels in a Batman book, each picture striving for maximum dread." [...] He went on to say, Proyas was [...] "trying simultaneously to create a pure thriller and sci-fi nightmare along with his tongue-in-cheek critique of artifice. And this doesn't work out quite so well." [...] Author TCh of Time Out, felt the development of the Murdoch character was [...] "surprisingly engrossing" [...] and thought production wise, the [...] "art direction is always striking, and unlike most contemporary sci-fi, the movie does risk a cerebral approach, tapping a vein of postmodern paranoia." ...|$|E

60|$|We landed Jim {{on top of}} the head, with an American flag {{to protect}} him, it being a foreign land; then we sailed off to this and that and t'other distance, to git what Tom called effects and {{perspectives}} and proportions, and Jim he done the best he could, striking all the different kinds of attitudes and positions he could study up, but standing on his head and working his legs the way a frog does was the best. The further we got away, the littler Jim got, and the grander the Sphinx got, till at last it was only a clothespin on a dome, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say.</b> <b>That's</b> the way perspective brings out the correct proportions, Tom said; he said Julus Cesar's niggers didn't know how big he was, they was too close to him.|$|R

"If she did, Hurry, she'd do no more, I'm afeard, {{than most}} queens on their thrones, and ladies in the towns," [...] {{answered}} Deerslayer, smiling, and turning back towards his companion with every trace of feeling banished from his honest-looking and frank countenance. [...] "I never yet know'd even a Delaware of whom <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> much.

60|$|The sudden {{taking off}} {{of so many}} men {{directly}} before our eyes, and the knowledge that if the cannon ball had inclined ever so slightly toward the east, we, instead of them, would have gone out from this world forever, served not to dampen our joy and triumph, but to cast a veil over it, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> so <b>that</b> we spoke in whispers, and did not indulge in mirth; but carried ourselves much as people do {{in the presence of}} the dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you could}} buy some--to-morrow morning, for example. A {{thousand}} mining shares would do.

6000|$|... "And often, when {{woman was}} nigh to winning to the empery {{of my mind}} over me, I sought Laulani's shin-bone. And often, when lusty manhood stung me into feeling over-proud and lusty, I {{consulted}} the spearhead remnant of Keola, one-time swift runner, and mighty wrestler and lover, and thief of {{the wife of a}} king.

60|$|THOMAS DE QUINCEY (1785-1859).
