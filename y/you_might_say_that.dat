The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 {{was close to}} an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: [...] "Forty years ago he was Slightly in Peter Pan, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he has been wholly in Peter Pan ever since. No private considerations {{have been allowed to}} deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E

This guy wears bad luck like the grimy trenchcoats of his protagonists, only his zipper's stuck and he can't seem to shake the damn thing off." [...] In expressing his negativity, he {{believed}} [...] "Dark City looks like a million bucks (or rather, a million bucks gone to compost), but at its dark heart it's a tedious, bewildering affair, lovely to look at {{but with all the}} substance of a dissipating dream." [...] Left equally disappointed was John Anderson of the Los Angeles Times. Commenting on the directing, he thought [...] "If you had to guess, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Proyas came out of the world of comic art himself, rather than music videos and advertising. Dark City is constructed like panels in a Batman book, each picture striving for maximum dread." [...] He went on to say, Proyas was [...] "trying simultaneously to create a pure thriller and sci-fi nightmare along with his tongue-in-cheek critique of artifice. And this doesn't work out quite so well." [...] Author TCh of Time Out, felt the development of the Murdoch character was [...] "surprisingly engrossing" [...] and thought production wise, the [...] "art direction is always striking, and unlike most contemporary sci-fi, the movie does risk a cerebral approach, tapping a vein of postmodern paranoia." ...|$|E

60|$|We landed Jim {{on top of}} the head, with an American flag {{to protect}} him, it being a foreign land; then we sailed off to this and that and t'other distance, to git what Tom called effects and {{perspectives}} and proportions, and Jim he done the best he could, striking all the different kinds of attitudes and positions he could study up, but standing on his head and working his legs the way a frog does was the best. The further we got away, the littler Jim got, and the grander the Sphinx got, till at last it was only a clothespin on a dome, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say.</b> <b>That's</b> the way perspective brings out the correct proportions, Tom said; he said Julus Cesar's niggers didn't know how big he was, they was too close to him.|$|R

"If she did, Hurry, she'd do no more, I'm afeard, {{than most}} queens on their thrones, and ladies in the towns," [...] {{answered}} Deerslayer, smiling, and turning back towards his companion with every trace of feeling banished from his honest-looking and frank countenance. [...] "I never yet know'd even a Delaware of whom <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> much. But {{here is the}} end of the long p'int you mentioned, and the 'Rat's Cove' can't be far off." ...|$|R
6000|$|O'Flaherty {{looked at}} his {{companion}} with amused surprise. [...] "Faith, Terence, {{that would be a}} change indeed, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hope the time will come when you can whip off a fellow's leg without his feeling pain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] she said,--"if our regrets and remorse were {{at our own}} disposal! <b>You</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is {{too late}} for unhappiness, too late for weariness, too late for all the misery that comes from a life's disappointment." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It'll be {{a disgrace}} to Yellowhammer," [...] said Trinidad, [...] "if it throws Cherokee down on his Christmas tree blowout. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> that man made this town.

But we were having such fun outside snowballing, and like that, that we got deeper into it before we gave it a second thought." ...|$|E
60|$|The sudden {{taking off}} {{of so many}} men {{directly}} before our eyes, and the knowledge that if the cannon ball had inclined ever so slightly toward the east, we, instead of them, would have gone out from this world forever, served not to dampen our joy and triumph, but to cast a veil over it, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> so <b>that</b> we spoke in whispers, and did not indulge in mirth; but carried ourselves much as people do {{in the presence of}} the dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you could}} buy some--to-morrow morning, for example. A {{thousand}} mining shares would do.

That would give you six months at any rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And often, when {{woman was}} nigh to winning to the empery {{of my mind}} over me, I sought Laulani's shin-bone. And often, when lusty manhood stung me into feeling over-proud and lusty, I {{consulted}} the spearhead remnant of Keola, one-time swift runner, and mighty wrestler and lover, and thief of {{the wife of a}} king. The contemplation of them has ever been of profound aid to me, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> well <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I have founded my religion or practice of living upon them." ...|$|R
60|$|THOMAS DE QUINCEY (1785-1859). It {{used to be}} said in {{a college}} {{classroom}} that what De Quincey wrote was seldom important and always doubtful, but {{that we ought to}} read him for his style; which means, as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> caviar is a stomach-upsetting food, but we ought to eat a little of it because it comes in a pretty box.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{only too}} natural. Isn't it {{perfectly}} natural for an invalid {{like that to}} want to keep her daughter with her; and isn't it perfectly natural for a daughter, with a New England sense of duty, to yield to her wish? <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she could get married and live at home, and then she and Glendenning could both devote themselves--" ...|$|E

Quite the customary thing with us over there. And you might say, generally, who I am." ...|$|E
5000|$|Canadian {{film critic}} Dean Duncan {{reviewed}} The Romance of Transportation in Canada and considered {{it one of}} Colin Low's finest works.

5000|$|Schwartz stated: I was striving, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> for <b>that</b> mirror-image, that opposite. And out of {{a machine}} which would reveal the {{negative}} Superman, came the mirror image — always remembering that in a mirror everything is reversed... The times were such that one-dimensional characters, your standard superheroes, even in comics, seemed rather simplistic, like paper cut-outs. What was demanded was the full dimensional personality — a figure that carried a shadow, if you like. I was certainly inspired to some degree also by C.G. Jung's archetype of [...] "the shadow" [...] — and Bizarro certainly reflected that, as well. [...] Alvin Schwarz ...|$|R

No. If my uncles will permit it and there is time, I will do my poor best for fifty--only, sir, I advise you against it, since to win that bad {{likeness}} you must sit for many weary hours." ...|$|E

60|$|BROADBENT [a little {{impatient}} of this unbusinesslike view]. Yes, yes; but {{you know}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> of any country. The fact is, {{there are only two}} qualities in the world: efficiency and inefficiency, and only two sorts of people: the efficient and the inefficient. It don't matter whether they're English or Irish. I shall collar this place, not because I'm an Englishman and Haffigan and Co are Irishmen, but because they're duffers and I know my way about.|$|E
