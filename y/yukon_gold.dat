5|$|The Silver Seven {{participated in}} {{perhaps the most famous}} Stanley Cup {{challenge}} of all, that of Dawson City of the Yukon Territory in 1905. Organized by Joe Boyle, a Toronto-born prospector, who had struck it rich in the <b>Yukon</b> <b>gold</b> rush of 1898, The Dawson City Nuggets had Lorne Hanna, who had played for Brandon against Ottawa in a 1904 challenge and two former elite hockey players: Weldy Young, who had played for Ottawa in the 1890s, and D. R. McLennan, who had played for Queen's College against the Montreal Victorias in an 1895 challenge. The remaining players were selected from other Dawson City clubs. Dawson City's challenge was accepted in the summer of 1904 by the Stanley Cup trustees and scheduled to start on Friday, January 13, 1905. The date of the challenge meant that Young had to travel separately to Ottawa, as he had to work in a federal election that December and would meet the club in Ottawa.|$|E

25|$|The Holyoke Building (or Holyoke Block) is a {{historic}} building located in downtown Seattle, Washington. It is a substantial five story brick structure with stone trimmings. Construction began {{at the corner of}} First Avenue and Spring Streets just before the Great Seattle fire of 1889. Completed in early 1890, it was the first permanent building completed and ready for occupancy in downtown Seattle following the fire. Today the Holyoke Building is {{one of the very few}} such buildings still standing in Seattle outside of the Pioneer Square district and is {{a historic}} remnant of the northward expansion of Seattle's business district between the time of the great fire and the <b>Yukon</b> <b>Gold</b> Rush in 1897.|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} primary routes from Seattle to the <b>Yukon</b> <b>gold</b> fields. One was by ship to the {{south-east}} Alaskan towns of Dyea and Skagway, and then via land for 30 miles over high mountain passes {{from where the}} miners could travel down the tributaries of the Yukon River. The other route was longer and more costly but faster and less grueling: Miners would take a coastal steamer to the Yukon delta port of St. Michael, from where they could transfer to a river steamer to head up the Yukon River. The Roanoke was brought to Seattle specifically by the North American Transportation and Trading Company to serve the long coastal route to St. Michael, sometime calling at intermediate ports such as Dutch Harbor. The NATTC began advertising the Roanokes service in March 1898.|$|E
25|$|When the {{perceived}} threat of Irish nationalist receded, {{focus of the}} Canadian intelligence system shifted. Limited intelligence was collected between the 1884-85 Red River Rebellion, and anarchists also {{caught the attention of}} the Canadian service a decade later. Then, after a lock at the Welland Canal was dynamited in 1900 by Irish nationalists prompting renewed state interest in the organization, and between 1901 and 1903 another group, the Order of the Midnight Sun, a U.S. annexation movement, was the target of Canadian intelligence. During the <b>Yukon</b> <b>Gold</b> Rush, the NWMP provided the federal government with considerable intelligence, and for the next two decades RNWMP and DP attention turned to other immigrants, political organizations, and unions, such as the Socialist Party of Canada (SPC), the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and the One Big Union (OBU).|$|E
500|$|Hawke's next film, 1991's White Fang, {{brought his}} first leading role. The film, an {{adaptation}} of Jack London's novel of the same name, featured Hawke as Jack Conroy, a <b>Yukon</b> <b>gold</b> hunter who befriends a wolfdog (played by Jed). According to The Oregonian, [...] "Hawke {{does a good job}} as young Jack... He makes Jack's passion for White Fang real and keeps it from being ridiculous or overly sentimental." [...] He then appeared in Keith Gordon's A Midnight Clear (1992), a well-received war film based on William Wharton's novel of the same name. In the survival drama Alive (1993), adapted from Piers Paul Read's , Hawke portrayed Nando Parrado, one of the survivors of the 1972 Andes flight disaster.|$|E

2500|$|Minto was one {{of three}} steamboats built of steel and wood that were {{intended}} for service on the Stikine River during the Klondike gold rush. [...] The other vessels were Moyie and Tyrrell. The Canadian Pacific Railway which commissioned the vessels had hoped to develop an [...] "All-Canada" [...] route to the <b>Yukon</b> <b>gold</b> fields that bypassed the other routes, generally through Skagway, Dyea, or from St. Michael on the Bering Sea {{all the way up the}} long Yukon River.

Stander's wife, who had convinced him to buy the property, would sue him for {{the building}} in 1906 during the couple's scandalous and highly publicized divorce in 1906. [...] Unable to fill all of the building's office space, subsequent owners leased entire floors as lofts or to light manufacturing firms. The Northwest Fixture & Electric Company, who during the gold rush supplied miners with electric motors and generators for mining and lighting, occupied the upper floors between 1894 and 1900 and had their name prominently painted across the building's facade. J. Kobi & Company manufactured toiletries {{on the fifth floor}} until moving to their own building in 1923.|$|E

The Schwabacher Wharf had been just far enough north to survive the Great Seattle Fire in 1889. In the 1890s, it was the site of two prominent events in the city's history. The freighter Miike Maru opened Seattle's Japan trade by docking there August 31, 1896. Less than a year later, July 17, 1897, the steamship Portland arrived from Alaska bearing a [...] "ton of gold", from the Klondike, Yukon.

6000|$|When this sailor-miner had {{accumulated}} $20,000 worth of dust {{he concluded that}} civilization {{was good enough for}} him, and proceeded [...] "to pull for the outside." [...] From the Mackenzie he went up the Little Peel to its headwaters, found a pass through the mountains, nearly starved to death on his way across to the Porcupine Hills, and eventually came out on the Yukon River, where he learned for the first time of the <b>Yukon</b> <b>gold</b> hunters and their discoveries. Yet for twenty years they had been working there, his next-door neighbours, virtually, in a land of such great spaces. At Victoria, British Columbia, previous to his going east over the Canadian Pacific (the existence of which he had just learned), he pregnantly remarked that he had faith in the Mackenzie watershed, and that he was going back after he had taken in the World's Fair and got a whiff or two of civilization.|$|E

Of particular value was the fact that Lynn Canal provided access to the <b>Yukon,</b> where <b>gold</b> was found in 1896. The dispute was fought between Canada and The United States of America, and finally settled in 1903 with the British, weary from fighting in the Boer War, ruled that the Canal was part of Alaska, not British Columbia.|$|R

In the meantime, in January 1898, both Armstrong and Wardner sold out their shares in the International Trading Company, and went north to Alaska {{to participate in the}} Klondike Gold Rush, with Armstrong deciding to try his chances at making money as a steamboat captain on the Stikine River then being promoted as the [...] "All-Canadian" [...] route to the <b>Yukon</b> River <b>gold</b> fields.|$|R

On the Stikine River, Armstrong served with the famous steamboat captain John Irving. Together with A.F. Henderson, Armstrong built a steamboat, Mono for the Teslin Transportation Company of Victoria, BC. As might be expected from a vessel designed by Armstrong, Mono had excellent shallow water performance. [...] When the Stikine river route collapsed as an alternate access to the Klondike in July 1898, Mono was taken under tow to St. Michael, Alaska for service on the Yukon River.|$|R

5000|$|The Klondike Gold Rush of 1898-1899 {{changed the}} region greatly. The {{population}} of the area reached 30,000, composed largely of Americans.

50|$|The Canadian Klondike Mining Company began {{operating}} the dredge in May 1913. After eleven years of operation, it had cut {{its way to}} the Boyle Concession, where it sank in 1924. By 1927, it had been refloated and worked its way to Hunker Creek, where it could produce up to 800 oz of gold a day at claim 67 Below Discovery. It ceased operations in the area on 11 July 1940, and was rebuilt by the <b>Yukon</b> Consolidated <b>Gold</b> Corporation on Bonanza Creek, where it resumed operations on 11 September 1941. The wooden hull of the original dredge was discarded, left in the pond where it sank, but all other parts were salvaged for use in the reconstructed dredge.
