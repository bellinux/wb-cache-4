25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

"There was {{a saying}} in my {{childhood}} that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> always <b>tell</b> when it was six o'clock in the evening, because {{at that moment the}} entire city would begin to vibrate with the force of everybody's chopping.

500|$|J. P. Davis was {{inspired}} to write the script after observing an older trainer working with a young boxer in a Brooklyn gym: [...] "I watched the guy spar. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> he wasn't going anywhere, but you could never convince the trainer. He's almost a caretaker. He's watching out for you completely. You could see the devotion involved." [...] Drawing upon material originally created for his critically acclaimed one-man off-Broadway show [...] "Dreamer Awakens," [...] Davis completed the script in 1999 and moved to Los Angeles.|$|E

In addition, he identified {{an homage to}} Revolutionary Girl Utena upon looking at GIFs of Pearl's sword-fighting scene with her hologram clone. Writing for Cartoon Brew, Kendra Beltran noted that Lonely Blade imitated the style of anime, stating that [...] "while the Universe team didn't overdo the animation on the anime, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{what they were going}} for without hearing the accents." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} [...] "Bam Thwok" [...] is, {{according}} to Deal, [...] "about loving everyone, showing goodwill to everyone". The lyrics are typically surreal and offbeat; Deal's main {{inspiration for the}} song and its title was a discarded art book she found on a New York City street while on tour in the late 1990s. She later described the book: [...] "From the handwriting, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that this book must have belonged to a little kid. This kid had written a short story, a paragraph really, about a party {{that took place in}} another universe, about people and monsters that were partying together.

According to reports, Usher has {{to spend more time}} with his then-pregnant wife. The expected November release date was booked to coincide with that of Usher's fragrance line. Released on May13,2008. The continually changing release dates became frustrating for Usher; Dupri said to Billboard, [...] "The last couple [...] times I've been around , <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> he's got the bug to hurry up and put this record out. He wants to get back out here and give the people that. He's got that itch."

According to MacFarlane, the episode {{polarized}} viewers, who either [...] "hated or loved the violence". Ryan J. Budke from AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, specifically praising the scene in which Stewie beats up Brian. Budke also {{said that it was}} [...] "fun" [...] and that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the crew had a good time making it. Overall, he considered it [...] "not a bad episode. The scene eventually {{became one of the most}} popular videos on YouTube." [...] The episode ranked number 1 in IGN's Top 10 Musical Moments in the show, for [...] "Shipoopi," [...] and Brian and Stewie's fight in the bathroom was named the 5th greatest fight scene in the show on another list.|$|E
500|$|Before {{embarking on}} the storyline, the show's {{producers}} consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation {{to ensure they}} maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything, either, and write from {{a place where they}} didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. And <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry." ...|$|E

500|$|Before Lois {{prepares to}} undergo in vitro fertilization, Dr. Hartman shows her several photos of babies {{conceived}} by celebrity couples, including actress Shelley Duvall and singer-songwriter James Blunt; actress Hilary Swank and actor Gary Busey; Olympic medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner and physicist Stephen Hawking; and actress, writer and comedian Tina Fey and actor Joaquin Phoenix. Beginning the procedure, Lois objects to Dr. Hartman's method of embryonic insertion. In response, he replies, [...] "Well, perhaps <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them—if only you spoke Hovitos," [...] {{a reference to}} Raiders of the Lost Ark. Later, {{in an attempt to}} cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of Grey's Anatomy DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the [...] "Acme Miscarriage Kit", a boxing glove attached to a crossbow. In a reference to the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Peter ultimately ends up missing with the crossbow, causing the glove to bounce and hit a large rock and land inches in front of him as he is standing on a narrow cliff. The ground then drops out from underneath his feet, causing him to fall like Wile E. Coyote.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford used a heavy bat——nicknamed [...] "Big Bertha". Opposition players {{sometimes}} {{joked that}} Ponsford's bat {{was larger than}} allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it {{was found to be}} slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting. Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that [...] "if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> he was heading for his second hundred". When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, [...] "What colour did [...] look to you after it was worn?" [...] Ponsford replied, [...] "I never noticed its colour, only its size." [...] A later study identified Ponsford's specific colour vision as protanopia, a form of dichromacy in which red appears dark. Ponsford did not enjoy batting on rain-affected wickets. When on tour his teammates did not ask if it had rained last night, merely [...] "Did Ponny wake during the night?"—legend had it that even the slightest trickle would wake him and have him anguishing over having to bat on the [...] "sticky" [...] in the morning.|$|E
500|$|Illmatic {{has been}} noted {{as one of the}} most {{influential}} hip hop albums of all time, with pundits describing it as an archetypal East Coast hip hop album. Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork writes: [...] "No album better reflected the sound and style of New York, 94. The alembic of soul jazz samples, SP-1200s, broken nose breaks, and raw rap distilled the Henny, no chaser ideal of boom bap." [...] Citing Illmatic as part of a string of notable albums released in 1994, David Drake of Stylus Magazine writes [...] "This was the critical point for the East Coast, a time when rappers from the New York area were releasing bucketloads of thrilling work". John Bush of Allmusic compares Illmatic to another DJ Premier production, The Sun Rises in the East (1994), as [...] "one of the quintessential East Coast records". Along with the critical acclaim of the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (1993) and the success of The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut Ready to Die (1994), Illmatic was also instrumental in restoring interest in the East Coast hip hop scene. [...] "Rarely has the birthplace of hip-hop," [...] wrote Rob Marriott of Complex, [...] "been so unanimous in praise of a rap record and the MC who made it." [...] As Nas later recounted: [...] "It felt amazing to be accepted by New York City in that way...at the time a lot of West Coast hip-hop was selling; East Coast wasn't selling as much, especially for a new artist. So back then you couldn't tell in the sales, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> in the streets".|$|E

500|$|She {{explained}} that {{in developing the}} relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of the season four finale, with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it.

During April, the Thames was dredged and six more bodies were discovered, including Doris Marmon and Harry Simmons—Dyer's last victims.

2500|$|She maintains, however, {{that she}} still refuses to sing [...] "Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)" [...] because she dislikes the monotony of the {{repeated}} chorus.
