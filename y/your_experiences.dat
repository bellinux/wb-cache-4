In a June 2010 interview with The Columbians Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, [...] " [...] the stuff that {{people are talking about}} on the streets...to get attention, you have to speak their language. You have to interest them, gain their trust, talk to them and show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of <b>your</b> <b>experiences.</b> Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion".|$|E

40|$|Suppose {{that you}} are looking at a vase of flowers {{on the table in front}} of you. You can {{visually}} attend to the vase and to the flowers, noticing their different features: their colour, their shape and the way they are arranged. In attending to the vase, the flowers and their features, you are attending to mind-independent objects and features. Suppose, now, that you introspectively reflect on the visual experience you have when looking at the vase of flowers. In doing so, you might notice various features of <b>your</b> <b>experience,</b> for exam-ple that individual petals on the flowers are difficult to distinguish. Although in introspection your interest is in the character of <b>your</b> <b>experience,</b> <b>your</b> attention is still to the objects of <b>your</b> <b>experience</b> – to the mind-independent vase and the flowers. Since attending to <b>your</b> <b>experience</b> involves attending to the mind-independent objects and features of <b>your</b> <b>experience,</b> <b>your</b> experi-ence seems introspectively to involve those mind-independent objects and features. 2 In general, then, when we introspect a visual experiential episode, it seems that we are related to some mind-independent object or feature that is present and is a part, or a constituent, of the experience. We can call this property – the property of having some mind-independent object or feature as a consti-tuent – the naı̈ve realist (NR) property of experiences. It is widely accepte...|$|R
