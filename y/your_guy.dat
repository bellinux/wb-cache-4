500|$|The {{lyrics of}} most songs in Laundry Service {{are based on}} issues and themes related to love, {{as they had been}} written after Shakira began a {{relationship}} Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] is an [...] "ode" [...] to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an [...] "important side" [...] in [...] "The One", which is a song about how [...] "you love <b>your</b> <b>guy</b> so much that you’re actually going to learn to cook" [...] and contains lines like [...] "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone." [...] In [...] "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is [...] "condemned" [...] to her and lists [...] "all the things your new boy can do." [...] Songs like [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and [...] "Fool" [...] also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train." [...] In the song, Shakira asserts that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers [...]" [...] "Fool" [...] discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a [...] "shitty, self-absorbed man" [...] even after suffering a [...] "soul-crushing defeat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liston {{failed to}} answer the bell for the seventh round, and Ali was {{declared}} the winner by technical knockout. At that point the fight was level on the official scorecards. It {{was the first time}} since 1919—when Jack Dempsey defeated Jess Willard—that a world heavyweight champion had quit on his stool. Liston said he quit because of a shoulder injury. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder. However, David Remnick, for his book, King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero, spoke with one of Liston's cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: [...] " [...] was all BS. We had a return bout clause with Clay, but if you say <b>your</b> <b>guy</b> just quit, who is gonna get a return bout. We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot." [...] Hall of Fame matchmaker Teddy Brenner also disputed the shoulder injury, claiming he saw Liston use the same arm to throw a chair in his dressing room after the match. However there is ample evidence that Liston carried an injury to his left shoulder into the fight.|$|E

It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world - in terms of people in Seattle - and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality.

2500|$|The first section, [...] "The Sex", {{opens the}} record with four songs about the [...] "lecherous and reckless" [...] {{beginning}} of a relationship, and are composed in a [...] "infectious and tongue-in-cheek stampede of uptempo pop." [...] Album opener, [...] "My Gun", {{has been described as}} an urban-influenced pop song textured with elements of dancehall. It begins with a [...] "mournful"-sounding choir before building to an upbeat pop groove. Lo’s vocals are low and seductive, before gliding into her higher range. The track explores the [...] "flirty" [...] stage before delving into more sexual themes, found later on [...] "Talking Body", and has been compared to the works of Rihanna. Lyrically, Lo compares her lover to [...] "her gun" [...] and sings of feeling a release of pleasure: [...] "Boy, if you're gonna shoot me down/Do it gently". The next track, [...] "Like Em' Young", is driven by a tribal-influenced rhythm [...] "coated" [...] with a [...] "parade" [...] of dub-bass. Its lyrics are satirical in nature, as she criticizes other women for judging her taste in younger men: [...] "Hey girl, why you judging me/When your, <b>your</b> <b>guy</b> is turning 53?/ I don't know what really gets you more/Is it that my guy's gonna live out yours?" [...] "Talking Body" [...] is a heavily sexual song described as [...] "salivating with carnal lust", and according to Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe, evokes [...] "the rush of early Madonna." [...] Lyrically, the verses see Lo in a state of idée fixe towards her partner, as she finds herself revolving her life around him. The chorus is musically armed with heavy propulsion combined with rising, subdued synths and sees her [...] "objectifying" [...] his model physique. Rounding out the first section is [...] "Timebomb", a frantic electronic dance piano ballad hybrid described as a [...] "sonic bombardment" [...] of [...] "euphoric" [...] chords, drums, and psychedelic synths, and features an [...] "explosive" [...] chorus containing crashing cymbals and pounding bass. Lo's vocals in the track are sung out of time to the beat, rushing her lyrics into a single phrase.|$|E

These guys [...] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound”. The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is also featured in the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty. During his solo concert in London on June 6, 2017, Vedder talked for the first time about Cornell since his death on May 18, 2017, saying that [...] "he wasn't just a friend, he was someone I looked up to like my older brother" [...] and [...] "I will live with those memories in my heart and I will love him forever".|$|E
