He, who knows everything, reassured her: [...] "Don't worry, dear sister, <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> Bhola Shankara and promptly grants to his devotees whatever they ask of him, without regard for the consequences; for this reason, I think he has gotten himself into some trouble. I will find out what has happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{studying}} at the University of California Summer session in 1928, Wedge met Jennie Mina Holliday, a fellow student, {{with whom he}} soon fell in love, and decided to marry after she had visited him several times when he was hospitalized after his August 1928 suicide attempt. However, his friend Dr. Lapsley Armstrong McAfee (born on March 31, 1864 in Ashley, Missouri; died Dumaguete, Philippine Islands, on January 18, 1935), pastor of the Berkeley Presbyterian Church, refused to perform the ceremony, as it was incompatible with Presbyterian beliefs on divorce and remarriage. Rev. Chauncey David Norris, pastor of the Church of the Nazarene in Berkeley, California, agreed to perform the ceremony. However, after Wedge's denominational leaders protested his intention to marry Holloway, {{as she had been}} divorced on the grounds of incompatibility, Wedge decided to break his engagement to Holloway and cancel the wedding. Three hours before the wedding Wedge sent a special delivery letter to Holloway: [...] "It is better for me to remain a lonely Presbyterian minister than to marry you and break God's law. The Bible is against our marriage. While <b>your</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> still living I would be breaking God's law by living with you, even though the laws of California sanction it". However, within hours he reconsidered and announced his intention to resign as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Oakland, California and also from the Presbyterian denomination and to marry Holloway. The wedding was held in the evening of January 25, 1929, two hours later than scheduled, in Holloway's Oakland home, with Hugh Wedge as best man and Holloway's daughter, Mrs Jeanette Dale, the bridesmaid.|$|E
