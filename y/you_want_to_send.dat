500|$|Hays and others, such as Samuel Goldwyn, {{obviously}} {{felt that}} motion pictures presented {{a form of}} escapism that served a palliative effect on American moviegoers. Goldwyn had coined the famous dictum, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a message, call Western Union" [...] in the pre-Code era. However, the MPPDA took the opposite stance when questioned about certain so-called [...] "message" [...] films before Congress in 1932, claiming the audiences' desire for realism led to certain unsavory social, legal, and political issues being portrayed in film.|$|E
2500|$|Lady Zhen bore Cao Pi {{a son and}} a daughter. Their son, Cao Rui, {{later became}} the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. Their daughter, whose {{personal}} name was not recorded in history, was referred to as [...] "Princess Dongxiang" [...] (東鄉公主; literally [...] "Princess of the East District") in historical records. Lady Zhen remained humble even though Cao Pi deeply fancied her. She provided encouragement to Cao Pi's other wives who were also adored by him, and comforted those whom he less favoured. She also often urged Cao Pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants, citing the example of the mythical Yellow Emperor. Cao Pi was very pleased. Once, Cao Pi wanted to send Lady Ren (任氏), one of his concubines who fell out favour with him, back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her. When Lady Zhen heard about it, she told her husband, [...] "Lady Ren comes from a reputable clan. I can't match her in terms of moral character and looks. Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> her away?" [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "She is unruly, impulsive and disobedient. She has made me angry many times before. I'm sending her away." [...] Lady Zhen wept and pleaded with her husband, [...] "Everyone knows that you love and adore me, and they'll think that you're sending Lady Ren away because of me. I fear that I'll be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me. Please consider your decision again carefully." [...] Cao Pi ignored her and sent Lady Ren away.|$|E

5000|$|... "Todoketai..."/"Kono Mama Zutto" [...] (I Wanna Send.../Just As It Is) is Thelma Aoyama's sixth single, and {{her first}} in 2009. It was {{released}} on March 11, 2009. The CD+DVD edition of the single includes a music video. [...] "Todoketai..." [...] is an answer song to [...] "Todoketakute... feat. Aoyama Thelma" [...] (<b>You</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Send...</b> feat. Aoyama Thelma) by Ken the 390. This is Aoyama's first double A-side single.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have only}} {{told me that}} I {{was one of two}} good Americans," [...] said Cheyne, with a quiet smile which the girl found reassuring. [...] "Now, <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> me away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lawrence," [...] she said, [...] "you {{are telling}} me too much, and not enough. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> me away I must go. But tell me this first. What claim has this woman upon you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. DON. 'Have you any message <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> us? Yes. Is it important? Yes. Are we {{to spell}} {{it out in the}} usual way? Yes. Is the first letter of the first word A? Is it B?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me, colonel," [...] says I, [...] "but there's some {{business}} {{to attend to}} now"; and I brought out paper and pen and ink and laid 'em before him. [...] "Who do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> to for the money?" [...] I asks.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must please {{not make}} love to me, or I shall have to leave you," [...] she said. [...] "The idea of {{thinking}} about such a thing in your condition! <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> me away, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> such a {{thing it}} can easily be done,' said Mrs. Swancourt, coming to her step-daughter's rescue. 'An {{envelope}} addressed, [...] "To the Critic of THE COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE, care of the Editor of the PRESENT," [...] would find him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One doesn't {{know when}} you're amused and when you're not," [...] Jefferson rejoined. [...] "However, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> Wolf a note." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{privateer}} {{going to}} sail, tomorrow; so if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> letters home, or to order {{anything to be}} sent out to you, you had better take the opportunity. Have you got everything you want, {{for the next two}} or three years?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, Jefferies is not here, and {{the dealer}} {{has taken the}} horses. But some one could go for us from Leek's farm. The Arrowpoints are at Quetcham, I know. Miss Arrowpoint left her card the other day: I could not see her. But I don't know about Herr Klesmer. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> before to-morrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{never heard}} of such nonsense, Salome Whitney! What on earth do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him back for? I knew Harriet Elwell years ago, and if she's still what she was then, it ain't much wonder Chester ran away from her. I'd say 'run,' too. Go back, indeed! You keep him right here, as you should, and let Harriet Elwell look somewhere else for {{somebody}} to scold!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't forget us {{when you}} are in London," [...] said Jessie. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> me some postal cards--the picture kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can't {{say if he}} is aboard or not," [...] {{said the}} steamer official. [...] "You see, we are not to sail until nine o'clock to-morrow morning.

6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> us away for, grandpapa?" [...] she asked. [...] "You three will {{be happier}} {{for having us}} with you, and James and I will be happier for having you with us. What {{nonsense}} to talk about buying another estate! We might get a little house up in London. It would make a change, for James and me to spend {{two or three months}} every year there, but of course this will be our home." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Kew {{had just}} made herself {{comfortable}} at Brighton, when her little grandson's illness brought Lady Anne Newcome and her family down to the sea. Lady Kew was almost scared back to London again, or blown over the water to Dieppe. She had never had the measles. [...] "Why did not Anne carry the child to some other place? Julia, you will on no account go and see that little pestiferous swarm of Newcomes, unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> {{me out of the}} world--which I dare say you do, for I am a dreadful plague to you, I know, and my death would be a release to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|Boyne stood {{talking to}} his mother, with his hands, which he had not grown to, largely planted on the jambs of her state-room door.

[...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>send</b> Ellen <b>to</b> you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Umph! that is {{one word}} too much, mother. If <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> me crazy, don't put the thing on the score of {{gratitude}} or duty.

6000|$|... "You don't want to bother. In the meantime, Margaret's my wife's sister from Calgary. That's {{good enough}} for the police, and anyhow the Royal North-West aren't city patrolmen. They reckon they're highbrow {{frontier}} cavalry and I guess the trooper won't allow a girl held him up. You'll stay put, until we see if we can ship you out with the construction boys to the Calgary side. If that plan won't go, we'll push across the range for the big park valley and try to run you south. I think that's all; but if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a letter to your friends, Graham will mail it for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm not blown yet. I've a {{deal more}} to say about Mr Moffat before I shall be blown. What has he done to entitle him to come here before you and ask you to send him to Parliament? Why; he isn't even a tailor. I wish he were. There's always some good in a fellow who knows how to earn his own bread. But he isn't a tailor; he can't even put a stitch in towards mending England's honour. His father was a tailor; not a Barchester tailor, mind you, so as to give him any claim on your affections; but a London tailor. Now the {{question}} is, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> the son of a London tailor up to Parliament to represent you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know very}} well that you've got the law on your side, and the power," [...] said George, bitterly. [...] "You mean to take my wife to sell in New Orleans, and put my boy like a calf in a trader's pen, and send Jim's old mother to the brute that whipped and abused her before, because he couldn't abuse her son. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> Jim and me back to be whipped and tortured, and ground down under the heels of them that you call masters; and your laws will bear you out in it,--more shame for you and them! But you haven't got us. We don't own your laws; we don't own your country; we stand here as free, under God's sky, as you are; and, by the great God that made us, we'll fight for our liberty till we die." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> for her, or {{anything}} like that, for it would make her suspicious," [...] he said. [...] "I'd like to meet her {{in some way that}} would seem accidental, and not startle her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Pinney, [...] "I don't {{know that}} that follows. My wife and myself talked that up a good deal at the time, and we {{concluded}} that it was about an even thing. You see it's pretty {{hard to believe that}} a friend is dead, even when you've seen him die; and I don't understand how people that lose friends at a distance can ever quite realize that they're gone. I guess that even if the ladies went upon the theory of the accident, there was always a kind of a merciful uncertainty about it, and that was my wife's notion, too. But that's neither here nor there, now, Mr. Northwick. Here you are, alive and well, in spite of all theories to the contrary--though they must have been pretty well exploded by your letter to the Events--and the question is what answer are you going to let me take back to your family? <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> some word, don't you?
