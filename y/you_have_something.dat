500|$|Drake {{ended his}} studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered [...] "writing him long letters, {{pointing}} out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net {{was the one thing}} he did not want." [...] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.|$|E
500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to say about the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E

500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, I know <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards {{based on her}} performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted {{for her role as}} Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't believe anything is going to happen until it does, until you see your name on a paper or it actually happens and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> in your hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA [...] to connect with a big audience." [...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, made it sound worthwhile, I think. So I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E

As a {{musician}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to say and I think you can easily lose direction by playing {{in two or three}} bands. I personally find it disorientating and I would prefer to focus in my band only." [...] The decision was amicable and the band continued to work on other projects.|$|E
2500|$|Page {{was shown}} {{hundreds}} of CDs and DVDs, ranging from his solo material to {{his time with}} Led Zeppelin and the Yardbirds, which Langley was allegedly selling in Scotland during 2005. Many contain footage and audio from Page's personal collection, stolen {{from his home in}} the early 1980s. The goods were found on sale as far away as New York City, where shop-owners thought they were official. Page later said [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> like this that appears legitimate then it is just not right".|$|E
2500|$|Around December 2009, after privacy {{concerns}} were raised, Google's CEO Eric Schmidt declared: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> that you don't {{want anyone to}} know, maybe you shouldn't be {{doing it in the}} first place. If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines—including Google—do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{returning}} to the sample site in 1988, the researchers were unable to find any further specimens. It was not until 2014 that they published the discovery. Jean Just of the University of Copenhagen, who carried out the trawling in 1986, has explained the long delay before publication {{in terms of the}} extraordinary nature of the discovery: [...] "Once you think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> really extraordinary, {{it takes a long time}} to study, read, consult left, right and centre, and convince yourself that you’ve really stumbled across something special." ...|$|E

If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> that you don't {{want anyone to}} know, maybe you shouldn't be {{doing it in the}} first place. But if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines, including Google, do retain this information for some time.

2500|$|In 1921, Cruikshank {{was hired}} as the pastor of the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Steubenville, Ohio, {{approximately}} 40 miles west of Pittsburgh. [...] He remained in Steubenville through at least 1926. [...] While working as a minister, Cruikshank continued his interest in football and {{used it as a}} theme in his speeches and sermons. [...] At a 1923 banquet honoring Steubenville's undefeated 1922 football team, Cruikshank spoke of the importance athletics:"I am for athletics in the school. [...] They create a school consciousness, call it spirit if you will. When you leave school after playing on its football team <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> that will always hold your school career near and dear to you. ... Athletics embue the fellow who plays and the fans as well in a spirit that never says die. ... That's the thing that counts in life, the never give up spirit. [...] To my mind if we can take this spirit out of high school with us it means more to us than our Latin or Greek. [...] In my work especially I find that every walk of life needs the fellow who can take the kick and still come up with a smile but a determination." ...|$|E

2500|$|The duo and {{the rest}} of the show's writing staff then spent three weeks writing {{material}} for the episode, with it being twice the length of a standard episode. The writers did not intentionally tone down their material as they knew that Lucasfilm would inform them of any items unsuitable for broadcast. Lucasfilm's director of marketing Tom Warner noted that [...] "There were definitely a few [...] I batted an eye at, and if I were producing probably wouldn't have put in. But they were having fun with it." [...] The writers decided not to choose [...] "obvious" [...] things to subvert so, for example, rather than just penning a sketch mocking Jar Jar Binks, had Jar Jar meet up with Darth Vader and react to the changes he has undergone since they last met. Goldstein noted [...] "It was a wild challenge to come up with fresh, new stuff since Star Wars has already been parodied for 30 years now." [...] On the style of the humor, Green opined: [...] "We love to emphasize the mundane in the extraordinary, and Star Wars was perfect for that. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> that's intergalactic, and yet there's got to be some textural machinations of day-to-day business: How can you run an industry that large without paperwork?
