You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe {{a quarter of the}} way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

The main {{critique}} was for the [...] "faster numbers", stating that [...] "Like a Dog" [...] "sounds mostly a little bored". The review concluded by noting that the best songs on Odyssey were those not available as [...] "fleeting radio singles and background music".|$|E

As a 16-year-old in 1993–94, he {{recorded}} six goals and 29points in 48 regular season games before playing an additional 19 in the playoffs. The Blazers captured both the league title and the 1994 Memorial Cup, Canada's national junior championship. In reference to the Blazers' dominance of the league at the time (they had won their third WHL title in five seasons), Iginla described the expectations of success as being similar to those placed on the Montreal Canadiens, the NHL's most successful franchise: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a Blazers jersey, it's like putting on the Canadiens'.

500|$|In March 2016, Marvel {{announced}} that Ms. Marvel would tie into the [...] "Civil War II" [...] storyline by releasing a promotional image illustrating a rift between Khan and Danvers. [...] "While [...] "Civil War II" [...] may have initiated this rift, we've {{known for some}} time that Kamala would eventually need to separate herself from her idols. Her journey centers around self-discovery and identity, and a part of that exploration includes separating yourself from those <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> pedestals. The rift between Carol and Kamala doesn't really have to do with right and wrong. It has to do with growing up and realizing that you perceive the world differently from even the ones you love," [...] Amanat elaborated.|$|E

What price did <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that although it is [...] "inevitable" [...] that Homer's car will be a disaster, the [...] "joy of this episode is anticipating exactly what sort of disaster."

500|$|Despite perceiving a [...] "heavy-handed {{emphasis}} on groove over melody" [...] and [...] "self-indulgent" [...] song durations, Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice viewed the album as a progression for D'Angelo and {{compared it to}} Prince's acclaimed Sign o' the Times (1987), noting that the latter album was initially perceived by most critics as [...] "uneven". Greg Tate of Vibe dubbed it [...] "the most daring song-oriented album by a mainstream R artist of his generation." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today wrote that [...] "no other R artist today seems to have as acute an understanding of where he comes from as D'Angelo, and none seems as {{willing to take risks}} in exploring where he should be heading". The Austin Chronicles Christopher Gray commented that [...] "Voodoo unlocks the brain's inner freak like an especially nimble Harry Whodini". Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz gave it five out of five stars and called it [...] "a record <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> and let it seep in, soaking your essence and one that evolves over subsequent listens... an aural aphrodisiac". He found it to be in the tradition of classic jazz albums and wrote of its musical significance, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre.

After {{a trip to}} Hawaii during which Amos learned about legendary volcano goddess Pele, the album began taking shape; Amos conceived of the songs as representing stealing fire from the men in her {{life as well as}} a journey to finding her own fire as a woman. From there, Amos explained, the songs just came. [...] "Sometimes the fury of it would make me step back, I began to live these songs as we separated. The vampire in me came out.

The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: [...] "marriage is sort of like a long con, because <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> display your very best self during courtship, {{yet at the same time}} the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all.

[...] However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as [...] "Greek" [...] and [...] "new age," [...] emphasizing that [...] "when someone says new age music, I think of something that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> in the background while you're vacuuming the house.

2500|$|In 1990, Idle {{sang and}} co-wrote the theme tune {{to the popular}} British sitcom One Foot in the Grave. The song was later released, but did poorly in the charts. However, when [...] "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" [...] was adopted as a {{football}} chant in the late 1980s, Idle's then neighbour Gary Lineker suggested Idle re-record and release the popular track. With help from Radio 1 breakfast show host Simon Mayo, who gave the song regular airplay and also used the chorus within a jingle, it became a hit, some 12 years after the song's original appearance in Life of Brian, reaching number 3 in the UK charts and landing Idle a set on Top of the Pops in October 1991. He recorded a special version of the song for Mayo's own use on air ("Come on Simon, get another song on now; why don't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a nice Cliff Richard record?") and changed the line [...] "life's a piece of shit" [...] to [...] "life's a piece of spit" [...] {{in order to get}} daytime airplay on radio.

[...] Crisler enrolled at the University of Chicago on an academic scholarship with plans to become a doctor. Crisler often told the story of his introduction to college football. Crisler recalled that he wandered over the football field as a freshman, where he saw the legendary coach Amos Alonzo Stagg directing a practice session. According to Crisler, Stagg knocked him over on the sideline while {{trying to get out of}} the way of an end sweep play. Stagg reportedly told the diminutive Crisler, [...] "If you're going to play football, why don't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a suit?" [...] Crisler worked out with the football team for a few days, but gave it up to return to his studies. When Stagg encountered Crisler a short time later on campus, Stagg said, [...] "I would have never picked you for a quitter." [...] Crisler recalled that he returned to the team in response to Stagg's taunt and noted, [...] "I've been in athletics ever since." [...] Stagg was also responsible for Crisler's nickname. After Crisler fouled up four consecutive plays during a practice session, Stagg told him, [...] "Crisler, from now on you are 'Fritz' after the master violinist.
