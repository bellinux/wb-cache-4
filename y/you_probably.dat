5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. <b>You</b> <b>probably</b> know who he is, and <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E

The Seattle Post-Intelligencer included Amor Prohibido on its list of the best produced albums of 1994, while the Houston Press placed it on its list of the best Texas albums of the past 30 years. BuzzFeed ranked Amor Prohibido number 22 on its list of the 35 Old-School Latino Albums <b>You</b> <b>Probably</b> Forgot About. Billboard magazine ranked Amor Prohibido among the most essential Latin recordings of the past 50 years, and included it on its list of the top 100 albums of all-time. In 2017, NPR ranked Amor Prohibido at number 19 on their list of the 150 greatest albums made by women.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian rated it {{third on}} {{its list of}} [...] "The top 10 films of 2009 <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> won't have seen". The reviewer, David Parkinson, praised this work as [...] "the most {{beautiful}} children's film of the year". He elaborated by saying, [...] "Everything about this poignant account...is exquisite. The photography and period design are impeccable, while the script deftly acquaints younger viewers with the good that can still emerge from the harsher realities of life.". He ended his review with: [...] "This {{is the kind of}} family entertainment that Hollywood has long forgotten how to make." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Harper {{delivered}} a controversial speech on Canadian identity to the Council for National Policy, a conservative American think tank. He made comments such as [...] "Canada is a Northern European welfare {{state in the}} worst sense of the term, and very proud of it", [...] "if you're like all Americans, you know almost nothing except for your own country. Which makes <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> knowledgeable about one more country than most Canadians", and [...] "the NDP [...] is kind of proof that the Devil lives and interferes {{in the affairs of}} men." [...] These statements were made public and criticized during the 2006 election. Harper argued that the speech was intended as humour, and not as serious analysis.|$|E
500|$|To {{understand}} {{his place in}} modern music <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> have to first go back to punk rock and its misguided attempt to kick aside {{what remained of the}} psychedelic 1960s. Given that the Clash and Sex Pistols had made brutal social commentary obligatory, there seemed little room for any of the creative exotica that had defined the Love Decade - until, slowly but surely, singing about dead-end lives and dole queues began to pall, and {{at least some of the}} previous generation were rehabilitated. Barrett was the best example: having crashed out of Pink Floyd before the advent of indulgent [...] "progressive" [...] rock, and succumbed to a fate that appealed to the punk generation's nihilism, he underwent a revival." ...|$|E

[...] The New York Times praised the film's musical numbers, but criticized the story line, {{describing}} it as [...] "a little on the thin side," [...] but also stating that [...] "it is sprightly enough to plug those inevitable gaps between the shimmeringly gay dances."Top Hat" [...] is worth standing in line for.

[...] He was inducted at Fort Thomas, Kentucky and reported to the Cavalry Replacement Center at Fort Riley on March 18. [...] He immediately became an acting corporal of Troop B of the First Squadron for the thirteen-week training program. The Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan owns a copy of an April 1941 fraternity newsletter with a note from Gedeon. [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know by this time", {{he wrote to his}} Phi Gamma Delta brothers, [...] "Old Ged has been drafted."

500|$|By early 1965 Josiffe was in Dublin, {{where he}} worked at various horse-related jobs while {{continuing}} to badger Thorpe by letter about his missing luggage and the continuing National Insurance card issue. However, Thorpe rejected any responsibility for these matters. In mid-March 1965 Josiffe wrote a long letter to Thorpe's mother, which began: [...] "For the last five years, as <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know, Jeremy and I have had a homosexual relationship." [...] The letter blamed Thorpe for awakening [...] "this vice that lies latent in every man", and accused him of callousness and disloyalty. Ursula Thorpe gave the letter to her son, who drafted a quasi-legal statement rejecting the [...] "damaging and groundless accusations" [...] and accusing Josiffe of attempting to blackmail him. The document was never sent; instead, Thorpe turned to Bessell for advice.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, John Calvert {{stated that}} [...] "timing" [...] {{is the reason}} why a grunge revival did not happen; he says that the {{cultural}} mood of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which inspired the movement, were no longer present. Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that people from the 2010s who are listening to grunge should learn about the [...] "...context and history of how it all came to be" [...] and [...] "...respect for what a truly amazing thing it was that happened here [...] because <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> won't see anything like it again."

500|$|Graveyard Mountain Home was {{generally}} well received. Rick Anderson of Allmusic regarded the album as [...] "a surprisingly affecting and powerful work." [...] Writing for Sea of Tranquility, Michael Popke noted that [...] "If {{you listen to}} Graveyard Mountain Home as a stand-alone piece of music... <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> won't be overly impressed. If, however, you hear this sophisticated mix of dark, ambient post-rock and psychedelic sounds while viewing the 1955 public-domain film Age 13, you may consider multi-instrumentalist Kevin Moore a small-time genius." [...] Popke speculated that if Moore created more albums based on obscure films, [...] "he might just alter {{the face of the}} genre." [...] Martien Koolen of DPRP described Graveyard Mountain Home as [...] "a typical album for dark, wintry afternoons," [...] although conceded that [...] "it is not [...] cup of tea." ...|$|E
500|$|For the iOS, 148Apps {{gave the}} game {{four and a}} half out of five stars, praising the game's visuals and level of detail, and expressing dissatisfaction only with the game's tutorial. Eric Ford of TouchArcade, another iOS reviewer, gave Defenders of Ardania four out of five stars, praising the visuals as [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "gorgeous" [...] and saying that the game [...] "is an {{excellent}} addition to the tower defense genre and is a must-try for any fan". Ford did, however, criticize the tutorial, expressing a desire for a tutorial mission rather than instructional screens. Mat Jones of The Average Gamer gave the game a highly negative review, saying that the game was not challenging and that concepts, such as the ability during one level to attack multiple bases and change which one player's units went towards, were never explained. Jones concluded his review by saying that [...] "Defenders of Ardania isn’t a quality product and <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> shouldn’t spend money on it." ...|$|E

500|$|The head of British Secret Intelligence Service, Stewart Menzies, {{stated that}} Cicero {{was indeed a}} double agent and that among the {{documents}} submitted to the Germans were documents of misinformation. Author James Srodes states in his biography of Allen Dulles that some British historians believed that Cicero was [...] "'turned' into a double agent to send disinformation via von Papen". Malcolm Gladwell, author of Pandora's Briefcase, said that an interviewer had questioned Menzies before he died about whether {{he was telling the}} truth. Menzies told the interviewer [...] "Of course, Cicero was under our control," [...] but his truthfulness is questioned. Gladwell stated in an article in The New Yorker; [...] "if you had been the wartime head of M.I.6, giving an interview shortly before your death, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> would say that Cicero was one of yours." [...] Gladwell also mentions that while Ribbentrop was wary of Bazna, which curtailed the dissemination of some of Bazna's intelligence, most German intelligence officials were not wary of him.|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} have criticized Ryan's votes {{for what they}} believe were deficit-increasing policies during the George W. Bush administration as being inconsistent with fiscal conservatism. While he voted for the two Bush tax cuts (in 2001 and 2003), he also voted for the 2003 bill that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and the $700 billion bank bailout, and Ryan was one of 32 Republicans in the House {{to vote for the}} auto industry bailout. In 2011 President Barack Obama criticized Ryan as [...] "not [...] on the level" [...] by describing himself as a fiscal conservative while voting for these policies, as well as two [...] "unpaid for" [...] wars. Columnist Ezra Klein wrote in 2012: [...] "If you know about Paul Ryan at all, <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> know him as a deficit hawk. But, Ryan has voted to increase deficits and expand government spending too many times for that to be his north star." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{very unusual}} {{to find a}} helmet of this type on a native {{ceremonial}} site. It was probably made between 25 and 50 AD, close to {{the date of the}} conquest of Britain in 43 AD; this makes it one of the earliest Roman helmets ever found in Britain. Other British examples of later date were found in isolation away from settlements, as in the cases of the Guisborough Helmet and Crosby Garrett Helmet, or on Roman sites, as with the Newstead Helmet. Various suggestions have been put forward as to why the helmet ended up at Hallaton; it may have been owned by a Briton who served in the Roman cavalry, {{it may have been a}} diplomatic gift from the Romans or it may have been captured in war. According to Dr Jeremy Hill of the British Museum, the first explanation is the most likely: [...] "Here <b>you</b> <b>probably</b> have a situation where local Britons are fighting on the Roman side." [...] The Roman cavalry at this time was mostly recruited from native allies, not Italians, suggesting that Britons fought alongside the Romans as they carried out their conquest of Britain.|$|E
