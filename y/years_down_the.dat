The grandeur of its arrangement easily upstages the tune", but [...] "even so, the luster of Adele's tone, and the bravura arc of her vocal, makes it enjoyable enough. And, fifty <b>years</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line, isn't that all we really expect from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but {{felt that it was}} too soon to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", but at the same time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E

For Nick Levine from Digital Spy, [...] "The Spice Girls' comeback single is as hip and modern as Jeremy Clarkson's dress sense: the simple drum loop could have been laid down while they were recording their debut album; the flamenco guitar riffs are pure 'Viva Forever'; and, nine <b>years</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line, Mel C is still taking on all the money notes, adding some real oomph to the middle 8".|$|E

500|$|Already {{before the}} {{national}} convention, the entire local party chapter in Osterøy was disestablished, but mainly {{due to the}} European Union controversy.

Eidesvik was {{a former member of}} the central board, and also a former deputy member of Parliament. The same day former MP and youth wing leader Pål Atle Skjervengen withdrew, commenting that the libertarians [...] "are asked by the party leadership to go to hell". Skjervengen had been criticized by Carl I. Hagen from the rostrum at the national convention. Many <b>years</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road Skjervengen joined the Conservative Party.

[...] "Now, it looks like a great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said.

500|$|Computer and Video Games {{predicted}} that the game [...] "will be the one {{you come back to}} when you've got a full house", and appreciated its [...] "crazy genius" [...] gameplay. Nintendo World Report was pleased with the game's variety, but found the small number of unlockable items and lack of high scores disappointing. Although video game review website IGN noted that the game was not the best in the Wario series of video games, they still considered it an [...] "essential piece of the Wii collection". The website was also entertained by the single-player mode as well as the multiplayer, especially when [...] "shov the controller off on unsuspecting houseguests or non-gamers months and <b>years</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road". They considered the game's use of the Wii Remote to be [...] "slick and intuitive", the graphics to be [...] "nearly inexplicable", and the sound to be [...] "totally off the wall". GameZone called the game [...] "original and addictive", but noted that it would not appeal to everyone. The Courier-Mail praised the game's use of the Wii's motion-sensitive controllers as one of its best features, which helps push it [...] "over-the-top" [...] as [...] "one of the most inventive games designed for the Wii's interactive controls". Canada's Toronto Sun also appreciated its [...] "novel use" [...] of the Wiimote.|$|E

McFarlane felt this album was [...] "more self-assured and textured [...] consolidated the band's {{position at the}} forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I, Spiderbait, Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed. [...] was full of accessible, spirited rock". Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted [...] " [...] revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves. Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or <b>years</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line". Four singles were released from the album – [...] "Pick You Up", [...] "D.A.F.", [...] "Living Type" [...] and [...] "Take Me In". [...] "Take Me In" [...] was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group.

500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron.

What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple <b>years</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall.

Silbermann voiced not knowing what the writers may have planned for the couple, but that [...] "the audience can assume it won't be smooth sailing". Hansis clarified: [...] "We have no idea what's happening until we get the scripts, which happens about a week in advance. We can talk to the producers if we want.

The problem is EastEnders is a realistic show, so with Steven being a larger-than-life character it was always going to be hard having him doing the same crazy things day in, day out. I wasn't expecting to stay on the Square forever. It was my first big job out of drama college and I couldn't have asked for a better start in the industry.

The New York Times describes their system as a [...] "hybrid of heuristics, behavior and a signature engine {{that is designed to}} detect and block malware that other vendors can't detect". According to Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat, Malwarebytes complements other antivirus software from vendors such as Symantec and McAfee, with the anti-malware working with the anti-virus software to attack the problem from [...] "different directions".
