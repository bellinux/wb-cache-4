50|$|Though the {{distinction}} is arbitrary, the improvements in reactor technology in third generation reactors are intended {{to result in a}} longer operational life (designed for 60 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> extendable to 100+ <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> prior to complete overhaul and reactor pressure vessel replacement) compared with currently used Generation II reactors (designed for 40 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> extendable to 60+ <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> prior to complete overhaul and pressure vessel replacement).|$|R
50|$|After over 100 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> the Hotel Cecil, also {{referred}} to as the Cecil Hotel and B.DeMille's, is the oldest public house on the Gold Coast to maintain its original name throughout all its <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Constantinople Flotilla had {{a maximum}} {{strength}} of 11 U-boats {{but due to}} the unfavourable conditions for commerce raiding in the Black Sea saw little success during its three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> In three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> the force sank ships totalling 117,093 GRT.|$|R
5|$|Revenues grew {{along with}} {{ridership}} {{over the first}} three years, but ridership remained below expectations. In 2008 the second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> revenues fell barely short of THSRC's expectations a year earlier of a doubling of first-year results.|$|E
5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E

5|$|The Transport Scotland Business Case for Borders Railway, {{published}} in November 2012, {{predicted that the}} total passenger return journeys made for the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> would be 647,136.

This was broken down into Edinburgh Park (4,071), Haymarket (35,329), Edinburgh Waverley (220,533), Brunstane and Newcraighall combined (986), Shawfair (61,860), Eskbank (130,525), Newtongrange (52,918), Gorebridge (90,019), Stow (5,843), Galashiels (23,431) and Tweedbank (21,621).|$|E
5|$|The first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> had 40,000 {{passengers}} {{and gave a}} small profit, but the next two gave deficits of NOK5,000.

The line had a large impact on Sylling, where the population increased from 467 in 1900 to 713 in 1910.|$|E

5|$|Although {{designed}} as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level natural science research component with the appointment of plant physiologist Kenneth V. Thimann as the first provost of Crown College. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus. Immediately upon its founding, UCSC was also granted administrative responsibility for the Lick Observatory, which established the campus as a major center for astronomy research. Founding members of the Social Science and Humanities faculty created the unique History of Consciousness graduate program in UCSC's first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

From 2005 to 2013, she played professionally for several teams around the world including FC Barcelona, UE L'Estartit, San Diego Sunwaves, Chicago Red Stars, and UAEH Panteras.|$|E
5|$|Early {{photovoltaic}} systems output decreased {{as much as}} 10%/year, but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its output performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its output during the same period. Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% in ten years and 80% over 25 years. The output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3% during the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

In IABC's first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> the association had 2,280 members and was focused on internal communications.
