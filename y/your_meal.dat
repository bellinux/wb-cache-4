2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{successful}} mainstream Filipino-American rappers is The Black Eyed Peas's apl.de.ap, who has released songs such as [...] "The Apl Song" [...] (Elephunk), [...] "Bebot" [...] (Monkey Business), and [...] "Mare" [...] (The E.N.D.) which not only contain Filipino (Tagalog) lyrics but also native Filipino musical elements. Pineda has also founded his own record label, the Los Angeles-based Jeepney Music, to help discover and promote Filipino hip-hop talent from both the United States and the Philippines. [...] "The APL Song" [...] not only contains elements of Tagalog and Filipino elements, but the track itself according to video producer, Christina DeHaven, represents Allan Pineda Lindo's view of the Philippines when he travels back for the first time since he was 14 years old. In the English verses of the song Allan Pineda Lindo describes aspects of Filipino life back home which is seen in the lyrics, [...] "How would you feel if you had to catch <b>your</b> <b>meal,</b> Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in, Having to pump the water outta the ground?". The shifting between Tagalog and English can be interpreted as showing both languages as equal or in an equal hierarchical relationship to one another which is especially important having included another language than English in American Pop song, even though English is one of two of the Official language's of the Philippines.|$|E

60|$|O august Justice, <b>your</b> <b>meal</b> was {{followed}} by a pretty appropriate grace! Was any man, who saw the show, deterred, or frightened, or moralized in any way? He had gratified his appetite for blood, and this was all. There is something singularly pleasing, both in the amusement of execution-seeing, and in the results. You are not only delightfully excited at the time, but most pleasingly relaxed afterwards; the mind, which has been wound up painfully until now, becomes quite complacent and easy. There is something agreeable in the misfortunes of others, as the philosopher has told us. Remark what a good breakfast you eat after an execution; how pleasant it is to cut jokes after it, and upon it. This merry, pleasant mood is brought on by the blood tonic.|$|E

"Then {{he thinks}} {{he has nothing to}} spare; and {{thinking}} he has nothing to spare, and yet prodigally drinking down his money as he does every day, {{it seems to me that}} that gentleman stands self-contradicted, and therefore is no good example for plain sensible folks like you and me to follow. My honest friend, if you are poor, avoid wine as a costly luxury; if you are rich, shun it as a fatal indulgence. Stick to plain water. And now, my good friend, if you are through with <b>your</b> <b>meal,</b> we will rise. There is no pastry coming. Pastry is poisoned bread. Never eat pastry. Be a plain man, and stick to plain things. Now, my friend, I shall have to be private until nine o'clock in the evening, when I shall be again at your service. Meantime you may go to your room. I have ordered the one next to this to be prepared for you. But you must not be idle. Here is Poor Richard's Almanac, which, in view of our late conversation, I commend to your earnest perusal. And here, too, is a Guide to Paris, an English one, which you can read. Study it well, so that when you come back from England, if you should then have an opportunity to travel about Paris, to see its wonders, you will have all the chief places made historically familiar to you. In this world, men must provide knowledge before it is wanted, just as our countrymen in New England get in their winter's fuel one season, to serve them the next." ...|$|E

"I {{think that}} it is well that your mother should come over," [...] the burgomaster said; [...] "for a man who has had the greater part of his leg taken off cannot be {{expected}} to get round quickly. Besides, after what you told us last night about the misfortune that has befallen her family, it were best that she should be busied about her husband, and so have little time to brood over the matter. As to hospitality, it would be strange indeed if we should not do all that we could for a brave man who has been injured in fighting our common enemy. Send word to your mother that she will be as welcome as he is, and that we shall be ready in all respects to arrange whatever she may think most convenient and comfortable. And now you had best sit down and have <b>your</b> <b>meal</b> with us. As soon as it is over I will go down with you to the wharf, and will do what I can to hasten the sailing of your ship. I don't think," [...] he went on, when they had taken their seats at table, [...] "that there is much chance of her meeting another Spaniard on her way out to sea, for we have news this morning that some ships of the beggars have been seen cruising off the entrance, and the Spaniards will be getting under shelter of their batteries at Amsterdam. I hear they are expecting a fleet from Spain to arrive soon to aid in their operations against our ports. However, I have little fear that they will do much by sea against us.

50|$|Not {{finishing}} <b>your</b> <b>meal</b> is {{not considered}} impolite in Japan, but rather it is taken as {{a signal to the}} host that you wish to be served another helping. Conversely, finishing <b>your</b> <b>meal</b> completely, especially the rice, is an indication that you are satisfied with <b>your</b> <b>meal</b> and therefore do not wish to be served any more. Children are especially encouraged to eat every last grain of rice - see also mottainai as Buddhist philosophy. It is impolite to pick out certain ingredients and leave the rest.
