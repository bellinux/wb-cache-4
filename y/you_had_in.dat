500|$|Louis Leterrier, {{who enjoyed}} the TV series {{as a child}} and liked the first film, had {{expressed}} interest in directing the Iron Man film adaptation. Jon Favreau had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent. Leterrier's primary inspiration was Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's Hulk: Gray (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film. Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him, while Feige added the film would explore [...] "that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> yourself". Arad also said the film would be [...] "a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross".|$|E
