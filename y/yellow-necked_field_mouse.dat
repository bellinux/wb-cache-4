Around 100 mm in length, it can climb trees and sometimes overwinters in houses. It is found mostly in mountainous areas of southern Europe, but extends north into parts of Scandinavia and Britain. It facilitates the spread of tick-borne encephalitis to humans and is a reservoir species for the Dobrava virus, a hantavirus that is responsible for causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} whether the portion of a vertebrate host population having specific immunity to tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus can participate in the TBE virus transmission cycle, natural hosts immunized against TBE virus were challenged with infected and uninfected ticks. <b>Yellow-necked</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus flavicollis) and bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) were either immunized with TBE virus by subcutaneous inoculation of the virus, or they were exposed to virus-infectedIxodes ricinusticks. One month later, when serum neutralizing antibody was detectable, the animals were infested with infected (donor) adult female ticks and uninfected (recipient) nymphal ticks; recipients were allowed to feed either in close contact (chamber 1) or physically separated (chamber 2) from the infected donor ticks. Following challenge with infected (and uninfected) ticks, viremia developed in all the control, nonimmune animals, whereas viremia was undetectable in all those animals naturally immunized by previous exposure to infected ticks. Despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies in all the immunized animals, 89 % (24 / 27) immune animals supported virus transmission between infected and uninfected cofeeding ticks. Most transmission was localized, occurring within chamber 1; disseminated transmission from chamber 1 to chamber 2 was reduced. Immunization by tick bite was more effective than immunization by syringe inoculation in blocking cofeeding virus transmission. Nevertheless 75 % (9 / 12) animals with “natural” immunity still supported transmission. The results demonstrate that natural hosts having neutralizing antibodies to TBE virus (and no detectable viremia) can still support virus transmission between infected and uninfected ticks feeding closely together on the same animal. These observations have important epidemiological implications relating {{to the survival of}} TBE virus in Nature...|$|R

Fa t content has been determined in Soxhlet's apparatus by ether ext rac-tion. The mean biomass of animals examined during various seasons amounted to 26. 3 ± 6. 20 g, while the mean dry mat ter — to 7. 9 ± 1, 84 g. Water content was highest in summer (72. 8 %), and lowest in winter (on an average 68. 3 %). Fat content in mouse bodies reveals seasonal f luc-tuations and a distinct annual cycle. Since autumn mice accumulate fa t (on an average 13. 9 % ± 3. 54 of the dry body weight); in winter the fa t content is highest (20. 8 % ± 5. 13). In spring fa t amount drops quite obviously (11. 9 % ± 6. 11) and in summer it is maintained on the same low level (11. 9 % ± 3. 31). The fatness of winter mice differs sta-tistically significantly f rom that in all remaining seasons.

Caloric value of mouse fa t reaches 9. 124 — 9. 305 kcal/g, while that of f a t- f r ee tissue — 4. 209 — 4. 782 kcal/g.

40|$|Southern Poland) {{the numbers}} of rodents were {{estimated}} during four consecutive years (1967 — 71) by means of prebaiting and intensive re-moval method. Bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and <b>yellow-necked</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus flavicollis) constituted 92. 5 °/o of all rodents in this forest. Small rodents went in this period through a population cycle from a high density (32. 1 vole and 5. 9 mice per ha during the year on the average) to a low density (8. 1 and 2. 0 individuals, respecti-vely). The mean number for the four year cycle amounts to 19. 0 rodents/ha. When young animals staying in the nests are also taken into account the mean numbers should be increased by approximately 20 %. The age of mice and voles was determined and then life tables were constructed and curves of individual growth were drawn. At high population density the mean life span of voles amounts to 2. 2 and mice to 2. 4 months, while at low density the corresponding figures are 2. 6 and 3. 3 months. The rate of body weight increase was lower {{in the year of}} mass occurrence. The turnover of individuals was also related to density and in the population of voles it ranged from 5. 5 to 4. 6 per year, while in the population of mice — from 5. 0 to 4. 0 per year.

40|$|Abstract Background In rodents, {{the cell}} surface {{complement}} regulatory protein CD 46 is expressed {{solely on the}} spermatozoal acrosome membrane. Ablation of the CD 46 gene {{is associated with a}} faster acrosome reaction. Sperm from Apodemus flavicollis (<b>yellow-necked</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice),</b> A. microps (pygmy <b>field</b> <b>mice)</b> and A. sylvaticus (European wood mice) fail to express CD 46 protein and exhibit a more rapid acrosome reaction rate than Mus (house mice) or BALB/c mice. A. agrarius (striped <b>field</b> <b>mice)</b> belong to a different Apodemus subgenus and have pronounced promiscuity and large relative testis size. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether A. agrarius sperm fail to express CD 46 protein and, if so, whether A. agrarius have a faster acrosome reaction than Mus. Methods Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess whether A. agrarius transcribe testicular CD 46 mRNA. RT-PCR was supplemented with 3 '- and 5 '-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of A. agrarius CD 46. Fluorescence microscopy was used to assess whether CD 46 protein is expressed by A. agrarius sperm. The acrosome status of A. agrarius sperm was calculated over time by immunocytochemistry using peanut agglutinin lectin. Results We demonstrate that A. agrarius mice transcribe two unique alternatively spliced testicular CD 46 mRNA transcripts, both lacking exon 7, which differ from those described previously in other Apodemus species. The larger A. agrarius CD 46 transcript has an insert between exons 10 and 11 which, if translated, would result in a novel cytoplasmic tail. In addition, A. agrarius CD 46 transcripts have an extended AU-rich 3 '-untranslated region (UTR) and a truncated 5 '-UTR, resulting in failure to express spermatozoal CD 46 protein. We show that A. agrarius has a significantly faster spontaneous acrosome reaction rate than A. sylvaticus and Mus. Conclusion Absence of CD 46 protein expression is associated with acrosomal instability in rodents. A. agrarius mice express novel CD 46 transcripts, resulting in the trade of spermatozoal CD 46 protein expression for a rapid acrosome reaction rate, in common with other species of <b>field</b> <b>mice.</b> This provides a strategy to increase competitive sperm advantage for individuals, leading to faster fertilisation in this highly promiscuous genus. </p...|$|R
40|$|B {{chromosomes}} (Bs) {{are a very}} heterogeneous {{group of}} extra chromosomes. In various species Bs occur with different nucleotide sequences ranging from repetitive to protein coding. In <b>yellow-necked</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice,</b> Apodemus flavicollis Bs are small euchromatic chromosomes and untill now, only few molecular analyses have been conducted. In this study we examined A. flavicollis individuals with different number of Bs for presence of two genes, C-KIT and 18 S rRNA. The C-KIT proto-oncogene was found on Bs in three Canidae species and one Cervidae species. This gene is a coding receptor critical for proliferation and cell differentiation of hematopoietic, melanoblast and primordial germ cells, and is highly conserved within mammals. While using semiquantitative PCR, we did not notice any difference in the C-KIT band intensity among animals with different number of Bs (0 - 3). The presence of only one copy of C- KIT gene was confirmed using real time-PCR on genomic DNA of A. flavicollis specimens with different number of Bs. rRNA genes in eukaryotes’ genome are organized like units of tandem repeated sequences. The units form distinct clusters on one to several chromosome pairs. rRNA genes were found on Bs in different species including two species of genus Apodemus. One particular sample with 2 Bs showed the number of 18 S rRNA gene about three {{times that of the}} calibrator 0 B sample. This result can indicate the presence of 18 S rRNA gene on Bs, but its confirmation requires the implementation of other methods. Still, we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of pseudogen of tested target genes, or lose of exon 1 of C-KIT protooncogen in Bs of A. flavicollis. Our findings are further discussed.

40|$|AbstractArboviruses are {{transmitted}} to vertebrates by the ”bite“ of infected arthropods. Events {{at the site}} of virus deposition are largely unknown despite increasing evidence that blood-sucking arthropods immunomodulate their skin site of feeding. This question is particularly relevant for ixodid ticks that feed for several days. To examine events under conditions mimicking tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in nature (i. e., infected and uninfectedIxodes ricinusticks feeding on the same animal), infected adult and uninfected nymphal ticks were placed in one retaining chamber (skin site A) and uninfected nymphs were placed within a second chamber posteriorly (skin site B) on two natural host species, <b>yellow-necked</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus flavicollis) and bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus). Virus transmission from infected to uninfected cofeeding ticks was correlated with infection in the skin site of tick feeding. Furthermore, virus was recruited preferentially to the site in which ticks were feeding compared with uninfested skin sites. Viremia did not correspond with a generalized infection of the skin; virus was not detected in an uninfested skin site (C) of 12 / 13 natural hosts that had viremia levels ≥ 2. 0 log 10 ic mouse LD 50 / 0. 02 ml blood. To characterize infected cells, laboratory mouse strains were infested with infected ticks and then explants were removed from selected skin sites and floated on culture medium. Numerous leukocytes were found to migrate from the skin explants of tick feeding sites. Two-color immunocytochemistry revealed viral antigen in both migratory Langerhans cells and neutrophils; in addition, the migratory monocyte/macrophages were shown to produce infectious virus. The results indicate that the local skin site of tick feeding is an important focus of viral replication early after TBE virus transmission by ticks. Cellular infiltration of tick feeding sites, and the migration of cells from such sites, may provide a vehicle for transmission between infected and uninfected cofeeding ticks that is independent of a patent viremia. The data support the hypothesis that viremia is a product, rather than a prerequisite, of tick-borne virus transmission...|$|R
