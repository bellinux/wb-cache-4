5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this {{would be the end of}} his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E

After <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (a.k.a.

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E

Because of the continuing media interest, Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing the situation on the website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to the greed accusation by explaining that the band had agreed on the distribution of earnings in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E

In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for n=p–1, where p is a prime number of the form p=8k+7. However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.|$|E
