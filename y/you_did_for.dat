I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, 'Whatever <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' ...|$|E
500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E

2500|$|Five {{years after}} Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, Cobb {{publicly}} supported {{blacks and whites}} playing baseball together, adding, [...] "Certainly it is okay for them to play. I see no reason in the world why we shouldn't compete with colored athletes {{as long as they}} conduct themselves with politeness and gentility. Let me say also that no white man has the right to be less of a gentleman than a colored man; in my book that goes not only for baseball but in all walks of life." [...] Using even stronger language, Cobb told the Sporting News in 1952 that [...] "the Negro should be accepted and not grudgingly but wholeheartedly." [...] In 1953, black newspapers cited his praise for Brooklyn Dodgers' catcher Roy Campanella, who Cobb said was [...] "among the all-time best catchers" [...] in baseball. Following Campanella's accident that left him paralyzed, the Dodgers staged a tribute game where tens of thousands of spectators silently held lit matches above their heads. Cobb wrote the Dodgers owner to show appreciation [...] "for what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> this fine man." [...] Cobb also stated that Willie Mays was the [...] "only player I'd pay money to see." [...] In the obituaries that ran in the black press following Cobb's death, he was praised for [...] " [...] in favor of racial freedom in baseball." ...|$|E
