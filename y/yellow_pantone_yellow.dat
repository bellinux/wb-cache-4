The frieze is dominated by the triglyphs, separated by metopes displaying a plane face architrave.

40|$|Poster PresentationSession 97 : Fluoride and Ca-based ProductsObjective: To {{compare the}} {{appearance}} of dentin after application of silver diammine fluoride (SDF) solution to that of dentin after application of SDF solution followed by potassium iodide (KI) solution. Method: Rectangular dentin blocks from root trunks of extracted permanent molars were cut into four blocks each. All blocks were coated with clear varnish except one flat surface of similar size. The 4 dentin blocks from the same tooth were allocated into four different groups randomly. Gp 1 - Artificial caries lesions (≈ 200 µm deep) created (BHI broth, multi-species cariogenic bacteria, 10 days) + SDF; Gp 2 -Artificial caries lesion created + SDF + KI; Gp 3 - immersed in sterilized BHI broth (10 days) + SDF; Gp 4 - immersed in sterilized BHI broth (10 days) + SDF + KI. Color of the dentin blocks was recorded using PANTONE color sheets and was coded into 1 -Light <b>yellow</b> (<b>PANTONE</b> code: 12 - 0704 -TPX/ 11 - 0907 -TPX); 2 -Yellow (1205 U/ 7401 U); 3 -Light brown/Greyish (4635 U/ 402 U); 4 -Dark brown/Black (4625 U/BlackU) for comparison. Result: All dentin blocks (each group n= 20) had similar color at baseline (coded 1). After intervention, all dentin blocks in Gp 1 and Gp 3 while no block in Gp 2 and Gp 4 were coded 4. A total number (proportion) of 5 (25 %), 13 (65 %), and 2 (10 %) of the blocks in Gp 2 was coded into 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The corresponding values for blocks in Gp 4 were 3 (15 %), 13 (65 %), and 4 (20 %) respectively. Pairwise comparison of Friedman’s two-way ANOVA showed that the rank of color coding of dentin blocks receiving SDF+KI was significantly lower than those receiving SDF alone regardless of the lesion/sound status of the dentin surfaces (Gp 2 vs. Gp 1 and Gp 4 vs. Gp 3, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The blackening effect of topical application of SDF solution on dentin surfaces can be reduced by an immediate application of KI solution following it...|$|R
40|$|<b>Yellow</b> {{and blue}} <b>Pantone</b> colors were printed on a {{substrate}} with high Optical Brightening Agent (OBA) levels and then measured under different measurement conditions {{as outlined in}} ISO 13655. Both colors exhibited large DEOO shifts with lighter screen tints, as more paper influenced the measurement. The Pantone colors were further analysed after being printed on two different substrates with varying OBAs. While the solids were color-matched to a DEOO of less than 1. 0, the tints resulted in DEOO values above 7. 0 due to more paper influence in the lighter screen tints...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{dispersion}} and performance of tartrazine aluminum lake, 7 kinds of water-based resins are used to form disperse system. These systems are enviroment friendly (low VOC) and use edible yellow lake as colorant. If proper adjustment is added, these disperse systems can be made into ink and paint. The application field should be printing or coating on all the food or drug packages, toys and decorate materials, which will improve social safe level. Colorant, resin, wetting agent, co-solvent, emulsifier, and deionized water are mixed at certain ratio and pre-dispersed for 15 min, then dispersed in GJ- 2 S high speed sanding mill for 3 h. Size distribution, PDI, color characteristics (reflectance spectroscopy and color density), glossiness, abrasion performance, and stability are studied. Results demonstrate particle size of disperse system is 338. 1 ~ 595. 3 nm (PDI< 0. 3) and changed to 428. 6 ~ 551. 2 nm after 5 days or so. Reflectance spectroscopy is close to <b>PANTONE</b> standard <b>yellow.</b> Glossiness is referred as Gs(60 °) ≥ 32 °. Viscosity is 0. 2 ~ 2 Pa·S. Relative stable disperse system is prepared...|$|R
5000|$|Yellow is {{the most}} visible color from a distance, so it is often used for objects {{that need to be}} seen, such as fire engines, road {{maintenance}} equipment, school buses and taxicabs. It is also often used for warning signs, since yellow traditionally signals caution, rather than danger. Safety yellow is often used for safety and accident prevention information. A yellow light on a traffic signal means slow down, but not stop. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) uses <b>Pantone</b> 116 (a <b>yellow</b> hue) as their standard color implying [...] "general warning," [...] while the Federal Highway Administration similarly uses yellow to communicate warning or caution on highway signage. A yellow penalty card in a soccer match means warning, but not expulsion.|$|R
5000|$|The Galatasaray home kit {{have always}} been {{fundamentally}} the same since 1908. The traditional shirt of Galatasaray is the eight-piece halved design. This consists of the shirt’s front, back and sleeves being made up of two colours, resulting in the shirt being split into eight parts. (Two same colours are never {{next to each other}} within the 8 parts.) The colours continue in an alternating order, from yellow to red. This results {{in the front of the}} shirt being the opposite of the back and the shirt also having an halved design from the side. This alternating colour order of eight parts creates a complete halved design for the shirt.The classic eight-piece halved design would become the look of Galatasaray for around 80 years, until 1985 when sportswear manufacturer Adidas began to provide the shirts and the sleeves were made up by one colour and not halved. Created over a century ago, the classic Galatasaray kit combination consists of the eight-piece halved traditional shirt, white shorts and red socks and are usually worn as part of the home strp. This changed in the mid-1980s, when sportswear manufacturer Adidas began to provide the shirts. The club reverted to the [...] "classic" [...] kit in 2012. The official colours are <b>Pantone</b> shades 1235 (<b>yellow)</b> and 201 (red).|$|R
