"Gore {{talked about}} 2005 and 2004 being very strong seasons, {{and if you}} weren't paying attention, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> left with the {{impression}} that there was a direct cause and effect, but he was very careful to not say there's a direct correlation," [...] Schmidt said.

[...] "Never in the movie does he say: 'This particular event is caused by global warming.'" ...|$|E
500|$|By 1889 B'nai Yeshurun had outgrown its {{original}} cemetery, and the congregation purchased [...] on West Schantz Avenue in Oakwood. Oakwood was a [...] "restricted community"; Jews {{were not allowed}} to reside or own stores there. According to Leonard Spialter, president of the Dayton Jewish Genealogical Society, [...] "if you were dead, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> buried in Oakwood, but if you were alive, you couldn’t live there". Relatives began moving those buried at the Rubicon cemetery to the new [...] "Riverview Cemetery", including Lebensburger, who had died by this time. This process was not completed until 1967.|$|E

500|$|... "It Girl" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R love song, {{built on}} a finger-clicking beat. The song is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 95 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Derulo's vocal range spanning from the note of E4 to the note of B5. According to Rap-Up, the song's lyrics find Derulo as the male protagonist singing praises of [...] "a lovely lady", comparing her to his [...] "greatest hit". [...] "It Girl" [...] opens with a whistling intro and an acoustic guitar melody. In the first verse, he chants about how he searched all over and finally found the girl of his dreams. He also affirms that the girl means {{much more than a}} Grammy Award to him. Its hook, which forms part of the chorus, contains the lyrics: [...] "You could be my it girl / Baby, you're the shit girl / Lovin; <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a crime / Crazy how we fit, girl / This is it, girl / Gimme 25 to life / I just wanna rock all night long and put you {{in the middle of my}} spotlight / <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> my it girl / You're my biggest hit, girl / Let me play it loud." [...] Scott Shelter from Pop Crush noted that the song uses the [...] "oh-oh-oh-oh" [...] vocal chants after the chorus.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{graduation}} from college, Davis held jobs in Chicago as a sales clerk in Marshall Field's department store {{and as a}} nurse's aide. With {{the help of her}} mother's colleagues in theatre, including ZaSu Pitts, Walter Huston, and Spencer Tracy, she pursued a professional career as an actress. She first gained a part in Pitts' 1945 road tour of Ramshackle Inn, moving to New York City. She landed the role of Si-Tchun, a lady-in-waiting, in the 1946 Broadway musical about the Orient, Lute Song, starring Mary Martin and a pre-fame Yul Brynner. The show's producer told her, [...] "You look like <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> Chinese." ...|$|E

500|$|Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly {{questioned}} whether Darren could adjust to fatherhood, while What's on TV labelled him a [...] "doting father". Once Nancy became pregnant again Claire Crick of All About Soap said [...] "At last – {{some good news}} in Hollyoaks for once! Our favourite soapy couple, Nancy and Darren, discover they’re going to be parents once again in tonight's episode, and we’ve got our fingers (and toes!) crossed that it works out for them this time". She said that [...] "with Darren's cheeky escapades and Nancy's no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents and we can’t wait to see them with a little one". Crick {{went on to say}} [...] "while Darren might be dad to twins already (remember them? <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> forgiven for forgetting they even existed – it seems Darren already has!), we think he's got potential to be great daddy material".|$|E
500|$|The {{second game}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews, with a reviewer from PC Gamer commenting {{that what he}} had hoped for in the sequel [...] "was more mind games and more uncertainty. I wanted the plodding animatronic suits to find me and rip my face off in new and interesting ways. I wanted working legs", and that [...] "what I got was a horror game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety". However, {{he also noted that}} [...] "enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty". Destructoid also gave the game a positive review, saying that [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to know that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> attacked at any moment from multiple avenues" [...] and also praised the introduction of new animatronics and mechanics, but also criticizing the jumpscares and calling the game [...] "too hard for its own good".|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

500|$|As a child, Rogen did {{not want}} to pursue any career other than comedy, stating [...] "As soon as I {{realized}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> funny as a job, that was the job I wanted". He got his start in show business at age 12 after enrolling in a comedy workshop taught by Mark Pooley. His early comedy routines involved jokes about his bar mitzvah, his grandparents, and his camp counsellors. During his teenage years he would perform stand-up comedy routines at places like bar mitzvahs and small parties, later shifting to bars. A mohel paid him to write jokes. At the age of13, he co-wrote a rough draft of Superbad with childhood friend Evan Goldberg, whom he had met at bar mitzvah classes. Based on their teenage experiences, Rogen and Goldberg spent the rest of their time in high school polishing the script. They initially worried that American Pie (1999) had beaten them to the idea for the movie, but they decided that the film [...] "managed to totally avoid all honest interaction between characters... which is what we're going for." ...|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{creation}} of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained [...] "a little bit of [...] personality". Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E

500|$|While much of {{the novel}} shows Henry and Clare falling in love, the end is darker and [...] "time travel becomes a means for {{representing}} arbitrariness, transience, [...] plain bad luck", according to The Boston Globes Judith Maas. As Andrew Billen argues in The Times, [...] "The book may even serve as a feminist analysis of marriage as a partnership in which only the male is conceded the privilege of absence." [...] Several reviewers noted that time travel represents relationships in which couples cannot quite communicate with each other. Natasha Walter of The Guardian describes the story's attention to [...] "the sense of slippage that you get in any relationship—that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> living through a slightly different love story from the one your partner is experiencing." [...] She points, for example, to {{the section of the}} book which describes the first time Clare and Henry make love. She is 18 and he is 41, already married to her in his present. After this interlude, he returns to his own time and his own Clare, who says, ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "Airbag" [...] was {{inspired}} by the music of DJ Shadow and is underpinned by an electronic drum beat programmed from a seconds-long recording of Selway's drumming. The band sampled the drum track with a digital sampler and edited it with a Macintosh computer, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow's style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline in [...] "Airbag" [...] stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub. The song's references to automobile accidents and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled [...] "An Airbag Saved My Life" [...] and The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Yorke wrote [...] "Airbag" [...] about the illusion of safety offered by modern transit, and [...] "the idea that whenever you go out on the road <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> killed." [...] The BBC wrote of the influence of J. G. Ballard, especially his 1973 novel Crash on the song's lyrical content. Music journalist Tim Footman notes the song's technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrate the [...] "key paradox" [...] of the album: [...] "the musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact.... It's a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the 'real' guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums." ...|$|E
500|$|According to MTV's Monique Steele, Kim Possible is [...] "all {{about how}} girls kick butt"; Kim {{constantly}} rescues Ron, saving him from peril {{on numerous occasions}} throughout the series. Writing for Wewomen.com, Carla Cain Walther observed that the series [...] "scoffed at the 'damsel in distress' trope used in action films" [...] by having Kim save Ron [...] "using her ingenuity and strength", reinforcing the idea that girls are capable of helping themselves. Identifying Kim as a postfeminist heroine because she is intelligent {{in addition to being}} [...] "shaped like Barbie" [...] and having a male assistant similar to female executives, The New York Times Julie Salamon joked that [...] "Kim's job seems to be making the world safe for cheerleaders again, following the path forged by Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde on behalf of sorority girls." [...] Tor.com's Sarah Gailey observed that while Shego proudly spends much of her time lounging poolside and deciding what she does and does not want to do, Kim is forced [...] "to leap into action regardless of whether she's tired or sad or sick or, heaven forbid, too busy". Bustles Sarah Freymiller wrote that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype", citing cheerleading as an outlet the character chooses willingly. Kim is not a tomboy; Julia Pugachevsky of BuzzFeed credits the series with [...] "show that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> traditionally feminine and strong at the same time." [...] Conversely, Geek Chic: Smart Women in Popular Culture author S. Inness argued that Kim Possible reinforces that [...] "girls can do anything they choose" [...] but must look a certain way in order to do so since its female character participate in consumerism and normative femininity that its male characters do not, such as shopping and spending much time on their appearance. Inness also felt that show's feminist potential is compromised by the fact that Kim mostly surrounds herself with male companions as opposed to female, [...] "contradict the messages of female solidarity".|$|E
