5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos was unlike any <b>yet</b> <b>seen</b> in the Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old hit-and-run tactics {{and launched a}} conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the flanks of the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E
5|$|Wills held no {{positions}} of power at the South Melbourne Cricket Club and only occasionally appeared in local team lists. He nonetheless convinced the club to open its ground to football in winter by arguing {{that it would make}} the turf firm and durable. Other clubs soon followed South Melbourne's example and football adapted to an oval-shaped field. By now, the sport had spread throughout Australasia with Melbourne matches attracting the world's largest football crowds <b>yet</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{explorer}} David Thompson, of the North West Company, {{spent the}} winter of 1807–08 at Kootanae House near {{the source of the}} Columbia at present-day Invermere, British Columbia. Over the next few years he explored much of the river and its northern tributaries. In 1811 he traveled down the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean, arriving at the mouth just after John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company had founded Astoria. On his return to the north, Thompson explored the one remaining part of the river he had not <b>yet</b> <b>seen,</b> becoming the first European-American to travel {{the entire length of the}} river.|$|E
5|$|Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, 34, a Jordanian {{military}} intelligence officer, {{was killed in}} the attack. He was the Jordanian handler of al-Balawi and the liaison between him and the CIA. Bin Zeid was a cousin to King Abdullah II of Jordan. Bin Zeid's wake was held in the Royal Palace. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania attended his funeral. Official Jordanian news reports said that he died while performing humanitarian service in Afghanistan. His death shed light on the U.S.-Jordanian intelligence partnership, which is rarely acknowledged publicly, <b>yet</b> <b>seen</b> by U.S. officials as highly important for their counter-terrorism strategy.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February 1917, in {{a tribute}} {{from his native}} city, Ball became an Honorary Freeman of Nottingham. Around this time he met James McCudden, also on leave, who later {{reported}} his impressions in most favourable terms. In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot Billy Bishop, who had not as <b>yet</b> <b>seen</b> combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and may have helped the latter secure a posting to No.60 Squadron. On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He impulsively invited her to fly with him, and she promptly accepted, wearing a leather flying coat that they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore his silver identification wrist bracelet in lieu of an engagement ring.|$|E

5|$|Simon Keynes saw Æthelstan's law-making as his {{greatest}} achievement. His reign predates the sophisticated {{state of the}} later Anglo-Saxon period, but his creation of the most centralised government England had <b>yet</b> <b>seen,</b> with the king and his council working strategically to ensure acceptance of his authority and laws, laid the foundations on which his brothers and nephews would create {{one of the wealthiest}} and most advanced systems of government in Europe. Æthelstan's reign built upon his grandfather's ecclesiastical programme, consolidating the local ecclesiastical revival and laying the foundation for the monastic reform movement later in the century.|$|E
5|$|Montagu, having {{delivered}} the Scottish embassy to Newcastle, left there on 14 May, either with Lords Greystoke and Willoughby or picking them up en route with other supporters, {{to seek out}} the Lancastrians. The next day, at Hexham- having crossed the Tyne 'either at Bulwell or Corbridge'- he attacked the rebels in their camp which was {{on the south side of}} Devil's Water river. Montagu, his army swelled with new recruits from Newcastle, and men raised by Montagu's brother, the Archbishop of York, may have had up to 10,000 men. Leading his army 'forward at the charge,' Montagu's attack soon became a rout, with the Lancastrian army dissolving and attempting escape over the bridge. Lords Roos, Hungerford, Findern, and Tallboys survived the battle only to be executed, on Montagu's order- and probably in his presence- with the Duke of Somerset in Newcastle. Following Hexham, Montagu ordered the largest number of beheadings the civil wars had <b>yet</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E

5|$|On the 60th {{anniversary of}} the sinking, 60 Minutes ran a story demonstrating that the wreck was not Centaur. It was {{revealed}} that nobody at the Queensland Maritime Museum had <b>yet</b> <b>seen</b> Dennis' footage, {{and when it was}} shown to Museum president Rod McLeod and maritime historian John Foley, they stated that the shipwreck could not be Centaur due to physical inconsistencies, such as an incorrect rudder. Following this story, and others published around the same time in newspapers, the Navy sent three ships to inspect the site over a two-month period; HMA Ships , , and , before concluding that the shipwreck was incorrectly identified as Centaur. An amendment was made to the gazettal, and the Hydrographic Office began to remove the mark from charts.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{army had}} not <b>yet</b> <b>seen</b> {{elephants}} in battle, and their inexperience turned the tide in Pyrrhus' favour at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, {{and again at}} the Battle of Ausculum in 279 BC. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with Carthage, and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, none of the other Italic peoples would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause. Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, and failing to find further allies in Italy, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in Sicily against Carthage, abandoning his allies to deal with the Romans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, {{including}} some of the most famous battles in history. During the first invasion, Thrace, Macedon and the Aegean islands were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed. However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes then led the second invasion personally in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece. Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated in the twin battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium on land and at sea respectively. All of Greece except the Peloponnesus thus fell into Persian hands, but then seeking to finally destroy the Allied navy, the Persians suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army <b>yet</b> <b>seen</b> and defeated the Persian invasion force at the Battle of Plataea, ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.|$|E
