60|$|The {{bad thing}} {{which you have}} done, or the bad tempers which you have given way to, or the person whom you have quarrelled with, hang in your mind, and darken all your thoughts: and <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} them: but conscience makes you remember them, and will not let the dark thought fly away; till you can enjoy nothing, because your heart is not clean and clear; {{there is something in}} the background which makes you sad whenever you try to be happy. Then a man tries first to deceive himself. He says to himself, 'No, that sin is not what makes me unhappy--not that;' and he tries to find out any and every reason for his uncomfortable feelings, except the very thing which he knows all the while in the bottom of his heart is the real reason. He says, 'Well, perhaps I am unhappy because I have done something wrong: what wrong can I have done?' And so he sets to work to find out every sin except the sin which is the cause of all, because that one he does not like to face: it is too real, and ugly, and humbling to his proud spirit; and perhaps he is afraid of having to give it up. So I have known a man confess himself a sinner, a miserable sinner, freely enough, and then break out into a rage with you, if you dare to speak a word of the one sin which you know that he has actually committed. 'No, sir,' he will say, 'whatever I may be wrong in, I am right there. I have committed sins too many, I know: but you cannot charge me with that, at least;'--and all the more because he knows that everybody round is charging him with it, and that the thing is as notorious as the sun in heaven. But that makes him, in his pride, all the more determined not to confess himself in the wrong on that one point; and he will go and confess to God, and perhaps to man, all manner of secret sins, nay, even invent sins for himself out of things which are no sins, and confess himself humbly in the wrong where perhaps he is all right, just to drug his conscience, and be able to say, 'I have repented,'--repented, that is, of everything but what he and all the world know that he ought to repent of.|$|E

5000|$|According to Josh Klinghoffer, [...] "Sick Love" [...] "was a {{song that}} {{we were working on}} for awhile before we started {{recording}} it, and it just sounded like Elton John was involved somehow, someway. So we thought we should just invite him down and see if he likes it and wants to play on it.” Chad Smith said of the recording [...] "He was kind of nervous. It was actually really kind of cute. When he came in, he looked for somewhere to sit really quick, and he sat down. Anthony Kiedis added “As soon as he touched the piano it was magical. <b>You</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be a fan boy, but it is Sir Elton John… He talked about everything and was really cool… It’s a real honour for us to have him on the record.” The chord structure and melody of the song were inspired by John's classic [...] "Bennie and the Jets".|$|E

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 197. Jimmie Johnson {{was running}} third when he cut down his left-front tire on lap 200. He rejoined {{the race in}} 29th one lap down. The seventh caution of the race flew for a two-car wreck in turn 1. Going into the turn, Ryan Newman got loose and sent Danica Patrick spinning into the wall. She made contact with the wall, slid back down the track and got t-boned by David Ragan. After a voluntary visit to the infield care center (she wasn't required to visit it since she drove her car back to the garage), {{she said that she}} was [...] "on track to have a potentially good finish today. It was kind of back and forth with the two- and four-tire cycle that was happening but definitely on the long run with everyone with four tires or with everyone kind of stringing out we had gotten {{all the way up to}} 12th. It sucks. It seems like nothing ever goes wrong on those days that you’re just trudging along in 27th, you know? It only happens when you’re having a good race." [...] Ragan commented that he didn't [...] "know what happened to her, but typically when you hit the wall you hold onto the brakes, you lock it down -- <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come back across the track. I saw her coming back down and I was trying. I didn’t want to lock my brakes up because I knew I would hit her, so I was trying to just get it as low as I could and just couldn’t get it as low as I needed to. Unfortunate to get involved in a wreck like that. Just one of those deals. I hate it for everybody that works on these race cars. We needed a good finish today, but I wish that she would have locked her brakes up and would have stayed up on the wall."

As a mother of a multicultural and-linguistic child I was quite intrigued to know about the benefits and disadvantages of living in a carrefour of cultures and languages without really being identified with only one but forced to construct a reality through all of them. My questions were socio-cultural and his reasoning was scientific, and his message quite simple. Diversity is good for the species, he said, and isolation leads literally to a poverty of mind. He smiled at my concerns that he called very European and said that turning our back to diversity would be like denying our offspring. “We carry diversity within ” he said, “and we are equipped with a physical capacity to speak many languages, think through different cultural landscapes and it is only good that we meet, mix and produc...|$|E
