5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical.

Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Coming Up for Air are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E

Whereas {{there were some}} differences in perceptions of <b>young</b> <b>women</b> drinkers across the alcohol brands, the greatest differential in the personality ratings {{was caused by the}} mere presence or absence of alcohol. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> drink alcohol were described as being more 2 ̆ 2 interesting 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 self-assured 2 ̆ 2 than <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> do not drink. These positive traits were reliably ascribed to <b>young</b> <b>women</b> drinkers by both young adult men and <b>young</b> adult <b>women</b> and more strongly by those who themselves drink. Although it is possible that <b>young</b> <b>women</b> drinkers really are differentially interesting and self-assured, a more likely contributor to these perceptions is advertising aimed at the female drinker...|$|R

5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint. The blisters, usually concentrated on the hoods, fenders and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and peeling paint was also reported on one Shreveport home. Most of the cars damaged were parked outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{the determinants of}} institutional delivery among <b>young</b> married <b>women</b> in Nepal. DESIGN: Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data sets 2011 were analysed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using a subset of 1662 ever-married <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (aged 15 - 24 years). OUTCOME MEASURE: Place of delivery. RESULTS: The rate of institutional delivery among <b>young</b> married <b>women</b> was 46 %, which {{is higher than the}} national average (35 %) among all women of reproductive age. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had more than four antenatal care (ANC) visits were {{three times more likely to}} deliver in a health institution compared with <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had no antenatal care visit (OR: 3. 05; 95 % CI: 2. 40 to 3. 87). The probability of delivering in an institution was 69 % higher among <b>young</b> urban <b>women</b> than among <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> lived in rural areas. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had secondary or above secondary level education were 1. 63 times more likely to choose institutional delivery than <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had no formal education (OR: 1. 626; 95 % CI: 1. 171 to 2. 258). Lower use of a health institution for delivery was also observed among poor <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> Results showed that wealthy <b>young</b> <b>women</b> were 2. 12 times more likely to deliver their child in an institution compared with poor <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (OR: 2. 107; 95 % CI: 1. 53 to 2. 898). Other factors such as the age of the <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> religion, ethnicity, and ecological zone were also associated with institutional delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal health programs should be designed to encourage <b>young</b> <b>women</b> to receive adequate ANC (at least four visits). Moreover, health programs should target poor, less educated, rural, <b>young</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> live in mountain regions, are of Janajati ethnicity and have at least one child as such women are less likely to choose institutional delivery in Nepal...|$|R
