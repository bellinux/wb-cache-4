500|$|... "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} on January 27, 1956, with B-side [...] "I Was the One", a song that was also recorded during Presley's RCA Victor debut sessions. Billboard magazine praised it as [...] "a strong blues item wrapped up in his usual powerful style and a great beat". However, [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] was less-than-warmly received by the British music press. The New Musical Express wrote that, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> good singing, I don't suppose you'll manage to hear this disc all through". BBC, which held a monopoly on broadcasting in Britain at the time, didn't consider it fit for general entertainment {{and placed it on}} its [...] "restricted play" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|Michael Sragow of Baltimore Sun {{described}} the only [...] "perfect aspect" [...] of Jennifer's Body as being its title. [...] "No {{one is going}} to like this movie for its brain", he said. Claudia Puig of USA Today stated of the film, [...] "Jennifer's Body is not as hot as you hope it would be". Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and [...] "orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious". Jennifer's Body, he said, wants [...] "so badly" [...] to be a Heathers-esque dark comedy, [...] "but its shortcomings makes <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> why that earlier film was so great". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe also said the film wants to be like Heathers, and reminded him [...] "a lot" [...] of Heathers but the only scene in the film that [...] "actually feels dangerous" [...] is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film [...] "very, very nervously backs away from" [...] and that [...] "Jennifer's Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, in this case a glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre".|$|E

500|$|Upon release, First Strike was a {{critical}} and commercial success, being the first Halo novel to make The New York Times bestsellers list. IGN stated that the writing was [...] "terse and exciting" [...] and that players waiting {{for the release of}} Halo 2 could pick up interesting hints about what was to come in the game and in the ilovebees viral marketing campaign. About.com's Eric Qualls stated that First Strike and the other Halo novels [...] "make <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> Halo and Halo 2 a hundred times more", and strongly recommended that fans of the game pick up the novel. Shawn of Digital Monkey Box criticized the way the Nylund sidelines characters who were developed early in the book as the Master Chief takes precedence but overall praised the book highly. Nylund's character development and the ethical challenges presented to the Master Chief were praised however and reviewer Josh Carter considered it superior to either of the previous books. When Phil Jones reviewed the book for Science Fiction Crowsnest he found that [...] "the combat does get somewhat tiresome" [...] but concluded that the book was a good, easy read and [...] "as spin-offs go, it's not bad." [...] The First Strike audiobook was also well received, reviewer Cliff Bakehorn commenting that [...] "Todd McLaren did a good job narrating", as well as finding it to be [...] "an exciting story throughout." ...|$|E
500|$|Rivera is well {{respected}} throughout baseball for his professionalism. Fellow closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "I {{look up to}} how he's handled himself {{on and off the}} field... You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him." [...] Michael Young said of Rivera, [...] "I respect Mo more than anybody in the game. The guy goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [...] Posada's hand. <b>You</b> <b>appreciate</b> someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." [...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among college audiences, a {{contemporaneous}} review {{pointed to}} the band's originality in a genre [...] "so codified that a little change in tradition is apocalyptic," [...] citing the band's experimental notes as quirky and bizarre, yet [...] "such loving care is taken with the obvious influences that <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> the music for simply reaffirming everything that's right about pop. It's {{one of the most}} important reasons for liking Game Theory, because any band with good taste is worth saving from obscurity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{appreciate}} it later--you'll {{appreciate it}} very soon.

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know you}} do," [...] said Rachel. [...] "No one ever can judge of a manuscript. You {{have done all}} I wished you to do, and I value your sincerity.

2500|$|Many reporters {{asked him}} if he would {{petition}} the Chief Justice to appeal the convictions that Judge Squires denied grounds of appeal, to which Shaik replied that his legal team was considering the matter. [...] The National Prosecuting Authority, as represented by spokesperson Makhosini Nkosi in front of the courthouse, said that it accepted Judge Squires' decision, despite some disappointment. [...] Nkosi also said that [...] "We [...] are satisfied that the judge applied his mind correctly to all the facts. [...] In some cases, we are naturally disappointed, but even then <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> the reasons for coming to that decision".|$|E
2500|$|It was at {{this point}} that the {{commander}} of New Guinea Force, Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell decided to recall Potts to Port Moresby, returning Porter to command of the 21st Brigade. Rowell's motives have been debated, but they appear to be a combination of frustration at the lack of forward movement, and a desire to have a first hand account of the situation. Rowell did not consult with Allen. He also sent a message to Major General George Alan Vasey, Deputy Chief of General Staff, informing him of Potts' removal. He continued [...] "I trust <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> the gravity of immediate situation, and will produce additional troops asked for particularly infantry, with minimum delay".|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{developed}} a reputation as an agitator for his aggressive play and verbal instigation while playing for the Chicago Blackhawks. He compared his playstyle to Boston Bruins player Brad Marchand, saying [...] "We're both agitators. We both play physical and we're always chirping." [...] Joel Quenneville, who coached Shaw in Chicago, praised Shaw by stating, [...] "You're {{not going to find}} the same ingredient that [...] provides, whether it's the game-to-game consistency of being an agitator, net-front presence on your power play, good in the room, good on the bench, good on the ice, smart hockey player, makes plays, brings that nastiness <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> and comes ready to play every game." [...] Shaw has also gained the nickname [...] "Mutt" [...] from some of his teammates and fans regarding his rough style of play.|$|E

[...] alluding to {{the speed with which}} the event was organised. He then introduces the first group of musicians, led by Shankar, who, like Harrison, attempts to convey the intricacies of Indian classical music to the audience, as well as outlining the reason for this [...] "special benefit concert". Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan proceed to tune their instruments and then stop after about 90 seconds. The audience, apparently believing they have heard an entire piece, respond with enthusiastic applause, to which Shankar replies: [...] "Thank you, if <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> the tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more." [...] The four musicians then launch into a fifteen-minute dhun.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to reports that Fred Durst, {{lead singer of}} Limp Bizkit, is {{a big fan of}} Tool, the latter's vocalist Maynard James Keenan said, [...] "If the lunch-lady in high school hits on you, <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> the compliment, but you're not really gonna start dating the lunch-lady, are ya?" [...] While Durst has cited Rage Against the Machine as a major influence, Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine is open about hating Limp Bizkit's music. At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Limp Bizkit won the Best Rock Video category for their song [...] "Break Stuff", beating Rage Against the Machine's [...] "Sleep Now in the Fire". When Limp Bizkit accepted their award, Commerford went on stage and climbed [...] up a backdrop, rocking back and forth. After the incident, Commerford was arrested and spent a night in jail. Years later, Tim Commerford called Limp Bizkit [...] "one of the dumbest bands in the history of music". Years later, Commerford also said, [...] "I do apologize for Limp Bizkit. I really do. I feel really bad that we inspired such bullshit... They're gone, though. That's the beautiful thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN {{described}} Legacy as the [...] "most elegantly produced web series", giving particular {{mention to}} episode one for [...] "effective action sequences and some great cinematography". It looked favorably upon episode 4 {{for the first}} use of [...] "extraordinarily effective" [...] animation and [...] "poetic" [...] voice-over narration, the removal of censorship, the [...] "fascinating character lore and dazzling fantasy [...] a beautifully crafted land of Outworld". Episode five was praised for the score, the attention paid to the character development and story, the editing and the [...] "quite great" [...] visual effects. CraveOnline praised the animation style used in episode four, saying Mileena's emerging heritage and the Tarkatan invasion were the episode's best parts. G4TV praised the third episode in the series for its shift towards character development, while {{not at the expense}} of the action sequences set forth in the first two episodes. It [...] "allowed the series to broaden its horizons a bit" [...] by creating a likable Johnny Cage, commenting, he [...] "finally lets loose and makes <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> the character in a whole new way". Houston Press also joined in the praise of the series' devotion to character development upon the release of Raiden's episode. They stated that while the martial arts took a backseat, the drama of Raiden's [...] "Christlike" [...] story was well executed, giving audiences a reason to identify with his character in a way the franchise has never been able to do. The Escapist called the Scorpion and Sub-Zero-themed episode 7 [...] "one of the best episodes" [...] in the series, lending an emotional weight to the most famous tale in the franchise.|$|E
