25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E
500|$|If Judge Landis was {{suspicious}} of an attorney's line of questioning, he {{would begin to}} wrinkle his nose, and once told a witness, [...] "Now let's stop fooling around and tell exactly what did happen, without reciting your life's history." [...] When an elderly defendant {{told him that he}} would not be able to live to complete a five-year sentence, Landis scowled at him and asked, [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>try,</b> can't you?" [...] When a young man stood before him for sentencing after admitting to stealing jewels from a parcel, the defendant's wife stood near him, infant daughter in her arms, and Landis mused what to do about the situation. After a dramatic pause, Landis ordered the young man to take his wife and daughter and go home with them, expressing his unwillingness to have the girl be the daughter of a convict. According to sportswriter Ed Fitzgerald in SPORT magazine, [...] "omen wept unashamed and the entire courtroom burst into spontaneous, prolonged applause." ...|$|E
500|$|Mouton's only WRC {{event of}} the year was the long-distance Rallye Côte d'Ivoire. She was co-driven by Arne Hertz as Pons was ill {{at the time of the}} start. Mouton started well and tied the lead with Toyota's Juha Kankkunen after the first day. Her Quattro {{incurred}} severe engine problems on the next day, but was seemingly repaired by Audi mechanics off the route in the jungle. At the same time, the Sport Quattro [...] "chase car", a high-speed service car, retired and Audi faced accusations of swapping the cars. The team withdrew Mouton just before the finish and the controversy remains unresolved; the stewards did not find proof but the media published evidence afterwards. Although her rallying year was a disappointment, Mouton made a successful return to the Pikes Peak, winning the event overall in her Sport Quattro. Despite slippery conditions caused by a hailstorm, she broke Al Unser, Jr.'s 1982 record by about thirteen seconds. The Frenchwoman's win irritated some of her male rivals. Bobby Unser was reputedly quite vocal about his loss, to which Mouton is said to have replied: [...] "If you have the balls <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to race me back down as well." ...|$|E

And when the Prime Minister of your country calls, all <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to do is stay in the same lane, avoid any fender-benders and have a meaningful conversation, which I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|A claim {{put forth}} by the Drudge Report that the newly {{released}} document was a forgery made with image editing software quickly spread on the Internet. Nathan Goulding, chief technology officer of the National Review magazine, dismissed the matter of [...] "layered components" [...] found in the White House PDF by suggesting [...] "that whoever scanned the birth certificate in Hawaii forgot {{to turn off the}} OCR setting on the scanner." [...] Nathan added [...] "I’ve confirmed that scanning an image, converting it to a PDF, optimizing that PDF, and then opening it up in Illustrator, does in fact create layers similar to what is seen in the birth certificate PDF. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> it yourself at home." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wu Shu {{recorded}} that Sun Ce once led {{a military}} expedition against the Shanyue and {{ventured into the}} hills alone after slaying the Shanyue chief and sending his men to pursue and destroy the remaining Shanyue forces. He encountered Yu Fan, who asked him where his bodyguards were. When Sun Ce {{told him that he}} had ordered his bodyguards to join the rest of his men in attacking the Shanyue, Yu Fan exclaimed, [...] "This is so dangerous!" [...] He then asked Sun Ce to dismount from his horse and said, [...] "The terrain here is deep and dangerous. You can't control your horse well under such conditions, so you should travel on foot, guide your horse along, and arm yourself with a bow and arrows. I'm good in using a spear and I'll lead the way." [...] After reaching flat ground, Sun Ce mounted his horse again and asked Yu Fan, [...] "You don't have a horse. What are you going to do?" [...] Yu Fan replied, [...] "I can travel on foot. I'm capable of travelling 300 li in a day. Since the start of the campaigns, no one has been able to match my pace. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> letting a horse run and I'll catch up with it on foot." [...] They encountered a signaller at the main road. Sun Ce took the signaller's horn and blew it. His men recognised the sound of the horn and rushed there to join him. They patrolled the area and pacified the three commanderies.|$|E
