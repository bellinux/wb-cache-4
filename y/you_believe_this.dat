500|$|N'Bushe Wright, {{best known}} {{to this point}} for playing the student activist Claudia Bishop in the NBC drama series I'll Fly Away, made a guest {{appearance}} in [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] as the cleaning woman Loretta Kenyatta. Wright was cast in the role based on her performance in Zebrahead (1992), a drama film about an interracial romance. A number of songs play on radios in the squad room throughout [...] "Night of the Dead Living".

500|$|Carman—the QC {{recruited}} by Bolton—was the last {{contributor to the}} documentary. Presented with This Week evidence, he disagreed with Margaret Thatcher's statement that the inquest would be sufficient to establish {{the facts of the}} incident. He opined that a more powerful judicial enquiry, possibly headed by a British High Court judge, would be better equipped to eliminate the inconsistencies between the official version of events and the eyewitness statements. In conclusion, Manyon asked Carman [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> case is so important that the government should take such extraordinary steps in order to clarify the facts?" [...] Carman responded [...] "the programme indicates there are serious, important public issues involved, and speaking as a lawyer, one is always anxious when there is contest on the facts in such important areas, they should be properly and efficiently investigated". The documentary closed with Jonathan Dimbleby: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{theme song}} for Homicide: Life on the Street was {{composed}} by Lynn F. Kowal, who submitted {{one of several}} tapes sent to the producers for consideration. Homicide producers initially had trouble finding the right song, and Levinson ultimately chose Kowal's themes because, {{while most of the}} candidates too closely resembled typical television theme songs, Levinson felt Kowal's song [...] "had that odd quality to it, drums or whatever, and it was very unusual". Music is presented in various ways throughout the first season of Homicide. Some songs are played on radios that play in the homicide squad room, like [...] "Lay Down My Life" [...] by Carole King, [...] "Texas Slide" [...] by Jean-Jacques Milteau, [...] "N.Y.C (Can <b>You</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>This</b> City?)" [...] by Charles & Eddie, [...] "Little Boy Blues" [...] and [...] "Break Up" [...] by , and [...] "Tropic Call" [...] by Mitchell Coodley and Andrew Snitzer, all of which are featured in [...] "Night of the Dead Living". Other songs are more integrated into the show itself, like [...] "Hazy Shade of Blue", a Tor Hyams song that plays while the police raid several neighborhood homes in search of clues during [...] "Ghost of a Chance", and the hymn [...] "The Sweet By and By", which is sung at a church during Adena Watson's funeral in that same episode. Several other songs are featured in episodes throughout the first season, including [...] "Elephant Walk" [...] by The Kings, [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] by Sonny Bono, [...] "Going' Around in Circles" [...] by Jules Taub, [...] "Telephone Blues" [...] by Sam Ling and George Smith, and [...] "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" [...] by Freddie Perren and Christine Yarian.|$|E

2500|$|Aniston {{starred in}} the film Cake (2014), {{directed}} by Daniel Barnz, portraying an astringent woman named Claire Simmons who struggles with chronic pain. The film received mixed reviews; however, Aniston's performance was highly praised, dubbed by some critics as [...] "Oscar-worthy." [...] The Toronto International Film Festival called her performance [...] "heartbreakingly good", Gregory Ellwood of HitFix stated, [...] "It's really on most people's radar for being a rare dramatic turn for Jennifer Aniston, and she doesn't disappoint." [...] He further stated, [...] "Aniston makes you believe in Claire's pain. She makes <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> character is at her lowest point and only she can pull herself out of it. [...] It's a complete performance {{from beginning to end}} and she deserves the appropriate accolades for it." [...] For her portrayal, Aniston was nominated for the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. The movie also starred Adriana Barraza, Anna Kendrick, Sam Worthington, Felicity Huffman, and William H. Macy.|$|E

6000|$|CONFUCIUS. He {{says he has}} invented such a method.
