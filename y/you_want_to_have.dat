25|$|As a {{concrete}} example, suppose you ran a cruise ship. You {{have to decide}} how many famous comedians to hire. This boat can handle {{no more than one}} ton of passengers and the entertainers must weigh less than 1000lbs. Each comedian has a weight, brings in business based on their popularity and asks for a specific salary. In this example you have multiple objectives. You want, of course, to maximize the popularity of your entertainers while minimizing their salaries. Also, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as many entertainers as possible.|$|E

Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated: [...] "We wrote about what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> happen with people you love. I think Will and Grace end up very fleshed out. They end up as full adults. All the things that matter in life, they end up having." [...] Three years before the series finale was created, Mutchnick was asked on his opinion regarding how {{he would like to}} see the character's story come to a conclusion, [...] "The truth is that [...] serve each other's dysfunction.

500|$|The North American {{release was}} {{scheduled}} for July 11, 2008, but was delayed until August 15, before being brought forward to August 13. As {{a result of the}} move from July, 20th Century Fox moved its family comedy Meet Dave in the open slot. The August 13 release date was also the opening weekends for the animated family film [...] and the horror film Mirrors. Studios consider the third week of August to be a weaker performing period than earlier in the summer because of students returning to school. Previous R-rated comedies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Superbad were released in mid-August and performed well at the box office. Reacting to Tropic Thunders release date, Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated: [...] "For a young person at the end of summer, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some fun and forget about going back to school. What better than a crazy comedy?" ...|$|E

500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, because <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a good time. I hate having to skip a track. I wanted to make an album you can just play." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, eight teams participated, {{including}} Slovakia for {{the first}} time. The Canadian and American teams outscored opponents in the preliminary round by 41–2 and 31–1 margins, respectively. This brought on more criticism about uneven competition. IOC president Jacques Rogge said, [...] "There is a discrepancy there, everyone agrees with that. This is maybe the investment period in women's ice hockey. I would personally give them more time to grow {{but there must be}} a period of improvement. We cannot continue without improvement." [...] Swedish team coach Peter Elander said it is hard for other nations to compete {{because of a lack of}} funding and a smaller pool of players to choose from. He said, [...] "The finances for all teams have to be the same. ... If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a close tournament in Sochi (for the 2014 Olympics), have (comparable) national programs in all countries." [...] Some critics suggested that a mercy rule be implemented to prevent such lopsided scores. René Fasel said the IIHF would consider adding one. Chinese team coach Hannu Saintula, whose team was defeated 12–1 by the Americans, and American coach Mark Johnson, did not favor the idea.|$|E

She brings her usual stage presence to this music video. Bright, beautiful, and definitely hot." [...] For his own website, he further {{wrote that the}} clip is [...] "filled with summer sounds and gorgeous visuals that excite [...] for summer" [...] and that [...] "Inna is stylishly sexy". Currinn awarded it {{four out of five}} stars, concluding that [...] "this video totally works, although it's a shame there wasn't a romantic element in the visual". Urban.ro said that the music video is [...] "full of colorful frameworks that make us think about summer", while Russian website Zircular pointed out the absence of a plot and stated that Inna [...] "focuses on the male audience". ZU TV wrote that [...] " [...] and her dancers warm up the atmosphere and make <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun". The music video received notable airplay on Romanian television, peaking at number eight on Media Forest's TV Airplay Chart in April 2017.|$|E

2500|$|A {{prominent}} {{theme in}} Slug's lyrics is his allegorical usage of women, especially in his earlier work. A notable use of women by Slug {{is in the}} song [...] "Woman with the Tattooed Hands", which he has said is [...] "a metaphor for that same old shit that everybody has already made songs about. Just trying to find your place within a belief and faith {{as well as people}} that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex with." [...] Further examples come in the song [...] "Abusing of the Rib" [...] from {{it has been said that}} the [...] "lover" [...] Slug speaks of is actually an allegory for hip-hop itself. In the tour-only release Sad Clown Bad Dub II, Slug used both symbolism and metaphor with references to nature and relationships throughout each song, culminating in the album's penultimate track [...] "The River." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carter Burwell, the {{composer}} of Twilight and , returned to score the final {{installment of the}} series. In later announcements, Burwell confirmed that the score for the film was complete. [...] "The movie basically upholds the final installment with a score that has the same jungle-music feeling [...] brought us," [...] Burwell affirmed. [...] "The music pieces {{that take place in}} the catalytic final battle will be very much like the nineteenth song in the previous movie's score, 'It's Renesmee' and the twenty-fourth, 'You Kill Her You Kill Me', which were, if not the most, one of the boldest pieces in my career. I will tease anything but I recommend for the fans to listen to 'A Kick in the Head', 'Exacueret Nostri Dentes in Filia' and 'Aro's End' if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> goosebumps {{for the rest of your}} life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers {{were less}} {{enthusiastic}} {{in regards to}} the game's cast of characters. USGamer's Jeremy Parish, in his Chrono Cross retrospective, felt that the creators were needlessly harsh in their treatment and uncertain fates of returning Chrono Trigger characters, a sentiment also echoed by Tieryas. Furthermore, Parish criticized the size and quality of the cast, comparing it to a failed attempt to mimic Pokémon or Suikodens large casts. He concluded that too many of the characters didn't impact the game enough, stating, [...] "The characters are the definition of slight – most of them have little personality outside of a hokey accent – but the core cast has purpose, while everyone else is there in case <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a giant voodoo doll, mushroom man, or baby alien in your party for some reason. Simon Seamann of RPGamer also criticized the difficulty in switching characters and transferring equipment between them, which he felt discouraged players from experiencing the full-breadth of the varied cast. Lack of character development outside of the core, required cast of characters was also cited as a problem.|$|E

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go {{up in the air and}} try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
