500|$|Initially, Nolan {{wrote an}} 80-page {{treatment}} about dream-stealers. Originally, Nolan had envisioned Inception as a horror film, but eventually wrote it as a heist film {{even though he}} found that [...] "traditionally [...] are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms." [...] Upon revisiting his script, he decided that basing it in that genre did not work because the story [...] "relies so heavily {{on the idea of}} the interior state, the idea of dream and memory. I realized I needed to raise the emotional stakes." [...] Nolan worked on the script for nine to ten years. When he first started thinking about making the film, Nolan was influenced by [...] "that era of movies where you had The Matrix (1999), you had Dark City (1998), you had The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and, to a certain extent, you had Memento (2000), too. They were based in the principles that the world around <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> real." ...|$|E
500|$|Gregg Shapiro of the Bay Area Reporter {{gave the}} album a mostly {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "hazardous waste". He {{also noted that}} Spears's voice was [...] "reedy, cold and mechanical" [...] when stripped from the original mixes. However, he highlighted two tracks, saying: [...] "Spears comes closest to achieving dance-diva status on the Valentin remix of [...] "Everytime", while the Davidson Ospina 2005 remix of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] elevates the original bubblegum track to club classic." [...] Mike Daniel of The Dallas Morning News called the Justice remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] the best track of the album, but said it [...] "has {{the feel of a}} hastily executed stopgap measure with almost no marketing-related thought behind it except to fulfill the once-every-two-years release cycle that's been established for Britney material." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt noted the remixes [...] "amps already-aggressive singles like [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to brain-popping levels of synth spiraling", and transforms [...] "sad-eyed slow jams like [...] "Everytime" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] into Hi-NRG bursts. This party is BYORB (Bring Your Own Red Bull); without it, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to keep up." ...|$|E

"To comfort <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> farther forward {{than you}} are now, Mr. Saddletree," [...] replied Mr. Butler; [...] "for our Scottish advocates are an aristocratic race. Their brass is of the right Corinthian quality, and Non cuivis contigit adire Corinthum--Aha, Mr. Saddletree?" ...|$|R
40|$|Becoming an {{effective}} manager {{of any kind}} can be a daunting task. You can find tons {{of information about the}} basics of management from the greats like Peter Drucker, Kenneth Blanchard and Tom Peters. But, what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> find <b>is</b> a simple recipe for successfully navigating the technical management waters...|$|R
2500|$|... "And if {{you have}} reason to fear {{that you might not}} act equitably towards orphans, then marry from among [...] women such as are lawful to you - [...] two, or three, or four: but {{if you have}} reason to fear that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to treat them with equal fairness, then [...] one - or [...] those whom you {{rightfully}} possess. This will make it more likely that you will not deviate from the right course." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{on in the}} letter, Gottlieb {{stated that}} he still had faith in Toole {{as a writer and}} that he wished to hold onto the {{manuscript}} in case he or Toole would be able to see a way around his objections. Toole decided that it would be best for Gottlieb to return the manuscript, saying [...] "Aside from a few deletions, I don't think I could really do much to the book now—and of course even with revisions <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> satisfied." [...] Toole made a trip to New York to see Gottlieb in person; however, he was out of town and Toole came back disappointed. He felt that he had embarrassed himself by giving a rambling, uncomfortable speech explaining his situation to one of Gottlieb's office staff. He returned home having left a note for Gottlieb to call him, and they later talked for an hour on the phone. In this conversation Gottlieb re-iterated that he would not accept the novel without further revision. He suggested that Toole move on to writing something else, an idea which Toole ultimately rejected.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} taken during its release, Ice Cube said: [...] "I {{want to make}} a record that was like a history book. I wanted to make a record that does what all good hip-hop does: it makes you feel good; it kind of pumps you up, but it also shows you a part of life that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> paying attention to or <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even know exists".|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ah! I {{thought it}} {{possible}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{able to follow}} the dictate of your own heart; {{but this is a}} fortunate conjuncture, in the absence of your guardian.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, your honour, it {{has been}} so hard getting away from there, that I should not have thought you wished to put your foot inside the place again. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> so lucky in getting off, next time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ell, how silly this is!' he said indignantly. 'Running {{away from}} home--I never heard such a thing! Of course I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> jealous of this unfortunate man; {{but it is}} too ridiculous that you, a married woman with three {{children}} and a fourth coming, should go losing your head like this over a dead lover! [...] . Do you know you <b>were</b> locked in? <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> able to get out all night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{said that}} it was better as it is!' she whispers, as she holds me in her arms. 'Oh, Doady, after more years, you never could have loved your child-wife better than you do; and, after more years, she would so have tried and {{disappointed}} <b>you,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> able to love her half so well! I know I was too young and foolish. It is much better as it is!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stay; {{what can}} be done?' said Glossin, anxiously. 'I dare not {{discharge}} you; but <b>might</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> rescued in the way? Ay sure! a word to Lieutenant Brown, and I would send the people with you by the coast-road.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that thing! That's the passengers' glass. I {{told the}} steward {{to put it}} out of gear so that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> frightened; it is an old trick. Look at this," [...] and he {{produced}} one of the portable variety out of his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{made myself}} {{a cup of}} tea the first thing, boys, and had a slice of bread and butter, for I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> down for some time; but I am quite ready to join you; we have got fish. I put them down {{directly}} you called." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Aunt. I had {{the best}} of opinions. I am sure that my father would not have written as he did to you, unless he had been very fond of you. Still, as at present I am not proved to be your nephew, I thought that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{disposed}} {{to ask me to}} stay.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's like this," [...] she said. He {{had seen}} her look at him {{in exactly the same}} way a hundred times. [...] "I don't suppose I can make you understand, but this is how it is. Suppose you had a room, and it was full--of things. Furniture. And there wasn't any space left. You--you couldn't put {{anything}} else in till you had taken all that out, could <b>you?</b> It <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> worth anything, but it would still be there, taking up all the room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But the Prince's great delight," [...] says Murray, [...] "was Walter Scott, [...] {{whose name}} and {{writings}} he dwelt upon and recurred to incessantly. He [...] preferred him far beyond any other poet of the time, repeated several [...] passages with fervour, and criticized them faithfully.... Lord Byron [...] called upon me, merely to let off the raptures of the Prince [...] respecting you, thinking, as he said, that if I {{were likely to}} have [...] occasion to write to <b>you,</b> it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ungrateful for <b>you</b> to hear [...] of his praises." ...|$|R
5000|$|A final {{objection}} is that pragmatism of James's variety entails relativism. What {{is useful}} for <b>you</b> to believe <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> useful for me to believe. It follows that [...] "truth" [...] for you is different from [...] "truth" [...] for me (and that the relevant facts don't matter). This is relativism.|$|R
6000|$|You {{have other}} recreations for your Sundays in the session, I daresay, than to come here. But it is {{generally}} a day on which I do not go out, and when we dine at half-past five in the easiest way in the world, and smoke in the peacefulest manner. Perhaps one of these Sundays after Easter <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> indisposed to begin to dig us out? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. A woman." [...] Sue's voice quavered as she spoke, and she {{suddenly}} sat {{down from her}} preparations, laid {{her hands in her}} lap, and looked into the fire. [...] "I don't know whether I did right or not!" [...] she continued. [...] "I said you were not at home, and when she said she would wait, I said I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to see her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And though <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{willing to}} accept any man's hand merely on a {{question}} of fortune, surely {{the fact that our}} marriage would be in every way suitable as regards money should not set you against it. Of my own love for you I will not speak further, as I do not doubt that you believe what I say; but should you not question your own feelings very closely before you determine to oppose the wishes of all those who are nearest to you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{group has}} cited the {{influence}} of [...] "artists like Syd Mead, films like Eddie and the Cruisers and Streets of Fire, books like 1984 and Atlas Shrugged... those are the pretty obvious ones you can pull out of Acts I and II. But what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> realize <b>is</b> that we own every Ernest movie ever made. And we watch them all the time.". Apart from previously mentioned, the band also draws inspiration from a huge array of other diverse sources, including Sergio Leone's films, the song [...] "The Mexican" [...] and musical groups Radiohead, Styx, Toto, Queen and Alabama.|$|R
40|$|The experts define smoking as the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from burning tobacco. We've all seen people do it, {{so we have}} a fairly good idea about how it works.

5000|$|On July 15, 2011, Bridges {{met with}} President Barack Obama at the White House, and while viewing the Norman Rockwell {{painting}} of her on display he told her, [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that if it hadn't been for <b>you</b> guys, I <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> here and we wouldn't be looking at this together." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Gilfil paused again, but Caterina said nothing. She {{was looking}} away from him, out of the window, {{and her eyes were}} filling with tears. He rose, and, {{advancing}} a little towards her, held out his hand and said, --'Forgive me, Caterina, for intruding on your feelings in this way. I was so afraid <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> aware how Miss Assher watched you.

6000|$|... "I would {{trust to}} a French officer's word {{as much as}} to that of an English officer," [...] Jack replied. [...] "You would expect them to trust to your word {{that they should be}} safe if they laid down their arms; and yet, as you know, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to keep it. Better a {{thousand}} times that a handful of French officers and men should be allowed to join the enemy's ranks than that the national honor of Spain should be soiled by a massacre perpetrated just after a surrender." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I {{can hardly}} do, for I {{do not know}} myself. However, I think it {{probable}} that the greater portion of the band would remain outside the town. There are copses, down by the riverside, where you could wait in safety until you were wanted. Possibly <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> wanted at all. Possibly you might be summoned {{to take part in}} so desperate an enterprise as storming one of the prisons. Of course it would be done at night, when we should have the advantage of a surprise.

6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} also," [...] agreed the Princess. [...] "I shall be quite {{able to take}} care of myself, <b>you</b> know, but <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to protect others so well. I do not look for opposition, however.
