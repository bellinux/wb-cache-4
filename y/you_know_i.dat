5|$|I {{was just}} numbing, numbing, numbing myself then {{sleeping}} it off, then getting on stage, killing it in pain, then getting off and smoking, smoking, smoking, {{not knowing what}} pain was.

25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> love and respect her to death so I wouldn't pass that chance up." ...|$|E
500|$|Amid {{frequent}} court appearances battling {{to stay in}} the United States, Lennon became stressed, {{a situation}} that was only worsened by constant surveillance by the FBI, due to his political activism. Lennon said, [...] "I just couldn't function, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> was so paranoid from them tappin' the phone and followin' me." [...] All this combined made Lennon begin to feel emotionally withdrawn. Lennon put his suffering aside to write the songs for Mind Games, writing all the songs for it in a week.|$|E

500|$|Kenny's {{deaths have}} been subject to much {{critical}} analysis in the media and literary world. In the book , an essay by Southern Illinois University philosophy professor Dr. Randall Auxier, entitled [...] "Killing Kenny: Our Daily Dose of Death", suggests that the fashion of the recurring gag serves to help the viewer become more comfortable with the inevitability of their own death. In the book South Park and Philosophy: <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> <b>I</b> Learned Something Today, University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point professor Karin Fry wrote an essay concerning the parallels between Kenny's role in the show and the different concepts of existentialism.|$|E
500|$|After being {{a member}} of the Scientology {{organization}} for ten years, Christman reached the spiritual [...] "Operating Thetan" [...] level of OT III.

[...] She explained, [...] "You're surrounded by all these people who're going, 'Wow, isn't it amazing, just getting the data? I can tell it's really changed you.'

Hutchins said [...] "I offered him options and, in some cases, multiple choices. We agreed to meet at the Warner Bros. gate near the water tower in 20 minutes." [...] He recorded the sound to a tape and met Hillenburg by the gate. Hutchins said [...] "He was about as happy as you could imagine, and off he went.

500|$|Madonna {{planning}} to perform [...] "Frozen" [...] in Werchter? I didn't expect anything else, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> don't even mind.

My lawyer is following the case. I'm really going to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
