25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when {{pointing to a}} person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There {{is nothing in the}} sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the store and you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{allude to}} his {{supposed}} relationship with Mariah Carey, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof {{he claims to}} have of the couple. The song begins [...] "Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me. Now I'm pissed off," [...] before describing Carey's impersonation of him in her video, [...] "Oh gee, is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?/ Wow Mariah, didn't expect <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> balls out." [...] Eminem continues describing a near-sexual encounter with the singer, threatening to release voice-mails and pictures he still has in his possession. Additionally, the song features a females voice, unknown whether or not Carey's, where she calls herself Mary Poppins, as well as several intervals of her laughter.|$|E

500|$|... "My Love" [...] {{was criticized}} {{for some of the}} lyrics and sounds that were featured. Sanneh {{reported}} that Timberlake [...] "exhales his clumsy pickup lines" [...] with the lyrics [...] "If I told you you were beautiful / Would you date me on the regular?". Murphy contemplated that the song is [...] "ultimately ruined" [...] by a [...] "bizarre Crazy Frog-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay". Emily Vaughan of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "Damn Girl" [...] and that he is also [...] "running out of creative ways to say he would like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to bed with him". Vaughan, however, was positive towards [...] "My Love", stating that the song, along with [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", sounded considerably {{different from the rest of}} the album.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to that when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead and do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's {{one of the reasons}} I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{typically}} reviewed [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] favorably. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly {{felt the}} song was [...] "not bad business for stationary cardio, but not the stuff year-end top tens are made of, either." [...] She said it didn't offer [...] "major sensations" [...] and found it similar to Christina Aguilera’s [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). Greenblatt was also disappointed with the song's rhyming in the lines, [...] "I'm not here to sell ya' / Or tell <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to hell". Sonya Sorich of Ledger-Enquirer said that while she anticipated some negative reception, [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was also a prime candidate for a guilty pleasure dance track." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic referred to [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "stomping" [...] and selected {{it as one of}} the album's best. Fraser McAlpine of BBC said that though the song has strong sexual undercurrents, Cyrus maintained classy throughout the track [...] [...] "If Miley's gonna weather the Ensexification Moment it'll be because she's doing it during a period of extrema GaGa, when videos are less about acreage of flesh and more about feathers and Victorian scientists. Oh, and because she's got the songs and the voice, that always helps", McAlpine concluded.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea found Second Sons open world {{beholden to}} a dated formula. He {{described}} Seattle as [...] "a playground for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> nuts in" [...] instead of [...] "a living, breathing world", with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players. CVGs Hussain called Seattle [...] "hauntingly empty", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He {{felt that the}} open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V, Sleeping Dogs and , which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that Second Son did not innovate the open world genre {{as well as it}} could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as [...] "virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs". Edge found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. [...] "Approach [...] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense", they wrote. Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards.|$|E
500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, [...] "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none {{of the rest of us}} Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Senate but the people would send you." ...|$|E

500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had to work off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, because you know, you sort of have to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E
500|$|In February 2014, Paul {{joined the}} Tea Party-affiliated {{conservative}} advocacy group FreedomWorks in filing a class-action lawsuit {{charging that the}} federal government's bulk collection of Americans' phone records metadata {{is a violation of}} the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Commenting on the lawsuit at a press conference, Paul said, [...] "I'm not against the NSA, I'm not against spying, I'm not against looking at phone records... I just want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a judge, have an individual's name and [...] a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says." [...] He also said there was no evidence the surveillance of phone metadata had stopped terrorism. Critics, including Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Steven Aftergood, the director of the American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, called the lawsuit a political [...] "stunt". Paul's political campaign organization said that the names of members of the public who went to Paul's websites and signed on as potential class-action participants would be available in the organization's database for future campaign use. On the announcement of the filing of the lawsuit, Mattie Fein, the spokeswoman for and former wife of attorney Bruce Fein, complained that Fein's intellectual contribution to the lawsuit had been stolen and that he had not been properly paid for his work. Paul's representatives denied the charge, and Fein issued a statement saying that Mattie Fein had not been authorized to speak for him on the matter and that he had in fact been paid for his work on the lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|Within a few weeks, Hall {{was making}} {{preparations}} for a sledging trip {{with the aim}} of beating Sir William Parry's furthest north record. Mistrust amongst the men in charge showed again when Hall told Tyson that [...] "I cannot trust that man (Captain Budington). I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with me, but don't know how to leave him alone with the ship." [...] There is some evidence that Budington may have been an alcoholic; on at least three occasions he raided the ship's stores, including the alcohol kept by the scientists for preservation of specimens. Hall had complained about Budington's drunken behavior, and it fully came to light from the crew's testimony at the inquest following the expedition. With Tyson watching over the ship, Hall took two sledges with first mate Chester, and the native guides Ebierbing and Hendrik, leaving on Oct 10, 1871. The day after leaving, Hall sent Hendrik back to the ship to retrieve a number of forgotten items. Hall also sent back a note to Bessels, reminding him to wind the chronometers at the right time every day. In his book Trial by Ice, Richard Parry postulated that such a note from the uneducated Hall must have rankled Bessels, who held a number of degrees from Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Jena. It was another example of Hall's micromanagement of the expedition. Before he left on the overland trip, Hall gave Budington a detailed list of instructions regarding how to manage the ship in his absence. This likely did not sit well with a sailing master with over 20years of experience.|$|E
