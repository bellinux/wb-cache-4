From the outset our objectives were ambitious and diverse, but could nevertheless be summarized in two sentences: To contribute towards making simulations and games easier to use and more accessible to a larger group of professors of different degree programmes. Secondly, to contribute towards getting a better idea about which types of learning and which learning objectives could be improved by which kinds of simulations and games.
