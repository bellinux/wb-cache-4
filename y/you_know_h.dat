Specifically, {{how much do you}} know about X when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>H</b> 1 (X,Z) alone? For a (nearly tautological) answer, put GX:= the compact, connected abelian Lie group (i. e., product of circles) which is the Pontrjagin dual of the free abelian group H 1 (X,Z). Now H 1 (GX,Z) is canonically isomorphic to H 1 (X,Z) = Hom(GX,R/Z) and there is a canonical homotopy class of mappings X − → GX that induces the identity mapping on H 1.

The set-pieces are fierce, as is the Casablanca tweak of the last shot, and Wallace's performance—a sad spectacle of a hurting creature caught between light and dark, good and evil—is one of noir's great unheralded triumphs." ...|$|R
