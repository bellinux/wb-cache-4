25|$|Dubuque is {{the primary}} city in the Dubuque Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). It is at the {{junction}} of four major highways and two major railroads. Its location along the river has formed the city into a major Midwestern hub. The Dubuque Area is the general area encompassing Dubuque, Iowa. The MSA proper includes Dubuque County exclusively, and un- officially, but locally includes: Jackson County, Iowa, Jo Daviess County, Illinois, Grant County, Wisconsin. The official population of the Dubuque County was 93,653 as of the 2010 population estimates. Although, if <b>you</b> <b>include</b> the unofficial counties, the area's population is near 190,000.|$|E
25|$|Ukraine: Even {{as part of}} the USSR, {{a number}} of Soviet gymnasts were trained in Ukraine or with Ukrainian origin {{including}} the first World Champion Ludmila Savinkova and Liubov Sereda. Ukraine has won 1 gold and 3 bronze medals at the Olympic Games. If <b>you</b> <b>include</b> all Ukrainian gymnasts, then they have won 2 gold and 4 bronze medals. The mother and daughter tandem of Albina and Irina Deriugina {{played an important role in}} the success of RG in the country, raising stars like Olexandra Tymoshenko and Oxana Skaldina. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine continued its success in rhythmic gymnastics with Kateryna Serebrianska winning the Olympic gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Other notable gymnasts include Anna Bessonova (two-time Olympic bronze medalist), Ganna Rizatdinova (2016 Olympics bronze), Olena Vitrychenko (1996 Olympics bronze), Victoria Stadnik, Tamara Yerofeeva, Natalia Godunko, Alina Maksymenko, Olena Dmytrash, Viktoriia Mazur, Valeriia Gudym, Yevgeniya Gomon, Oleksandra Gridasova, Anastasiia Mulmina, Anastasiya Voznyak, Kateryna Lutsenko and Olena Diachenko.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the song, Harrison {{delivers}} a spoken dedication to Frank Sinatra, adding: [...] "we love you, Frank, and we hope <b>you</b> <b>include</b> this one at Caesars Palace on your next live album." [...] This message referred to Sinatra's adoption of the Harrison composition [...] "Something", which he lauded as [...] "the greatest love song of the past fifty years". On [...] "Far East Man", Inglis finds Scott's multiple horn parts [...] "reminiscent of the soul stylings" [...] of King Curtis, Junior Walker and the Funk Brothers. Unlike on the Wood recording, Harrison's slide guitar appears only midway through the Dark Horse version (overdubbed onto his rhythm guitar part), in a solo that author Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "wonderfully complement" [...] by Scott's [...] "bachelor-pad saxophones".|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Secret Speech" [...] {{proved to}} be an utter misnomer. While the {{attendees}} at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked [...] "not for the press" [...] rather than [...] "top secret". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West. Khrushchev's son, Sergei, later wrote, [...] "learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If <b>you</b> <b>include</b> their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen {{called for the}} salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: [...] "never, never, I beg <b>you,</b> <b>include</b> boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise." [...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fourth Test at Manchester proved controversial. The Old Trafford pitch {{had little}} grass, {{perhaps as a}} result of earlier wet weather. [...] Again, Johnson lost the toss and England chose to bat first. Johnson and his {{spinning}} partner, Richie Benaud were unable to exploit the spin-friendly conditions and the English made 459runs. [...] In reply, the Australians could not {{come to grips with the}} conditions; Laker took nine of the ten wickets, Lock the other, as Australia were brushed away for just 84. Amid wild weather, the Australians were asked to follow-on. [...] A determined batting performance was not enough to prevent an English victory by an innings and 170runs. [...] Laker's performance was historic. [...] He took 10/53, the first time in a Test match a bowler had taken all ten wickets in an innings. [...] With his 9/37 in the first innings, he had captured 19wickets for the match, still a world record in first-class cricket. [...] Wisden reported that the Australians were [...] "extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch". Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "This pitch is a complete disgrace" [...] while Colin McDonald later said, [...] "England cheated: if by cheating <b>you</b> <b>include</b> the practise of preparing wickets to suit your own purpose." [...] Johnson was generous towards the victors. Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians, he said: [...] "When the controversy and side issues of the match are forgotten, Laker's wonderful bowling will remain." [...] The media reported that Australia had been [...] "Lakered".|$|E

2500|$|... the {{possible}} combinations are huge: 27 letters if <b>you</b> <b>include</b> the final forms × 9 niqqudim (more {{if we consider}} biblical niqqud) × cantillation marks. This means for an algorithm based on classification (such as Jochre), there are far too many classes, and it’s virtually impossible to get sufficient representation in an annotated training corpus. It {{would be better to}} imagine a two-pass algorithm: the first pass recognizes the letter, and the second pass recognizes the diacritics (niqqud + cantillation). However, this would require development in Jochre – it’s hard to guess how much without analyzing further. Note that Yiddish doesn’t suffer from the same difficulty, since there is very little niqqud used, and only in certain fixed places (e.g. komets aleph, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|In early Japanese films, {{kissing and}} sexual {{expression}} were controversial. In 1931, a director slipped a kissing scene past the censor (who was a friend), {{but when the}} film opened in a downtown Tokyo theater, the screening was stopped and the film confiscated. During the American Occupation of Japan, in 1946, an American censor required a film to include a kissing scene. One scholar says that the censor suggested [...] "we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>include</b> that in your films?" [...] Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions, feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl Harbor, Americans had felt that the Japanese were [...] "sneaky", claiming that [...] "if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laker {{dismissed}} Miller for six, {{his only}} scoring shot being a strike over the fence. Australia fell from 0/48 {{to be all}} out for 84, with Laker taking 9/37. Australia were forced to follow on and Miller was tormented for 15 minutes before being bowled for a duck by Laker, who took an unprecedented 10/53 at Test level to take a world record 19wickets as Australia lost by an innings and 170 runs. Australia's misery was compounded by regular rain interruptions during their innings, which turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Wisden reported that the Australians were said [...] "to be extremely bitter over {{the condition of the}} pitch". Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "This pitch is a complete disgrace" [...] while opening batsman Colin McDonald later said, [...] "England cheated: if by cheating <b>you</b> <b>include</b> the practise of preparing wickets to suit your own purpose." [...] During the Tests at Headingley and Old Trafford, Laker and Lock bowled two thirds of the overs and took 38 of the 40 Australian wickets.|$|E

2500|$|Moyers {{reported}} and Potter confirmed {{that there were}} attempts to radicalize Moore {{in an effort to}} discredit the film’s message. Moore would be referred to as a [...] "Hollywood entertainer" [...] or [...] "Hollywood moviemaker" [...] to associate the film as being grounded in entertainment without any basis in objective reality. [...] "They would want you to see this as just some fantasy that a Hollywood filmmaker had come up with. That's part of the strategy." [...] Potter said that the strategy worked and the impact of the film was [...] "blunted" [...] by the public relations campaign. He agreed that Sicko contained [...] "a great truth" [...] which he said was [...] "that we shouldn't fear government involvement in our health care system. That there is an appropriate role for government, and it's been proven in the countries that were in that movie. [...] You know, we have more people who are uninsured in this country than the entire population of Canada. And that if <b>you</b> <b>include</b> the people who are underinsured, more people than in the United Kingdom.
