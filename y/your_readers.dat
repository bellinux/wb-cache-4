500|$|Johnson {{identified}} himself as a poet and, in November 1734, applied to Edward Cave {{to work on the}} poetry reviews for The Gentleman's Magazine. In a letter written under the name S. Smith, Johnson said, [...] "As You appear no less sensible than <b>Your</b> <b>Readers</b> of the defects of your Poetical Article, You will not be displeased, if, in order to the improvement of it, I communicate to You the sentiments of a person, who will undertake on reasonable terms sometimes to fill a column". In particular, Johnson suggested removing the magazine's [...] "low Jests" [...] and [...] "awkward Buffoonery" [...] and then replacing them with poems, inscriptions, and [...] "short literary Dissertations in Latin or English" [...] written by himself. Cave did not accept Johnson's proposal to write a column, but he did employ Johnson occasionally to work on minor aspects of the periodical.|$|E
500|$|On January 19, 2012, Stallone {{stated that}} the film was being aimed at a PG-13 audience. Unlike the first film (which was {{restricted}} to viewers over age 17), this {{would have made the}} sequel available to all viewers over 13 years of age (and younger children, with parental consent). The reported change received a negative reception. Speaking to Ain't It Cool News about the change, Stallone said [...] "The PG-13 rumor is true, but before <b>your</b> <b>readers</b> pass judgement, trust me when I say this film is large in every way and delivers on every level." [...] It was reported that the change was requested by Norris before he would take part in the film, because he did not appreciate the swearing in the script. However, these plans for a more family-friendly rating did not succeed and the finished film was rated R. When the adult-oriented rating was confirmed shortly before release, West stated that [...] "the shooting style and the dialogue, from day one, it was R-rated." [...] However, the visual effects supervisor said that The Expendables 2 was shot as a PG-13 film, with all bullet wounds being dust-hits. Once it was decided that the film would be R-rated, blood, decapitations, eviscerations and severed limbs were digitally added in post-production.|$|E

5000|$|As a writer, Sanford {{stressed}} {{that it was}} important to use elements of style in a harmonious way and to remember that [...] "you are writing for <b>your</b> <b>reader</b> and not to satisfy yourself."

[...] So {{your job is to}} either make them recall exactly what it feels like when something occurs in your story or, if they haven't experienced it, what it would feel like if they did" [...] [...] Morrell describes a [...] "sensory surround", which when [...] "coupled with drama tugs the reader into [...] story and forces him to keep reading." ...|$|E

This followed a public media brawl between Jake Chapman and journalist Carole Cadwalladr in The Observer {{and on the internet}} the previous year. Cadwalladr told readers that Chapman threw her out of their studio. Jake publicly replied, [...] "You may grace <b>your</b> <b>readers</b> with the meek tones of plum-mouthed middle-Englanders, but don't send them round to my studio I'll make [...] mince meat out of them, ha ha ha." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Dowland Manuscript {{was first}} {{printed in the}} Gentleman's Magazine in 1815. The contributor, James Dowland, wrote [...] "For the {{gratification}} of <b>your</b> <b>readers,</b> I send you a curious address respecting Freemasonry which not long since came into my possession. It is written on a long roll of parchment, in a very clear hand apparently in the 17th century, and probably was copied from a MS. of earlier date." [...] This earlier date is still estimated to be around 1550, making the Dowland the second oldest prose constitutions known. The wages mentioned in the text agree with other manuscripts known to originate {{in the second half}} of the sixteenth century. Unfortunately, the original is now lost.|$|E

40|$|Hints to good {{technical}} writing For some people good writing comes naturally. But {{for the rest}} of us, it need not be difficult to write reasonably well with the help of some rules or guidelines. In this paper I outline some of the rules I use when writing. These help me to save time and to be as effective as possible. 1. The right attitude It is essential that we have the right attitude with regard to the question “for whom are we writing?”. On one hand you are obviously writing {{for the benefit of the}} person who will read what you write. You have something to say, and <b>your</b> <b>reader</b> needs to hear your message. But on the other hand you are also writing for your own benefits. Because you have a Golden rule – you are writing for the benefit of <b>your</b> <b>reader.</b> Make sure that you always aim to help you...|$|R
2500|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} being {{a witness in}} Ryan's trial, where he gave {{evidence}} claiming to have seen him commit the murder, a man broke his silence, for fear that the alleged killer was becoming a latter-day Ned Kelly. Les Watt wrote to The Australian: [...] "Let me assure you and <b>your</b> <b>readers</b> that Ryan did kill Hodson." [...] Watt spoke out after reading Philip Opas' comments and the latter's autobiography. Watt {{was one of four}} witnesses to testify seeing Ryan fire a shot. Watt said that it might well be proper for Opas to leave the bar as his emotional involvement with the case had certainly distorted the facts, leading as it had to the suggestion that Ryan might not have fired the shot that killed Hodson. Watt, on the contrary, said that he saw Ryan take aim and fire and then saw Hodson fall flat on his face and not move. [...] "It was a sickening sight. I also witnessed a slight puff of smoke come from the carbine Ryan used. This was probably {{as a result of a}} bullet passing through a well-oiled barrel bore." ...|$|E
2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If <b>your</b> <b>readers</b> ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E

You can do what you like with a reader then, if you only keep him nicely on the move. So long as you are happy <b>your</b> <b>reader</b> will be so too. But one law must be observed: an essay, like a dog that wishes to please, must have a lively tail, short but as waggish as possible.
