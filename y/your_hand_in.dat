500|$|After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra {{believed}} {{he needed to}} go solo, with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby, but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry. [...] A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1943. On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bid farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, [...] "I hope you fall on your ass". He replaced Sinatra with singer Dick Haymes. Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, holding {{a gun to his}} head. Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times the salary of Dorsey. Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never patched up their differences before Dorsey's death in 1956, worsened by the fact that Dorsey occasionally made biting comments to the press such as [...] "he's the most fascinating man in the world, but don't put <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the cage".|$|E

500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] {{opens with}} flanged drums. Although {{computer}} technology offered {{it during the}} album’s production, according to Hoppus, the band opted to produce the effect [...] "the old school way", opting for two tape machines. Originally taking root as a faster-paced drum 'n' bass-inspired track, Barker imitated that genre's groove on open hi-hats. The influence of John Bonham is most explicit in the song's first few seconds, in which Barker performs eighth-note triplets on his bass drum, much like the Led Zeppelin song [...] "Good Times Bad Times" [...] (1969). Following a sample from Captain America (1990)—"Get ready for action!—the song moves into a [...] "stabbing guitar rhythm" [...] over the verses, which are [...] "half-barked" [...] and contain delivery reminiscent of hip-hop. The [...] "harmony-rich" [...] chorus of the song, which contains the refrain [...] "Fate fell short this time, smile fades in the summer / Place <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> mine, I'll leave when I wanna", is replete with a [...] "syncopated Latin-flavored backbeat." [...] In the chorus, Barker plays a cowbell, which he initially included as a joke, believing Hoppus and DeLonge would [...] "hate it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once, after {{standing}} on the top rails of a corral above the thick dust covering a bunch of running horses, {{almost all of them}} paints, he dropped to the ground as the gate swung shut and announced, [...] "By golly, boys, I'm a rich man; I've got 42 head of horses!" [...] A woman standing close by looked at him in utter amazement and blurted out, [...] "How could you count all those horses, Mr. Long ... Why ...

2500|$|Qualities {{that are}} {{experienced}} as “tracks” {{of the actions}} of ourselves or of others: [...] Sircello defines “tracks” as “objects” that we may experience as the result of actions of sentient beings, either ourself or others. [...] Tracks need not actually be the result of such actions but are objects that can be perceived as such, in the way that a landscape might be regarded as a trace of the hand of a creator. [...] Sircello provides many examples of tracks in his book.

It's beautiful, yes it's beautiful, it's cute, it's pretty, it has a good smell, wherever you go you want to inhale it." [...] Critics allege that he was endorsing the practice of [...] "necklacing" [...] opposition activists – placing a gasoline-soaked tire around a person's neck and setting the tire ablaze – others argue he was actually speaking about people using the constitution to empower themselves.
