Hearing of the Nordic ban and that Dimensions was being sold in Australia with a PG classification, the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor and the Australian Classification Board re-examined the game and revoked its classification, although Nintendo Australia assured the board that the game contained no material which could be considered child pornography. Upon re-submission, the game was awarded the stronger (but not age-restricted) M classification and was re-released shortly after.

I used to be fond of hunting, but I can tell you that it is infinitely more exciting to hunt a man than it is to hunt a fox. You are your own hound, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the scent, to follow it up, however much the quarry may wind and double, and when at last you lay your hand upon his shoulder and say, 'In the King's name,' there is an infinitely keener pleasure than there is when the hounds run down the fox. One sport is perhaps as dangerous as the other: in the one case your horse may fail at a leap and you may break your neck, in the other you may get a bullet in your head; so in that respect there is not much to choose between man and fox hunting. There is the advantage, though, that in the one you have to depend upon your horse's strength, and in the other on your own courage." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Ten years ago, at the {{beginning}} of the ‘prescription-only (Rx) to over-the counter (OTC) switch revolution’. Nurofen 1 (ibuprofen) had switched in the UK and Advil/Nuprin 1 had moved OTC in America, along with 0. 5 per cent hydrocortisone (Cortaid 1) and several cold remedies. The outlook for additional switches and the OTC market generally was bullish. Most experts predicted that the OTC market would explode, led by switches and the coming harmonisation of EU regulatory mechanisms beginning in 1992. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> an icon that would be symbolic of the growth curves most OTC business managers <b>had</b> in mind, <b>you</b> might choose the hockey stick. So what happened? There has been an enormous increase in consumer interest in alternative, prevention-oriented self-treatment but the growth in non-prescription pharmaceutical sales has been much more modest. So where do we go from here? This paper explores:. current business trends in the global market for over-the-counter brands. a comparison of Rx to OTC brand switches in the US versus the rest of the world. the key success factors for switches. the emerging OTC business strategies of the major sector players. the outlook for OTC brand growth and Rx to switches over the next 5 – 10 years. a summary of the implications from a strategic perspective.
