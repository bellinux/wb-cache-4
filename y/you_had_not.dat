Therefore I had Mr. Barber make me a proof of this change, and as this left so much blank space over the top we concluded {{that it would be better}} to put on the motto, [...] "In God We Trust".

500|$|... "Two for the Road" [...] {{was viewed}} by 15.03million American viewers, which was 1.5million {{less than the}} ratings {{compared}} to the previous year. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. TV Squad's C. K. Sample wrote that [...] "Two for the Road" [...] was [...] "a great episode that I thoroughly enjoyed", although he did feel [...] "badly for Sawyer and Hugo". Sample also wrote that although he suspected that Ana-Lucia and Libby were going to die, he thought what [...] "was amazing was who shot them". Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com wrote that the episode contained the [...] "Biggest ... twist ... ever." [...] Slocum {{went on to say}} that if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen the episode, [...] "whoooeee [...] are you in for a treat", and called the two murders [...] "a doozy".

Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B+. Supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and producer Christina M. Kim were nominated for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Episodic Drama at the February 2007 ceremony for writing the episode.|$|E

2500|$|The oldest Germanic {{languages}} {{have the}} typical complex inflected morphology of old Indo-European languages, with {{four or five}} noun cases; verbs marked for person, number, tense and mood; multiple noun and verb classes; few or no articles; and rather free word order. [...] The old Germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses (present and past), with three PIE past-tense aspects (imperfect, aorist, and perfect/stative) merged into one and no new tenses (future, pluperfect, etc.) developing. [...] There were three moods: indicative, subjunctive (developed from the PIE optative mood) and imperative. [...] Gothic verbs {{had a number of}} archaic features inherited from PIE that were lost in the other Germanic languages with few traces, including dual endings, an inflected passive voice (derived from the PIE mediopassive voice), and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense (derived from the PIE perfect). [...] The complex tense system of modern English (e.g. In three months, the house will still be being built or If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> acted so stupidly, we would never have been caught) is almost entirely due to subsequent developments (although paralleled in many of the other Germanic languages).|$|E
2500|$|This {{question}} {{is called the}} Monty Hall problem due to its resembling scenarios on the game show Let's Make a Deal; its answer existed before it was used in [...] "Ask Marilyn". She said the selection should be switched to door #2 {{because it has a}} 2/3 chance of success, while door #1 has just 1/3. To summarize, 2/3 of the time the opened door #3 will indicate the location of the door with the car (the door <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> picked and the one not opened by the host). Only 1/3 of the time will the opened door #3 mislead you into changing from the winning door to a losing door. These probabilities assume you change your choice each time door #3 is opened, and that the host always opens a door with a goat. This response provoked letters from thousands of readers, nearly all arguing doors #1 and #2 each have an equal chance of success. A follow-up column reaffirming her position served only to intensify the debate and soon became a feature article {{on the front page of}} The New York Times. Parade received around 10,000 letters from readers who thought her wrong.|$|E
