500|$|Shortly after Leslie {{successfully}} relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, {{she struggles}} {{to find any}} new ideas for future parks project. She becomes so stressed that Ron, in the episode [...] "Camping," [...] locks her {{in a room and}} refuses to let her out until she gets some sleep. She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party," [...] where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and <b>you</b> <b>roll</b> the dice, its all anyone can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't you married 3 times?" [...] To which Ron replies [...] "My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy." [...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{in favor}} of Storm of Zehirs focus on {{exploration}} and the ability to postpone or ignore the game's main storyline, and they compared the gameplay to older role-playing video games such as Icewind Dale II and Fallout. GameZone's reviewer said [...] "This is a game that harkens back to the good old days of adventure D video-gaming", and IGN said [...] "this feels like an homage to the old school D games of the past". [...] The ability to handcraft an entire party instead of just the main character was welcomed, with GameSpot's reviewer noting [...] "Rather than playing as a solo hero chosen for some great destiny, <b>you</b> <b>roll</b> up a party of four average joes just like you did way back when in D classics like the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises," [...] (It should be noted that Baldur's Gate did not actually contain the ability to create the entire party in single player mode; however, in multiplayer, this was possible) [...] and IGN saying [...] "There's a strange kind of nerd joy when it comes to creating a D party". [...] Reviewers also appreciated the [...] "Party Conversation System", which allows typically underutilized social skills to be used by the entire party during conversation. [...] GameSpy said [...] "It's a terrific convention in which the game responds not to one but to every member of an adventuring party. [...] have the option to interject some special comment into a conversation that might open up otherwise unavailable avenues". [...] Reviewers were grateful that the time-based, [...] "spirit-eating" [...] gameplay mechanic of Mask of the Betrayer was not included.|$|E

5000|$|Under this [...] "possible worlds idiom," [...] to {{maintain}} that Bigfoot's existence is possible but not actual, one says, [...] "There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists; but in the actual world, Bigfoot does not exist". However, {{it is unclear what}} this claim commits us to. Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds, every bit as real as our actual world, just not actual? Saul Kripke believes that 'possible world' is something of a misnomer - that the term 'possible world' is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility. For him, the sentences [...] "you could have rolled a 4 instead of a 6" [...] and [...] "there is a possible world where <b>you</b> <b>rolled</b> a 4, but <b>you</b> <b>rolled</b> a 6 in the actual world" [...] are not significantly different statements, and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world. David Lewis, on the other hand, made himself notorious by biting the bullet, asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own, and that what distinguishes our world as actual is simply that it is indeed our world - this world. That position is a major tenet of [...] "modal realism". Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism, considering it ontologically extravagant, and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments. Robert Adams holds that 'possible worlds' are better thought of as 'world-stories', or consistent sets of propositions. Thus, it is possible that <b>you</b> <b>rolled</b> a 4 if such a state of affairs can be described coherently.|$|R

60|$|The {{gambling}} {{instinct is}} not strong among {{creatures of the}} wild; the chances of their daily life are sufficient stimuli for the beneficial excitement of their nerve centers.

60|$|I {{wonder why}} we Anglo-Saxons cannot imitate the liberality of the {{continent}} {{in the matter of}} railroad stations, and give the traveller something more agreeable than the grim, bare, forbidding places, which now obtain in England and America. This Wittenberg is but a paltry town; and yet how much care is spent to make the station house comfortable and comely! I may here say that nowhere in Europe is railway travelling so entirely convenient as in Germany, particularly in Prussia. All is systematic and orderly; no hurrying or shoving, or disagreeable fuss at stations. The second class cars are, in most points, as good as the first class in England; the conductors are dignified and gentlemanly; <b>you</b> <b>roll</b> on at a most agreeable pace from one handsome station house to another, finding yourself disposed to be pleased with every thing.|$|E

Winter comes, and though it will not mock its fellow plants by growing then, it will not pine and mourn, and turn colorless or leafless as they. It is always green; and is only the brighter and gayer for the hoar-frost.|$|E
