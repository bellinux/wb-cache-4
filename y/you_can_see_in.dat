25|$|The {{decarboxylation}} of oxalosuccinate (below center) {{is a key}} step in {{the formation}} of alpha-ketoglutarate. In this reaction, the lone pair on the adjacent Tyrosine hydroxyl abstracts the proton off the carboxyl group. This carboxyl group is also referred to as the beta subunit in the isocitrate molecule. The deprotonation of the carboxyl group causes the lone pair of electrons to move down making carbon dioxide and separating from oxalosuccinate. The electrons continue to move towards the alpha carbon pushing the double bond electrons (making the ketone) up to abstract a proton off an adjacent lysine residue. An alpha-beta unsaturated double bond results between carbon 2 and three. As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the picture, the green ion represents either Mg2+ or Mn2+, which is a cofactor necessary for this reaction to occur. The metal-ion forms a little complex through ionic interactions with the oxygen atoms on the fourth and fifth carbons (also known as the gamma subunit of isocitrate).|$|E

Executive {{producer}} Al Jean spoke to Entertainment Weekly in September 2014 about the third segment of the episode, and the difference in voices between the older and newer versions of the characters. He said that although Dan Castellaneta’s portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time, Nancy Cartwright’s voicing of Bart changed as well, because [...] "it was lower-register, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the difference in this segment. It was really funny to get the interplay [...] and for the actors to see the voice evolution. The great thing is we didn’t have to ask—we already had the cast hired for the Tracey Ullman Simpsons." [...] He also revealed that the segment expanded on an earlier episode which implied that the Ullman Simpsons were murdered and buried under the family home, stating [...] "if people want a real Halloween bloodbath, they get it." ...|$|E

Among the stars from this era were Mitr Chaibancha and Sombat Metanee, who co-stars as gang leader Fai.

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{politics}} and message in Harry Potter, Rowling explained, [...] "I wanted Harry to leave our world and find exactly the same problems in the wizarding world. So you have the intent to impose a hierarchy, you have bigotry, and this notion of purity, which is this great fallacy, but it crops {{up all over the}} world. People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity[...] It wasn't really exclusively that. I think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." [...] She also said, [...] "You should question authority and you should not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Horn {{was quoted}} as saying that [...] "the {{entrance}} to all my work... which is extremely important to me" [...] is the ongoing series of books entitled To Place (1990-) concerning Iceland. The books consider identity, site, and nature through photographs of landscapes, ice, rocks, swirling water, and people; most of the images are accompanied by descriptive, classificatory, or literary texts. In describing her attraction to the landscape, Horn states: The drama comes from its youth. The landscape is unique in that the geology is very young. It’s like a labyrinth in the definitive sense. It’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough to find yourself. There is little erosion and, as a result, unexpected symmetries exist in unexpected places. America has everything Iceland has, but it’s ten thousand, twenty thousand, one hundred thousand years older... Growing up in a very “old” landscape—New York City—its origins are secreted from the present. I mean that the geological aspect of the landscape in New York City can only be experienced theoretically at this point. In Iceland, you understand empirically exactly what this place is: its what and how. That accessibility effects the nature of one’s experience, the experience of the world. Any place you’re going to stand in, in any given moment, is a complement {{to the rest of the}} world, historically and empirically. What <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> that moment, what you can touch in that moment, is confluent with everything else.|$|E
2500|$|In {{connection}} with her {{portrayal of the}} bureaucratised Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance to Hogwarts compulsory and the [...] "registration of Muggle-borns" [...] with the Ministry), Rowling has been asked {{whether there is a}} parallel with Nazism. She replied that [...] "It wasn't really exclusively that. I think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." [...] Jennifer Barnett of People's Weekly World stated that the reader is drawn [...] "into the politics of the wizarding world—the 'Educational Decrees' from the toad-like Ministry of Magic representative, the high-level connections of 'war criminals' from the last rise of Voldemort, the prejudice against 'mudbloods' and 'half-breeds,'" [...] and suggested connections [...] "to the world we live in, to the similarities and differences between the Fudge administration and the Bush administration." [...] Julia Turner of Slate Magazine also interpreted Rowling's depiction of the ministration as criticism of the Bush and Blair administrations, suggesting the Ministry's security pamphlet recalls the Operation TIPS (Terrorism Information and Prevention System). University of Tennessee law professor Benjamin Barton notes what he considers to be libertarian aspects of Harry Potter in his paper, Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy, published in the Michigan Law Review, stating that [...] "Rowling's scathing portrait of government is surprisingly strident and effective. This is partly because her critique works on so many levels: the functions of government, the structure of government, and the bureaucrats who run the show. All three elements work together to depict a Ministry of Magic run by self-interested bureaucrats bent on increasing and protecting their power, often {{to the detriment of the}} public at large. In other words, Rowling creates a public-interest scholar's dream—or nightmare—government." ...|$|E
