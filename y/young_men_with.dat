5|$|The {{progressive}} {{movement in}} the United States was at its height during the early 20th century. With the migration of families from farms to cities, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism. The YMCA was an early promoter of reforms for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> a focus on social welfare and programs of mental, physical, social and religious development.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that two later died. The survivor was awarded a pension, {{believed to be the first}} in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress.|$|E

These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} couple of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog howling along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a brass plate made which he put on the wall just outside the front door, and had labels made for the discs, but changed the design of the disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E

Bellamy first visited the formerly war-torn West African country in 2007 and has subsequently invested £1.4m {{of his own}} money to build a not-for-profit football academy in the Western Area Rural District village of Tombo where 32 boys receive an international standard education and elite-level football coaching for free.

25|$|Before prohibition, Irish gangs {{dominated}} the Bronx and Manhattan, {{but during the}} prohibition era the mobs were increasingly Italian and Jewish and controlled {{by the likes of}} Dutch Schultz, Charles Luciano, Bugsy Siegel and Louis Lepke. Schultz, the son of a barkeeper, built up an empire of speakeasies, clandestine alcohol stills and breweries {{during the early years of}} prohibition. In a tough business, with rival gangs constantly trying to carve out their own territory, Schultz needed ruthless, violent <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> a talent for intimidation and killing. Vincent Coll had all of that in spades and started out as an enforcer for Schultz, when he was still in his mid-teens.|$|E
25|$|In {{his younger}} days, Gan Ning {{was known to}} be very {{energetic}} and eager to behave like a youxia or vigilante. He gathered a group of wayward <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> <b>with</b> him as their chief, and engaged in piracy. They were armed with either bows or crossbows, wore feathers in their hats and tied bells on their bodies. The ringing of the bells alerted people to the presence of Gan Ning and his gang. Gan Ning's plundering and murderous ways earned him infamy throughout Ba Commandery. On land, he and his gang travelled by riding on horses or in chariots in a certain formation; on water, they sailed on light vessels linked together. They were dressed in elaborate and flamboyant garments to attract attention wherever they went. When they stopped at a certain location, they used silk to tie their boats to the jetties; when they were departing, they cut the silk and abandoned it as a display of their extravagance.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, Manchester-based Nigel Martin-Smith {{sought to}} create a British male vocal singing group {{modelled}} on New Kids on the Block. Martin-Smith's vision, however, was a teen-orientated group that would appeal {{to more than one}} demographic segment of the music industry. Martin-Smith was introduced to young singer-songwriter Gary Barlow, who had been performing in clubs since the age of 15. Impressed with Barlow's catalogue of self-written material, Martin-Smith decided to build his new-look boy band around Barlow's musical abilities. A campaign to audition <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> abilities in dancing and singing followed and took place in Manchester and other surrounding cities in 1990. At 22, Howard Donald was one of the oldest to audition, but he was chosen after he got time off work as a vehicle painter to continue the process. Prior to auditioning, Jason Orange had appeared as a breakdancer on the popular television programme The Hit Man and Her. Martin-Smith also selected 18-year-old bank employee Mark Owen and finally 16-year-old Robbie Williams to round out the group, which initially went by the name Kick It.|$|E
25|$|When Noah visits {{his father}} in prison, he crushes the Colonel's hopes by {{revealing}} that his marriage to Ameera is in name only and that he and Luke are still a couple. Not long thereafter, Ameera disappears, leaving a note saying {{that she will be}} able to stay in the country without the marriage and will have it annulled. Luke and Noah have little time to celebrate before they are advised that the Colonel has escaped from prison, which leads Noah to fear for his boyfriend's safety and also to worry that Ameera has been kidnapped. When Noah tries to track him down, the Colonel assaults him, but he manages to get away and reunite with Luke and Ameera, who has also escaped the Colonel. The Colonel is determined to get Ameera back under his control and tricks the <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> some fake police officers, but Luke calls upon his grandmother Lucinda, who brings real police to protect them. Following a confrontation with his son, the Colonel dives into the water and does not resurface; he is believed dead. Noah blames Luke for this for a time, but the couple eventually reunite after Cyndi Lauper, in town on the True Colors Tour, dedicates a set to Luke. Noah tells Luke he wants to be with him, and the couple kiss again.|$|E
