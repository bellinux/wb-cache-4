There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up.

[...] Walsh said, [...] "The {{most important thing is to}} capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D.
