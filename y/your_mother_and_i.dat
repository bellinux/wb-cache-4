2500|$|The {{following}} day, Peter Porco {{was notified}} that Christopher had also obtained {{a line of}} credit from Citibank to finance the Jeep Wrangler, again using his father's name as a cosignatory. Peter once again wrote to his son, who had not answered his parents' phone calls in weeks: [...] "I {{want you to know that}} if you abuse my credit again, I will be forced to file forgery affidavits in order to disclaim liability and that applies to the Citibank college loan if you attempt to reactivate it or use my credit to obtain any other loan." [...] The email concluded: [...] "We may be disappointed with you, but <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still love you and care about your future." ...|$|E

60|$|BUILDER. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{are going}} round to Athene at twelve o'clock. I shall {{make it up}} with her. She must come back here.|$|E
5000|$|Phone gag: [...] "Jay, this is <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>Your</b> father <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{are taking}} {{you out of}} our will. We feel you already have enough money. Oh yes, and happy birthday." ...|$|R
6000|$|When he {{had heard}} the whole story, he said, 'Give me <b>your</b> blessing, <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will go <b>and</b> search the world till I find them.' ...|$|R
60|$|THE PARLOR MAID. Two ladies for you, miss. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> sister, miss, <b>I</b> think.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I won't.' Mr. Torrance is elated {{to share}} a secret with Roger about which mother is not to know. 'Think <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are an aged pair, Roger?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, Bessy. It {{would be}} {{telling him that}} you would be his wife. He would {{understand}} it so, and so would <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> It must be so understood altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you think, my dear, that on {{the whole}} <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> who have lived longer and know more, {{are more likely to}} know when it is best that you should begin to know--this or that?" ...|$|E
60|$|PATRICIA. There is little, a very little, in everybody's. The {{question}} is, what kind? We can't turn {{life into}} a pleasure. But we can choose such pleasures as are worthy of us and our immortal souls. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> chose <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have chosen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to leave!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Never! When I say that I want to live here myself, that my heart will not let me go {{anywhere}} else, I mean that I {{want you to}} live here too--you, <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> father--that <b>I</b> want--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dorothy," [...] {{she said}} at last, about noon, [...] "I have been over hasty about <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> this man. <b>I</b> am sorry for it, and must--beg--everybody's--pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I grieve {{to remind}} you that I showed you in the drawer in the dining-room chiffonier a {{translation}} of that very book of Caesar that <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> made years ago, when she was crazy upon Vercingetorix.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That instant,' said Ralph. 'I {{was coming}} to call for you, making sure to catch you before you left; but <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have been talking over family affairs, and the time has slipped away so rapidly--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know his}} valet. However, marry who you may, I hope you'll be happy, my dear girl. You would be still more divided from {{us in that}} event; but when <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are dead, it will make little difference.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If," [...] he suggested, [...] "a box at {{the theatre}} could be {{accepted}} on the same terms as this luncheon--for <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> you, <b>I</b> mean," [...] he went on hastily, [...] "I am always having them given me. I'd keep out of the way. Or {{we might have a}} little dinner first. Your mother--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Miss Virginia," [...] he cried, as she {{was passing}} him in the hall, [...] "I can see you're worried about Lize (<b>I</b> mean <b>your</b> <b>mother),</b> <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> can be of any use I hope you'll call on me." [...] As she thanked him without enthusiasm, he added: [...] "How is she to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Duke {{no doubt}} was {{thinking}} of certain scenes passed at the great house in question, which scenes had not been delightful to him. [...] "No, I don't suppose she would wish to live at Gatherum. The Horns was given expressly by my uncle to <b>your</b> dear <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should like Mary to have the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Gyp; <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{loved each}} other." [...] He felt a quiver go through her, {{would have given}} much to see her face. What, even now, did she understand? Well, it must be gone through with, and he said: ...|$|E
60|$|Come, come, my boy, you're {{too young}} to play the heavy father. We're both your friends. Hadn't you better make a clean breast of it? After all, <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are {{interested}} in {{nothing so much as}} your welfare.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, Frances, I {{think we}} shall have to settle it for them. Things weren't like this when we were young. Why, Jamie, <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got married six weeks after I was {{introduced}} to her at a croquet party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe it," [...] he declared. [...] "You {{have had}} a good training, thanks to <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> father. Well, <b>I</b> have advised her to let you try your luck in the great metropolis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I could but guess. I have tauld ye <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> purpose, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ken Teresa was a fiend. She {{was never}} mair seen in Scotland, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have heard that}} she {{returned}} to her ain land. A dark curtain has fa'en ower the past, and the few that witnessed ony part of it could only surmise something of seduction and suicide. You yourself"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has done}} his part both as cleric <b>and</b> <b>your</b> devoted servant, <b>mother,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> confess, {{made the best}} of his case, as an able man heartily {{convinced}} can do. Good night, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dears, {{the less}} {{we talk about}} it, the better. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> differ entirely on the subject. She {{believes}} that Reuben Whitney is guilty. I am absolutely convinced he is innocent. Therefore, if you please, we will not discuss it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My daughter," [...] he said, [...] "the Thane of Steyning {{has asked}} for your hand in marriage, and <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have given our free and full consent, but he would fain know from your own lips that you will come to him willingly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The term commences next week," [...] {{explained}} my father. [...] "It is {{not exactly}} what I had intended, but it will do--for the present. Later, of course, you will {{go to one of}} the big public schools; <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have not yet quite decided which." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe it's all nat'ral, Mabel, yes; I do: the Sergeant {{tells me}} he had such {{feelings}} towards <b>your</b> own <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think I've seen something like it in the young people I have {{from time to time}} guided through the wilderness. Yes, yes, I daresay it's all nat'ral enough, and that makes it come so easy, and is a great comfort to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will let}} bygones be bygones, Terence," [...] he said, as he {{shook hands with}} him. [...] "You have turned out a credit to <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> name, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am proud of you; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hold my head high when I say Colonel Terence O'Connor, who was always playing {{mischief}} with the French, is my great nephew, and the good M'Manus blood shines out clearly in him." ...|$|R
60|$|There now I {{think what}} with Poetry and Theology, you may thank your stars that my pen {{is not very}} long-winded. Yesterday I {{received}} two Letters from <b>your</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> Henry, which <b>I</b> shall send by young Birkbeck with this.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Elizabeth," [...] said Dick preachily, [...] "that {{you read}} too many novels, {{and not the}} right kind, either. Some of these days I am {{going to ask you}} to promise me that you will read no more books except those <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> pick out for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our love to you, dear," [...] he said. [...] "Take {{care of the}} jewels, {{but take}} more care of yourself. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will come to New York {{as soon as we}} can. In the meantime, don't forget us amidst the hosts of your new friends and the joy of your new life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a pity, now, Josh," [...] said Raffles, {{affecting}} to scratch {{his head and}} wrinkle his brows upward {{as if he were}} nonplussed. [...] "I'm very fond of you; by Jove, I am! There's nothing I like better than plaguing you--you're so like <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must do without it. But the brandy and the sovereign's a bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good!' cried Jeremiah, evidently meaning Bad. 'Very good! only don't {{expect me}} to stand between <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> you, Arthur. <b>I</b> stood between <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> father, fending off this, and fending off that, and getting crushed and pounded betwixt em; and I've done with such work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{this the}} stranger, {{who was a}} famous African magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying: [...] "I am your uncle, and knew you from your {{likeness}} to my brother. Go to <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> tell her <b>I</b> am coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{know nothing}} about these things <b>and</b> <b>I</b> only ask pour me renseigner,' Mrs. Berrington's guest went on. 'And after their reverses <b>your</b> father <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> lived <b>I</b> think only a short time?' ...|$|R
