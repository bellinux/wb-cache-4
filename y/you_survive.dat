500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says. If you get shot and <b>you</b> <b>survive,</b> you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn! It feels like a stove burning your blood. You feel like any minute you gonna be dyin'.}} ...|$|E

2500|$|According {{to another}} account, Dubnow's killer was a German {{who had been}} a former student. [...] A rumor, which later grew into a legend, started that Dubnow said to the Jews present at the last moments of his life: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>survive,</b> never forget what is {{happening}} here, give evidence, write and rewrite, keep alive each word and each gesture, each cry and each tear! [...] What is certain is that the SS stole the historian's library and papers and transported them back to the Reich.|$|E

The texts are rendered in 3-D. [...] "When a previously stated rule becomes relevant—when nature calls, for instance—the relevant text pops up, occasionally getting splattered with blood." [...] Slates Josh Levin said, [...] "The pop-up bit works precisely because Zombieland unspools like a game—how can <b>you</b> <b>survive</b> a zombie horde armed with a shotgun, an SUV and a smart mouth?" ...|$|E

When he died, the fortress was breached and now people are going out of Islam [...] Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah before Umar died famously said: If Umar dies, Islam would be weakened People asked him why and his reply was You will see what i am speaking about if <b>you</b> <b>survive</b> ...|$|E

2500|$|Email statement: [...] "I {{do not see}} {{how they}} could have been confused. [...] Malaria is a chronic fever, caused by a {{microorganism}} that is suppressed but not cured by quinine. [...] Malaria attacks could easily become worse if the patient was reinfected by a trip to Panama. [...] Even in the 1860s, malaria was easily distinguishable from yellow fever. [...] Yellow fever is not a chronic disease. [...] The victim has a single acute episode, with liver complications (hence the yellow skin color). [...] If <b>you</b> <b>survive</b> the attack, you are immune to later episodes. Decompression sickness is acute, very painful, but would not show the fever or liver symptoms associated with malaria or yellow fever. [...] The doctors at the time may not have known the precise causes of the three conditions, but it is inconceivable to me that they might confuse them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Backmasking {{has also}} been used to record {{statements}} perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track [...] "Hot Poop", from We're Only in It for the Money (1968). The released version contains {{at the end of}} its side [...] "A" [...] the backmasked message [...] "Better look around before you say you don't care. / Shut your fucking mouth 'bout the length of my hair. / How would <b>you</b> <b>survive</b> / If you were alive / shitty little person?" [...] This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song [...] "Mother People", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as [...] "Hot Poop" [...] (though even in the backward message the word [...] "fucking" [...] is censored). On the same album, a modified backmasking can be heard in [...] "Harry, You're a Beast" [...] with Madge saying, [...] "Don't come in me, in me" [...] repeatedly before she starts crying. In at least one bootleg version of the album, these words are very clear.|$|E

6000|$|My {{wife and}} I would willingly have gone with them, God wot, for our boy sickened {{and lost his}} strength, and caught the fever in our swampy country; but at this time she was expecting to lie in (of our son Henry), and she knew, too, that I had promised to stay in Virginia. It was agreed that we should send the two back; but when I offered Theo to go, she said her place was with her husband;--her father and Hetty at home {{would take care of}} our children; and she scarce would allow me to see a tear in her eyes whilst she was making her {{preparations}} for the departure of her little ones. Dost thou remember the time, madam, and the silence round the worktables, as the piles of little shirts are made ready for the voyage? and the stealthy visits to the children's chambers whilst they are asleep and yet with you? and the terrible time of parting, as our barge with the servants and children rows to the ship, and you stand on the shore? Had the Prince of Wales been going on that voyage, he could not have been better provided.

60|$|A lover {{masculine}} {{so disappointed}} can speak and urge explanation, a lover feminine can say nothing; if she did, {{the result would}} be shame and anguish, inward remorse for self-treachery. Nature would brand such demonstration as a rebellion against her instincts, and would vindictively repay it afterwards by the thunderbolt of self-contempt smiting suddenly in secret. Take the matter as you find it: ask no questions, utter no remonstrances; it is your best wisdom. You expected bread, and you have got a stone: break your teeth on it, and don't shriek because the nerves are martyrized; do not doubt that your mental stomach--if you have such a thing--is strong as an ostrich's; the stone will digest. You held out your hand for an egg, and fate put into it a scorpion. Show no consternation: close your fingers firmly upon the gift; let it sting through your palm. Never mind; in time, after your hand and arm have swelled and quivered long with torture, the squeezed scorpion will die, and you will have learned the great lesson how to endure without a sob. For the whole remnant of your life, if <b>you</b> <b>survive</b> the test--some, it is said, die under it--you will be stronger, wiser, less sensitive. This you are not aware of, perhaps, at the time, and so cannot borrow courage of that hope. Nature, however, as has been intimated, is an excellent friend in such cases, sealing the lips, interdicting utterance, commanding a placid dissimulation--a dissimulation often wearing an easy and gay mien at first, settling down to sorrow and paleness in time, then passing away, and leaving a convenient stoicism, not the less fortifying because it is half-bitter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Godson," [...] he began, {{without any}} {{softening}} adjective, [...] "I have learnt {{with pain and}} indignation that you have dishonoured yourself again by breaking the pledge you gave me to abstain from politics. With still greater pain and indignation do I learn that your name has become {{in a few short}} days a byword, that you have discarded the weapon of false, insidious arguments against my class--the class to which you owe everything--for the sword of the assassin. It has come to my knowledge that you have an assignation to-morrow with my good friend M. de La Tour d'Azyr. A gentleman of his station is under certain obligations imposed upon him by his birth, which do not permit him to draw back from an engagement. But you labour under no such disadvantages. For a man of your class to refuse an engagement of honour, or to neglect it when made, entails no sacrifice. Your peers will probably be of the opinion that you display a commendable prudence. Therefore I beg you, indeed, did I think that I still exercise over you any such authority as the favours you have received from me should entitle me to exercise, I would command you, to allow this matter to go no farther, and to refrain from rendering yourself to your assignation to-morrow morning. Having no such authority, as your past conduct now makes clear, having no reason to hope that a proper sentiment of gratitude to me will induce to give heed to this my most earnest request, I am compelled to add that should <b>you</b> <b>survive</b> to-morrow's encounter, I can in no circumstances ever again permit myself to be conscious of your existence. If any spark survives of the affection that once you expressed for me, or if you set any value upon the affection, which, in spite of all that you have done to forfeit it, is the chief prompter of this letter, you will not refuse to do as I am asking." ...|$|E
