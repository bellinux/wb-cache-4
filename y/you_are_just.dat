He explained that his campaign remained carbon neutral through the purchase of carbon credits. On The Tonight Show, Vilsack joked about his relative obscurity. He remarked that he was okay with Leno making jokes about him, because [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> below {{the margin of error}} in polls, anything anybody says about you is important." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, a woman {{residing}} in Sheboygan, Wisconsin became unresponsive {{due to an}} asthma attack. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy. Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: [...] "None of [...] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is {{so far away from}} the reality of interns. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes." [...] The series placed at No. 66 on Entertainment Weekly [...] "New TV Classics" [...] list, and was declared the third highest rated show for the first ten years of the Internet Movie Database (2002–2012).|$|E
500|$|In September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos {{to become}} an {{associate}} professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. [...] In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of encephalitis, which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery. [...] During his recuperation, many friends visited, including Nicholas Metropolis from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician Paul Erdős, who remarked: [...] "Stan, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> like before." [...] This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis. [...] Another friend, Gian-Carlo Rota, asserted in a 1987 article that the attack changed Ulam's personality: afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and biology; Rota also cites Ulam's former collaborator Paul Stein as noting that Ulam was sloppier in his clothing afterwards, and John Oxtoby as noting that Ulam before the encephalitis could work for hours on end doing calculations, while when Rota worked with him, was reluctant to solve even a quadratic equation. [...] This assertion was not accepted by Françoise Aron Ulam.|$|E

500|$|On 10 August, Patton {{entered the}} {{receiving}} tent of the hospital, {{speaking to the}} injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. [...] "It's my nerves," [...] Bennett responded. [...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E
500|$|While babysitting Stewie, Peter {{takes him}} along on an all day golf game and Stewie {{ends up with}} a tan all over his body. Stewie decides he likes being tanned and begins {{frequently}} to use a tanning bed in his room. He also holds a party for tanned people only. Stewie tells Brian to wake him up after fifteen minutes of tanning but Brian falls asleep and wakes up {{six and a half}} hours later. Stewie is extremely sunburned, barely able to move and in great pain. When Stewie eventually begins to peel, Brian spots a mole on Stewie's stomach. Convinced it is skin cancer, Stewie begins to live out his dying wishes with Brian forced to help him since it was entirely his fault he caused the cancer in the first place. One of Stewie's requests was to visit the Chicago Museum of Art. As his last request he has Brian record his final thoughts. In the end, Stewie hears from Dr. Hartman that he does not have cancer and gives up tanning.

500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E

With Fenella Fielding he recorded Edith Sitwell's Façade poems with Walton's music {{played by the}} Academy of St Martin in the Fields conducted by Neville Marriner (1972).

2500|$|Mark Kanarick of All Game Guide {{also gave}} Virtual Springfield a {{three out of}} five rating. He praised the game for its {{references}} to the television series, noting that [...] "The inside jokes and story-lines alone make the game worth it for those that are fans. For casual viewers and non-viewers, however, {{there is not enough}} here to warrant purchase of The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield." [...] Kanarick further wrote that while exploring Springfield was fun at times, [...] "it is also very tedious. Reading the map can be a problem, especially for younger kids. If you do not utilize the map to its full extent, you will most likely find yourself lost in the town and unsure of where to go next. Although it is a full town, you do at times feel very constricted, as you can only change directions at certain corners. The rest of the time <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> moving where the computer is telling you to." ...|$|E

[...] Trump wrote that he, [...] "love to crush {{the other side and}} take the benefits." [...] He elaborated on the value of revenge, [...] "When someone intentionally harms you or your reputation, how do you react? I strike back, doing the same thing to them only ten times worse." [...] Trump cautions readers of the dangers of the planet, [...] "The world is a vicious and brutal place. We think we're civilized. In truth, it's a cruel world and people are ruthless." [...] Trump writes that those who do not seek revenge are remiss, [...] "I tell people, 'Get even!' This is not your typical advice, get even, but this is real-life advice. If you don't get even, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> a schmuck!" ...|$|E
