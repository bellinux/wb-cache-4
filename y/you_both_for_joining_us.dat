60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th, inclosing {{the letter}} of HON. John Minor Botts, was duly received. The latter is {{herewith}} returned according to your request.

The people of the South have too much of good sense and good temper to attempt the ruin of the government rather than see it administered as it was administered by the men who made it. At least so I hope and believe. I thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> your own letter and a sight of that of Mr. Botts.|$|R
