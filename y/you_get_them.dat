5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing.

Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album.

60|$|Beam. In my conscience, you Hollanders {{never get}} your children, {{but in the}} spirit of brandy; you are exalted then a little above your natural phlegm, and only that, which can make you fight, and destroy men, makes <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
