5|$|Dissidia Final Fantasy was {{originally}} envisioned by creative producer Tetsuya Nomura as a Kingdom Hearts spin-off featuring {{a cast of}} Disney characters while the Square Enix staff were developing Kingdom Hearts II. Nomura later felt uncomfortable with the Disney characters fighting each other and instead opted to use Final Fantasy characters, although the original idea eventually {{gave rise to the}} development of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, with the game's multiplayer mode inspired by Dissidia's gameplay. The game was made in conmemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary and despite being handled by young employees, Nomura noticed there was no pressure, having assisted them in the designing various areas from the gameplay. The game was directed by Takeshi Arakawa whom Nomura noted that his experience in a previous Square Enix game, The World Ends With <b>You,</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> effect in the game. In order to have their desired way of fighting, the team chose the PlayStation Portable console. There were plans for online play but the console's capacities made them unable to add such feature. Developing the game took three years due with the battle system requiring two years and the RPG mode one.|$|E

6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time at Count Rosek's?" [...] And, {{without her}} will, against her will, the words slipped out: [...] "I'm afraid you've missed the music-room!" ...|$|E

6000|$|MRS WARREN. Gone {{out to have}} a pipe. [The clergyman {{takes his}} hat from the table, and joins Mrs Warren at the fireside.
