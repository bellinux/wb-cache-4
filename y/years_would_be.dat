5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father HenryIII – led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> formative on Edward's character.|$|E

Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that others believe that something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> beneficial to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with knowledge of a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E

5|$|After visiting England in July 1936, Thomas Finucane, then {{a company}} director, decided {{to set up}} an office in the West End of London on Regent Street. In November 1936, the family moved to England {{permanently}} and bought a house at 26 Castle Gate Road, Richmond in the London suburbs. Brendan was sent to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. Brendan completed his schooling with good qualifications. He started in an office job as an accountant which he loathed. In 1937, the RAF began offering short-service commissions (SSC) to lower-class persons who met the academic standard. It offered a four-year term as a junior rank on squadron service with flying lessons. A further six <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spent on the reserve list. In November 1937, Brendan approached his father about joining the British Armed Forces. Despite his Republican past, the senior Finucane agreed believing a military career would provide him a sense of direction lacking in his own youth. His parents cashed in their insurance policies, even though they needed the money and Thomas Andrew Finucane had been made unemployed.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, {{the sequel}} to Final Fantasy IV, is set {{seventeen}} years after {{the events of the}} original. The first two chapters of the game were released in Japan in February 2008 for NTT DoCoMo FOMA 903i series phones, with a release for au WIN BREW series phones slated for Spring 2008. The game revolves around Ceodore, the son of Cecil and Rosa, with most of the original cast members returning, some of whom are featured in more prominent roles than before, among other new characters. After the mobile release, it was hinted that The After <b>Years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> released outside Japan. On March 25, 2009, an announcement was made by Satoru Iwata during Nintendo's GDC 2009 Keynote speech that the U.S. would see The After Years released later that year on the Wii's WiiWare service. The first two chapters were released on June 1, 2009 in North America and June 5, 2009 in PAL territories, with the additional chapters being released in the following months.|$|E

25|$|The {{next step}} was to present the revised plan to the Board of Supervisors by February 2009 in order to decide if the 11-member board would {{recommend}} to continue with the congestion pricing plan. The plan will need approval at the local and state legislative levels, and possibly some non-objection at the federal level. It has not been decided if San Francisco residents will vote to approve the plan's implementation. Final study results were expected by late 2009, and SFCTA staff estimates that if the proposal moves forward in 2009, implementation will still take several years, as at least two to three <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spent doing the environmental studies required by law.|$|E
25|$|The city of Bell {{assessed}} {{property owners}} for sewer fees without getting the mandated voter approval. The Times acquired {{a letter to}} the city in which Controller John Chiang stated that property owners overpaid $621,737 in fees that were illegally increased since 2007. The extra tax added about $20 per parcel for each of the last three years’ tax bills. After the salary scandal surfaced in July 2010, about a hundred residents protested at City Council meetings, saying they believed that their taxes were too high. Many residents said they had noticed assessments on their tax bills that they were never informed of and did not understand. ABC News announced that Bell homeowners who had overpaid their property taxes over the last three <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> refunded the funds that were collected illegally. In September 2010, Lieutenant Governor Maldonado signed Assembly Bill 900, which returned $3,000,000 collected from 4,000 residents.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolutionary}} strategy used by cicadas of {{the genus}} Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects {{spend most of their}} lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{disagreements}} with the Lincoln administration, Bramlette proclaimed {{a day of}} fasting and prayer upon receiving news of Lincoln's assassination. The General Assembly petitioned new president Andrew Johnson to call an end to martial law in the state. The tension {{between the state and}} federal governments remained, however. Bramlette announced that every [...] "white male citizen" [...] twenty-one years of age who had resided in the Commonwealth for at least two <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> eligible to vote. Spurred on by the Democratic governor's actions, Kentucky gave control of both houses of the General Assembly and five of its nine congressional seats to Democrats. [...] President Johnson received the message, ending martial law and restoring habeas corpus in Kentucky.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any land {{transportation}} route to the dam site, the first stage of construction would have involved the building of a temporary road from Eureka, about [...] away, to the dam site. Consideration also was given to the extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to the site. A period of about four years would have been required for preconstruction planning, including detailed construction surveying and finalizing the design of the dam, powerhouse, and other structures. Engineers estimated that after the four years of final planning and surveying, three <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed to dig river diversion tunnels and construct the cofferdams needed to clear the Yukon River streambed for construction. Housing and construction offices also would have been constructed for workers on the south bank of the site, and the cost for this effort was included in overall cost proposals for the project.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there was}} general {{agreement}} that property {{law should be}} reformed the process was made more difficult by the various vested interests involved; the Law Society, for example, was opposed to the changes because it would reduce the fees dedicated property solicitors could earn by {{making it possible for}} more solicitors to understand that area of law and become involved. After intense negotiation Schuster and the Law Society representative agreed that a [...] "period of probation" [...] lasting three <b>years</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> included in the bill, which Charles Brickdale the Chief Registrar of HM Land Registry considered [...] "a very good bargain". When the bill finally got to the House of Commons it met additional opposition from Members of Parliament who were also members of the Law Society and Bar Council, as well as Lord Cave who later became Lord Chancellor. After further negotiations the bill was passed on 8 June 1922, with Birkenhead taking the credit, and it became the Law of Property Act 1922.|$|E
