2500|$|Rosé Champagnes {{account for}} between 3-5% of Champagne's <b>yearly</b> <b>production.</b> These Champagnes are {{distinct}} from Blanc de noirs (white of blacks or white from black grapes) in that rosé Champagnes are often noticeably and intentionally colored, with hues that span from [...] "baby pink" [...] to copper salmon, while Blanc de noirs are white wines with only sometimes the palest of coloring that {{could range from}} a [...] "white-grey" [...] to a light salmon. This color traditionally comes from the very brief skin contact of the black grapes (Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier) during pressing that the Champagne producer decides not to remove by any decolorizing techniques. However, many modern rosé Champagnes are produced as regular Champagnes but are later [...] "colored up" [...] by adding red Pinot noir wines to the finished wine. According to wine expert Karen MacNeil, some Champagne producers believe this second method adds more richness and age-ability to the wine.|$|E
