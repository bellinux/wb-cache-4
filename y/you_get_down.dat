500|$|A {{writer for}} GamePro noted that John Madden Football '93 was [...] "at first glance" [...] largely {{identical}} to its predecessor; but he believed that, [...] "once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> to serious business, you'll notice {{a wealth of}} All-Star enhancements". He wrote that the [...] "game play is now faster and smoother", and that [...] "the graphics are sharper, more detailed, and even better animated". He believed that [...] "Electronic Arts has [...] made the best even better", and he concluded, [...] "John Madden Football '93 is even more fun to play than Madden '92". The staff of Mean Machines Sega called the game [...] "hopelessly redundant" [...] and [...] "very, very disappoint", and {{they believed that the}} John Madden Football series was [...] "on its last legs". They considered the game to be arguably worse than its predecessors, largely because of framerate problems. The reviewers concluded that it was [...] "not a bad game at all", but they suggested that readers buy [...] "the slightly better John Madden Football '92 if [...] after the definitive American Football game".|$|E
500|$|Alabama {{announced}} the American Farewell tour in May 2002 at the Country Music Association Awards (CMAs), encompassing 40 tour dates, sponsorships, special events, and a TV special. Owen spoke {{then on the}} decision to part ways: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> to it, there are many, many factors involved â€” some of them very personal. It's really about {{the integrity of the}} group, the dignity of the group." [...] Owen later admitted the group was exhausted after twenty years of nonstop touring and recording, and [...] "everybody needed some time." [...] The tour collected $15 million in box office before it even began, and Alabama performed to packed arenas from June to November 2003. Due to [...] "extraordinary fan response and overwhelming ticket demand," [...] the tour was extended for an additional 30 shows, running between February and June 2004. The group performed their [...] "final" [...] show in October 2004 in Bismarck, North Dakota, with Herndon jokingly declaring [...] "I need a job" [...] as the concert closed.|$|E

[...] Shevlin spoke {{in defense of the}} sport. [...] He noted that, though he loved all forms of sport, football was a particular favorite: [...] "There's something primitive about football that I like. [...] <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> to the fundamentals, as it were. [...] Football is a war game. [...] You have to plan it like a battle. [...] It requires more brains to play it an develop it than any other game ..." ...|$|E

2500|$|... he Elo {{equivalent}} of a given handicap degrades as you go down the scale. A knight seems to be worth around a thousand points when the [...] "weak" [...] player is around IM level, but it drops as you go down. For example, I'm about 2400 and I've played tons of knight odds games with students, and I would put the break-even point (for untimed but reasonably quick games) with me at around 1800, so maybe a 600 value at this level. An 1800 can probably give knight odds to a 1400, a 1400 to an 1100, an 1100 to a 900, etc. This is pretty obviously the way it must work, because the weaker the players are, the more likely the weaker one is to blunder a piece or more. When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> {{to the level of}} the average 8 year old player, knight odds is just a slight edge, maybe 50 points or so.|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{called the}} album a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] in their mixed review, adding [...] " [...] When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> to it, the samples and interludes on Zombie's solo debut, Hellbilly Deluxe, are merely window {{dressing}} for compact, overdriven, anthemic money shots like 'Superbeast', 'Demonoid Phenomenon', and 'Living Dead Girl'." [...] In their 2010 {{review of the}} album, Bloody Disgusting wrote [...] "Putting aside the futuristic sounds and crisp production, everything about the album screamed out vintage horror. I imagined creepy black and white laboratories where glass vials and tubes bubbled with menacing liquids. I pictured a dark night where clouds slowly moved past a full moon. I envisioned foggy forests where tree branches looked like skeleton arms. With that kind of atmosphere, the album already felt like a fine wine: aged and more enjoyable for it." [...] They later criticized {{the length of the}} album, and claimed that some songs felt like [...] "filler" [...] tracks. PopStops also praised the album, writing [...] "This is an album that rarely ever gets out of overdrive. Zombie growls his lyrics over a bed of car crash crunching guitars and pounding industrial rhythms. No surf music here." ...|$|E
