500|$|Not My Life was {{screened}} at the 2012 UNIS-UN Conference in New York City, {{the theme}} of which was human exploitation. Segments from the film were included in [...] "Can <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> Away?", a 2012 exhibition on contemporary slavery at President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home in Washington, DC. A hotel chain presented the film to its staff in London {{in preparation for the}} 2012 Summer Olympics to raise awareness about the types of human trafficking that might take place in conjunction with the events. Bilheimer initiated an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in 2012 to allow local organizations opposing human trafficking to screen the film. That same year, he expressed a willingness to release fifteen-minute excerpts from the film to help its message reach more people.|$|E

[...] The rest of the story came later, drawn from the author's own life and other inspiration. [...] Brosgol started work on Anya's Ghost in 2007.|$|E

He decided to wear No. 3, the number he wore during his college years at Washington. He felt well during {{training}} camp but suffered an injury after a collision during a preseason game on October 26, 2012. He played in five regular season games before needing season-ending surgery on his right knee. He averaged 5.8 points per game, 2.8 rebounds per game, and 4.6 assists per game in 24.4 minutes during the 2012–13 season. Roy was waived by Minnesota on May 10, 2013.

Jack tells her you can do anything if <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows.

He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance.

500|$|The {{underlying}} {{theme of}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights," [...] {{reflected in the}} chorus, is lost innocence. The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park under the Brooklyn Bridge; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about {{the first time the}} band arrived in New York City, calling it [...] "a song about innocence and naïvete." [...] Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife, Alison Stewart, when they were teenagers. The experience of walking through Piccadilly Circus and along Wardour Street put him in mind of [...] "discovering what a big city could offer you and what it could take away." [...] Although the first verse is set in London, the chorus is set in New York City. The verse, [...] "I've seen <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" [...] was written as an expression of love for Alison, with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.|$|E

He mused, [...] "it's like everybody is a student: <b>You</b> <b>walk</b> into a session, and it's {{all about the}} subject at hand." [...] The remastered album version featured a new guitar solo, composed by producer Bink!. Bink! is most famous for his contributions to Jay-Z's album, The Blueprint, which has been described a [...] "pioneering album" [...] by Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal and was West's big break as a producer. West and Bink! originally became friends while producing another Jay-Z album, [...] in the late 1990s. Bink! described that the two producers quickly developed a mutual respect for each other. Bink! commented on {{the first time he}} showed the composition to West, saying [...] "the reaction I got from him after I played the beat for the first time was real intense." [...] Immediately Bink! knew that West was going to use the production. Initially, he wasn't sure whether or how West was going to use the song for his album, and expressed surprise that West dropped the song as a free track prior to the album's release.|$|E

500|$|An {{earlier version}} of [...] "Full on Idle", Title TKs eighth track, was {{released}} on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal {{expressed an interest in}} redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of [...] "Full on Idle" [...] sound almost the same, but The Village Voices Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardians Betty Clarke cited the line [...] "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" [...] as an example of Title TKs amusing, off-center lyrics. On [...] "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings [...] "Has anyone seen the iguana?" [...] She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: [...] "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? <b>You</b> <b>walk</b> in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." [...] Another line, [...] "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a [...] "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.|$|E

The seventh track on the international version, [...] "Body to Body, Heart to Heart", is a Spanish-influenced song penned by Diane Warren. The eighth song [...] "Love Is a Lonely Place Without You" [...] lyrically carries the theme of a [...] "brokenhearted symbol of a strong but decidedly single woman". The following track, [...] "Real Love", features [...] "computer-altered vocals adding a futuristic feel" [...] to it. The tenth track [...] "Love One Another" [...] is a [...] "anthemic" [...] and [...] "heartfelt rendition" [...] of a song originally by singer Amber. The eleventh song on the international version of the album, [...] "You Take It All", is an [...] "alpine breakbeat number", while the track that replaces it on the American version is [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> Away", another track penned by Warren. The closing song, a cover of Bruce Roberts' [...] "When the Money's Gone", is an [...] "airy track" [...] which has [...] "rapid-fire drum beats".|$|E
500|$|... 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, both {{of which}} debuted on 2006–07 NBC lineup, {{revolved}} around the off-camera happenings on a sketch comedy series. Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, {{as well as the}} conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied. Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey wound up [...] "winning" [...] over Sorkin when Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was cancelled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Although 30 Rocks first season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, the latter was more expensive to produce. The first season episode [...] "Jack the Writer" [...] contained a self-referencing walk and talk sequence, which was commonly used on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Sorkin's previous series. In this episode, the walk and talk sequence is referenced when Liz asks Kenneth, [...] "can <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> and talk?", to which Kenneth replies, [...] "usually, but now you've got me thinking about it".|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} three verses of {{advertising}} slogans, the song continues with the lyrics [...] "I have no compass, and I have no map" [...] and [...] "No reason to get back", referring to {{the uncertainty of the}} new direction of U2's music at the time. [...] The following verse begins with, [...] "And I have no religion", which was included in the lyrics because Bono stated that he believes [...] "religion is the enemy of God." [...] A review of the album in Melody Maker compared the lyric [...] "Uncertainty can be a guiding light" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song to the line [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> away, [...] I will follow" [...] from U2's 1980 single [...] "I Will Follow". The reviewer stated [...] "The man (Bono) that once had so many answers now sounds simply confused." [...] The theme of moral confusion was first used in U2's song [...] "Acrobat" [...] from Achtung Baby. The coda in [...] "Zooropa" [...] features the lyric [...] "dream out loud", which Bono included as a reference to [...] "Acrobat". The phrase [...] "dream out loud" [...] was first used by Bono during the Lovetown Tour in 1989, and has appeared several times in U2's work since then. The phrase was also used in the song [...] "Always"– a B-side to the [...] "Beautiful Day" [...] single released in 2000 — and was spoken by Bono in the [...] video.|$|E
500|$|He {{was voted}} the National Football League Players Association NFC Offensive Lineman {{of the year}} four times—1983, 1986, 1987, and 1989 and was the Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award winner after the 1995 season. Slater played in 259 games from 1976 to 1995, a then-record for {{offensive}} lineman (broken by Bruce Matthews in the 1999 season). He was {{the first player to}} play 20 seasons for one team, later matched by Washington Redskins cornerback Darrell Green and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson and third all-time. He played for 24 quarterbacks and 37 running backs in his lengthy career, during which seven running backs reached for over 1,000 yards in a season and played in seven Pro Bowls. Former teammate Jim Everett stated [...] "Jackie Slater is proof they were playing football in the prehistoric days". [...] He was Dickerson's Hall of Fame presenter in 1999. In 2001, Slater was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon hearing his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, fellow inductee and teammate Jack Youngblood said [...] "Jackie Slater didn't want to just beat you, he wanted to dominate you. That's what made him the player that he was."

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fifteen" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman White, who previously directed Swift's music video [...] "You Belong with Me". White began {{with the intention of}} creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> in on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|E
