5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice <b>your</b> <b>opinions,</b> be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
25|$|My heart...is {{to agree}} on all {{subjects}} with Charles Fox: but <b>your</b> <b>opinions</b> have been terribly at variance. New occurrences and change of circumstances will, I hope, bring us together again—but still I am anti-Gallican: I ask not, what sort of Government prevail, but under none, can I submit patiently to the strange assumption of power over independent nations, daily making by France. Here {{is the root of}} my present opinions: I am sure, it is the growth of good Whig soil.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{said the}} song [...] "was just me {{trying to figure}} things out", and she later stated that she [...] "was {{doing a lot of}} drugs" [...] when she wrote the song. She claims it is about how [...] "whoever you are or where you live – you can self-proclaim this inner fame based on your {{personal}} style, and <b>your</b> <b>opinions</b> about art and the world, despite being conscious of it", and also about her experiences as a struggling artist working in the Lower East Side. The line [...] "Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah", according to Gaga, was inspired by [...] "rich kids" [...] in the area who she would hear calling their parents for money to buy drugs with. She added that [...] "ultimately what I want people to take from it is 'Bang-bang.' No matter who you are and where you come from, you can feel beautiful and dirty rich." ...|$|E

30|$|For IKDC-SKF item comprehensibility, {{patients}} were asked, “In <b>your</b> <b>opinion,</b> how comprehensible {{is the question}} formulated?” and could answer with: (1) totally comprehensible, (2) mostly comprehensible, (3) moderately comprehensible, (4) slightly comprehensible, or (5) not at all comprehensible. In a similar manner, {{patients were}} asked to rate the relevance of each IKDC-SKF item, i.e. “In <b>your</b> <b>opinion,</b> how essential is this item in order to describe your situation?” [1] and to specify missing items, i.e. “In <b>your</b> <b>opinion,</b> which questions/items are also very important, but are missing in this questionnaire?”.|$|R
500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] is {{categorised}} {{by three}} distinct moods written in what Yorke {{referred to as}} three different states of mind. The song's lyrics tie in {{with a number of}} themes common in OK Computer, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism. Yorke's lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her. Yorke characterised the woman as [...] "inhuman", and said [...] "There was a look in this woman's eyes that I'd never seen before anywhere.... Couldn't sleep that night because of it." [...] The woman inspired the line [...] "kicking squealing Gucci little piggy" [...] in the song's second section. Yorke, referring to the line [...] "With <b>your</b> <b>opinions,</b> which are of no consequence at all", said that [...] "Again, that's just a joke. It's actually the other way around– it's actually my opinion that is of no consequence at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Bloomberg Businessweek {{journalist}} Paul Ford {{summed up}} the issue by remarking, [...] "Regardless of <b>your</b> <b>opinions</b> on the health-care law, this is {{the wrong way to}} make software." [...] He also wrote, [...] "In the meantime, it’s clear that {{tens of millions of dollars}} have been spent to launch something broken." [...] A ConsumerReports.org article re-iterated previous advice, with the group recommending for people to stay [...] "away from HealthCare.gov for at least another month". The group stated as well, [...] "Hopefully that will be long enough for its software vendors to clean up the mess they've made." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing <b>your</b> <b>opinions</b> from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don't wish you to give me your opinion about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lu Ji {{appeared}} {{briefly in}} chapter 43 {{of the historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. He {{was one of the}} Wu scholars who debated with Zhuge Liang over Sun Quan's decision to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao before the Battle of Red Cliffs. Lu Ji argued, [...] "Even though Cao Cao controls the Emperor and holds sway over the lords, he is still a descendant of the chancellor Cao Shen. Liu Bei may be a descendant of Prince Jing of Zhongshan, but there is no proof for this. As far as we see, he {{is no more than a}} straw mat weaver and shoe seller. How can he compete with Cao Cao?" [...] Zhuge Liang replied, [...] "Aren't you the 'Young Man Lu' who hid oranges in his sleeve at Yuan Shu's house? Please sit down and listen to me. Since Cao Cao is a descendant of Chancellor Cao, he is therefore a subject of the Han Empire. However, he monopolises state power and bullies the Emperor. This is a disgrace to his ancestor. He is not only a villain of the Han Empire, but also a miscreant of the Cao family! Liu Bei is a member of the imperial clan. His Majesty the Emperor checked the family records and granted him a title. How can you say there is no proof? Emperor Gaozu started off as a minor patrol officer, but yet he became an Emperor eventually. What is disgraceful about weaving straw mats and selling shoes? <b>Your</b> <b>opinions</b> are those of a child. You're not fit to speak with learned men!" [...] Lu Ji remained silent.|$|E
2500|$|Again he {{discussed}} his ideas, and she subsequently wrote telling him of her [...] "fear that our {{opinions on the}} most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing <b>your</b> <b>opinions</b> from the fear of giving me pain." [...] She continued; [...] "my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling." [...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E
