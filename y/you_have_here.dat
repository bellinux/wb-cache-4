About 1806, Metcalfe married Nancy Mason of Fairfax, Virginia. The couple had four children. Between 1817 and 1820, Metcalfe built a house for his family in Nicholas County. The estate was dubbed [...] "Forest Retreat" [...] by statesman Henry Clay who, on {{his first visit to}} the newly constructed house, told Metcalfe, [...] "Tom, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> a veritable Forest Retreat." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameTrailers {{was also}} {{critical}} of the plot, saying, [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> is an unending parade of threadbare anime tropes predictably matched by bland characters. You've seen {{every one of these}} stereotypes before, acting out the same quests and forcing out the same emotions they do in just about every other RPG." [...] However, they praised the gameplay and variety of side-quests, and concluded [...] "while it has plenty of problems, anyone who can get beyond the banal storytelling and stale level design will find something addictive and worthwhile in Rogue Galaxy. Grinding out levels and looking for items is rarely this rewarding, and it's obvious that Level 5 knows the depths of the role-player's mind all too well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E
