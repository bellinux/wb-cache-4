Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You can do whatever <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> mind to. If you're lazy, you're {{not going to get}} it done. But if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E

I take it back. I take it back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record.

In September 2012 after the All Blacks v South African Test in Dunedin, then South African coach Heyneke Meyer said that McCaw was the greatest rugby player the world has ever seen. Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup, All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw's and Dan Carter's career efforts, distinguishing McCaw from Carter:“Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second,” said Hansen. “The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> body on the line every time you go there. The challenge for the other guys now is to try and become as great as him and Dan.” ...|$|E
500|$|Matsoukas {{initially}} {{planned the}} music video to visualize Beyoncé winning the contest, {{where she would}} {{realize that it was}} meaningless to her. However, Beyoncé suggested that an albino should serve as the contest's winner instead. Speaking to MTV News, Matsoukas elaborated: [...] "We thought it was really important and interesting to break those ideas of what the classic beauty standards would be and to do this with this beautiful albino woman, I thought was really great. And to show 'Yeah she's not perfect, she doesn't always win and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> best foot forward and you may still lose.'" [...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E
500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> hands on the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set {{to appear on the}} album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... <b>You</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E

[...] "So Emotional" [...] is a midtempo gospel-inspired number {{talking about a}} man who has got Aguilera [...] "on the ropes." [...] "Love for All Seasons" [...] is a pop track which is musically similar to Carey's [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] (1996), while [...] "Somebody's Somebody", in which Aguilera sings about being secure in one's arms, features drums snap, bass pops, and a gospel organ in the bridge. Aguilera sings about a woman longing to reveal her true self on [...] "Reflection", which Partridge characterized it as the song that [...] "sums up the album." [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" [...] is deemed the most [...] "sexual" [...] track on Christina Aguilera, a hip hop-influenced song which features a rap verse written by Aguilera herself. [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> Hands On Me", an R song co-written by Robin Thicke, addresses the alchemy of sex: [...] "I just know / when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> hands on me / I feel sexy / and my body turns to gold." [...] "Blessed" [...] features elements of gospel, while [...] "Love Will Find A Way" [...] features an R groove and was compared to Carey's songs [...] "Emotions" [...] (1991) and [...] "Dreamlover" [...] (1993).

2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but {{also had a}} high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see {{this is a very}} shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, [...] <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if you print that's exactly what you don't want.

The units frequently ambushed Arab saboteurs who attacked oil pipelines of the Iraq Petroleum Company, raiding border villages the attackers had used as bases. In these raids Wingate's men sometimes imposed severe collective punishments on the villagers, which was criticised by Zionist leaders as well as Wingate's British superiors. Wingate disliked Arabs, once shouting at Haganah fighters after a June 1938 attack on a village {{on the border between}} Mandatory Palestine and Lebanon, [...] "I think you are all totally ignorant in your Ramat Yochanan [...] since you do not even know the elementary use of bayonets when attacking dirty Arabs: how can <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> left foot in front?"

2500|$|While {{initially}} {{signed as}} a singer and artist in his own right, Thicke first {{made a name for}} himself within the industry as a songwriter and producer for other artists before releasing and performing his own music. Among his work for other artists, Thicke co-wrote [...] "Love Is on My Side" [...] on Brandy's eponymous debut album; he also wrote for 3T's Brotherhood, and collaborated with Jordan Knight, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on several songs in Knight's 1999 album Jordan Knight including the Billboard top 10 hit [...] "Give It to You". According to Thicke, Knight also invested in the ability of the young songwriter early on by purchasing studio equipment for him. He also co-wrote the song [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> Hands on Me" [...] for Christina Aguilera's debut album and co-wrote and produced three songs for Mýa's sophomore release, Fear of Flying. In 1999, Thicke co-wrote the song [...] "Fall Again" [...] with Walter Afanasieff, which was intended to be a track on Michael Jackson's 2001 album Invincible, but it failed to be presented as a completed song. The demo Michael recorded in 1999 was released on November 16, 2004 as an album track of his limited edition box set The Ultimate Collection. As an artist, he recorded and performed solely under his surname, Thicke. He would continue to do so until 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Newark {{burned in}} 1967, where {{six days of}} rioting left 26 dead, 1500 injured, and the inner city a burned out shell. In Detroit in 1967, Governor George Romney sent in 7400 {{national}} guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and on police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead, 2250 were injured, 4000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The biggest wave of riots came in April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this fell on deaf ears. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had {{lost control of the}} streets of major cities as well as his party. Johnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: [...] "What did you expect? I don't know why we're so surprised. When <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off." ...|$|E

[...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] was later re-recorded for its single release, replacing the [...] "lighter" [...] version for a more [...] "funky" [...] R version. Peiken also re-wrote with Roche the single version for the track [...] "Come on Over", first produced by Johan Aberg, Paul Rein and Aaron Zigman. According to herself, [...] "We're {{going to give it}} more of an edge, R it up a little, maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there." [...] Aguilera also recorded a cover of All-4-One's song [...] "I Turn to You", written by Diane Warren. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers (who would eventually broke into the scene as the producers who launched Rihanna's career) wrote and produced two tracks, while the then up-and-coming Robin Thicke co-wrote and co-produced [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> Hands on Me". Franne Golde (who previously worked with Whitney Houston) also wrote a song for Aguilera. At the final stages, producer and songwriter David Frank presented a song called [...] "Genie in a Bottle", which Aguilera almost didn't record, [...] "because {{there were a lot of}} other artists out there that were after this song, so we had to fight a little bit to get it," [...] she claimed. With Heather Holley, Aguilera also co-wrote a track called [...] "I Will Be", which she said was inspired by Mariah Carey's [...] "Vanishing".
