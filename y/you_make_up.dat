"Wannabe" [...] was {{completed}} in thirty minutes—mainly because the group had written and composed parts of the song beforehand—in what Brown describes as a [...] "sudden creative frenzy." [...] During the session, Brown and Bunton {{came up with the}} idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group got very motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> silly words? Well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ha. We were in the studio and it all came together in this song." ...|$|E

If they were to press 500 records, there goes their savings. But if you do a cassette <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> as many as you need, they're cheap, and if you don't sell them you just use them." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Jaka's Story", {{a tragic}} {{character}} study dealing with gender roles {{and the political}} suppression of art, is generally cited as the series' pinnacle of narrative achievement. Later issues of the series became highly personal and began to alienate many long-time fans, his female readers especially. Issue #186 (collected in Reads) contained a lengthy prose section that was attacked by some readers and critics for what they perceived as overt misogyny, but which Sim describes as [...] "anti-feminism". During {{this part of the}} story, the storyline consisted of a textual treatise written by Viktor Davis, a fictional [...] "reads" [...] author, interspersed with the main Cerebus storyline. [...] In Davis' material, he refers to the [...] "creative male light" [...] and the [...] "emotional female void", a reversal of the gender-based view of creation espoused by the Judge at the end of Church and State (namely, the [...] "female light" [...] being raped by the [...] "male void" [...] and shattering into the physical universe). As Sim himself says in an interview with The Comics Journal, [...] "Cerebus #1-200 [...] the completion of the story. The yin and yang. The ultra-female reading. The ultra-male reading. I'm attaching an allegory to the Big Bang. <b>You</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> your mind which one's the pit and which one's the top of the mountain." [...] By the end of the series, the Void is again male and identified as God, and the Light is female, now identified with YHWH. Issue #186 was followed by an even harsher essay in the back of issue #265 called [...] "Tangent", in which Sim identified a [...] "feminist/homosexualist axis" [...] that opposed traditional and rational societal values. [...] This material appeared as Sim was retreating from public life and becoming more marginalized by his peers in the industry.|$|E
