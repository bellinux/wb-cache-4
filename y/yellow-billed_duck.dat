If this continues, only hybrids occur and in the long term result in the extinction of various indigenous waterfowl.

In summary, the problems of mallards [...] "hybridising away" [...] relatives is more a consequence of local ducks declining than of mallards spreading; allopatric speciation and isolating behaviour have produced today's diversity of mallard-like ducks despite the fact that, in most, if not all, of these populations, hybridisation must have occurred to some extent.|$|E

40|$|Examination of the {{helminth}} {{communities in}} 25 <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>ducks</b> (Anas undulata), 21 red-billed ducks (Anas erythrorhyncha), ten Cape teal (Anas capensis) and seven Cape shovellers (Anas smithii) that had overwintered at Barberspan, revealed differences in community structure. Infracommunities in <b>yellow-billed</b> and red-billed <b>ducks</b> {{were characterized by}} low diversity and high eveness, and generally consisted of less than 100 helminths per duck. Similarity values (mean percent similarity and mean Jaccard's coefficients) were low. In contrast, infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were more diverse, displayed low eveness values and consisted of far greater numbers of helminths. Mean similarity values for the infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were much higher than those in <b>yellow-billed</b> or red-billed <b>ducks.</b> The component communities in all four duck hosts were species rich. Those in <b>yellow-billed</b> and red-billed <b>ducks,</b> however, consisted predominantly of satellite species and no core species were present, whereas those in Cape teal and Cape shoveller included several core species. Cape teal and Cape shovellers each had a group of recurrent species but {{there was not much}} of a tendency for species to co-occur in <b>yellow-billed</b> and red-billed <b>ducks.</b> Multivariate analysis revealed a greater similarity between the communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers than between the latter and the communities in yellow- billed or red-billed ducks. Communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers could be distinguished from each other by {{the presence or absence of}} particular cestode species. The communities in these two species could be distinguished from those in <b>yellow-billed</b> or red-billed <b>ducks</b> by a suite of cestode species that was absent in the latter two. Two recurrent groups, consisting of eight and two species, were identified in the compound community. Each group consisted of species found predominantly in Cape teal and Cape shovellers. Patterns seen in the helminth communities of the various hosts reflected differences in diet, but other factors, including feeding behaviour, spatial segregation and host specificity, may also have had an effect.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Despite the {{importance}} of movement ecology studies, the field faces a prevailing challenge of methodological limitations in tracking individual organisms. This research investigated {{the utility of the}} stable isotope technique to trace movements of ducks in southern Africa. I sampled and analysed feathers of ten duck species for stable isotope proportions of Carbon (δ 13 C), Nitrogen (δ 15 N) and Hydrogen (δD), from five wetlands (Strandfontein and Barberspan in South Africa, the Manyame catchment in Zimbabwe, Lake Chuali in Mozambique, and Lake Ngami in Botswana) as test cases. Sampling was carried out at different seasons to account for seasonal isotope signature variations. Isotope signatures of feathers grown at different moulting locations were compared to test whether southern Africa shows stable isotope spatial patterns (distinct isotopic regions). Feathers grown at different life-phases were compared to test whether different sites had been used and if more mobile species showed more and stronger isotope distinctions. Finally, growing flight feathers grown at moulting locations were compared across species to query how much information on diet and foraging behaviour can be inferred from southern African duck feather stable isotopes. Feather isotope signatures were distinct by site in {{at least one of the}} tested isotopes, for the majority of ducks tested. Strandfontein had more and stronger distinctions of isotope signatures between feathers grown at different life phases. This site is the closest to the sea and most likely to have marine-influenced isotope signatures especially in δ 15 N, it falls within the Mediterranean climatic conditions experiencing winter rainfall unlike all the other sites. Vegetation compositions (C 3 and C 4 plant distributions) therefore vary across sites influencing δ 13 C patterns. More mobile species (only Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiacus from Strandfontein, and Cape Shoveler Anas smithii from Barberspan; determined by mobility scores from other studies) had more and stronger distinctions between flight and body feathers. All the other species did not comply with mobility scores. They showed weaker and fewer tissue signature distinctions than their mobility scores suggested. There were high isotopic signature overlaps in δ 13 C and δ 15 N across and within feeding guilds at each moulting site implying dietary overlaps during moulting. More overlaps occurred during the dry seasons (summer in Strandfontein and winter in Lake Chuali, Manyame catchment site, and Lake Ngami). Higher isotopic variances (higher dietary flexibility) were associated with isotope signature divergence to mobility scores especially in Cape Teals and <b>Yellow-billed</b> <b>Ducks.</b> The isotope technique is flawed with uncontrollable sources of variation which potentially confound movement inferences. It is best used when accompanied by conventional methods to detect and counter against species specific biology and dietary behaviour imposed biases in tissue isotope signatures. Further research on how species specific biological processes affect the reflection of spatial patterns of isotopes in feathers is recommended. Multi-isotope time explicit approaches and trace element analysis were also recommended. Scientists should be wary about basing management strategies or building theory about movement patterns of species based on the technique at least in stochastic environments such as southern Africa. My results provide empirical evidence that the technique is unreliable at this scale of analysis. In particular, the majority of ducks in this region are not good candidates for use of isotopic signatures in distinguishing movement patterns of southern African ducks. 498...|$|R

50|$|Despite its {{preference}} for ground-dwelling avian prey, a surprisingly {{considerable number of}} water birds may also be attacked. Waterfowl known to be attacked include the 1.18 kg South African shelduck (Tadorna cana), 1 kg <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>duck</b> (Anas undulata), the 4.43 kg spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) (Africa’s largest waterfowl species) and especially the peculiar, overly bold and aggressive 1.76 kg Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca), {{which is one of}} the main prey species for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. Larger wading birds are also fairly frequently attacked including herons and egrets, flamingoes storks, ibises, spoonbills and cranes. The diversity and number of storks taken is particularly impressive. They are known to take 8 species of stork, ranging from the smallest known species, the 1.08 kg African openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus), to the tallest species in the world, the 6.16 kg, 1.5 m-tall saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). One naturalists observed up to a half dozen attacks in different parts of Africa on 3.45 kg white storks (Ciconia ciconia). Short of three attacks on spotted thick-knees (Burhinus capensis), which weigh about 0.42 kg, so far as is known small waders or shorebirds are ignored as prey. Other assorted avian prey may consists of ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks (frequently resulting in the immediate ire of protective ostrich parents), sandgrouse, pigeons and doves, hornbills and crows. Beyond occasional captures of other birds of prey (covered later), one other impressive avian prey species is the southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which at 3.77 kg is probably the world’s largest hornbill. At the other end of the scale, some martial eagles may capture a few small social species of passerine, which are exceptionally small prey (the smallest recorded prey species for the eagle overall), potentially consisting of the 18.6 g red-billed queleas (Quelea quelea) and the 27.4 g sociable weavers (Philetairus socius), as practically every meat-eating bird in Africa may be attracted to these species’ colonial abundance.|$|E
50|$|Verreaux's eagle-owl takes {{a diverse}} range of birds as prey. More than 50 avian prey species have been {{identified}} and they may locally exceed mammals in importance in the diet, somewhat unusually for eagle-owls. No one type of bird {{can be said to}} be predictably favored as prey and any avian species unfortunate enough to have a nighttime roost or nest that happens to be in an eagle-owl's foraging path may fall victim to this species. Many cases of predation involve nest robbery, with nestlings or fledglings being taken, although adult birds may be taken just as often, especially for species with less conspicuous nests. In South Africa's De Hoop Nature Reserve, it was found that birds were somewhat better represented by both number, 43.3% of remains, and biomass, 57.84% of remains, than mammals or any other prey group. The species best represented in biomass in the prior study was the black-headed heron (Ardea melanocephala) with several adults estimated to average 1260 g being found among the prey remains. Other fairly common, largish herons are also known to fall prey at night to Verreaux's eagle-owl including the 873 g great egret (Ardea alba), the 1443 g grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and the 975 g purple heron (Ardea purpurea). Other medium-sized water birds known to have been represented in this species diet include the 1008 g <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>duck</b> (Anas undulata), the 983 g African black duck (Anas sparsa), the 596 g African swamphen (Porphyrio madagascariensis) and the 825 g red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata). Besides herons, another well-represented group of birds in the diet are galliforms. Perhaps the most widely prey species reported from this group is the 1229 g helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), which may seasonally dominate the eagle-owl's food in Kenya. More modestly sized wild galliform species reported in the diet including the 96 g common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the 390 g grey-winged francolin (Francolinus africanus). Domestic fowl, especially those allowed back to a semi-feral state and thus sleeping in the open as is prevalent in Africa, are taken when encountered, including chickens and peafowls.|$|E

In nearly all species both sexes have iridescent wing speculum markings, and in all species the trachea has an enlarged bulla at the syrinx.

40|$|Waterbirds {{are often}} {{overlooked}} as predators in aquatic ecosystems, {{despite the fact}} that waterbirds congregate in great numbers in and around waterways, notably estuaries. To fully appreciate the effect that aquatic feeding waterbird species may have on aquatic prey communities and the role that they play in estuarine food webs, stable isotopes and fatty acid profiles were employed to examine the seasonal diet of selected waterbirds in the Kowie Estuary, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Population counts were conducted every month for four seasons to examine the demography of waterbirds in the lower reaches of the estuary. The mean monthly energy consumption, along with dry matter intake of all waterbird species observed, were calculated and compared to similar estuaries in South Africa and elsewhere. Three duck species, one migrant sandpiper and one piscivore were selected for more detailed investigation at several temporal scales. This thesis has revealed that stable isotope analysis of waterbird tissues provides more informative data than fatty acid analysis for investigating waterbird diet and basal resource-tertiary consumer nutrient coupling. Stable δ 15 N and δ 13 C isotopes from several body tissues, in conjunction with SIAR models, were used to determine the seasonal diet of each waterbird species, while fatty acid profiles were investigated to examine the trophic transfer of fatty acids from basal resources to waterbird predators via the benthic fauna. Stable isotopes revealed that Cape Shoveller, Cape Teal and <b>Yellow-Billed</b> <b>Duck</b> shifted their diet over both long and short temporal scales, while the migratory Ruff and piscivorous Little Egret maintained a relatively consistent diet over time. Isopods, amphipods, copepods and Mysidacea were the main foods of all three duck species and the Ruff (> 30 %). Little Egret fed mainly on flathead mullet throughout the year. Fatty acid analysis revealed evidence for trophic transfer of specific fatty acids from basal resources to waterbirds in the Kowie Estuary but provided little information on seasonal diet of waterbirds. Waterbirds foraging in the Kowie Estuary appeared to shift their diet to coincide with resource abundance pulses, but also displayed seasonal dietary overlap. This study highlights the role that waterbirds play in aquatic food webs. The subject requires more attention so that we can better understand all the predatory drivers on aquatic communities...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Sciences) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Ornithology {{should be}} {{considered}} as an essential part of ecological studies. Birds provide an easy way of monitoring the state of the environment, because they are easier to detect, simpler to locate than many other taxonomic groups, and bird taxonomy and distribution are better known than for any other reasonably large group of animals or plants. Bird diversity and density are considered good indicators of overall environmental health, since birds occur in most habitats on land throughout the world, and are sensitive to environmental change. Recreation is an inseparable part of the Vaal River. It will not be advisable to undertake ecological studies without at least considering the effect of recreational activities on the environment. Although still largely unprotected, the Middle Vaal River is a declared Important Bird Area (IBA) on sub-regional level and the Vredefort Dome area was recently promoted to World Heritage status in 2005. Bird species data were gathered at the Middle Vaal River from April 2002 to April 2003. Point surveys were conducted at monthly intervals at fourteen sites. Relative densities and Shannon indices were calculated from the data and certain feeding, nesting and habitat guilds were identified. Based on an existing model used to determine the occurrence of droughts, amendments were made to predict the seasonal occurrence of bird species. During the survey period, 59 water-associated bird species were recorded of which 51 species were recorded during the actual counting times, with an overall total of 5 428 individuals. The major influences on bird numbers and species richness are human activities and some habitat features at sites. According to their relative densities the top fifteen species contributed 90 % to the total bird numbers, while the remaining 34 species only contributed 10 %. Overall, it was determined that all study sites had a high diversity and evenness of birds as measured by the Shannon index. According to the model used for seasonal occurrence, a pattern of succession of three breeding bird species was observed during the study period at the heronry situated at Limerick. The importance of heronries in sustaining {{a large part of the}} aquatic avifaunal population is emphasised by this study. In future the model can be used to make predictions about the bird status at a given time or season. When making management and conservation decisions, it is important to combine as many different factors as possible. In this study not only diversity was used, but also abundance, species richness and certain guilds. It is also recommended to use more than one surveying method, depending on the aim of the survey as some species may largely be overlooked by using only one surveying method. Important points to consider when making management and conservation decisions based on a census survey of aquatic avifauna are discussed. These include taking into account density, diversity, abundance and guilds, as well as the presence of heronries and other breeding colonies. Some conservation and management recommendations are also made specifically for the Middle Vaal River of which the following are the most important: the control of pollution and boating, management of mallards not in captivity that may interbreed with the <b>Yellow-billed</b> <b>Duck,</b> protection of heronries along the river, conservation of landscapes and riparian vegetation surrounding the river. Observations made on the White-backed Night Heron and some other rare species, as well as the high numbers of the Goliath Heron and waterfowl, show that the Middle Vaal River should maintain its status as a Sub-regional Important Bird Area. Ecotourism is an important part of the Vredefort Dome and it can be used to make people more aware of the aesthetic value and beauty of aquatic avifauna. Master...|$|E
