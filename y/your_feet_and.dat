Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't {{give a lot of}} credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." [...] Her ashes were scattered over the [...] of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park.|$|E

2500|$|ERICKSON: You know, I had {{one patient}} this last July who had {{four or five}} years of {{psychoanalysis}} and got nowhere with it. And someone who knows her said, [...] "How much attention did you give to the past?" [...] I said, [...] "You know, I completely forgot about that." [...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start {{at the top of your}} head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E

The ballad Sand on My Feet was released to adult contemporary stations and reached No. 30 on that chart. Summer said, [...] "I wanted this album {{to have a lot}} of different directions on it. I did not want it to be any one baby. I just wanted it to be a sampler of flavors and influences from all over the world. There's a touch of this, a little smidgeon of that, a dash of something else, like when you're cooking." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 2, 2015, {{the trial}} began in U.S. District Court for Northern Florida. On {{the first day}} of testimony, the {{prosecution}} discussed Hovind and Hansen's [...] "dozens of filings", including several lis pendens, used to resist a court-ordered forfeiture due in part to legal advice Hovind took from his [...] "cellmate in a New Hampshire prison camp". The prosecution case included numerous emails, recorded phone calls, and court filings related to the forfeited properties. The prosecution presented audio of Hovind characterizing a lis pendens by asking his daughter, [...] "Have you ever taken a step into dog crap and it gets stuck on <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> it's really hard to get off?" [...] Hansen and Hovind took the stand in their own defense. According to journalist Kevin Robinson, during Hovind's testimony, he [...] "refused to give short answers" [...] and said that he believed his actions were lawful. On March 12, 2015, Hovind was found guilty on one count of criminal contempt, Hansen on two counts of criminal contempt, and jury was hung on the remaining charges.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Tom Ewing of FreakyTrigger {{ranked the}} song at number 42 in {{his list of}} the [...] "Top 100 Singles of the 90s", saying [...] "No band {{understood}} the possibilities for mass lunacy contained in the new music as well as did the KLF. [...] Read a copy of The Manual, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty’s pricelessly cynical dissection of the process needed to have a No.1 hit, {{and the depth of}} their understanding begins to show through. For novelty scam-mongers and pranksters, they knew the public well, particularly that strain in British pop listening which likes an occasional brush with the gigantic. The KLF did to house what Jim Steinman did to rock – they turned it into a thing of tottering grand opera absurdity, pushed the excitement in the music to hysteria, traded content for ever-huger gesture. The difference being that the KLF never lost track of what made the music special in the first place. Maybe because there’s less inherent ‘meaning’ in the KLF’s music, or maybe just because the ‘meaning’ in house music is less fragile, I don’t know, but no matter how vast “Last Train To Trancentral” sounds, it never loses its happy grip on <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> heart." ...|$|E
