[...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that.

500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>think.</b> I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable.

500|$|Warner {{publicly}} supported Richard Nixon {{during the}} 1960 presidential election {{and paid for}} full-page ads in The New York Times [...] "to proclaim why Nixon should be elected". [...] In the wake of Nixon's loss to John F. Kennedy, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Los Angeles Palladium {{in honor of the}} president-elect. [...] Several weeks later, Warner {{received a phone call from}} the new chief executive's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan's book, PT 109, a bestseller concerning John Kennedy's exploits during World War II. [...] "I don't think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon," [...] Warner said later. [...] "I would have voted for both of them if I could.

[...] On the April 22, 2010, episode of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart went into a ten-minute tirade about the alleged death threats, expressing disgust at the alleged hypocrisy of Revolution Muslim's speech while its members enjoy the American lifestyle and freedom of speech.|$|E

500|$|Streep portrayed Roberta Guaspari, {{a real-life}} New Yorker who found passion and {{enlightenment}} teaching violin to the inner-city kids of East Harlem, {{in the music}} drama Music of the Heart (1999). A departure from director Wes Craven's previous work in films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream series, Streep replaced singer Madonna, who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven. Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, five to six hours a day. Streep received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she {{may be the most}} versatile speaker in the movies. Here <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's – with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E
500|$|MacDermot {{followed}} Hair {{with three}} successive rock scores: Two Gentlemen of Verona (1971); Dude (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and Via Galactica (1972). [...] While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, Dude failed after just sixteenperformances, and Via Galactica flopped after a month. [...] According to Horn, {{these and other}} such [...] "failures {{may have been the}} result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard {{to the quality of the}} material presented." [...] Jesus Christ Superstar (1970) and Godspell (1971) were two religiously themed successes of the genre. [...] Grease (1971) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like The Wiz (1975) were heavily influenced by gospel, R and soul music. [...] By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. [...] Except for a few outposts of rock, like Dreamgirls (1981) and Little Shop of Horrors (1982), audience tastes in the 1980s turned to [...] with pop scores, like Les Misérables (1985) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986). [...] Some later rock musicals, such as Rent (1996) and Spring Awakening (2006), as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like We Will Rock You (2002) and Rock of Ages (2009), have found success. [...] But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair. [...] Critic Clive Barnes commented, [...] "There really weren't any rock musicals. [...] No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ... <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> of the musical Tommy, but it was never conceived as a Broadway show. ... And one can see why.

Canby echoed praise for Ermey, calling him [...] "the film's stunning surprise … he's so good—so obsessed—that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> he wrote his own lines". Canby also said D'Onofrio's performance should be noted with [...] "admiration", and he called Modine [...] "one of the best, most adaptable young film actors of his generation".
