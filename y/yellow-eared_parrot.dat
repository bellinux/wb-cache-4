The bearded helmetcrest hummingbird is {{endemic to}} the region. Noteworthy mammals include the {{mountain}} tapir, spectacled bear, northern pudú, oncilla, cougar and white-eared opossum.|$|E
50|$|From 1998, Fundación ProAves {{with the}} support of Fundacion Loro Parque, American Bird Conservancy and CORANTIOQUIA have {{undertaken}} an intensive conservation project across Colombia that has led to one of Latin America's most successful recoveries of an endangered bird. With protection and community support, the <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> population has climbed to over 1500 individuals by 2012.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{contains many}} endemic birds.Endangered birds include the black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori), black-breasted puffleg (Eriocnemis nigrivestis), chestnut-bellied flowerpiercer (Diglossa gloriosissima), Chocó vireo (Vireo masteri), colorful puffleg (Eriocnemis mirabilis), El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi), gold-ringed tanager (Bangsia aureocincta), pale-headed brush finch (Atlapetes pallidiceps), rufous-brown solitaire (Cichlopsis leucogenys), turquoise-throated puffleg (Eriocnemis godini), violet-throated metaltail (Metallura baroni) and <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> (Ognorhynchus icterotis).|$|E
50|$|It {{grows in}} large and dense populations along {{the central and}} eastern Andes of Colombia (rarely in the western Colombian Andes), with a disjunct {{distribution}} in the Andes of northern Peru. The elevational range of this species is between 2000 and 3100 m above sea level. It achieves a minimum reproductive age at 80 years. Wax palms provide habitats for many unique life forms, including endangered species such as the <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> (Ognorhynchus icterotis).|$|E
5000|$|... 297 birds {{species have}} been reported, of which 35 were {{directly}} associated with the forest.Migratory birds of the Thraupidae, Parulidae and Accipitridae families pass through the region.The western osprey (Pandion haliaetus) visits {{the north of the}} region in the winter.Parrots and hummingbirds migrate from higher regions.Long after it was thought to be extinct and the <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> (Ognorhynchus icterotis) was rediscovered in the region.The blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti) is no longer present.Endangered birds include the recurve-billed bushbird (Clytoctantes alixii).|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{relatively}} large, long-tailed parrot with an average length of 42 cm and a weight of about 285 g. It is overall green, with the underparts being paler, more lime green than the upperparts. The heavy beak and a ring of bare skin around the eyes are black. The origin of the common epithet [...] "yellow-eared" [...] is caused for the yellow patch of feathers that extends from the forehead down to its cheeks and ear-coverts. The <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> mates for life. Its main source of food are {{the fruits of the}} wax palm.|$|E
50|$|Of 429 {{bird species}} {{recorded}} in the Serranía de Perijá, 76% are also {{recorded in the}} Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, with about the same percentage of species also found on the eastern slopes.The northeastern and southeastern slopes have similar bird populations.The Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) is endangered.Other endangered birds include chestnut-bellied hummingbird (Amazilia castaneiventris), Táchira antpitta (Grallaria chthonia), Cundinamarca antpitta (Grallaria kaestneri), Colombian mountain grackle (Macroagelaius subalaris), Perijá metaltail (Metallura iracunda), gorgeted wood quail (Odontophorus strophium), <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> (Ognorhynchus icterotis), helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi), Antioquia bristle tyrant (Phylloscartes lanyoni), Bogotá rail (Rallus semiplumbeus), Perijá thistletail (Asthenes perijana), black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori) and Niceforo's wren (Thryophilus nicefori).|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> nests {{and lives}} among wax palms {{in a few}} areas of Western and Central Cordillera of Colombia, where it inhabits cloud forests about 1800-3000 meters above sea level. It nests in the hollow trunks of the palms, usually 25-30 meters over the floor level. It also {{occurred}} very locally in northern Ecuador where wax palm grows. Their numbers had been greatly reduced, and only 81 individuals were recorded in the Colombian census of 1999. Their populations have been impacted by hunting and habitat destruction, particularly the harvesting of wax palm, which was traditionally cut down and used each year on Palm Sunday. There has been no confirmed records of this parrot from Ecuador since the mid-90s.|$|E
50|$|There {{are over}} 500 bird species.This {{ecoregion}} contains a 19000 km2 Endemic Bird Area {{as defined by}} BirdLife International.There are 12 restricted-range species, of which four are found only in the region.These include the Cauca guan (Penelope perspicax), restricted to a few remnants of humid forest at elevations from 1200 to 2200 m {{on both sides of}} the valley.Other restricted-range or endangered bird species include the brown-banded antpitta (Grallaria milleri), moustached antpitta (Grallaria alleni), multicoloured tanager (Chlorochrysa nitidissima) and golden-plumed parakeet (Leptosittaca branickii).The golden-plumed parakeet and quetzals of Pharomachrus genus migrate regionally along the Andes slopes.Endangered birds include the black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori), Cauca guan (Penelope perspicax), chestnut-bellied flowerpiercer (Diglossa gloriosissima), gold-ringed tanager (Bangsia aureocincta) and <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> (Ognorhynchus icterotis).|$|E
50|$|The Tropical Andes {{is said to}} be {{the most}} diverse of the world's {{scientific}} hotspots of diversity. The journal Nature contained an article by Norman Myers comparing the twenty-five hotspots with land and species in 2000. At the time the Tropical Andes was recorded to have 45,000 plant species with the next closest hotspots recorded to have 25,000 plant species. Actually a sixth of all plant species can reside in the Tropical Andes. Tropical Andes also has the most endemic plant species at 20,000 with the next hotspot contains 15,000. Tropical Andes does have a lot of land compared to other hotspots, but is not the largest. The large land area shows the Tropical Andes can provide for biodiversity with diverse landscape. Many endemic plant and animal species are currently threatened in the Tropical Andes. An example of a threatened plant species is the Andean bromelilad. Andean bromelilad is an endemic plant that takes up to 100 years to mature and a common diet for species that forage. Other plants species include many crops such as tobacco and potatoes. Some endemic animals include the Andean condor that almost became extinct from hunting. Thanks to a conservation reintroduction program, their numbers are growing. Another threatened endemic bird in the Tropical Andes is the <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot.</b> One threat this species faces is the loss of the vulnerable wax palm. The <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> uses the wax palm for nesting and roosting. However, humans especially in Colombia are removing the vulnerable wax palm from the wild for Palm Sunday. Some conservation programs are helping the situation to educate churches to use other resources besides the vulnerable wax palm. The yellow tailed monkey is another endemic animal being endangered. They are one of the rarest mammals with a recorded population of 250 found in cloud forests of Peru. They are threatened by humans causing habitat loss and fragmentation of their habitat. Their slow maturity and low population densities do not help. Programs have tried to relocate to secondary forests, but attempts have failed. Many species reside in the Tropical Andes but threatened severely.|$|E
5000|$|Colombia holds 18% of the world’s bird species. The Andes {{alone is}} one of the most diverse areas in the world. [...] However, bird species {{specifically}} in the San Lucas Andean mountain ranges are endangered. The absence of government protection from armed conflict in San Lucas has facilitated the cultivation of coca crops and deforestation, which has resulted in local biodiversity loss. In some areas in the Western Andes concentrations of endemic threatened birds reached 46 species in certain areas. Neotropical birds especially from higher elevations are more prone to extinction. A study done in a 3000 ha reserve in Los Andes that conserves an extensive amount of endemic and small ranged bird species found 227 species in the region nine that pronounced threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature four of these are endemic species to Colombia: the Munchique Wood-wren, the Chestnut-bellied Flowerpiercer, the <b>Yellow-eared</b> <b>Parrot,</b> the Magdalena Tapaculo, the Bicoloured Antvireo, the Tanager Finch, the Ruddy Pigeon, the White-capped Tanager, and Red-bellied Grackle.|$|E
50|$|Paul Salaman {{was born}} in Australia in 1971 where he started birding {{at the age of}} six, before moving to the UK. In 1979, Paul met David Attenborough and became enthused by {{conservation}} and natural history. From age 14 Paul managed a local nature reserve in London and as an undergraduate in 1991, commenced a series of biodiversity expeditions across Colombia, which culminated in a series of conservation assessments and actions. In 1991, he discovered a distinctive new species of bird (vireo) to science and sold the scientific name for $75,000 as an innovative species sponsoring initiative for seeking conservation funds. In 1992, Paul established a nature reserve in southwest Colombia and commenced Project Ognorhynchus to locate and protect the Critically Endangered <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>parrot</b> with Fundacion ProAves, where he is an elected advisory board member. Graduated in 2001 with a D.Phil from the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at the University of Oxford studying threatened bird populations in southwest Colombia. A post-doc at the Natural History Museum from 2002 established Project BioMap, before coordinating biodiversity science for Conservation International across the Tropical Andes Biodiversity Hotspot. From 2005-2008, Paul was Director of International Programs at American Bird Conservancy.|$|E
