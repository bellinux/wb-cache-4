On March 24 two inches of snow fell after the first seeding that was sown on the surface without covering of any kind.

50|$|Stipa avenacea {{can be used}} as a cover crop, {{in which}} they are grown after a crop has been cut so that soil can be replenished, and is thus plowed back into the garden rather than being harvested. It is {{commonly}} said that <b>oat</b> <b>grass</b> is a good choice to use as a cover crop because when they die during the winter time, the residue will be much easier to handle when working with the soil, while preparing for planting season.|$|R
