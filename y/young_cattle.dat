2500|$|In {{laboratory}} studies, <b>young</b> <b>cattle</b> {{are able}} to memorize the locations of several food sources and retain this memory for at least 8hours, although this declined after 12hours. [...] Fifteen-month-old heifers learn more quickly than adult cows which have had either one or two calvings, but their longer-term memory is less stable. [...] Mature cattle perform well in spatial learning tasks {{and have a good}} long-term memory in these tests. [...] Cattle tested in a radial arm maze {{are able to}} remember the locations of high-quality food for at least 30 days. [...] Although they initially learn to avoid low-quality food, this memory diminishes over the same duration. [...] Under less artificial testing conditions, <b>young</b> <b>cattle</b> showed they were able to remember the location of feed for at least 48 days. [...] Cattle can make an association between a visual stimulus and food within 1 day – memory of this association can be retained for 1 year, despite a slight decay.|$|E

Fifteen carcasses were selected from five populations (fed beef cows, non-fed beef cows, fed dairy cows, non-fed dairy cows, and Select grade beef) and nine muscles per carcass were characterized.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} histamine on the contractile elements of the respiratory tract in neonatal calves and <b>young</b> adult <b>cattle.</b> SAMPLE POPULATION: Samples of trachealis muscle, bronchi, and intrapulmonary arteries and veins dissected from the respiratory tracts of healthy bovids (2 to 8 days and 16 to 20 months old). PROCEDURE: Histamine cumulative concentration-effect curves (10 (- 6) to 10 (- 3) M) were constructed in duplicate smooth muscle samples mounted in organ baths. Contractile responses to histamine were compared with reference contractions elicited by methacholine (10 (- 5) M) for airways or KCl (127 mM) for vessels. RESULTS: In <b>young</b> adult <b>cattle,</b> trachealis muscle had a substantial contractile response to histamine (84 % of methacholine-induced contraction), whereas bronchi reacted slightly (15 and 20 % for large and small bronchi, respectively). Although contractile responses to KCl were comparable in arteries and veins, histamine-induced contractions were greater for intrapulmonary veins than for arteries (202 vs 48 % of KCl-induced contraction). In neonatal calves, histamine-induced contraction of veins also exceeded that of arteries (230 vs 54 % of KCl-induced contraction); however, unlike in <b>young</b> adult <b>cattle,</b> histamine produced notable contraction of large and small bronchi (48 and 60 % of methacholine-induced contraction, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Compared with intrapulmonary arteries, intrapulmonary veins have greater contractile responses to histamine in neonatal and <b>young</b> adult <b>cattle.</b> Data suggest loss of histamine responsiveness in bronchial smooth muscle as neonatal calves grow to young adults. Venodilation may be useful in treatment of lung edema in cattle. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{to predict}} numbers of healthy oocytes in the ovaries {{of young adults}} could have {{important}} diagnostic relevance in family planning and animal agriculture. We have observed that peak antral follicle count (AFC) determined by serial ovarian ultrasonography during follicular waves is very highly reproducible within individual <b>young</b> adult <b>cattle,</b> despite 7 -fold variation among animals. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that AFC is positively associated {{with the number of}} morphologically healthy oocytes and follicles in ovaries and with serum concentrations of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an indirect marker for number of healthy follicles and oocytes in ovaries. In the present study, age-matched <b>young</b> adult <b>cattle</b> (12 - 18 mo old) were subjected to serial ultrasonography to identify animals with a consistently high (≥ 25 follicles that were ≥ 3 mm in diameter) or low (≤ 15 follicles) AFC during follicular waves. Differences in serum AMH concentrations, ovary weight, and number of morphologically healthy and atretic follicles and oocytes were determined. The phenotypic classifications of cattle based on AFC during follicular waves or AMH concentrations both predict reliably the relative number of morphologically healthy follicles and oocytes in ovaries of age-matched <b>young</b> adult <b>cattle...</b>|$|R

Following the identification of a BSE-infected U.S. dairy cow in December 2003, FSIS issued new regulations expanding the definition of prohibited CNS tissue to include additional cattle parts. Furthermore, all AMR-processed product from cattle more than 30 months old now is prohibited from being used for food, and such product from <b>younger</b> <b>cattle</b> and from otherlivestock species also is prohibited if it contains CNS material.|$|R

Data was obtained from 204, 072 carcasses at a Western Australian processor between 2002 and 2008. Binomial data of pH u compliance was analysed using a logit model in a Bayesian framework. Increasing eye muscle area from 40 to 80 cm 2, increased pH u compliance by around 14 % (P < 0. 001) in carcasses less than 350 kg. As carcass weight increased from 150 kg to 220 kg, compliance increased by 13 % (P < 0. 001) and <b>younger</b> <b>cattle</b> with lower ossification were also 7 % more compliant (P < 0. 001).
