500|$|The album's {{characters}} {{include the}} [...] "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the [...] "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the [...] "Sheep", {{who represent the}} exploited. Croskery described the [...] "Sheep" [...] as being in a [...] "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a false consciousness. The [...] "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone {{with no one to}} trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse {{as an example of a}} [...] "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: [...] "You know that I care what happens to <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that you care for me too." [...] However, he also acknowledges that the [...] "Pigs" [...] are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a [...] "Dog" [...] who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.|$|E

60|$|But, as <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the last sentence, was not the truth of the matter at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, {{handsome}} enough," [...] {{answers the}} old House; [...] "and handsomer still {{it must have}} been before <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it, before mean care had furrowed it with fretful lines." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Patience, do 'ee come!" [...] pleaded poor Andrew, and {{the tears}} even sprang to his eyes. [...] "I'd be very good to <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> thou would'st be to my poor babes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} see <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that your mother would be out. It is not often that I do a thing in secret, even though it be to see the girl that I love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not intentionally, mamma; I {{have never}} meant to keep {{anything}} secret from <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you have known what I felt about Charley.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And they won, you said? The world's judgment! I {{have told}} <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> They won {{as you are}} winning, here in your hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Dick,' said my aunt, 'you {{have heard}} me mention David Copperfield? Now don't {{pretend not to}} have a memory, because <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet I must allay your joy," [...] {{said the}} old glover, [...] "though, Heaven <b>knows,</b> <b>I</b> share it. Poor Oliver Proudfute, the inoffensive fool that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> so well, has been found this morning dead in the streets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a tale}} I hear," [...] said Oona, {{though her}} voice was gentler than before. [...] "Kamo-tah is dead and cannot speak for <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> only what <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>know</b> <b>thee</b> of my own eyes for no coward." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The cathedral's west window by Carl Johannes Edwards. The {{uppermost}} {{window is}} the Benedicite window. The pink neon sign by Tracey Emin reads [...] "I felt <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> loved me“ <b>and</b> was installed 2008 when Liverpool became European Capital of Culture.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Mr. Crawshay," [...] Brightman began, [...] "who has charge {{from the}} Government point of view, {{of the little}} matter <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I know it vexes <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it's silly; {{but still}} I feel sure that Mr. Grayson will take it. You don't mind that, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Pris, that's just lovely of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it {{will work}} wonders. Smile and nod away, dear, {{and try to do}} your part, as I'm trying to do mine." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Only <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> (live version)" [...] (Dave Mason) - 4:10 ...|$|R
5000|$|Lisa: [...] "In Beverly Hills it's who <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> everyone." ...|$|R
6000|$|HENRY. Hell take thy bishop then, and my kingship too! Come, come, <b>I</b> love <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> thee, A doter {{on white}} pheasant-flesh at feasts, A sauce-deviser for thy days of fish, A dish-designer, and most amorous Of good old red sound liberal Gascon wine: Will not thy body rebel, man, if thou flatter it? ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucy Davidson {{looked at}} him steadily. “What I felt about it doesn’t concern anybody but myself. I told you they were fools, Tony. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> who it was that {{circumstances}} really pointed to.” ...|$|E
60|$|An equally curious {{thing is}} that {{whenever}} I pass the hotel, which I do constantly, I see the same man. Scientists call that phenomenon an obsession of the visual nerve. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> better.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well," [...] the other said, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> half a dozen {{cases in which the}} niggers have {{attacked}} a ship, and in every case beachcombers were killed too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My child," [...] he said, [...] "we {{have carried}} it too far. It {{was more than}} {{we ought to have}} {{required}} of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it. <b>I</b> had made up my mind, and told my nephew that the first time you really asked I should tell the whole truth, and trust to your discretion, while of course he wished for nothing more." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{fearful that}} you felt hurt at my not {{mentioning}} to you the proposed [...] "Watchman", and from my not requesting you to attend the meeting. My dear friend, my reasons were these. All who met were expected to become subscribers to a fund; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there would be enough without <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>and</b> felt, how much money had been drawn from you lately.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} in a low voice, [...] "that's the difference between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> myself better than <b>you</b> <b>know</b> yourself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> better." [...] She smiled again. [...] "Unless we could have it all back again, I shouldn't want any of it. You do not love me--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely you {{can trust}} me," [...] the woman said. [...] "I would lay down my life for <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> Adolphe would do so too when he knows {{what you have done}} for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I know <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> him. I {{am quite}} {{prepared}} {{to hear that}} you are outwitted. Indeed, to judge from your appearance {{there can be no}} doubt about it. Remember I warned you." ...|$|E
60|$|Ha, that's touched you up, has it? You think I don't {{know what}} sort of a feller you are. I can just about see through two of <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{a good deal more}} about you than you think.|$|E
6000|$|The {{mention of}} money cast a chill upon their talk; and Mrs. Lander said gloomily, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> as <b>I</b> ca'e {{so much for}} that will Mr. Milray made for me, after all. I did want to say ten {{thousand}} apiece for Mr. Landa's relations; but I hated to befo'e him; I'd told the whole kit of 'em so much about <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what they would think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--what do {{you think}} of his condition;--of his happiness, his health, his {{capacity}} of endurance? Will he be able to go on much longer? Now, my dear Duke, don't stare at me like that. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> that <b>you</b> haven't spoken a word to me for the last two months. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> how many things there are of which we are both thinking in common. You haven't quarrelled with Plantagenet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "You mustn't, Willis! You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> can't manage without <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> can't {{take the}} man {{out and get}} him drunk. I couldn't. I shouldn't feel that it was right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} it back," [...] he said. [...] "I have heard of <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{that you have no}} love for The Sheik, your father. Neither have I. I will not betray you. Let me see the picture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Utterly {{out of the}} question," [...] Jesson pronounced. [...] "Kroten is the {{one place}} that must be left in my hands. I {{know more about the}} getting there than any of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the tricks of {{changing}} my identity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Uncle Luke, dad's a dear, {{especially}} after dinner, but <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> him. Giving me a present is one thing, doing business {{for me is}} another. He'd unload on me. He'd {{never be able to}} resist the temptation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never <b>knew</b> him do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't {{believe he}} ever thought, {{anything}} that was untrue, or unkind, or ungenerous," [...] says the Colonel. [...] "If any one has belied my boy to <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> who his enemy has been----" ...|$|R
60|$|Peter {{nodded as}} if he quite agreed. Though, as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> Peter himself does very little except fill his own big stomach.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008 a work {{entitled}} [...] "For You" [...] by Tracey Emin {{was installed}} at {{the west end of}} cathedral the below the Benedicite window. The pink neon sign reads [...] "I felt <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> loved me", <b>and</b> was installed when Liverpool became European Capital of Culture. The work was originally intended to be a temporary installation for one month as part of the Capital of Culture programme, but is now a permanent feature.|$|R
