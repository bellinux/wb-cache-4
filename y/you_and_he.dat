500|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 January 1386, Dame Nicole de Carrouges {{departed}} her chateau at Capomesnil for the neighbouring town of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives where she had legal business to attend to. Although the journey was only a short one, she apparently took {{some or all of}} the household servants with her, leaving her daughter-in-law unattended during the day. Marguerite's testimony then alleged that a man-at-arms named Adam Louvel knocked on the chateau door, which Marguerite opened herself in the absence of servants. According to Marguerite, Louvel then made enquiries about a loan he owed Jean de Carrouges before suddenly announcing that Jacques Le Gris was outside the door and insisted on seeing her. At her refusal, Louvel exclaimed that [...] "he loves you passionately, he will do anything for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> greatly desires to see you". Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris then forced his way into the house and propositioned her, offering money if she would remain silent of their affair. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris then violently raped her with the aid of Louvel and threatened her not to tell anyone what had occurred on pain of death.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E

The Bullets' general manager, John Nash, who was disappointed that Jason Kidd was no longer available at the fifth pick of the draft, told Jerry Bembry of The Baltimore Sun that Howard was [...] "as fundamentally sound as any player in the draft" [...] and that he [...] " [...] a discipline about his game and [...] a high level of skill and technique". Bembry said, [...] "Not only can Howard post up, he passes effectively and is able to hit a jumper up to 17 feet", adding that he also was [...] "an excellent position defender". [...] Later Bembry noted that he was a power forward who was able to play center, adding that at Michigan he was [...] "most effective playing {{with his back to the}} basket" [...] but could also pass effectively and hit medium-range jumpers. The Bullets' head coach, Jim Lynam, described Howard as a [...] "complete player" [...] and noted, [...] "e can defend <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> can score over you".

Didn’t he die for me?” John Reed, sitting next to Young responded, “Cheer up Art, Jesus died for you." [...] As before, the jury returned unable to come to a unanimous decision (though without threats of violence).|$|E

Carimi played well against top competition and his feet are quick enough to play left tackle." [...] CBS Sports lauded [...] "his prototypical size" [...] and [...] "excellent athleticism". As to his pass blocking, it noted that he has [...] "the elite agility and nimble feet to protect the quarterback's blindside. Very difficult to turn the corner against because of his lateral movement and solid footwork. Also protects the inside lane well. Delivers a strong hand punch capable of knocking back an opponent .... Uses his length to block his man with one hand and knock an edge blitzer off his path with the other." [...] With regard to his run blocking, it said he is [...] "known as an athletic pass protector, but is a strong blocker". While he exclusively played left tackle in college, he was projected by some as a left tackle and by others as a right tackle.|$|E
2500|$|The Tribunal {{heard from}} retired Garda Chief Superintendent Tom Curran, who {{was based in}} Monaghan {{at the time of}} the killings. He stated that in 1988 an {{informer}} told him of an IRA death threat against Buchanan. The man had allegedly said: [...] "There's a fella crossing the border there to see <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is going to be shot." [...] Curran — who had met Buchanan many times and regarded him as a friend — was worried and duly informed Eugene Crowley, the assistant commissioner of crime and security at Garda headquarters in Dublin, about the threat. Curran never told Buchanan about the threat as he didn't want Buchanan to think that the Garda Síochána was trying to stop him coming to the Republic. In 1987, Buchanan had called to Curran's office to discuss RUC concerns about the Garda detective sergeant at Dundalk station who was [...] "unnecessarily associating" [...] with the IRA. Buchanan asked Curran to convey his message to Garda headquarters, which he did in person. Assistant Commissioner Crowley (now deceased) did not, however, seem interested in what Curran had to say about the possible collusion. This detective sergeant was the same man whom Breen had discussed with Sgt Alan Mains before setting out for Dundalk. This man was also on first name terms with the then RUC Chief Constable Sir John Hermon. Breen's widow June maintained that many times before the ambush, Breen had given her instructions that in the event of his death Hermon was not to be allowed to attend his funeral.|$|E

2500|$|This season {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of red kryptonite. In the fourth episode of the second season, titled [...] "Red", Clark buys a high school ring that contains a red kryptonite gem. The effects of the kryptonite were meant {{to act as a}} metaphor for drugs. Loeb was given the task of writing [...] "Red" [...] by Gough and Millar, {{and one of the things}} he decided on was that the ultimate pay off with the kryptonite would be Clark finally kissing Lana. As Tom Welling describes it, [...] "With 'Red Clark' he's completely aware of the consequences of his actions at the time, but he doesn't care! He doesn't care what happens to <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> certainly doesn't care what happens to himself, because he probably realizes that nothing can happen to him. It's always fun to be that way, even in real life, because we're not allowed to be that way all too often." [...] One of the concerns for the episode was whether the audience would embrace the idea of a [...] "bad Clark", as Ken Biller knew that Clark would have to be [...] "the villain of the story". Fortunately, audiences did embrace the idea and after the good ratings [...] "Red" [...] received, the WB requested more episodes with red kryptonite. Unfortunately, Gough and the crew did not like using it because of the idea of [...] "Clark [...] bad", but the team asked themselves, [...] "what if a friend slips something in your drink and you don’t know it?" [...] This became the basis in [...] "Rush", where Pete slips a shard of red kryptonite into Clark's pocket; it also gave the network what they wanted, but in the form of a single act instead of the entire episode. This element would show up again in the season finale, when Clark slips on another red kryptonite ring before riding out of Smallville on a motorcycle. According to Ken Biller, the moment Clark goes searching for the kryptonite is the payoff they had wanted with that piece of Superman mythology. The show had established that red kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions, and in the season finale, Clark is to the point that he is willing to [...] "go 'on drugs' to solve his own pain and [...] guilt about what he's done".|$|E
