25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001, Feist self-produced seven songs at home which she called The Red Demos, which have never been {{released}} commercially. She spent {{more than two years}} touring throughout Europe with Gonzales. In that same year she joined a group of old friends in forming a new version of Toronto indie rock group Broken Social Scene, adding vocals to many tracks after being forbidden to play guitar by de facto bandleader Kevin Drew. She subsequently recorded <b>You</b> <b>Forgot</b> It in People with the band. While on tour in Europe with Gonzales, they began recording new versions of her home recorded Red Demos, which would later become her major label debut Let It Die. Let It Die featured both original compositions and covers, and Feist has been noted both as a songwriter and as an innovative interpreter of other artists' songs.|$|E
25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If <b>you</b> <b>forgot</b> about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|Actor Diedrich Bader guest {{starred in}} the episode as the sheriff. The Simpsons {{producer}} Ian Maxtone-Graham directed Bader during his recording session, telling the guest star to do a Southern accent. The episode also features guest appearances from talk show host Charlie Rose and film producer Robert Evans as themselves. Evans and Rose appear in a scene {{at the beginning of}} the episode, when Homer stays up late and watches television because of his fear that he might die in his sleep. Rose is seen interviewing Evans on the television, and as they are talking about Evan's film Love Story, Rose says: [...] "And the critics loved it, too. I remember Vincent Canby said, [...] 'I'm going to kill you, Homer. You are so dead.'" [...] The last part is imagined by Homer, who has become incredibly sleepy. Later in the interview, when talking about his unsuccessful film The Two Jakes, Evans says: [...] "I said to myself, 'Evans, <b>you</b> <b>forgot</b> Hollywood Rule No. 1: [...] Kill Homer Simpson.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Higgins of The Independent {{deemed the}} episode [...] "a {{technical}} triumph", praising the [...] "smooth, almost flawless" [...] and [...] "fluent" [...] production. Shane Donaghey of The Belfast Telegraph {{also called the}} episode a [...] "triumph", opining {{that it could not}} possibly have lived up to the hype surrounding the storyline, but that transmitting live gave EastEnders [...] "an energy it normally lacks, with great violence, excellent direction". He summarised: [...] "the story gripped so well <b>you</b> <b>forgot</b> to look for the cock-ups, before a genuinely shocking denouement that you never saw coming amid all of the hype." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable", calling the episode [...] "a triumph of logistics over logic". However, Stacey wrote that aside from the [...] "damp-squib" [...] ending, [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] was [...] "surprisingly enjoyable [...] even for a committed 'Endersphobe like self." [...] She felt that transmitting live [...] "added a tangible layer of tension" [...] to proceedings, lamenting: [...] "If only EastEnders was this exciting all the time." [...] The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith similarly felt that transmitting live made for [...] "tension, not clarity", commenting that bookmakers would be [...] "absolutely delighted" [...] with the outcome, but that viewers would be [...] "incredulous". [...] Cate Devine of The Herald was similarly critical, describing the episode as [...] "30 minutes of cheesy dramatic counterpoint", and highlighting the [...] "ropey lighting and poor sound effects." ...|$|E
