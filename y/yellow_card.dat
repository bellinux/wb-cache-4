5|$|Milan kicked-off {{the second}} half. Two {{minutes into the}} half, Liverpool had the first attack but Nesta tackled Gerrard before he could reach Kuyt's pass. Jankulovski {{received}} a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> in the 54th minute when he brought Pennant down. Immediately afterwards, Milan had an attack. Pirlo received the ball from a header by Clarence Seedorf, Pirlo played a high pass to Kaká who was ruled to be offside by the assistant referee, despite being behind the defence when the ball was played. Milan had another attack straight after the offside, but Liverpool defender Daniel Agger tackled Inzaghi before he could shoot. Liverpool had their first <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> in the 59th minute when Javier Mascherano received one for bringing down Pirlo. After the <b>yellow</b> <b>card,</b> Liverpool decided to replace Boudewijn Zenden with Harry Kewell. Liverpool's best goalscoring chance of the match occurred minutes later. Gerrard capitalised on an error by Gattuso to be one-on-one with Dida, but his shot did not possess enough power to beat the Milan goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 World Cup, Lokvenc {{replaced}} the injured Jan Koller {{as a substitute}} in the first group match, against the USA. He didn't score but received a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> as his nation won 3–0. He started the second group match, against Ghana, {{in the absence of}} fellow strikers Koller and Baroš due to injury. He received another <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> in the match, which Ghana won 2–0. Due to having received two yellow cards, he was suspended for his country's final group match, against Italy. The Czech Republic lost to Italy and therefore failed to progress to the next stage of the competition. Lokvenc announced his retirement from international football in September 2006, becoming the third player from the World Cup team to retire after Karel Poborský and Pavel Nedvěd. He finished his international career with figures of 14 goals in 74 matches.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{setting up}} Vieri's goal in Italy's second round defeat to co-hosts South Korea from a corner, his {{performance}} {{was once again}} criticised, in particular as he was sent off in extra time after being handed a controversial second <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> by referee Byron Moreno for simulation.|$|E
5|$|In the 33rd minute, a Chelsea free-kick, awarded after Ramires {{was brought}} down by Enrique, but it was cleared by the Liverpool defence.

The first <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> of the match was shown to Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel in the 36th minute, after a mistimed tackle on Gerrard. A cross from midfielder Stewart Downing was headed out for a Liverpool corner in the 40th minute, but the {{subsequent}} corner is cleared by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech.

Etherington {{advanced}} down the right hand side of the pitch and passed to Harewood, whose shot was saved by Reina, who also saved a subsequent shot from Benayoun. Liverpool had a chance immediately afterwards as Cissé passed to Alonso, but his shot was blocked and {{went out for a}} corner. A minute later, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match, as the injured Harry Kewell was replaced by Fernando Morientes. Liverpool equalised in the 54th minute, when Gerrard volleyed home a knock-down header from Crouch. The first <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> of the match went to Ashton after he fouled Finnan in the 60th minute. Three minutes later, Carragher also received a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> for a foul on Ashton.|$|E
5|$|Nedvěd was {{instrumental}} in the Euro 2004 group stage match against the Netherlands. Two goals down after 19 minutes, he gave a man of the match performance as the Czechs rebounded to win 3–2. Nine players (including Nedvěd) were rested for the group match against Germany, with the Czechs already qualified for the knockout stage. He received a <b>yellow</b> <b>card,</b> upheld on appeal, in the quarter-final match against Denmark. This meant Nedvěd would miss the final if he received another <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> in the semi-final against Greece. However, Greece defeated the Czechs and Nedvěd was substituted after a knee injury. After their exit from the tournament, Nedvěd announced his retirement from the national team; he was named to the Team of the Tournament alongside countrymen Petr Čech and Milan Baroš.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1990, England played West Germany in a World Cup semi-final {{match at}} Juventus's Stadio delle Alpi in Turin. Gascoigne, having already {{received}} a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> during England's 1–0 victory over Belgium {{in the second}} round, was booked for a foul on Thomas Berthold, which meant {{that he would be}} suspended for the final if England won the match. Television cameras showed that he had tears in his eyes following the <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> and made Gascoigne a highly popular figure with the sympathetic British public. The match culminated in a penalty shoot-out, which the Germans won after Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle missed their penalties.|$|E

However, he contributed defensively, clearing a goal-bound shot from Christian Ziege off the line.|$|E
5|$|A {{minute later}} Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was shown a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> for a foul on García. The {{resulting}} free-kick found Steven Gerrard, but {{he fell to}} the ground after a challenge from Claude Makélélé. The referee Steve Bennett ignored Liverpool claims for a penalty and Chelsea went straight on the attack, but an effort by Drogba went wide of the Liverpool goal. Chelsea continued to attack in an effort to score an equalising goal, but attempts by Duff and Joe Cole failed to find the target. Liverpool defender Djimi Traoré was the third player to be shown a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> for a foul on Ferreira in the 35th minute. However, minutes later he made an important tackle as Duff beat the Liverpool offside trap, but a poor touch outside of the Liverpool penalty area allowed Traoré to dispossess him. As half-time approached Liverpool were content to remain in their own half and allow Chelsea to attack them, but any attack was dealt with by the Liverpool defence.|$|E

Liverpool player Gary McAllister also received a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> after he confronted the Alavés player over his challenge. Alavés first opportunity to score was in the 12th minute. They were awarded a free-kick {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool penalty area following a challenge by Stéphane Henchoz. Oscar Téllez curled a shot towards Liverpool's goal, however, Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld pushed the ball away from goal.

5|$|After half-time, Leicester {{increased}} their lead with a converted try from Geordan Murphy after 45 minutes {{and two more}} penalties from Dupuy extended Leicester's lead further to 26–12 going into the last 20 minutes. Flood left the field due to an injury {{and was replaced by}} Aaron Mauger. Leicester then had two players sent to the sin bin in quick succession. First, Craig Newby was shown a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> on 62 minutes for killing the ball during a Cardiff attack, and then Geordan Murphy was shown a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> on 68 minutes for what was adjudged to be a deliberate knock-on during another Cardiff attack. Leicester did not concede during Newby's absence, but shortly after his return and with Murphy still off the pitch in the sin bin, Cardiff's Jamie Roberts scored a try with Ben Blair successfully kicking the conversion from within five metres of the touchline. At the restart, Cardiff gathered the ball and Roberts made a break from within 22 metres of Cardiff's own goal line before passing to Tom James, who ran 60 metres to score a try in almost exactly the same place as Roberts. Blair again kicked the conversion from the touchline to tie the scores at 26–26 with three minutes remaining. With no further scores, the match went into extra time.|$|E
5|$|Challinor's first sending off for Cambridge {{came after}} {{receiving}} a second <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> during a 5–0 home defeat to Crawley Town in the FA Trophy second round on 14 January 2009.

25|$|The Dutch {{received}} nine <b>yellow</b> <b>cards,</b> {{compared with}} five <b>yellow</b> <b>cards</b> issued to Spain.

After the match some Dutch players, such as Robben, Stekelenburg, Robin van Persie, Dirk Kuyt and Wesley Sneijder, accused Webb of favouring the Spaniards, while in Switzerland's earlier defeat of Spain, Spain supporters accused Webb of favouring Switzerland. Other critics noted poor and missed calls on both teams. By the end of the tournament, the Dutch team had earned 22 <b>yellow</b> <b>cards</b> in its seven games, while Spain had earned only eight (the lowest of the four semi-finalists, with Germany and Uruguay having earned 13 each). Spain was awarded FIFA's Fair Play award after the final.|$|R
