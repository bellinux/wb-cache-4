Wilmore, a former writer on the television comedy The PJ's, had been asked by Scully to participate in a practical joke, in which he would play the mayor of East St. Louis and confront Selman about his controversial statement. According to Selman, Wilmore gave an [...] "Oscar-worthy performance". [...] "I was terrified", he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, [...] " [...] a twenty-minute discussion in which [...] said that [...] children were teased at school , and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air..." [...] According to Wilmore, Selman immediately blamed the other writers. Said Selman, [...] "Well, everyone participates, you know [...] Have <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the word 'collaboration'?" [...] Selman realized the joke when he turned around and saw [...] "all the other writers laughing". [...] "I was so relieved", he said, [...] "I was soaked with sweat [...] I had betrayed my fellow writers, tried to get them in trouble, and they all knew me for the turn-coat that I was." ...|$|E

In 2010, Billington's decision to open new DCMA loopholes resulted in his being described as [...] "the most important person <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of,</b> having headed the library since well before the Web was spun or the DMCA was even a glint in the Recording Industry Association of America's eye [...] [...] [...] It was probably Billington's unassailable reputation for integrity and probity that won the LOC this power under the DMCA.|$|E

2500|$|Barlow {{has written}} {{extensively}} for Wired magazine, as well as The New York Times, Nerve, and Communications of the ACM. In his writings, he explained the wonder of the Internet. The Internet to him {{is more than a}} computer network. It is a place that he called an [...] "electronic frontier." [...] "He frequently wrote in language that echoed Henry Morton Stanley's African diary. ‘Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no end to its dimensions. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate that expands with development. Imagine a place where trespassers leave no footprints, where goods can be stolen infinite number of times and yet remain in the possession of their original owners, where business <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> can own the history of your personal affairs.’" [...] He wanted to encourage and provoke youngsters to explore the cyberspace through his writing.|$|E
