Smith officially began work on May 7, 2007, as content editor, {{providing}} fans and the Bungie readership with information about Bungie's game and staff. Smith believed that there was a special opportunity for game developers, [...] "for someone to come in and tell the stories that people want to know [...] Right now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> bridges between developer and reader: Developer to PR, to journalist to reader. [...] could get rid of those middle two bridges." ...|$|E

[...] Apart from the album playings, Springsteen kept setlists flexible during the third leg; sign requests continued, as in Springsteen's words they allowed [...] "the fans to have input into the show in a way that just pumps the blood into everything and enlivens the evening." [...] Born to Run remained the standard full album choice {{for the rest of the}} tour, but the two shows at New York's Madison Square Garden saw The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle and The River, with the latter's 20-song length dominating the setlist. [...] Springsteen felt The River show succeeded, saying [...] "I sequenced [...] to feel like a live show, so <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> fast songs and a couple of ballads. It played real well when we went to play it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then {{he pulled out the}} pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E

60|$|Now he has {{accompanied}} {{this account}} with another very curious one. For {{when you come}} to look into the particulars of it, you will find there are three bonds declared to be the Company's bonds, and which refer to the former transactions, namely, the money for which he had taken the bonds; but {{when you come to}} look at the numbers of them, you will find that one of the three bonds which he had taken as his own disappears, and another bond, of another date, and for a much larger sum, is substituted in its place, of which he had never mentioned anything whatever. So that, taking his first account, that two thirds is his own money, then that it is all his own, in the third that it is all the Company's money, by a fourth account, given in a paper describing the three bonds, you will find that there is one lac which he does not account for, but substitutes in its place a bond before taken as his own. He sinks and suppresses one bond, he gives two bonds to the Company, and to supply the want of the third, which he suppresses, he brings forward a bond for another sum, of another date, which he had never mentioned before. Here, then, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> different accounts: if any one of them is true, every one of the other three is totally false.

"Sir, said he, I {{must confess}} it {{as a great}} {{unhappiness}} that we disagree in several doctrinal articles of religion; but surely both of us acknowledge this, {{that there is a}} God, who having given us some stated rules for our service and obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him; either by neglecting what he has commanded, or by doing what he has forbidden. This truth every Christian owns, that when any one presumptuously sins against God's command, the Almighty then withdraws his blessing from him; every good man therefore ought certainly to prevent such neglect of, or sin against, God and his commands." [...] I thanked the young priest for expressing so great a concern for us, and desired him to explain the particulars of what he had observed, that according to the parable of Achan, I might remove the accursed thing from among us [...] "Why then, Sir, said he, in the first place, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>four</b> Englishmen, who have taken savage women to their wives, by whom they have several children, though none of them are legally married, as the law of God and man requires; they, I say, Sir, are no less than adulterers, and as they still live in adultery, are liable to the curse of God. I know, Sir, you may object the want of a priest or clergyman of any kind; as also, pen, ink and paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But neither this, nor what the Spanish governor has told you of their choosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage, nor any more than an agreement to keep them from quarrelling among themselves; for, Sir, the essence or sacrament of matrimony (so he called it) not only consists in mutual consent, but in the legal obligation, which compels them to own and acknowledge one another, to abstain from other persons, the men to provide for their wives and children, and the woman to the same and like conditions, nutatis mutandis, on their side: whereas, Sir, these men, upon their own pleasure, on any occasion, may forsake those women and marry others, and by disowning their children, suffer them utterly to perish. Now, Sir, 'added he, 'can God be honoured in such an unlawful liberty as this; how can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours, if men are allowed to live in so licentious a way?" [...] I was indeed struck with the thing myself, and thought that they were much to blame, that no formal contract had been made, though it had been but breaking a stick between them, to engage them to live as man and wife, never to separate, but love, cherish, and comfort one another all their lives; yet Sir, said I, when they took these wommen, I was not here, and if it is adultery, it is past my remedy, and I cannot help it. [...] "True, Sir,' answered the young priest, you cannot be charged with that part of the crime which was done in your absence: but I beseech you, don't flatter yourself, that you are under no obligation now to put a period to it: which if you neglect to do, the guilt will be entirely on you alone, since it is certainly in nobody's power but yours, to alter their condition." [...] I must confess, I was so dull, that I thought he meant, I should part them, and knowing that this would put the whole island in confusion, I told him, I could not consent to it upon any account whatsoever. [...] "Sir,' said he, in a great surprise, 'I do not mean that you should separate, but marry them, by a written contract, signed by both man and woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the European laws decree to be of sufficient efficacy." [...] Amazed with such true piety and sincerity, and considering the validity of a written contract, I acknowledged all that he said to be very just and kind, and that I would discourse with the man about it; neither could I see what reason they could have not to let him marry them, whose authority in that affair is owned to be as authentic as if they were married by any of our clergymen in England.|$|E
