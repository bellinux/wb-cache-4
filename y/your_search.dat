500|$|A {{few of the}} Robinsons {{actually}} {{tried to}} actively take revenge on the occupying forces. The most famous of these, who became a local legend, was an individual known only as [...] "Ares" [...] (after the Greek god of war), described by Gluth-Nowowiejski, {{based on interviews with}} the Robinsons he conducted. Ares, active in the Śródmieście district, staged numerous ambushes of German soldiers, in at least one case using an improvised explosive device. According to Gluth-Nowowiejski's sources, he would leave behind graffiti of his name, as well as slogans such as [...] "Hitler kaput". Other messages included communications to the German soldiers. In one case he dumped a body of a soldier he had killed with the note: [...] "This awaits all of you in Warsaw". In another he wrote: [...] "Ares is a ghost, not matter – <b>your</b> <b>search</b> for him is useless". Eventually, Ares met his demise when the Germans left some poisoned food for him to find. Soon they discovered a man in the ruins who was obviously sick from having eaten it. He shot at them before taking his own life. According to some sources, other individuals took on Ares' struggle but used the names of other Greek Gods as their signature.|$|E
