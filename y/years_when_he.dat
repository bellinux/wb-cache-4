5|$|As {{is common}} for non-dominant wolf males, OR-7 left the Imnaha Pack in the Wallowa Mountains near Joseph in September 2011, presumably {{in search of a}} mate. In November, he became the first wolf {{detected}} in western Oregon in more than 60 <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was photographed east of Butte Falls by an automatic trail camera. This marked the first known wild wolf presence in southwestern Oregon since 1946.|$|E
5|$|Poets {{and artists}} {{were among the}} early {{visitors}} to Helvellyn {{at the beginning of}} the nineteenth century. Samuel Taylor Coleridge did a lot of fellwalking during the <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> lived near Keswick. In August 1800, barely a month after moving there, he went to visit his friends William and Dorothy Wordsworth in Grasmere, taking a route over Helvellyn and arriving at ten in the evening.|$|E

5|$|Aided by Motley's {{swiftness}} and size, the Browns won the NFL {{championship in}} 1950, their first {{season in the}} league. In October 1950, Motley set an NFL record that stood for more than 52 <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> averaged over 17 yards per rush against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with 188 yards on 11 carries. In December 2002, quarterback Michael Vick of the Atlanta Falcons rushed for 173 yards on 10 carries against the Minnesota Vikings, eclipsing Motley's average. Motley also had a 69-yard rushing and 33-yard receiving touchdowns in the game. While Motley did not factor in the Browns' championship game win against the Los Angeles Rams, he {{led the league in}} rushing with 810 yards in 1950 despite averaging fewer than 12 carries per game. He was a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years later}} in 1950, he became {{prosector}} for the Zoological Society of London and remained there for twelve <b>years.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> left the London Zoo in 1962, the old prosectorium that has been his office was closed, many preserved biological specimens were discarded, and the era of anatomists working at the London Zoo—starting {{from the time of}} Richard Owen—came to a close. Between 1957 and 1958, Osman Hill also acted as a visiting scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Later in 1958, primatologist Jane Goodall studied primate behaviour under him in preparation for her studies of wild chimpanzees. In 1962, he was hired as the assistant director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) in Atlanta after being turned down for the position of director.|$|E

Gatski said he had not expected to make it into the hall. He had not played for 28 <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was selected by an old-timers committee. Two decades later, Marshall University retired Gatski's number 72 during a homecoming game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Gatski was the first and remains the only Marshall football player to be so honored.|$|E
5|$|His {{first-class}} {{career was}} confined to his university <b>years,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> appeared for both Oxford and Somerset. Close {{to the top of}} the bowling averages for both teams in each season, his 62 first-class wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket-takers in the country. Somerset's temporary loss of first-class status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard's first-class career when he was 23. Although he continued to play for the side in second-class cricket until 1889, by the time Somerset resumed first-class cricket in 1891, Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions of Ted Tyler and George Nichols. He died at the age of 39 while engaged in scholastic work in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|Joel Palmer {{was born}} in Elizabethtown, Ontario, Canada, on October 4, 1810. His parents, Hannah Phelps and Ephraim Palmer, were American Quakers. When he was two years old, they moved to New York's Catskill Mountains in {{response}} to the War of 1812. He received only three months of formal education in elementary school. In 1822, when Palmer was 12, his parents indentured him to the Haworth family for a period of four <b>years.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> gained his freedom, he moved to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to work on canals and bridges.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{had a more}} {{productive}} campaign during the 1952–53 season, scoring 470 runs at 33.57 and taking 23 wickets at 26.26 in nine matches. He broke through for his first first-class century in three <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> made 169 against New South Wales, {{but it was not}} enough to prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, but this was not enough for him to regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E
5|$|Lucius Aelius Sejanus {{had served}} the {{imperial}} family for almost twenty <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> became Praetorian Prefect in AD15. As Tiberius became more embittered {{with the position}} of Princeps, he began to depend more and more upon the limited secretariat left to him by Augustus, and specifically upon Sejanus and the Praetorians. In AD17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed {{the ranks of the}} Praetorian Guard responsible for the defense of the city, and had moved it from encampments outside of the city walls into the city itself, giving Sejanus access to somewhere between 6000 and 9000 troops.|$|E

On 7July he was posted to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, which operated Hawker Demon biplane fighters out of RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. He spent much of the remainder of the year learning instrument flying on the Link Trainer, and undertaking a parachute training course.|$|E

5|$|Shankar {{conceived}} {{the film in}} mid-2003 during the post-production period of his previous film, Boys. He based the film on his own life experiences during his formative <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was disturbed {{by what he saw}} around him, and his eventual displeasure with society. Pre-production for Anniyan began in November 2003 and principal photography in March 2004. The making of the film, which included numerous production delays, took 14 months. The film was shot at Hyderabad, Thanjavur, Villupuram and Chennai, and the song sequences were filmed in Amsterdam, Mumbai, Malaysia and Tenkasi. The film was notable for its recreation of the Tyagaraja Aradhana music festival and the extensive use of time slice photography in an action sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{firm that}} was to become Rogers Locomotive Works began in 1831. Thomas Rogers had been {{designing}} and building machinery for textile manufacturing for nearly 20 <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sold his interest in Godwin, Rogers & Company (of which he was the Rogers part of the name) in June of that year. Rogers set {{out on his own}} with a new company called Jefferson Works in Paterson, New Jersey. The Jefferson Works built textile and agricultural machinery for a year before Rogers met the two men who would help transform the company into a major locomotive manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades was {{a leading}} {{supporter}} of the Sicilian Expedition, and scholars have argued that, had that expedition been under Alcibiades's command instead of that of Nicias, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous fate. In the <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> served Sparta, Alcibiades {{played a significant role}} in Athens's undoing; the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege. Alcibiades's military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state currently held his allegiance, but his propensity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long; and by the end of the war which he had helped to rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were a bygone memory.|$|E

5|$|Kershaw {{was drafted}} seventh {{overall in the}} 2006 MLB draft. He {{worked his way through}} the Dodgers' farm system in just one full season, and reached the majors at 20 years old. When he debuted in 2008, he was the {{youngest}} player in MLB, a title he held for one full year. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014, becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so. Being a left-handed strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. He became the first pitcher in history to lead MLB in ERA for four consecutive <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> did so in the 2011 through 2014 seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Krujë in 1450 {{resulted}} in heavy loss for both Murad II and the League of Lezhë. A {{large portion of}} the Albanian land was wasted from the long campaign where the Turkish forces had been stationed {{for more than half a}} year. The country was left with few resources to produce crops and a large famine was the result. In 1451, the year after Murad's forces had devastated the country, Mehmed II gained control of the Ottoman Empire after his father's death. Mehmed's great energy was already apparent during the previous <b>years</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had accompanied his father to Albania. Skanderbeg realized that if Mehmed struck now, he would be in great difficulty since he lacked the resources and the support to successfully hold off a large invasion. One of Albania's most powerful princedoms, the Dukagjini, were making open negotiations with the Turks, suggesting that they would become Mehmed's vassals.|$|E
5|$|While Sawyer {{was serving}} overseas, the reform {{coalition}} swept the Democrats into power in Philadelphia {{for the first}} time in 67 <b>years.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> returned to Philadelphia, Clark asked him to run for an at-large seat on City Council in 1955. By the rules of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only choose five. The result was that the majority party could take only five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Sawyer was elected to one such seat and served a single four-year term. In that position, he sponsored legislation to establish the city's One Percent for Fine Arts program, which required one percent of the cost of construction projects in Center City to be spent on public art. He also worked for the creation of a Police Review Board. City Council did not pass that bill, but Mayor James Tate later created the board through an executive order.|$|E
