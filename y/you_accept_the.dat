5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out. If the player declines, your morale will drop. If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{announcement}} that Steven Moffat would leave the show in December 2017 and be replaced by new showrunner Chris Chibnall, this decision led to speculation over whether Capaldi would remain in the role or leave alongside Moffat. A month before this, Capaldi stated [...] "This could be my final year it's terrifying, I love Doctor Who {{but it can be}} an insular world and I do want to do other things. There will come a time when this is over, but I knew that when I started. I was thinking about my regeneration scene from the outset, that’s my terrible melancholic nature, when <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> job you know there’ll come a day, inevitably, when you’ll be saying goodbye.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Your wish {{was to help}} Harry? You might {{hereafter}} {{have been}} of service to your brother, had <b>you</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>the</b> Duke's offer. Princes do not love to have their favours refused, and I don't wonder that his Royal Highness was offended." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Drummond only {{wants to}} know what you wish and it shall be done," [...] said Mounser Green. Lord Drummond was the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the day. [...] "I hope I need hardly say that we were delighted that <b>you</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>the</b> offer." ...|$|R

6000|$|She went on, eagerly: [...] "I {{wish you}} could come to believe. Your sister said your mother and your uncle spoke last night. Why can't <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> faith?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Louis," [...] she cried, {{clapping}} her hands, [...] "let me be {{the first}} to congratulate you! How proud and glad I am! <b>You</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> professorship, of course?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} you ten minutes to deliberate. Unless {{by the end of}} that time <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> {{conditions}} offered, it will go hard with those in our hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> of <b>the</b> King's mercy {{upon these}} terms, Mr Morton?" [...] said the Duke of Lauderdale, who presided in the Council.|$|R
5000|$|Hearing this, Muruga {{accepted}} all of these, {{and promised}} to behave accordingly. Vaikundar replied, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>accept,</b> do <b>the</b> following things to symbolise that": ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘And that is {{just what}} I mean; {{that is just}} how it was with us,’ said Rosa. ‘You liked me very well, and you had grown used to me, and had grown {{used to the idea}} of our being married. <b>You</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} as an inevitable kind of thing, didn’t you? It was to be, you thought, and why discuss or dispute it?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor {{to raise}} curiosity which you don't mean to satisfy," [...] {{retorted}} his friend; [...] "however, my advice is, that <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> Captain's offer, and trust to your uncle's generosity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He says,' she added, with {{a grimace}} of irony, 'that {{you can find}} an eternal {{equilibrium}} in marriage, if <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> unison, and still leave yourself separate, don't try to fuse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The duke {{looked at}} him steadily. [...] "I will put you to the proof," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "Dressed as the king, you shall, yourself, attend mass in his {{carriage}} at midnight. Do <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> test?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I think I will," [...] said Junius, [...] "if <b>you</b> will <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> {{services}} {{of a man who}} is decidedly opposed to your interests." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When I narrated {{the story}} to you, I {{expected}} 50/50 chance of <b>you</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>the</b> film. There are some elements that appeal to your sensibilities and some elements are unique to me. The avakai girl character will be liked by you. But there are some elements which might not be liked by you. Lucky, you liked {{the soul of the}} story. Another apprehension I had was the audience’s expectations. They come to theaters expecting a Sekhar Kammula’s movie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} dull, {{and there was}} nothing more to be said. I did come away early, and perhaps have given affront. I hope <b>you</b> will <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> {{compliment}} implied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He had not {{the least}} idea," [...] she declared, [...] "that you were not {{reasonably}} well off. He is most interested in hearing about you, and he was delighted to have <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> allowance he offered you. You will go and see him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> skin, Miss Warrener?" [...] Captain Dunlop {{said to her}} afterward; [...] "I have {{arranged}} with the doctor. He {{is to have the}} hams, and I am to have the hide. If you will, I will have it dressed and mounted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> challenge," [...] {{broke in}} the Doge shortly, [...] "cease from gibes, my lord, which more befit an angry woman's mouth {{than that of}} one whose life {{is about to be}} put to hazard, and take up the gage of his Grace of England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said slowly. [...] "When {{the boys}} said that <b>you</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>the</b> {{guardianship}} {{of that child}} NOT on account of Dick Stannard, but only as a bluff against the joke they'd set up at you, I didn't believe them! When {{these men and women}} to-night tumbled to that story of the child being YOURS, I didn't believe that! When it was said by others that you were serious about making her your ward, and giving her your property, because you doted on her like a father, I didn't believe that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us go," [...] she said, {{a little}} abruptly. [...] "I {{am tired of}} talking here. If you really wish to know, <b>you</b> can <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> {{invitation}} which I shall send you presently, and come to Scotland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} far <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> or reject <b>the</b> teachings of Scripture on this matter," [...] he began rather vaguely, but Hilbrook stopped him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have every}} right. You shall {{have every right}} if you will accept it. Lady Mason, I am an old man,--some would say a very old man. But I am not too old to love you. Can, <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> love {{of an old man}} like me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{young friend}} and I admired your {{performance}} equally, Miss Fay, although, perhaps, {{he was the}} more demonstrative," [...] said Mr. Marx, coming forward. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> congratulations and thanks of a provincial who seldom has the pleasure of seeing such acting or hearing such a voice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{should say}} so," [...] replied Alfred. [...] "Flo will tell you. She's {{the only person}} Gene ever let ride that horse, unless, as Bill thinks, the little Mexican girl, Bonita, rode him out of El Cajon the other night. Well, sister mine, how about it--will <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> horse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, now <b>you</b> must <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> whole. There's room to {{give the}} preachers a wide berth, even should they insist on [...] "concluding with prayer," [...] {{and it will be}} a pretty sight. They have the Guards' band coming.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I might {{perhaps be}} better able to judge whether it would be {{advantageous}} or otherwise for <b>you</b> to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> offer, but <b>you</b> must be the best judge as to whether you would like to accept it or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter whether she did or did not," [...] said Sir Harry. [...] "I ask you again, whether <b>you</b> will <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> offer made <b>you</b> by Mr. Boltby, and give me your written promise not to renew this suit." ...|$|R
6000|$|L. If it be, {{what will}} you gain by unpersonifying it, or what right have you to do so? Cannot <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> image given you, in its life; and listen, like children, to the words which chiefly belong to you as children: [...] "I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me"? ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Fyne {{had only}} {{smiled at me}} very expressively, very self-confidently. [...] "Oh I quite {{understand}} that <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> fullest responsibility," [...] I said. [...] "I am the only ridiculous person in this-- this--I don't know how to call it--performance. However, I've nothing more to do here, so I'll say good-night--or good morning, for it must be past one." ...|$|E
60|$|But even so, {{you will}} {{hesitate}} before <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> story of that saturnalia in its entirety, {{and before you}} believe that an old man of seventy, a priest and Christ's Vicar, was present with Cesare and his friends. Burchard does not say that he himself was a witness of what he relates. But the matter shall presently be further considered.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{thank you}} very much," [...] I answered, [...] "we must {{get back to the}} wagon or our {{servants}} will think that we have come to grief. Perhaps <b>you</b> will <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> wildebeeste if it is of any use to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{exercise}} {{of your right}} to self-determination, do <b>you</b> approve and <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> proposed new Constitution for Gibraltar? YES NO ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Cliff smiled. [...] "Very good," [...] said she, [...] "we'll take {{a little}} trial trip {{just as soon as}} you are ready, Captain Burke! That is, if you have not made any plans which will prevent <b>you</b> from <b>accepting</b> <b>the</b> position." ...|$|R
