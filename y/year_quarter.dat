Published 1817.' In the Biog. Lit. (loc. cit.) the last seven lines of the quotation read as follows--'judgement-seat in the interim, I should, year after <b>year,</b> <b>quarter</b> after quarter, month after month (not to mention sundry petty periodicals of still quicker revolution, 'or weekly or diurnal') have been for at least seventeen years consecutively dragged forth by these into the foremost rank of the proscribed, and forced to abide the brunt of abuse, for faults directly opposite, and which I certainly had not.

6000|$|To {{anonymous}} {{critics in}} reviews, magazines, and news-journals of various name and rank, and to satirists {{with or without}} a name in verse or prose, or in verse-text aided by prose-comment, I do seriously believe and profess, that I owe full two-thirds of whatever reputation and publicity I happen to possess. For when the name of an individual has occurred so frequently, in so many works, for so great a length of time, the readers of these works--(which with a shelf or two of beauties, elegant Extracts and Anas, form nine-tenths of the reading of the reading Public [14])--cannot but be familiar with the name, without distinctly remembering whether it was introduced for eulogy or for censure. And this becomes the more likely, if (as I believe) the habit of perusing periodical works may be properly added to Averroes' catalogue of Anti-Mnemonics, or weakeners of the memory [15]. But where this has not been the case, yet the reader will be apt to suspect that there must be something more than usually strong and extensive in a reputation, that could either require or stand so merciless and long-continued a cannonading. Without any feeling of anger therefore--(for which indeed, on my own account, I have no pretext)--I may yet be allowed to express some degree of surprise, that, after having run the critical gauntlet for a certain class of faults which I had, nothing having come before the judgment-seat in the interim, I should, year after <b>year,</b> <b>quarter</b> after quarter, month after month--(not to mention sundry petty periodicals of still quicker revolution, [...] "or weekly or diurnal")--have been, for at least seventeen years consecutively, dragged forth by them into the foremost ranks of the proscribed, and forced to abide the brunt of abuse, for faults directly opposite, and which I certainly had not.

40|$|Self-reporting of {{information}} is an inexpensive means for collecting data on fishing or other human activities, but the accuracy of self-reported data {{can be difficult to}} measure. Logbooks that record fishing activities are a common form of self-reporting that can provide vast amounts {{of information}} about a fishery. Using logbook data from trawlers from Oregon ports operating along the US Pacific coast during 1987 – 2001, this study examined (a) the consistency of reported tow locations and bottom depths and (b) the accuracy of reported retained catches of four groundfish species groups. Because logbook data during this period played no direct role in fishery management or stock assessments, there were no obvious incentives for trawl captains to deliberately report false logbook information. To evaluate consistency between tow locations and corresponding bottom depths, each tow was assigned to a 100 - m bottom depth-band based on the reported tow location on a digital chart. The depth-bands based on the tow locations were then compared one-to-one with the depths reported in the logbooks and analysed to determine factors (e. g., <b>year,</b> <b>quarter,</b> vessel) contributing to the consistency between the reported locations and depths. Consistency was highest in the shallowest depth-bands and there was a strong interaction between depth and vessel. To evaluate the accuracy of the retained catches reported by the captains, the tow-by-tow logbook data were summed to the fishing-trip-level and compared to the official landing weights, recorded at the fish processing plants when the catches were off-loaded and weighed. The logbook weights relative to the corresponding official landing weights were analysed using zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) regression models to determine factors (<b>year,</b> <b>quarter,</b> vessel) that were important explanatory variables. The analysis found strong <b>year,</b> <b>quarter,</b> and vessel effects for all three parts of the ZIGP: the mean value, the dispersion, and the proportion of zeros. The vessel effect was strongest. In a combined analysis, based on results from the other two analyses, vessels that were consistent in recording their depths and fishing locations had only a weak tendency to be accurate in recording their catches.

The main factors considered were <b>year,</b> <b>quarter,</b> area, ratio, gear and the interaction quarter*area. The basic significant model obtained explained 81 % of CPUE variability observed and suggests a stable trend for this blue shark stock in the Indian Ocean.

Other significant, although less important factors were quarter and area and the interaction between the two, while the year was considered the least important of all the factors examined during this period.

40|$|Clinical {{mastitis}} (CM) can {{be caused}} by a wide variety of pathogens and a farmer has to start treatment before the actual causal pathogen is known. Knowing the Gram-status of CM cases would aid in the decision for the most appropriate treatment. By providing a probability distribution for the Gram-status, rather than only providing the most likely Gram-status, the involved uncertainty is visible for a farmer, thereby allowing a more informed treatment decision. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the value of providing probability distributions for the Gram-status of CM cases to a farmer to take a more informed treatment decision. A naive Bayesian network (NBN) based on data from 274 Dutch dairy herds in which the occurrence of CM was recorded over an 18 -month period was constructed. The dataset contained 3, 534 CM cases, all classified accordingto their Gram-status. Two-third of the dataset was used for the construction and one-third was retained for validation. Information usually available at a dairy farm was included in the NBN under construction (parity, month in lactation, season of the <b>year,</b> <b>quarter</b> position, somatic cell count history and CM history, being sick or not, and color and texture of the milk). For getting insight in the quality of the constructed NBN, the accuracy was determined. The accuracy of classifying CM cases into Gram-positive or Gram-negative pathogens was 73 %. Because only CM cases with a high probability for Gram-negative or Gram-positive pathogens will be considered for specific treatment, it was interesting to have a closer look at CM cases with probabilities > 0. 90. We foundthat the accuracy of the classification increased with the calculated probability for Gram-negative or Gram-positive pathogens. The probability distributions for the Gram-status provide the farmer with considerable additional information about the most likely Gram-status of a CM case and the uncertainty involved...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the prevalence of smoking in the population and incidence of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) among children under 5 years of age. Design: Retrospective, longitudinal, observational study. Poisson regression controlled for confounding factors. Setting: Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands between 1975 and 2009. Population: Total population of approximately 35 million people in these four countries. Data sources: Data were collected from the Ministries of Health, National Statistics Bureaus and other relevant national institutes. Results: In Norway, there was a significant positive relationship between the annual prevalence of daily smokers among individuals aged 25 - 49 years and the incidence of IMD in children under 5 years of age, unadjusted (RR= 1. 04 - 1. 06, 95 % CI 1. 02 to 1. 07, p< 0. 001) and after adjustment for time of <b>year</b> (<b>quarter),</b> incidence of influenza-like illness and household crowding (RR= 1. 05 - 1. 07, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 09, p< 0. 001). Depending on age group, the risk of IMD increased by 5. 2 - 6. 9 % per 1 % increase in smoking prevalence among individuals aged 25 - 49 years in adjusted analyses. Using limited datasets from the three other countries, unadjusted analysis showed positive associations between IMD in children related to older smokers in Sweden and the Netherlands and negative associations related to younger smokers in Sweden. However, there were no demonstrable associations between incidence of IMD and prevalence of smoking, after adjustment for the same confounding variables. Conclusions: The reduced incidence of IMD in Norway between 1975 and 2009 may partly be explained by the reduced prevalence of smoking during this period. High-quality surveillance data are required to confirm this in other countries. Strong efforts to reduce smoking in the whole population including targeted campaigns to reduce smoking among adults may {{have a role to play}} in the prevention of IMD in children...|$|E
