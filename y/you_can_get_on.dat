500|$|Lim Choon Klet of New Straits Times {{praised the}} [...] "simply wonderful" [...] {{graphics}} but {{questioned whether the}} sound effects were enough to [...] "create the environment of a full-scale war". Choon Klet pointed to a high initial difficulty but said: [...] "Once the skills are acquired, be ready for many hours of enjoyment and sleepless nights." [...] Chip and Jonathan Carter of St. Petersburg Times deemed the game {{one of the best}} of the year and felt the SNES version [...] "loses nothing in the translation". The duo said the Game Boy and Game Gear versions were [...] "less impressive" [...] due to their technical restrictions but [...] "about as good as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the small screen". [...] "Sir Garnabus" [...] of GamePro was impressed with the Game Boy version's clear and detailed graphics, lack of slowdown, good controls, and faithfulness to the original version, but judged the Game Gear version to be [...] "merely average", saying issues such as poor collision detection hamper the game despite its outstanding graphics. Amiga CD32 Gamer called Jungle Strike [...] "a 500lb gorilla among games" [...] and praised its ease of control and [...] "masses of gameplay and realistic detail".|$|E
2500|$|Of the 1996 Hastings Center Report, Emanuel said, [...] "I was {{examining}} two different, abstract philosophical {{positions to}} see what they might offer in the context of redoing the health-care system and trying to reduce resource consumption in health care. It's as abstractly philosophical as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> a practical question. I qualified it in 27 different ways, saying it wasn't my view." [...] He also said, [...] "As far as rationing goes, it's nothing I've ever advocated for the health system as a whole, and I've talked about rationing only in the context of situations where you have limited items, like limited livers or limited vaccine, and not for overall health care." ...|$|E

2500|$|A blatant bigot, McReynolds {{would not}} accept [...] "Jews, drinkers, blacks, women, smokers, married or engaged individuals" [...] as law clerks. Time [...] "called him 'Puritanical', 'intolerably rude', 'savagely sarcastic', 'incredibly reactionary', and 'anti-Semitic'". McReynolds refused to speak to Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the Court, for three years {{following}} Brandeis's appointment and, when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to justices on their retirement. He habitually left the conference room whenever Brandeis spoke. When Benjamin Cardozo's appointment was being pressed on President Herbert C. Hoover, McReynolds joined with fellow justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter in urging the White House not to [...] "afflict the Court with another Jew". When news of Cardozo's appointment was announced, McReynolds is claimed to have said [...] "Huh, {{it seems that the}} only way <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the Supreme Court these days is to be either the son of a criminal or a Jew, or both." [...] During Cardozo's swearing-in ceremony, McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper, and would often hold a brief or record {{in front of his face}} when Cardozo delivered an opinion from the bench. Likewise, he refused to sign opinions authored by Brandeis.|$|E

I dare say you could buy another house such as you own in Plainton, and scarcely miss the money. Compared to your health and happiness, the loss of that house, even if it should burn up while you are away, would be as a penny thrown to a beggar." ...|$|E
