5|$|Reagan {{never left}} the United States during the war, but he kept a film reel that he {{obtained}} {{while he was in}} the service. The reel depicted the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp; he believed that doubts would someday arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred. It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz, though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.|$|E

50|$|The party {{managed to}} win three seats in the election, taken by Weizman, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Shlomo Amar. They were invited to join <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> {{coalition}} government, and Weizman became Minister without Portfolio.|$|R
25|$|Unfortunately for Pollard, {{the effort}} broke down when Yossi Ben Aharon, {{assistant}} to Israeli Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> insisted on Israel negotiating {{directly with the}} Russians rather than through an intermediary such as Greenwald. The Israeli negotiating effort never gained traction, and Pollard remained in prison until 2015.|$|E
25|$|After the Madrid Conference of 1991, Ze'evi {{withdrew from}} the Likud {{government}} of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir,</b> remaining in the opposition for a decade. He disagreed strongly with the Labour governments of 1992–1996 (led by Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres) and 1999–2001 (Ehud Barak), however, he looked favourably on the Netanyahu government of 1996–1999 and supported it from the outside.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, the United States granted Israel {{the status}} of major non-NATO ally, {{enabling}} it to compete equally with NATO and other US allies for contracts and purchase advanced US weapons systems. Israel became the largest recipient of U.S. military aid in the world (see military aid below). In 1988, Reagan and Israeli Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> signed a memorandum of understanding to formalize and perpetuate {{the work of the}} bilateral US-Israel military, security and economic working groups.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{breaking}} {{away from his}} party, the new faction joined <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> government, with <b>Yitzhak</b> Moda'i appointed Minister of Finance. On 18 June 1990 Avraham Sharir returned to Likud, as did Yosef Goldberg on 4 December that year.|$|R
50|$|The party only won {{one seat}} in the elections, taken by Hurvitz. Despite its small size, the party was invited to Shimon Peres and <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> {{national}} unity government alongside the National Religious Party, Agudat Israel, Shas, Morasha, and Shinui.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{motions of}} no confidence being tabled in the Knesset, a government {{has only been}} defeated by one once, when <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> government was brought down on 15 March 1990 {{as part of a}} plot that became known as the dirty trick.|$|R
25|$|In 1992 Rabin {{was elected}} as {{chairman}} of the Labor Party, winning against Shimon Peres. In the elections that year his party, strongly focusing on the popularity of its leader, managed to win a clear victory over the Likud of incumbent Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir.</b> However, the left-wing bloc in the Knesset only won an overall narrow majority, facilitated by the disqualification of small nationalist parties that did not manage to pass the electoral threshold. Rabin formed the first Labor-led government in fifteen years, supported by a coalition with Meretz, a left wing party, and Shas, a Mizrahi ultra-orthodox religious party.|$|E
25|$|On 11 April 1987, after <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> became prime {{minister}} of Israel, Hussein engaged in direct talks with Shamir's foreign minister, Peres, in London. After reaching an agreement between Hussein and Peres on establishing an international peace conference, Shamir {{and the rest of}} the ministers in his cabinet rejected the proposal. On 8November 1987 Jordan hosted an Arab League summit; Hussein enjoyed good relations with rival Arab blocs, and he acted as conciliatory intermediate. He helped mobilize Arab support for Iraq against Iran, and for Jordan's peace efforts, and helped to end the decade-long Arab boycott of Egypta boycott that began after it unilaterally signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Hussein described the summit as one of the best moments in his life.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1988 Israeli {{legislative}} election Netanyahu returned to Israel {{and joined the}} Likud party. In the Likud's internal elections, Netanyahu was placed fifth on the party list. Later on he was elected as a Knesset member of the 12th Knesset, and was appointed as a deputy of the foreign minister Moshe Arens, and later on David Levy. Netanyahu and Levy did not cooperate and the rivalry between the two only intensified afterwards. During the Gulf War in early 1991, the English-fluent Netanyahu emerged as the principal spokesman for Israel in media interviews on CNN and other news outlets. During the Madrid Conference of 1991 Netanyahu was among members the Israeli delegation headed by Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir.</b> After the Madrid Conference Netanyahu was appointed as Deputy Minister in the Israeli Prime Minister's Office.|$|E

Shamir inspired and underwrote a series of Rohr Jewish Learning Institute classes commemorating the centennial of Prime Minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> birth.|$|R
50|$|Meridor's {{father was}} Eliyahu Meridor {{a member of}} the Knesset. It was Ya'akov Meridor who was {{commander}} of the Irgun Zvai Leumi, not Eliyahu. See Ya'akov Meridor's underground memoirs, Long Is the Road, <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> memoirs, Summing Up, or any biography of Menahem Begin for confirmation.|$|R
50|$|The {{party was}} {{established}} on 25 December 1990 during the 12th Knesset when Minister of Immigrant Absorption and former Shas leader Yitzhak Peretz {{broke away from}} Shas to form his own Knesset faction. The faction remained part of <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> government and Peretz retained his ministerial portfolio.|$|R
25|$|In September 1983, Begin {{resigned}} and was succeeded by <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> as prime minister. The 1984 election was inconclusive, {{and led to}} a power sharing agreement between Shimon Peres of the Alignment (44 seats) and Shamir of Likud (41 seats). Peres was prime minister from 1984 to 1986 and Shamir from 1986 to 1988. In 1984, continual discrimination against Sephardi Ultra-Orthodox Jews by the Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox establishment led political activist Aryeh Deri to leave the Agudat Israel party and join former chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in forming Shas, a new party aimed at the non-Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox vote. The party won 4 seats in the first election it contested and over the next twenty years was the third largest party in the Knesset. Shas established a nationwide network of free Sephardi Orthodox schools. In 1984, during a severe famine in Ethiopia, 8,000 Ethiopian Jews were secretly transported to Israel. In 1986 Natan Sharansky, a famous Russian human rights activist and Zionist refusenik (denied an exit visa), was released from the Gulag in return for two Soviet spies.|$|E
25|$|The present Eritrean Jewish {{community}} {{is believed to}} be started by Yemenite Jews from Yemen attracted by new commercial opportunities driven by Italian colonial expansion in the late 19th Century. The Jewish population then later increased from European refugees coming to Eritrea to escape the anti-Semitic regimes in Europe at the time. Many returned to Israel in 1948. During British administration, Eritrea was often used as a location of exile for Irgun and Lehi guerrillas. Among those imprisoned was future Israeli prime minister <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> and Haim Corfu, a founder of Beitar Jerusalem. In 1961 the Eritrean War of Independence began after Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia. It was then that Jews began to leave Eritrea. In the early 1970s, Jewish emigration increased because of ensuing violence between Eritrea and Ethiopia (up to and beyond Eritrea's official declaration of independence in 1993). Judaism {{is not one of the}} four religions recognized by the Eritrean government and indeed, as of 2006 there was only one last native Jew left in Eritrea - Sami Cohen, who attends to the Asmara Synagogue and cemetery.|$|E

50|$|He {{joined the}} Agudat Yisrael movement, {{becoming}} {{a member of}} its central committee, World Executive Committee and eventually chairman of the party in Israel. He {{was elected to the}} Knesset on its list in 1988, and was appointed Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Welfare in <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> government, although he resigned on 31 October 1989. He lost his seat in the 1992 elections.|$|R
50|$|In the 1984 elections, Tehiya {{became the}} third largest party in the Knesset after the Alignment and Likud, albeit with only five seats. However, they were {{excluded}} from Shimon Peres and <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> national unity government, which included the Alignment, Likud, the National Religious Party, Agudat Israel, Shas, Morasha, Shinui and Ometz. During the Knesset session Rafael Eitan defected from Tehiya to found a new party, Tzomet.|$|R
50|$|The faction {{was formed}} on 25 December 1990 when Efraim Gur {{broke away from}} the Alignment in 1990, during the term of the twelfth Knesset. Gur was invited to join <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> new government, which had been formed (minus the Alignment) on 11 June 1990, and accepted. He was {{initially}} appointed Deputy Minister of Communications, but became Deputy Minister of Transportation in November 1990.|$|R
2500|$|Many of Israel's most {{prominent}} conservatives have been [...] "graduates" [...] of Betar, including former prime ministers Menachem Begin, <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir,</b> and Ehud Olmert, and former Defense Minister Moshe Arens. Former Likud/Kadima minister (in several offices) Tzipi Livni MK was a youth Betarist. Yoel Hasson MK was formerly national head of Betar in Israel. Livni and Hasson later formed Hatnuah, which in 2015 allied with Labor in the center-left Zionist Union.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assassination}} {{plan was}} discussed in a September 10, 1948, meeting of Lehi leadership in a Tel Aviv apartment, which included Israel Eldad, Nathan Yellin-Mor and future-Prime Minister of Israel <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir.</b> Shamir later recounted that [...] "The idea was conceived in Jerusalem by Lehi members. Our opinion was asked, and we offered no opposition." [...] With no objections raised, Zettler {{came back to}} Jerusalem and selected the team that would carry out the attack on Bernadotte, which included Meshulam Makover and Yehoshua Cohen.|$|E
2500|$|A {{small group}} (about 200 activists), {{dedicated}} to resisting the British administration in Palestine, {{broke away from}} the Etzel (which advocated support for Britain during the war) and formed the [...] "Lehi" [...] (Stern Gang), led by Avraham Stern. In 1943, the USSR released the Revisionist Zionist leader Menachem Begin from the Gulag and he went to Palestine, taking command of the Etzel organization with a policy of increased conflict against the British. At about the same time <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> escaped from the camp in Eritrea where the British were holding Lehi activists without trial, taking command of the Lehi (Stern Gang).|$|E
50|$|Degel HaTorah {{was founded}} in 1988 as a {{splinter}} from Agudat Israel. Its establishment by Rabbi Elazar Shach was due to policy disputes with the Hasidic rabbis within Agudat Yisrael. In the 1988 elections, the party won two seats, taken by Moshe Gafni and Avraham Ravitz, and joined <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir's</b> coalition government. For the 1992 elections, the party allied itself with Agudat Yisrael under the name United Torah Judaism.|$|R
50|$|In 1988 he {{was elected}} to the Knesset on the Alignment list (of which the Labor Party was the major component).

2500|$|Beginning in 1947, Bunche was {{involved}} with trying to resolve the Arab–Israeli conflict in Palestine. [...] He served as assistant to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, and thereafter as the principal secretary of the UN Palestine Commission. In 1948, he traveled to the Middle East as the chief aide to Sweden's Count Folke Bernadotte, who had been appointed by the UN to mediate the conflict. These men chose the island of Rhodes for their base and working headquarters.

2500|$|In September 1986 Ben-Menashe gave {{information}} to Time correspondent Raji Samghabadi about the weapons shipments to Iran organised by Richard Secord, Oliver North and Albert Hakim—which later {{became known as}} the Iran–Contra affair. Time was unable to corroborate the allegations, and Ben-Menashe later passed the {{information to}} the Lebanese Ash-Shiraa, which published them on 3 November 1986, and soon led to Congressional investigations. Samghabadi later said that [...] "The information he gave me was earthshaking, and it was later corroborated by Congress." [...] According to Ben-Menashe, the leaking was done on the orders of Likud's <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> to embarrass his Labor Party rival Shimon Peres.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker told Israeli prime {{minister}} <b>Yitzhak</b> <b>Shamir</b> that the United States would honor the position expressed in Ford's letter. William B. Quandt speculates that Baker told Syrian President Hafez al-Assad that the United States {{did not recognize}} Israel's annexation of the Golan and thought that UN Resolution 242 should apply there. In May 2017, prior to U.S. president Donald Trump′s visit to Israel {{as part of a}} broader tour of the region, a promotional video released by the White House included a map of Israel drawn within the 1967 borders — leaving out the West Bank and the Golan.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Shimon Peres and King Hussein tried {{secretly}} {{to arrange}} a peace agreement in which Israel would concede the West Bank to Jordan.
