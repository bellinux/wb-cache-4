I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making decisions based on the information that they have at the time. Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy. The Pope assures all concerned of his prayers for those who died and for their families." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{released}} her second studio album [...] in April 2012. The album {{was preceded by}} the promotional singles [...] "Roman in Moscow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Hoe". Critics suggested that the latter song was directed at Lil' Kim, who said: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> song called 'Stupid Hoe,' {{you must be a}} stupid hoe." [...] Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform their single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", on the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012. She was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering [...] "Roman Holiday" [...] during the 2012 ceremony on February 12. Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake [...] "Pope" [...] to escort her on the red carpet. The [...] "exorcism" [...] scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well. According to the Catholic League president Bill Donohue [...] "Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt between her legs in prayer. Finally, 'Come All Ye Faithful' was sung while a man posing as a bishop walked on stage; Minaj was shown levitating." ...|$|E
2500|$|McNamara's staff {{stressed}} {{systems analysis}} {{as an aid}} in decision making on weapon development and many other budget issues. The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that [...] "this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency {{to the way we}} spend our defense dollars.... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> judgment on how much is enough." [...] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary to national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} well received. On Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} an 87% 'Fresh' rating based on 54 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 72 (generally {{favorable}} reviews) out of 100 based on 23 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, writing: [...] "Pi is a thriller. I am not very thrilled these days by whether the bad guys will get shot or the chase scene will end one way instead of another. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> movie like that pretty skillfully before I care. But I am thrilled when a man risks his mind in the pursuit of a dangerous obsession." [...] James Berardinelli gave the film three out of four stars, writing: [...] " [...] transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling. Reality is a fragile commodity, but, because the script is well-written and the central character is strongly developed, it's not hard to suspend disbelief....It probably deserves 3.1416 stars, but since my scale doesn't support that, I'll round it off to three." ...|$|E

They may {{come this way}} or they may not; at any rate, we must be {{prepared}} for them. Get the beasts into the sheds, and then do you all take scythes and set to work to cut down that patch of corn, which is high enough to give them shelter; there's nothing else which will cover them within a hundred yards of the house. Of course you will take your rifles with you and keep a sharp lookout; but they will have heard the bell, {{if they are in}} the neighborhood, and will guess that we are on the alert, so they are not likely to attempt a surprise. Shut one of the gates and leave the other ajar, with the bar handy to put up in case <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> run for it.

60|$|Sometimes {{the process}} of liquidating the {{consequent}} claims bordered on violence. It was always a very rhetorical and often a trying affair, but in these progressive times <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> noise to get a living. It was often hard work, but nevertheless this hiring was a fairly steady source of profit, until one day all the panes in the window and door were broken and the stock on sale in the window greatly damaged and disordered by two over-critical hirers with no sense of rhetorical irrelevance. They were big, coarse stokers from Gravesend. One was annoyed because his left pedal had come off, and the other because his tyre had become deflated, small and indeed negligible accidents by Bun Hill standards, due entirely to the ungentle handling of the delicate machines entrusted to them--and they failed to see clearly how they put themselves in the wrong by this method of argument. It is a poor way of convincing a man that he has let you a defective machine to throw his foot-pump about his shop, and take his stock of gongs outside in order to return them through the window-panes. It carried no real conviction to the minds of either Grubb or Bert; it only irritated and vexed them. One quarrel makes many, and this unpleasantness led to a violent dispute between Grubb and the landlord upon the moral aspects of and legal responsibility for the consequent re-glazing. In the end Grubb and Smallways were put to {{the expense of a}} strategic nocturnal removal to another position.|$|E
60|$|Speech, no doubt, is a {{valuable}} gift, {{but at the same}} time it is a gift that may be abused. What is regarded as polite conversation is, I hold, such an abuse. Alcohol, opium, tea, are all very excellent things in their way; but imagine continuous alcohol, an incessant opium, or to receive, ocean-like, a perennially flowing river of tea! That is my objection to this conversation: its continuousness. You have to keep on. You find three or four people gathered together, and instead of being restful and recreative, sitting in comfortable attitudes and at peace with themselves and each other, and now and again, perhaps three or four times in an hour, making a worthy and memorable remark, they are all haggard and intent upon keeping this fetish flow agoing. A fortuitous score of cows in a field are a thousand times happier than a score of people deliberately assembled for the purposes of happiness. These conversationalists say the most shallow and needless of things, impart aimless information, simulate interest they do not feel, and generally impugn their claim to be considered reasonable creatures. Why, when people assemble without hostile intentions, it should be so imperative to keep the trickling rill of talk running, I find it impossible to imagine. It is a vestige of the old barbaric times, when men murdered at sight for a mere whim; when it was good form to take off your sword in the antechamber, and give your friend your dagger-hand, to show him it was no business visit. Similarly, you keep up this babblement to show your mind has no sinister concentration, not necessarily because you have anything to say, but as a guarantee of good faith. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> noise all the time, like the little boy who was left in the room with the plums. It is the only possible explanation.|$|E
