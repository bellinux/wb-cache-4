5|$|On October 12, Manning led the Colts to a 31–3 {{blow out}} win at Lucas Oil Stadium against the Baltimore Ravens to avoid their first 0–3 start at home since the 1997 season. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the 17th {{time in his}} career for his effort of three {{touchdown}} passes and 271 <b>yards</b> <b>passing.</b> It was revealed during the game by CBS commentators Jim Nantz and Phil Simms that Manning had a second surgery on his knee before the season started.
