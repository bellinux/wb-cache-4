5|$|In Major League Baseball, the 300win club is {{the group}} of {{pitchers}} who have won 300 or more games. Twenty-four pitchers have reached this milestone. The New York Gothams/Giants/San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: those players are Tim Keefe, Mickey Welch, Christy Mathewson, and Randy Johnson. Early {{in the history of}} professional baseball, many of the rules favored the pitcher over the batter; the distance pitchers threw to home plate was shorter than today, and pitchers were able to use foreign substances to alter the direction of the ball. The first player to win 300games was Pud Galvin in 1888. Seven pitchers recorded all or the majority of their career wins in the 19thcentury: Galvin, Cy <b>Young,</b> <b>Kid</b> Nichols, Tim Keefe, John Clarkson, Charley Radbourn, and Mickey Welch. Four more pitchers joined the club {{in the first quarter of}} the 20thcentury: Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Eddie Plank, and Grover Cleveland Alexander. Young is the all-time leader in wins with 511, a mark that is considered unbreakable. If a modern-day pitcher won 20 games per season for 25 seasons, he would still be 11 games short of Young's mark.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the <b>young</b> <b>kid</b> of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

He grew about 12 more cm {{in the next couple}} of years and could do everything on the court: play defense, assist his teammates, shoot 3 pointers and dominate inside the paint.|$|E

500|$|Stevens {{planned to}} live in a friend's {{basement}} and took a job at Applebee’s to pay the bills. Before he started training at Applebee's, he was offered a low-paying administrative position as coordinator of basketball operations under then-coach Thad Matta. The position had opened up when assistant coach Jamal Meeks resigned after being arrested on solicitation and drug charges, of which he was later acquitted. Years later, Matta recalled, [...] " [...] was just a hungry <b>young</b> <b>kid</b> that was desperate to get into coaching. He had a great passion and was willing to take a risk to get into the coaching profession." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title is}} a tongue-in-cheek pun on male {{masturbation}} ("take off your pants and jack it"). Previous titles had included If You See Kay (a pun on the spelling of [...] "fuck") and Genital Ben, {{accompanied by a}} bear {{on the cover of}} the album (a reference to Gentle Ben). Stressed at being at a loss for a name, DeLonge asked guitar tech Larry Palm for suggestions. The album's title was coined by Palm, who was snowboarding on a rainy day. Inside the lodge, Palm was congregating with friends when a <b>young</b> <b>kid</b> walked in completely drenched, to which his mother suggested he [...] "take off [...] pants and jacket." [...] Palm was told by DeLonge that if the band were to use the name, he would [...] "hook him up". Instead, Palm received a letter from manager Rick DeVoe for his contribution, which offered a $500 payout for the name. Palm scoffed at the amount, and filed suit in 2003 with the intellectual property attorney Ralph Loeb, alleging breach of contract and fraud against the band. Palm demanded $20,000; the band eventually settled out of court for $10,000.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the six-man tag teams, or Trios, became {{extremely}} {{popular with the}} fans in Mexico, {{to the point where}} it actually became the most common match form. During the emergence of the Trios matches El Satánico formed a trio with Pirata Morgan and Espectro Jr. known as Los Infernales ("The Infernal Ones"), one of the teams credited with the trios match becoming the most common match form in Lucha libre. Los Infernales existed in various forms from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. In 1999 El Satánico began teaming with a couple of young wrestlers, Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero, on a regular basis. The trio, soon dubbed Los Nuevo Infernales, or simply Los Infernales, won the 1999 version of the Copa de Arena Mexico by defeating the trio of Emilio Charles Jr., Mr. Niebla and Tarzan Boy in the finals. Following the tournament El Satánico began working a feud with the young técnico Tarzan Boy, with the explanation being that [...] "El Satánico wanted to teach the <b>young</b> <b>kid</b> a lesson". Meanwhile, Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero experienced their own success as they won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship by defeating Villano IV and Mr. Niebla in a tournament final to win the vacant championship.|$|E
500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a <b>young</b> <b>kid,</b> he's got powers, he doesn't {{have any of the}} bad things, he's not a vampire, so maybe he would enjoy it, and maybe he would be {{the closest thing to a}} superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E

By this point, the Yankees, long noted for being slow to adapt to changes in race relations, have come to develop many minority players in their farm system and seek out others via trades and free agency. Jackson usually appears in uniform at the Yankee's spring training complex in Tampa, Florida, and was sought out for advice by such recent stars as Derek Jeter, before his retirement, and by former Yankee star Alex Rodriguez. [...] "His experience is vast, and he's especially good with the young players in our minor league system, the 17- and 18-year old kids. They respect him and what he's accomplished in his career. When Reggie Jackson tells a <b>young</b> <b>kid</b> how he might improve his swing, he tends to listen", said Hal Steinbrenner, Yankees' managing general partner and co-chairperson.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Wilson was {{responsible}} for writing or co-writing the Beach Boys' string of hits in the 1960s, which inspired a number of Los Angeles music industry figures to refer {{to him as a}} [...] "genius". Biographer Peter Ames Carlin writes that session musicians who participated on Wilson's productions were [...] "awestruck" [...] by his musical abilities. Drummer Hal Blaine stated: [...] "We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a <b>young</b> <b>kid</b> writing about high school and surfing." [...] In the meantime, the Beatles' former press agent Derek Taylor had left the UK and moved to California, where he started his own public relations company. From 1965 to 1968, he provided publicity for groups such as the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Captain Beefheart, the Beau Brummels, and Paul Revere and the Raiders. According to music critic Richie Unterberger, through his time working in Hollywood, Taylor [...] "became, probably, the most famous rock publicist of the mid-'60s".|$|E

[...] He also said that for him, important factors in Harry's psyche are his survivor's guilt in regard to his dead parents and his lingering loneliness. Because of this, Radcliffe talked to a bereavement counsellor to help him prepare for the role. Radcliffe was quoted as saying that he wished for Harry to die in the books, but he clarified that he [...] "can't imagine any other way they can be concluded." [...] After reading the last book, where Harry and his friends do indeed survive and have children, Radcliffe stated he was glad about the ending and lauded Rowling for the conclusion of the story. Radcliffe stated that the most repeated question he has been asked is how Harry Potter has influenced his own life, to which he regularly answers it has been [...] "fine," [...] and that he did not feel pigeonholed by the role, but rather sees it as a huge privilege to portray Harry.|$|E
