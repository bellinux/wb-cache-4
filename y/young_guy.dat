5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Hilary Robinson (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) {{bringing}} breakfast to newlyweds Paul (Stefan Dennis) and Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke). She is {{surprised to find}} that they have spent the night in separate bedrooms. To hide the fact that they only married for business purposes, Gail tells Hilary that she and Paul had an argument the night before. Hilary tells them to sort things out and she tends to the bouquets. At the Robinson house, Scott (Jason Donovan) begins to panic about getting married, while his father, Jim (Alan Dale), and best friend, Mike <b>Young</b> (<b>Guy</b> Pearce), set up tables for the reception. Meanwhile, Lucy Robinson (Sasha Close) tries to find her pet mice. Over at the Ramsay house, Scott's fiancée, Charlene (Kylie Minogue), is getting ready.

5|$|The 2007–08 season {{started with}} a further {{reduction}} in teams. Harbin and Qiqihar combined into a single team and became {{owned and operated by}} the San Jose Sharks. They took the name of their new owner and became the China Sharks. Kangwon Land renamed to High1. With only seven teams, the league reduced the number of games played to its lowest at just 30 games. The league continued with an unbalanced schedule and the Korean and Chinese teams played each other more than the Japanese teams did. After three years of dominance, the Nippon Paper Cranes slipped to fourth place and the regular season was won by the Prince Rabbits. Alex Kim, playing for High1, recorded the most goals with 23 and most points with 51. Joel Prpic continued to find himself on top of the pack with 30 assists. With six of seven teams going to the playoffs, the Sharks were the only team that didn't find themselves in a playoff spot. The first round was over quickly as the Cranes swept Halla in three games and Oji did the same to the Ice Bucks. Nippon faced their rivals, the Rabbits, in the second round and defeated them three to one. High1 couldn't repeat their success from the previous year by winning a series and were swept by Oji in three games. For the first time, the final series was not between the Cranes and Rabbits. Oji continued to roll over their opponents and swept the Cranes, marking the only time a team in Asia League had swept its way through three rounds. Due to their dominance on the ice, the point race was also swept by Oji. Takeshi Saito led the playoffs with nine assists and 15 points, while Shane Endicott had the most goals with 6. Kunihiko Sakurai, also from Oji, won the MVP of the Year and Eum Hyun-seung, from High1, won the <b>Young</b> <b>Guy</b> of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|After {{a season}} with little {{change to the}} make-up of the league, the 2009–10 saw further change. The San Jose Sharks ended their {{association}} with the Chinese team. They pulled out all coaches and players they had sent. The Chinese Ice Hockey Association took over the team and brought in new import players and coaches to replace those lost. The team also changed its name from China Sharks to China Dragon. Midway through the previous season the Seibu Prince Rabbits announced that due to financial difficulties they would withdraw from the league {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season. They were unable to find a buyer and the team folded. However, another team from Japan joined the league in the off-season. The Tohoku Free Blades were able to hire enough players and imports to join the league in time for the beginning of the season. This again left the league with seven teams. The league left the number of games played at 36, marking the first time that the league didn't adjust the schedule from the previous year. The league also introduced a couple of rules changes. All face-offs will take place on one of the nine face-off dots as well teams will no longer be allowed to change after an icing. Anyang Halla repeated as the regular season champions finishing with 79 points and 23 wins. The team also set the record for the most goals by a team in a 36-game season with 180. Alex Kim and Tim Smith lead the points race. Both finished with 75 points on the season, with Kim taking the goal scoring race with 29 and Smith taking the assists race with 48. The League further reduced the number of teams making the playoffs to only four. As well they brought in referees from outside the league to assist in officiating. The two Korean teams faced each other in one semi-final guaranteeing for the first time that a Korean team would appear in the final. Halla defeated High1 in four games after a loss on home ice. The Cranes similarly defeated the Eagles in four games. The final was a close series, needing all five games and with four of the five games only being decided by a single goal. In the final game, Halla tied the game with 17 seconds remaining and in over-time the team captain, Kim Woo-jae scored to give Halla a victory and mark the first time a non-Japanese team had won the cup. In the play-offs Brock Radunske led with six goals and 13 points overall while Darcy Takeshi Mitani led with 8 assists. Patrik Martinec took regular season MVP honors, and Cho Min-ho, also from Halla, was named <b>Young</b> <b>Guy</b> of the Year.|$|E

5|$|The 2005–06 season saw {{a number}} of changes to the make-up of Asia League. In the off-season, the Golden Amur withdrew from the league due to {{financial}} trouble. At {{the same time it}} was announced that Kangwon Land was showing interest in entering a team in the league. However, only a few weeks later, they withdrew their application because it was felt their team wasn't strong enough to enter the league. The league also revised the limits on the number of imports some teams were allowed to have. Halla and the Ice Bucks were both allowed to carry an additional import player while the two Chinese teams were permitted two more import players. It was announced in July 2005 that Anyang Halla Winia would change their name to Anyang Halla. In late July, the league announced that Kangwon Land had acquired some imports and strengthened the team. They had applied again and were expected to enter the league that season. As well another new team, the Nordic Vikings, was expected to join the league. The Nordic Vikings were a Swedish-Chinese joint venture that saw the team based in Beijing. As part of the venture, Swedish players were also sent to the two existing Chinese teams. This brought the league to its high point of nine teams. Even though there were more teams than in the previous season the league reduced the number of games from 42 to 38, which resulted in an uneven schedule. For example, the Korean teams played nine games against each other, while playing four games against the teams from Japan and China except the Nordic Vikings, whom they played five times. At the end of the regular season, the Nippon Paper Cranes had captured first place for a {{second year in a row}} with 95 points. While the Cranes had a very strong showing in the point rankings, the top goal scorer was Song Dong-hwan from Anyang Halla with 31. Derek Plante led in assists with 47 and overall points with 75. The top six teams advanced to the playoffs with the top two teams, the Cranes and Halla, receiving a bye to the semi-finals. In the first round, Kokudo swept the Ice Bucks while Oji Paper defeated the Vikings three games to one. In the second round Kokudo faced Halla, who were making their playoff debut. Kokudo won that series three games to one. On the other side, the Cranes faced off against Oji Paper and swept them in three games. The final was again the Cranes vs Kokudo and once again Kokudo emerged victorious, claiming the title for the second year in a row. Kokudo had three players claiming the three top points spots for the playoffs. Joel Prpic was the top goal scorer with nine, Kiyoshi Fujita had the most assists with 12 and Takahito Suzuki had the most points with 18. Kikuchi Naoya won MVP of the year for the second time and <b>Young</b> <b>Guy</b> of the Year went to Masahito Nishiwaki of the Cranes.|$|E

The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung {{in the window of}} the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.|$|E
500|$|Daphne {{was portrayed}} as a smart, {{confident}} and independent woman from a good background. She sported a short haircut and bright clothing, which made her {{stand out from the}} other female characters on television at the time. Daphne was not embarrassed by her profession as a stripper and her [...] "no-nonsense approach" [...] to life made her an immediate favourite with the viewers. Daphne gave up stripping when her grandfather gave her the lease to the local coffee shop. She used her position to help customers with their problems and gained the trust of many of the teenage characters, particularly Mike <b>Young</b> (<b>Guy</b> Pearce).|$|E

Daphne gave up {{her career as a}} stripper to run the coffee shop, which her grandfather Harry Henderson (Johnny Lockwood) gave to her, after he won it in a poker game. Kingsley commented that Daphne ran the business like [...] "a pro". Daphne's position in the coffee shop meant that customers often confided in her and she helped mediate between several parents and their children.

Dominic Cooper took on the role of John Willoughby, Brandon's rival for Marianne's affections. Describing his character, Cooper said [...] "The way I tried to persuade myself he wasn't too bad was that he's a 25-year-old <b>young</b> <b>guy</b> and he genuinely falls in love with Marianne – he's not just doing it for one moment in time."

500|$|In Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, Angelou {{utilizes}} repetition as {{a literary}} technique. For example, she leaves her child {{in the care of}} his grandmother, just as her own mother left her and her older brother in the care of their grandmother in Caged Bird. Much of Singin' and Swingin′ delves into Angelou's guilt about accepting work that forces her to separate from her young son. As Angelou's friend, scholar Dolly McPherson states, [...] "The saddest part of Singin' and Swingin is the <b>young</b> <b>Guy,</b> who, though deeply loved by Angelou, seems to be shoved into the background whenever a need to satisfy her monetary requirements or theatrical ambitions arises". Despite her great success traveling Europe with the Porgy and Bess tour, she is distressed and full of indecision.

500|$|Jane was {{originally}} portrayed as being dowdy, lonely and quiet. She was a bookworm and mousey, thus generating her nickname [...] "Plain Jane the Superbrain" [...] {{to which she}} was often referred {{at the beginning of}} her role. Jones describes her character as a [...] "goody-goody"[...] Her clothing style was forced upon her by her mother who believed she should be dressed in [...] "dowdy" [...] clothing. Jane is very clever and was bullied because of this whilst at school. When she meets Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue), she begins to transform into a different person. With Charlene's help, she began to dress differently and as she became more confident, she began drawing the attention of male characters, most notably Mike <b>Young</b> (<b>Guy</b> Pierce) and eventually was seen as a [...] "heart-breaker". Jane's grandmother Nell Mangel (Vivean Gray) does not approve of her change in personality, but Jane ignores her worries and becomes a model. Following her make over, she becomes more assertive and takes the initiative to end her relationship with Mike Young. She then begins an affair with an older man.|$|E
500|$|Donovan {{commented that}} Scott loved Charlene, {{so when he}} saw she was in danger, he forgot to think about himself and he just went in to rescue her. Donovan added that Scott was [...] "devastated" [...] when he saw Charlene had been injured. At the hospital, Scott gave Charlene the {{friendship}} ring and declared that they would live together. Minogue told Bourne that Charlene was flattered by the gift, while Donovan stated that it proved that they loved each other and {{were not going to}} break up again. Minogue agreed with Donovan, saying [...] "There is that underlying love whether they are together or not." [...] After learning about the couple's plans to move in together, their friends and neighbours expressed their shock at how serious the couple had become. When Charlene showed the ring to Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith) and told her how she and Scott wanted to live together, Daphne was taken back. Scott's friend Mike <b>Young</b> (<b>Guy</b> Pearce) also voiced his opposition, but Scott was determined that no one would stop them from moving in together. Bourne noted that Daphne's shock at the couple's plans was [...] "the start of a major controversy, splitting apart the inhabitants of Ramsay Street." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{devised a}} romance storyline {{for the character}} alongside Mike <b>Young</b> (<b>Guy</b> Pearce). Jane's grandmother is {{not happy with the}} prospect of Jane and Mike forming a relationship. Jane decides not to pursue their relationship any further. Pearce told Patrice Fidgeon from TV Week that his character mainly shared a [...] "platonic" [...] relationship with Jane. But writers introduced a temporary love interest for Jane, pilot Glen Matheson (Richard Moss) who is much older than her. Nell disapproves of her new boyfriend because of the age difference. But Jane decides to end the romance, Pearce explained that [...] "she realises this was not going to work out and calls it quits." [...] This wins Nell's support of Jane's involvement with Mike who is of a similar age. The pair had not been on good terms prior to working together on a photography assignment. They spend the day with Charlene and Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) but after they leave the pair spend time alone and resolve their past problems. Pearce added that his character had been trying to charm Jane for some time. Eventually [...] "she gives in" [...] to Mike, Pearce believed that she felt sorry for Mike but over time comes to the realisation that she [...] "really likes him".|$|E

[...] The Edge composed the song's bass intro. [...] "Raised by Wolves" [...] is about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people but were narrowly avoided by Bono that day. The song is written {{from the perspective}} of Andy Rowen (brother of Bono's childhood friend Guggi), whose presence at the bombings would later drive him into heroin addiction, a subject also addressed in U2's 1984 song [...] "Bad". [...] "Cedarwood Road" [...] reminisces about the street in Dublin on which Bono lived during his youth. The cherry blossom tree referenced in the lyrics was from the Rowen family garden. [...] "Sleep Like a Baby Tonight", written about a pedophile priest, was described by Qs Tom Doyle as featuring [...] "deceptively lullaby-like... synth pulses" [...] reminiscent of Kraftwerk. Their album The Man-Machine was gifted by Bono to Ali when they were dating as teenagers and is name-checked in [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)" [...] in the line, [...] "But it was you who made me your man/Machine". [...] "This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now" [...] takes musical cues from one of the group's childhood inspirations, the Clash. According to the liner notes, the song is dedicated to the Clash's guitarist/vocalist Joe Strummer. The closing track, [...] "The Troubles", was described by Bono as [...] "an uncomfortable song about domestic violence".|$|E
500|$|Further {{changes were}} seen {{in the league in}} the 2006–07 season. After the last season The Nordic Vikings were looking for {{sponsors}} for the team. However, they failed to find sufficient sponsorship and left the league due to financial trouble. [...] Harbin moved their home rink to Beijing and changed their name to Hosa to reflect this. Qiqihar acquired a new sponsor and changed their name to Changchun Fuao. Kokudo also changed their name to the Seibu Prince Rabbits. With eight teams, the league further reduced the number of games played to 34, which again resulted in an uneven play schedule. The Chinese-based teams, for example, played each other and the Korean teams each six times but only played the Japanese teams four times. The Paper Cranes easily won the regular season again finishing first with 86 points. With the previous year's goal leader not participating the scoring race went to Tim Smith of Kangwon Land. He led the league with 30 goals. Patrik Martinec of Halla led the league with 53 assists and 71 points. The playoffs followed the same format as the year before and six teams advanced. Kangwon Land swept Halla in three games and Oji Paper beat the Ice Bucks three games to one. While it was inevitable with two Korean teams facing each other, it marks the first time a non-Japanese team won a playoff series in Asia League. The second round was over quickly as the Cranes and Rabbits who both had byes swept their opponents in three games each. For the third year in a row the final was between the Paper Cranes and the Rabbits. The Cranes took the series in four games. Joel Prpic won himself another scoring title as he led the playoffs in goals, 8, and points, 17. Kengo Itoh for the Cranes had the most assists with 13. At the awards ceremony Itoh also took the award for MVP of the Year while Jun Tonosaki received the award for <b>Young</b> <b>Guy</b> of the Year.|$|E
500|$|After {{several years}} of many changes to the teams, the 2008–09 season came with only one change. Oji Paper renamed {{themselves}} to Oji Eagles in July 2008. The league increased China's allowance to seven import players to help their competitiveness. Prior {{to the start of}} the regular season a series of exhibition games, dubbed [...] "Anyang Cup 2008" [...] was held in Anyang. Five of the seven teams in the league participated with the Ice Bucks and Rabbits sitting out. Oji won the exhibition tournament without losing a game. The league increased the number of games played to 36 and balanced the schedule by having all teams play each other an equal amount. Early in the season the Halla coach, Shim Eui-sik was suspended for refusal to play after a disputed goal against High1. Halla was forced to forfeit the game, but at the end of the regular season they had finished in first place with 76 points, becoming the first non-Japanese team to do so. Brock Radunske of Halla finished first in goals and points with 29 and 57 respectively. Kunihiko Sakurai, a previous MVP, finished on top with 40 assists in the regular season. The league reduced the number of teams making the playoffs and only five teams advanced. The first round saw a short three games series between the Cranes and High1. The Cranes swept High1 in two games. The second round found the regular season winners, Halla, facing the Cranes and Oji facing the Rabbits. Halla and the Cranes took it to seven games, but Halla lost on home ice. After the previous year's record setting playoff run, Oji found themselves swept by the Rabbits in four games. For the fourth time in five years the final was between the Rabbits and Cranes. The Cranes won for the second time. The Cranes swept the playoffs point race with Kengo Itoh taking the lead with 16 assists and 21 points. Masahito Nishiwaki led with 12 goals. Brock Radunske took the award for MVP of the Year marking the first time the award has gone to an import player. <b>Young</b> <b>Guy</b> of the Year went to Kim Ki-sung, also from Halla.|$|E

500|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} the first full season for the league, and was seen {{by some to be}} the inaugural season. Before the season began, there was already {{interest}} by the National Hockey League (NHL) in China's hockey program. In addition to the five teams which took part in the tournament the year before, the league added Golden Amur from Russia as well as Harbin and Qiqihar from China. The first season had a schedule of 42 games. Teams played each other six times during the season. In December 2004 there was speculation by the South Korean media that North Korea could potentially field a team in the league, but that never materialized. The league also had an all-star game which took place on [...] 22 and 23 January 2005 in Kushiro. The league was broken up into two teams, the Blue Orion and Red Antares. Fans voted on their favorite players and coaches. The most popular vote was for the forward position on the Blue Orion which received over 45,000 votes. Masatoshi Ito received the most votes with 9741. The skill competition and game were both won by the Blue Orion. The regular season finished with the Nippon Paper Cranes and Kokudo both having 98 points. After applying the league's tie-breaking procedure, the Nippon Paper Cranes were ranked first. The Nippon Paper Cranes also won the points race holding the top three spots in goals scored with Masatoshi Ito taking top honours at 33 goals. Darcy Mitani, also from the Cranes, took top spot in assists with 44 and points with 69. The playoffs saw the top four teams advance. The Golden Amur were swept in three games by Kokudo and the Cranes beat the Oji Paper in a close series, three games to one. The final was between the Cranes and Kokudo. While the Cranes won the first game, Kokudo won three games straight and won the playoffs. Chris Yule of Kokudo acquired ten points in the playoffs to lead the league while Chris Lindberg of the Cranes led the league in goals scored with six. Several players from Kokudo and the Cranes all had five assists. The 2005 ALH Awards were held in Tokyo and announced in April. Among the awards Kikuchi Naoya a goaltender for Kokudo was voted Most Valuable Player (MVP) and [...] Matsuda Keisuke of the Nikkō Ice Bucks was voted <b>Young</b> <b>Guy</b> of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Halla {{opened the}} 2009–10 {{season with a}} loss on home ice, but at the {{midpoint}} of the season they were tied for first place with the Oji Eagles. The league maintained the number of games at 36. The first half of the season saw Halla plagued with injuries. Particularly hard hit were the team's foreign imports. After the third game of the season Jon Awe was diagnosed with a sports hernia that required surgery and was scheduled to miss 8–12 weeks. On 29 November, Brad Fast received a knee injury that would sideline him for 4–6 months, ending his season. Brock Radunske was also on the injury list with a concussion, while Patrik Martinec was day to day with a lower-body injury. Halla replaced Awe quickly with Dustin Wood, who has played in both the American Hockey League and Deutsche Eishockey Liga. Fast was replaced by Lee Don-ku from Yonsei University. Halla also had several other regular players injured including Kim Won-jun, Kim Kyu-hun, and Lee Seung-yup. After 18 games Halla led the league with 94 goals. On 31 January 2010 Halla defeated the Oji Eagles in overtime by a score of 4–3, clinching first place {{for the second year in}} a row. The win also set up a semi-final match-up against Korean rivals High1, guaranteeing that a Korean team would appear in the final for the first time in league history. Halla won all of their series against opposing teams, except against their rival High1. Of 18 possible points available in their six-game series, Halla took only eight. They were the only team to win a series against the Nippon Paper Cranes. The team led the league in goals scored with 180. Individually, Kim Ki-sung led the team in goals scored with 22, while Patrik Martinec again led with 40 assists and 51 points. Halla finished with five players in the top ten point list. The team also led in both powerplay goals for, with 57, powerplay percentage, with 34.97%, and shorthanded goals for, with 10.
