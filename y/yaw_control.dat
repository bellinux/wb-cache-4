5|$|The {{satellite}} continued operations until February 25, 1982, when it {{was removed}} from operations due to a faulty <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> thruster. The satellite was placed in standby mode on March 31, 1983.|$|E
5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Flying wing {{configuration}} is {{a promising}} candidate for {{various kinds of}} unmanned aerial vehicles. However, this kind of configuration eliminates conventional vertical tail and rudder, thus existing severe problems on <b>yawing</b> <b>control.</b> To make the flying wing configuration into practical use, it is especially necessary to gain a deep understanding on the <b>control</b> characteristics of <b>yawing</b> <b>control</b> devices. To the innovative <b>yawing</b> <b>control</b> device: split-drag-rudder, which is most widely used on flying wing configuration, the paper introduced its current research and mechanical feature, then carefully analyzed its <b>yawing</b> <b>control</b> characteristics, three-axis control coupling effect, also influencing regularities on aerodynamics and stabilities. The conclusions can help to provide basis on engineering application for split-drag-rudder, and to some extent, help to solve the <b>yawing</b> <b>control</b> problem for the flying wing configuration. ...|$|R

40|$|Direct <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> is an {{effective}} means to enhance vehicle stability and handling. The majority of the latest direct <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> works employ sliding mode control to generate the target yaw moment. In this paper, a new sliding mode-based direct <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> method is proposed for electric and hybrid vehicles equipped with independent motors. This method employs a novel switching function design to simultaneously track the desired yaw rate and vehicle side-slip. Comparative simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method outperforms the conventional direct <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> method in terms of tracking the reference yaw rate, vehicle path and vehicle side-slip in various challenging driving scenarios...|$|R
5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>control.</b> The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E
25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by tilting the rotor fore and aft; roll control by tilting the rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the tilt of the rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides <b>yaw</b> <b>control.</b> On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed outboard of the propeller arc).|$|E
25|$|The piloted machine had wire-braced tandem wings (one {{behind the}} other). It had a Pénaud tail for pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> but no roll control, {{depending}} {{instead on the}} dihedral angle of the wings, as did the models, for maintaining roughly level flight.|$|E
40|$|Basically, {{there are}} two main {{techniques}} to <b>control</b> the vehicle <b>yaw</b> moment. First method is the indirect <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control,</b> which works on the basis of active steering control (ASC). The second one being the direct <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> (DYC), which is based on either the differential braking or the torque vectoring. An innovative idea for the direct <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> is introduced by using an active controller system to supervise the lat-eral dynamics of vehicle and perform as an active <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> system, denoted as the stabilizer pendulum system (SPS). This idea has further been developed, analyzed, and implemented in a standalone direct <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> system, as well as, in an inte-grated vehicle dynamic control system with a differential braking yaw moment controller. The effectiveness of SPS has been evaluated by model simulation, which illustrates its superior performance especially on low friction roads. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4027499]...|$|R

25|$|In {{spacecraft}} propulsion, rocket {{engines are}} generally {{mounted on a}} pair of gimbals to allow a single engine to vector thrust about both the pitch and yaw axes; or sometimes just one axis is provided per engine. To control roll, twin engines with differential pitch or <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> signals are used to provide torque about the vehicle's roll axis.|$|E
25|$|An {{autopilot}} used a Rate integrating gyroscope for directional control. The rate integrating gyroscope {{could be}} pre-programmed {{to turn the}} SM-73. Pitch and roll control were provided by elevons either operating in phase or asymmetrically. <b>Yaw</b> <b>control</b> was provided by a rudder. The control system positioned flight controls by sending electrical signals to hydraulic actuators located at each flight control.|$|E
25|$|The {{empennage}} of the MiG-21 {{consists of}} a vertical stabilizer, a stabilator and a small fin {{on the bottom of}} the tail to improve <b>yaw</b> <b>control.</b> The vertical stabilizer has a sweep angle of 60° and an area of 5.32m² (on earlier version 3.8m²) and a rudder. The stabilator has a sweep angle of 57°, an area of 3.94m² and a span of 2.6m.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>yaw</b> stability <b>control</b> {{system for a}} vehicle. At least one yaw rate sensor (5) is arranged to generate a signal indicative of the vehicle yaw rate. A controller is responsive to a yaw rate error. The controller is arranged to activate <b>yaw</b> angle <b>control</b> part (1) of the controller, {{in response to a}} body-force-disturbance being detected by at least one body-force-disturbance detection unit (7), and to start performing <b>control</b> of the <b>yaw</b> angle error in order to obtain a correction of the vehicle yaw angle resulting from the body-force-disturbance, and input to the system for performing vehicle <b>yaw</b> stability <b>control</b> operations (6) a signal to perform a body-force-disturbance <b>yaw</b> stability <b>control</b> operation for eliminating the vehicle yaw angle resulting from the body-force-disturbance and returning the vehicle to a pre body-force-disturbance heading...|$|R

50|$|Flight {{controls}} allow {{pilots to}} control the collective (or throttle, on fixed pitch helicopters), the cyclic controls (pitch and roll), and the tail rotor (<b>yaw).</b> <b>Controlling</b> these in unison enables the helicopter to perform the same maneuvers as full-sized helicopters, such as hovering and backwards flight, and many that full-sized helicopters cannot, such as inverted flight (where collective pitch control provides negative blade pitch to hold heli up inverted, and pitch/yaw controls must be reversed by pilot).|$|R
25|$|The Saunders-Roe Skeeter {{is a light}} all-metal, two-seat {{single-rotor}} helicopter, {{complete with}} a tail rotor for torque compensation and <b>yaw</b> <b>control.</b> It was intended to perform as an all-purpose rotorcraft, primarily being used for light civil {{work as well as}} aerial observation and training missions in military service. The handling characteristics were broadly similar to comparably-sized rotorcraft of the era, while possessing the necessary simplicity, robustness, and reliability that commonly typified trainer aircraft.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: control stick, rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide <b>yaw</b> <b>control,</b> and the throttle controls engine power.|$|E
25|$|The alloy box {{structure}} {{was attached to}} and carried a box girder tail boom on which the engine, a horizontal tailplane and vertical stabilizer and rudder surfaces were mounted. The rudder projected beneath the boom into the jet efflux and provided effective <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> even when the aircraft was stationary. The undercarriage was a simple pair of tubular steel skids directly attached to the box structure, porter bars could {{be attached to the}} skids to allow the rotorcraft to be carried by hand.|$|E

The decoupling of {{the control of the}} active steering control (AFS) and the direct <b>yaw</b> moment <b>control</b> (DYC) as a way of controlling the vehicle’s body slip angle and its yaw rate simultaneously, also allows the stabilization of the lateral motion of the EV.

50|$|The canard surface {{controls}} pitch, while roll is via conventional ailerons. <b>Yaw</b> is <b>controlled</b> with wing-tip rudders. The aircraft is {{advertised as}} spin-proof.|$|R
25|$|As above for {{pitch and}} roll, {{but with the}} rudder locked and the pedals {{operating}} the ailerons / airbrakes differentially for <b>yaw,</b> lateral <b>control</b> prove barely adequate.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{asymmetrical}} thrust {{has been}} used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the throttles to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> can be combined with pitch control. If the aircraft is yawing, then the wing on the outside of this yaw movement will go faster than the inner wing. This creates higher lift on the faster wing, resulting in a rolling movement, which helps to make a turn.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} version had two cabane struts of long chord length supporting the upper wing. Four similar type interplane struts were used between the upper three wings, {{all of which}} had ailerons. The bottom wing had a shorter span with pairs of struts and cut outs for the landing gear wheels. Because the axle was the same height as the lower wing, the tailskid was very tall to prevent that wings trailing edge from contacting the ground. When tested in mid 1916 the aircraft had difficulty taking off due to shallow wing incidence and displayed dangerous tendencies {{because of a lack}} of <b>yaw</b> <b>control</b> and a major redesign was required.|$|E
25|$|The Do 32 was {{structurally}} very simple, with {{a square}} section, tapering fuselage behind the pilot. The BMW 6012L turbine and compressor {{were placed on}} top of the fuselage, immediately behind the rotor pylon. Its exhaust impinged upon a large rectangular rudder, built to resist thermal stresses, for <b>yaw</b> <b>control.</b> The horizontal tailplane was swept. The pilot sat in front of the rotor pylon, on a simple seat, carried on the lower longerons. He controlled the plane of the two-bladed rotor directly with a long curved hanging arm, and its pitch with a conventional collective pitch lever by his left side. The rudder pedals were almost straight {{out in front of him}} on a strut that also carried, beyond his feet, some simple instruments. This member also formed part of the simple three-legged undercarriage, each strut ending with an unsprung foot.|$|E
25|$|With {{pitch control}} {{provided}} by all four elevons, roll by the split ailerons (operating together), speed / approach control by split ailerons / airbrakes and <b>yaw</b> <b>controlled</b> by the rudder. In this configuration the aircraft {{proved to be}} stable in pitch, {{being able to be}} flown hands-off during aero-tow, and pitch could be controlled simply by the pilot leaning forwards or backwards to adjust the centre of gravity. Lateral stability was noted to be poor to fair but acceptable and the aircraft was safe and capable of flying simple aerobatics.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{degrees of}} freedom vehicle dynamic model is established.
