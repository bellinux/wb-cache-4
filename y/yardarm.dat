5|$|After {{the end of}} World War I Kilkis saw {{service in}} the Allied {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea. While supporting the French and British forces defending Sevastopol in April 1919, Kilkis observed mutinies on several French battleships. Her crew taunted the French mutineers by hanging a dummy from the <b>yardarm.</b> Kilkis then returned to Greece. During the subsequent Greco-Turkish War, Kilkis served in support of landings to seize Ottoman territory. On 15 May 1919, she {{and a pair of}} destroyers escorted a convoy of six transports carrying the troops that undertook the occupation of Smyrna and its environs. Kilkis carried Rear Admiral Kaloulides, who thereafter served as the military governor of the city. The Ottoman Navy had been interned by the Allies after the end of World War I, and so provided no opposition to the Royal Hellenic Navy's activities.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{international}} conventions on flying the flag, but protocol {{adopted by a}} large number of countries have such similarities as to suggest lines of commonly accepted practice. In general two areas of exposure are identified: national and international events. In both cases it is generally followed practice that national flags displayed in a group should be of equal size and each hoisted on its own flagstaff, of equal height, or on separate ropes if fixed on <b>yardarm.</b> The flag is flown from sunrise to sunset, except in case of bad weather; exhibition at night is permitted provided it is adequately illuminated. The flag is raised and lowered vividly and with solemnity; it is always treated with dignity and should never be allowed to touch the ground or water. Vertical hoist is transformationally identical to horizontal hoist (i.e. the flag is rotated 90 degrees).|$|E
25|$|Admiral Linois is a French admiral whom Jack Aubrey first {{encounters}} in Master and Commander when the Sophie is taken by his squadron in the Mediterranean. Later, after Aubrey has been paroled, Linois and his ships {{are involved in}} Sir James Saumarez's battle against a combined French and Spanish fleet in the Gut of Gibraltar. In HMS Surprise Jack, {{with the assistance of}} a fleet of armed merchant ships belonging to the British East India Company, fights against Linois' squadron, taking the Surprise into a <b>yardarm</b> to <b>yardarm</b> battle (a cannon duel at almost touching range) against Linois' 74 gun ship of the line, the Marengo.|$|E

25|$|The whale carcass still {{lies in the}} water. Queequeg mounts it, tied to Ishmael's belt by a monkey-rope as if {{they were}} Siamese twins. Stubb and Flask kill a right whale whose head is {{fastened}} to a <b>yardarm</b> opposite the sperm whale's head. Ishmael compares the two heads in a philosophical way: the right whale is Lockean, stoic, and the sperm whale as Kantean, platonic. Tashtego cuts into the head of the sperm whale and retrieves buckets of oil. He falls into the head, and the head falls off the <b>yardarm</b> into the sea. Queequeg dives after him and frees his mate with his sword.|$|E
25|$|The Union Jack is worn at the {{masthead}} {{of a ship}} {{to indicate}} {{the presence of the}} Sovereign or an Admiral of the Fleet. The Union Flag may also be flown from the <b>yardarm</b> to indicate that a court-martial is in progress, though these are now normally held at shore establishments.|$|E
25|$|When in port, the ensign {{should always}} be flown from {{the staff at the}} stern. This is traditional, because in former times the gaff was then lowered along with the mizzen sail. The only ensign ever flown from the {{starboard}} spreader or <b>yardarm</b> is that of a nation being visited. This is known as a courtesy hoisting of a courtesy Flag.|$|E

50|$|King Philip, at {{the time}} also king of Portugal, was accused of cruelty for his hanging of {{supporters}} of António, Prior of Crato, the rival contender for the throne of Portugal, on <b>yardarms</b> on the Azores islands, following the Battle of Ponta Delgada.|$|R
25|$|During this time, Roberts {{reportedly}} {{caught the}} Governor of Martinique, who was sailing aboard a 52-gun French warship. The Governor was caught and promptly hanged on the <b>yardarm</b> {{of his own}} ship, which the pirates converted into the new Royal Fortune. According to Konstam and Rickman, this reported capture was an embellishment by Captain Charles Johnson in his A General History of the Pyrates.|$|E
25|$|An {{enlarged}} {{version of}} the very numerous Albacore class, they reflected the change in use from coastal operations towards deep-water cruising, but were delivered too late to see action in the Crimean War. They were the first class of Royal Navy gunboat to incorporate a hoisting screw, which gave them improved performance under sail. Of note, the last man hung from the <b>yardarm</b> in the Royal Navy was a Royal Marine executed on 13 July 1860 in Leven.|$|E
25|$|The hanging of Reginald Birchall in Woodstock, Ont. in November 1890 {{seems to}} be the last time a device of this kind was used. Radclive had first been exposed to executions as a Royal Navy seaman helping with {{shipboard}} hangings of pirates in the South China Sea, and it is possible he was trying to approximate something similar to hanging a man on a ship's <b>yardarm.</b> After Birchall's hanging, Radclive used the traditional long drop method, as did his successors.|$|E

25|$|The {{state of}} Louisiana refused to {{extradite}} {{most of the}} sailors accused of mutiny and killing Lieutenant Fuller. Furthermore, many witnesses had gone down with their ship when it was lost in October. Nevertheless, Commodore Moore tried those hands aboard his flagship in April 1843. Three were sentenced to lashes, and four were sentenced to death. They were hanged from the <b>yardarm</b> of the Austin on 26 April 1843. Sergeant Oswald escaped jail in New Orleans and was never brought to justice, and Frederick Shepard, a mutineer who was spared because he testifying against the others, was killed in action three weeks later in the Naval Battle of Campeche.|$|E
25|$|In 1749, Peter Cartcel, {{a sailor}} aboard a {{ship in the}} Halifax harbour, stabbed Abraham Goodsides to death and wounded two other men. He was brought before a Captain's Court where he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Two days later he was hanged from the <b>yardarm</b> of the vessel as a {{deterrent}} to others. This is one of the earliest records of capital punishment in English-speaking Canada. It is difficult to accurately state numbers of capital punishment since there were no systematic efforts to accurately record names, dates, and locations of executions until after 1867, and many records have been lost because of fires, floods, or decay.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October Griffon {{was in the}} Downs and Gamage was in command, Trollope {{having gone}} ashore. Gamage was a mild man who, in a sudden and uncharacteristic fit of rage, stabbed an insubordinate {{sergeant}} of Marines {{to death with a}} sword thrust. A court martial on 27 October found Gamage guilty of murder and sentenced him to hang. Appeals for clemency, including from the crew, were rejected and Gamage was hanged on 23 November from Griffons <b>yardarm.</b> As was customary, all vessels in the Downs sent two boats alongside Griffon to witness the execution; the men who remained on the vessels were required to watch from the decks of their vessels.|$|E
50|$|A square rig {{is a type}} of sail and rigging {{arrangement}} in which the primary driving sails are carried on horizontal spars which are perpendicular, or , to the keel of the vessel and to the masts.

25|$|Another legend {{alleges that}} a common sailor on the flagship, {{tried to warn}} Shovell that the fleet was off course but Shovell had him hanged at the <b>yardarm</b> for inciting mutiny. The story first {{appeared}} in the Scilly Isles in 1780, with the common sailor being a Scilly native, who recognized the waters as being close to home but was punished for warning the admiral. While it is possible that a sailor may have debated the vessel's location and feared for its fate (such debates were common upon entering the English Channel, as noted by Samuel Pepys in 1684), the story has been repeatedly discredited by naval scholars, who noted the lack of any evidence in contemporary documents, its fanciful stock conventions and dubious origins. After his death Shovell became a popular British hero.|$|E
25|$|The Liberal {{government}} was {{weakened by the}} failure of the naval attacks and the first landings in Gallipoli, {{by the failure of}} the offensive at Neuve Chapelle, and by the Shell Crisis. The Cabinet was bickering and some members plotted against others. Churchill himself aimed to replace Sir Edward Grey as Foreign Secretary with Balfour. The historian Stephen Koss has argued that Churchill himself created the Shell Crisis. He states that during a visit to BEF Headquarters on 8 May he arranged with Colonel Charles à Court Repington, the Times correspondent there to publish the reports of the lack of shells. James discounts this argument. On 15 May Fisher resigned as First Sea Lord. He presented the Cabinet with a list of demands; if these were satisfied he would return to office. The first of these was that Churchill would be dismissed from Cabinet altogether. Fisher's demands were extreme, the King saying that Fisher should be hung from the <b>yardarm,</b> but his resignation precipitated a Cabinet crisis.|$|E
25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a <b>yardarm</b> and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|From 1580 to 1640, {{the throne}} of Portugal was held by the Habsburg kings of Spain {{resulting}} in the biggest colonial empire until then (see Iberian Union). In 1583 Philip I of Portugal, II of Spain, sent his combined Iberian fleet to clear the French traders from the Azores, decisively hanging his prisoners-of-war from the <b>yardarms</b> and contributing to the [...] "Black Legend". The Azores were {{the last part of}} Portugal to resist Philip's reign over Portugal.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of World War II Captain F. S.

5000|$|In 1886, Cope [...] erected the new genus Naosaurus [...] "ship lizard" [...] (from Greek naos [...] "ship") for {{skeletal}} remains {{similar to those}} of the long-spined Dimetrodon but with distinctive [...] "transverse processes or branches which resemble the <b>yardarms</b> of a ship's mast". He speculated that [...] "the <b>yardarms</b> were connected by membranes with the neural spine or mast, thus serving the animal as a sail with which he navigated the waters of the Permian lakes". He recognized three species: Naosaurus claviger [...] "club-bearer" [...] (for the projections on its spines; now considered a synonym of Edaphosaurus pogonias); Naosaurus cruciger [...] "cross-bearer" [...] (for the projections on its spines; first described by Cope as Dimetrodon cruciger in 1878; now Edaphosaurus cruciger, the largest species in size); and Naosaurus microdus [...] "small tooth" [...] (first described as Edaphosaurus microdus in 1884). Cope noted some incomplete skull material found associated with the specimens of N. claviger and N. microdus, but thought Naosaurus was distinct from Edaphosaurus. He later decided that Naosaurus must have had a large carnivorous skull similar to Dimetrodon, although he had no direct fossil proof.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 March, while sailing near the Louisiade Islands, one of the ship's stokers was stabbed {{fourteen}} times, and died from peritonitis during the night. Before dying, the stoker informed the ship's surgeon that he had threatened to expose the homosexual relationship between two other stokers, {{which led to the}} attack. The two accused stokers were imprisoned, and a court-martial was held between 15 and 18 March, while the ship was anchored at Nouméa. The stokers were found guilty of the first ever murder aboard an Australian warship; under British naval regulations (which the RAN was operating under), the men were to be hanged from the cruiser's <b>yardarm.</b> However, despite Captain Harold Farncomb's aggressive prosecution of the two men, he successfully requested that the death sentences be put off at least until the ship returned home. As the men were convicted under British military law, the matter of commuting their sentences was out of Australian hands until an appeal for clemency was made to King George VI, who downgraded the sentence to life imprisonment. This situation had arisen because the Australian government had not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster 1931, a British Act which defined the Dominions as sovereign governments capable of amending or repealing previous British legislation affecting them, while preventing the British government from legislating on the Dominions' behalf unless requested. Prompted by the murder, along with issues relating to the legal control of shipping in Australian ports, and the National Security Act, a bill ratifying the Statute was passed on 9 October and backdated {{to the start of the}} war. The sentences of the two stokers were reduced several times, and they were freed in September 1950.|$|E
500|$|On 26 October 1792 Heywood and Morrison {{received}} royal pardons from King George III {{and were}} released. Muspratt, through his lawyer, won a {{stay of execution}} by filing a petition protesting that court martial rules had prevented his calling Norman and Byrne as witnesses in his defence. He was still awaiting the outcome when Burkett, Ellison and Millward were hanged from the <b>yardarm</b> of [...] in Portsmouth dock on 28 October. Some accounts claim that the condemned trio continued to protest their innocence until the last moment, while others speak of their [...] "manly firmness that... was the admiration of all". There was some unease expressed in the press—a suspicion that [...] "money had bought the lives of some, and others fell sacrifice to their poverty." [...] A report that Heywood was heir to a large fortune was unfounded; nevertheless, Dening asserts that [...] "in {{the end it was}} class or relations or patronage that made the difference." [...] In December Muspratt heard that he was reprieved, and on 11 February 1793 he, too, was pardoned and freed.|$|E
