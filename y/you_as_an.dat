[...] Balachander's letter {{has been described by}} Sify as Rajinikanth's [...] "most prized moment and possession". Following its success, Mullum Malarum was remade in Malayalam by Sreekumaran Thampi as Venalil Oru Mazha (1979) and in Hindi by Bapu as Pyari Behna (1985). It was also dubbed in Telugu as Mullu Puvvu.|$|E
500|$|Numerous hip hop {{fans and}} certain rappers mocked West for {{becoming}} [...] "sappy" [...] while others deemed the upcoming LP as a throwaway experimental album. Comparisons {{were drawn to}} Electric Circus, an album recorded by West's labelmate and close friend Common. MTV eventually interviewed Common to share his thoughts and views on the artistic direction of the album. Common expressed both his understanding and his support for West's intentions, stating [...] "I love it. I'mma tell <b>you,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist, you wanna be free. I'mma do what I feel. You can't just cater to the audience. You gotta say, 'Hey, y'all, this is where I'm at.' For him to do an album called 808s and Heartbreak, you know that's where he is at this moment. I heard some songs, and I think it's fresh. I think the people are ready for it." ...|$|E

[...] She notes that Clarissa Dickson-Wright [...] "makes a good case" [...] for giving Glasse this much credit, that Glasse had found a gap in the market, and had the distinctions of simplicity, an [...] "appetising repertoire", and a lightness of touch. Prince quotes the food writer Bee Wilson: [...] "She's authoritative but she is also intimate, treating <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> equal", and concludes [...] "A perfect book, then; one that deserved the acclaim it received." [...] Jane Shilling, writing in Mail Online, agrees, noting that [...] "Glasse writes in the same sort of chatty, intimate style that makes Delia and Nigella's books so comforting for the nervous cook: Glasse concludes one chapter 'You must do just as you like it'." ...|$|E

500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever <b>you,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{courtesy}} and chivalry of Crillon attracted much admiration {{during his lifetime}} and afterwards. As the English anecdotist William Seward put it in 1798, [...] "Courtesy, no less than courage, was always the appenage {{of the family of}} Crillon". During the siege of Gibraltar, he sent his English opponent General George Eliott a gift of fruits, vegetables and game, along with some ice, which he presumed [...] "will not be disagreeable in the excessive heat of this climate at this season of the year." [...] He expressed his [...] "pleasure to which I look forward of becoming your friend, after I shall have learned to render myself worthy of the honour, by facing <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> enemy." [...] Five years later, when his old adversary Eliott was promoted to the peerage and became Lord Heathfield, Crillon wrote to his [...] "dear and respectable enemy", whom he now considered a friend, to offer his congratulations.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, and marked his directorial debut. Because of his position as both the writer of the episode and the director, Spotnitz later noted {{that it was hard}} to achieve perfection when filming the episode. However, he did note that, as both the writer and director, he had more creative control than usual. Originally Spotnitz did not have plans to direct the episode but was encouraged to do so by David Duchovny; Duchovny reminded Spotnitz that it would be the last Monster-of-the-Week (stand alone) episode to feature his character, Fox Mulder. After production and shooting was finalized, the rough cut of [...] "Alone" [...] was nine minutes over time and in order to compensate for the time, various sections were cut during final editing. Robert Patrick was very pleased with Spotnitz's work, stating, [...] "You're talking about some incredibly intelligent individuals, and they were very willing to let <b>you,</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist, discover what they were trying to do with the role. That's a wonderful environment to work in." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E
500|$|Willoughby's {{wardrobe}} {{was designed}} to reflect his [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "fashionable" [...] nature, while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth-century rural colours. With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed {{to be out of}} date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, [...] "Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home." [...] She added that the director had wanted the characters to [...] "feel more human." [...] Morrissey commented that the period costumes were [...] "slightly uncomfortable" [...] for modern life, {{but as soon as the}} cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made that way. He added, [...] "When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture – posture was different then, and that's important. But they give you a feel for the character which is really an advantage to <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actor." ...|$|E

He preferred large casts of actors, natural overlapping conversations, and encouraged his actors to improvise and express their innate creativity, but without fear of failing.

2500|$|In August, November and December 1887 respectively, {{the first}} three volumes of the {{collection}} Novellas and Short Stories by N. S. Leskov were published. At the 1888 New Year party at Alexei Suvorin's, Leskov met Anton Chekhov for the first time. Soon Ilya Repin became Leskov's friend and illustrator. Several months later in a letter, asking Leskov to sit for him, Repin explained his motives: [...] "Not only me but the whole of enlightened Russia loves <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> outstanding, distinguished writer and as a thinking man." [...] The sittings early the next year were aborted: Leskov was unwilling to have his portrait seen at a forthcoming exhibition of Repin's works.|$|E
