5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I know it is. I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether <b>you</b> <b>put</b> another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E

5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where <b>you</b> <b>put</b> little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
25|$|Proton's then Senior Director Operations, Dr. Wolfgang Karl Epple {{revealed}} that the Prevé was developed by an international consortium consisting of experts from Malaysia, Italy, France, Germany and South Korea. Additionally, several components of the car are also sourced from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Europe. “If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> global ingredients in the components, people, processes, styling and packaging, you get something which is global.”, Epple commented. Nonetheless, Proton later claimed that 94% of the Prevé's components are locally sourced {{in an effort to}} reduce capital outflow.|$|E
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on the gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe {{a quarter of the}} way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the hell business is it of yours? You just shut your mouth, and stay out of it. Because in the future, we gonna become a nation.

25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a person’s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to get}} to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to remember where <b>you</b> <b>put</b> a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{scientific}} sources {{report that}} the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Professor Douglas Melton, of the Harvard University Biology department, said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." [...] Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that [...] "If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out." ...|$|E

500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You can do whatever <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your mind to. If you're lazy, you're {{not going to get}} it done. But if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the prostitution plot, Christina Hendricks said, [...] "This {{is a very}} confusing situation for Joan and for everyone involved. First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then {{all of a sudden}} <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the money involved or the opportunity involved or <b>you</b> <b>put</b> a label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down." [...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E
500|$|Milk's {{reception}} by the gay {{political establishment}} in San Francisco was icy. Jim Foster, who had by then {{been active in}} gay politics for 10 years, resented the newcomer's asking for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, [...] "There's an old saying in the Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless <b>you</b> <b>put</b> up the chairs. I've never seen <b>you</b> <b>put</b> up the chairs." [...] Milk was furious at the patronizing snub, and the conversation {{marked the beginning of}} an antagonistic relationship between the [...] "Alice" [...] Club and Harvey Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.|$|E

500|$|Each chapter {{begins with}} a section of [...] "Observations" [...] {{on the topic of}} the chapter; thus, Chapter 3 has three pages of [...] "Observations on Roasting and Boiling".

500|$|Critics {{compared}} [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] {{to previous}} works by Ne-Yo. Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "second cousin" [...] of Ne-Yo's singles [...] "Sexy Love" [...] and [...] "Because of You".

500|$|Devon Powers of PopMatters complimented Fanning's vocals, {{and said}} {{the focus of the}} album was [...] "meaty, rolling ballads". Powers said that many of the songs on the album were [...] "the kind of songs <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on repeat for hours, or days". The main {{critique}} was for the [...] "faster numbers", stating that [...] "Like a Dog" [...] "sounds mostly a little bored". The review concluded by noting that the best songs on Odyssey were those not available as [...] "fleeting radio singles and background music".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} this {{systematic}} approach forced other teams to follow. Most of Brown's organizational innovations are still in use today. [...] "No one, I mean no one, has ever had total command and respect like Paul Brown", Paul Wiggin, a former Browns defensive end, said in 1997. [...] "I believe that Paul Brown {{could have been a}} general in the Army ... <b>you</b> <b>put</b> Paul Brown in charge of anything and he would have been one of those special people who could organize and lead." ...|$|E
