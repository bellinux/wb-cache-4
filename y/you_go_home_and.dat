500|$|At Warren's first Banking Committee {{hearing in}} February 2013, she pressed several banking {{regulators}} to answer {{when they had}} last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and stated, [...] "I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'." [...] Videos of Warren's questioning became popular on the Internet, amassing {{more than one million}} views in a matter of days. At a Banking Committee hearing in March, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. With her questions being continually dodged, Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: [...] "If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> sleep in your own bed at night." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gehad El-Haddad, {{spokesman}} of the Muslim Brotherhood {{criticized the}} military's move comparing it with Mubarak era tactics. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> you watch TV {{and they are}} calling you a terrorist and your leadership is locked up, you may join your neighbors and do something dangerous," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Niver mind,’ replies the {{opposition}} expressively, ‘niver mind; <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and,</b> ven you’re quite sober, mend your stockings.’ ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. Nothing more wanted, thank you, Paynter. <b>You</b> can <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> {{the maids}} {{can go to}} bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Bill, drily, [...] "he figures he's a bloomin' admiral in the meanwhile, and that's {{good enough}} for <b>you.</b> <b>Go</b> <b>home</b> again, <b>and</b> don't worry me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Kobolds said {{it would}} be so because you tried so hard to be and do good! Now <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> lead a happy life in Fairyland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you'll have to {{come with}} me," [...] said Trot decidedly, [...] "for I'm going to 'cept this inv'tation. If you don't care to come, Cap'n Bill, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> tell mother I'm visitin' the mermaids." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, I {{have not}} {{got to decide}} until to-morrow; <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> think it over, and if you come {{in the morning with}} your mind made up, I will speak to the officer here and ask him if they will take us both.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have simply}} {{got to do}} it, Doctor!" [...] cried Dave. [...] "I shall {{not be able to}} settle my mind on a thing until it's done. Would <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> see Mr. Wadsworth and Professor Potts first, or go direct to that sailor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you think," [...] said Miss Harriet, {{taking a}} seat {{opposite}} the old lady, [...] "that {{it is about}} time for <b>you</b> to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> attend to your affairs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, my Naval Bazaar at five-thirty; {{and while}} I'm there <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> have a rest, and freshen {{yourself}} {{up for the}} evening. We dine at Plassey House." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you didn't, cook; but I'll {{tell you}} what I'm coming to, cook. <b>You</b> must <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> be born over again; you don't know how to cook a whale-steak yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it {{has been}} so, but it shall not be so again, not while I am your chief," [...] Curtis responded. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> do as I have commanded? Will you search hard and bring me word what you discover?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come away, James! I {{think we}} are not wanted any more here," [...] says the Colonel. [...] "Good-night, boys. Some ladies in Hill Street won't {{be able to sleep}} for this strange news. Or will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> sup with 'em, and tell them the story?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'You doen't ought--a {{married man}} like you--or what's as good--to take and hull away a day's work. And you doen't ought {{to watch and}} work both. That won't do. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> turn in. You ain't afeerd of Em'ly not being took good care on, I know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> burn all the poetry--all the manuscripts, {{and never}} let the {{children}} write a verse--a verse--when I am dead?" [...] And his head sank back, and his jaw dropped.|$|R
6000|$|... "This one {{shall be}} put right, at any rate," [...] he promised her. [...] "Now, {{if you will}} take my advice, <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> lie down until the evening. You are going to sing again, aren't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, {{not quite}} as civilly as I {{generally}} speak to people older than myself, [...] "your boat has gone, that is plain enough. I suppose, when your family came from the light-house, they thought <b>you</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> so <b>went</b> themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Donald, my boy, I have {{a strong}} desire to be alone--that is, to try if I cannot go {{the rest of the way}} without guidance; so, if you will just give me a little direction, I'll let <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> many thanks for coming thus far. Now, point out the landmarks." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rilla {{shut her}} little white teeth {{together}} with a snap. [...] "Heaven grant me patience," [...] she said under her breath. [...] "I'll do it then," [...] she said aloud, [...] "and meanwhile, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> make what preparations you can. When I 'phone down to you {{to come up and}} help me sew come at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Mr. Mohun, 'I {{prescribe}} for {{you that}} <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> lie down. I am going to Raynham, and I will tell your friend there that you want help for the evening service. Do not think of moving again to-day. I shall send Claude home with you {{to see that you}} obey my prescription.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Lee.—‘Oh! he must <b>go.</b> Mr. Scott, <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> <b>home</b> immediately, <b>and</b> make {{yourself}} acquainted with that cause, before our consultation this evening.’ ” ...|$|R
60|$|Warn. To confess {{the truth}} on't, you had angered me, and I {{was willing to}} {{evaporate}} my choler; if you will pass it by so, I may chance to help you to your mistress: No more words of this business, I advise <b>you,</b> but <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> grease your back.|$|R
6000|$|... "But must <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> yet?" [...] she asked. [...] "Yes, {{the sand}} has nearly slipped away, I see, and the eclipse is {{creeping}} on more and more. Don't go yet! Stop till the hour has run itself out; then I will not press you any more. <b>You</b> will <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> sleep well; I keep sighing in my sleep! Do you ever dream of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why are you {{loitering}} around here? Why don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> do up your chores before dark?' he croaked in a {{way that}} didn't please me a little bit, for I'm not the kind of rabbit that neglects his family, except, perhaps, when there's something important on hand for me to watch and I told him so plainly; but he croaked again: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Miss Harvey. I have been rude--mad. If you will {{look in your}} glass when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> have a woman's heart in you, you may at least see an excuse for me: but like Mr. Trebooze I am not. Forgive and forget, and let us walk home rationally." [...] And he offered to take her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said a big {{powerful}} man, collaring a great lad who {{had been}} thrusting forward at Lance's defiance, 'we don't have no mills with natomies like <b>you!</b> <b>Go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> mind yer own business. Your father was another guess sort of parson, and I'll not see a finger laid on you. Be off, till we've given that other bad lot a bit of our mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Radbourn became alarmed for him, {{and advised}} him to get {{indefinite}} leave of absence <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> [...] "Go back into the haying-field; that's what you need; they won't miss <b>you</b> here. <b>Go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> out of politics, and stay out till the revolution comes; then go out and chalk death on your enemies' door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{it is in}} {{the nature}} of its {{influence}} not to endure. At this moment, I repeat, your lordship may perhaps love Miss Herbert; <b>you</b> may <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> muse over her memory, and even deplore in passionate verses your misery in being separated from her; but, {{in the course of a}} few days, she will be again forgotten.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You most {{certainly}} are not. You're drenched. She threw <b>you</b> twice. <b>Go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> change. <b>You</b> {{may have to}} be out again all night. It's only half-past seven now. I'm perfectly safe.' She flung herself lightly over a stile, and hurried uphill by the foot-path, out of reach of all but the boasts of the flood below.|$|R
6000|$|Van Helsing {{returned}} {{in a couple}} of hours, and presently said to me: [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I stay here tonight, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave reasons. No, do not ask me. Think what you will. Do not fear to think even the most not-improbable. Goodnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you have}} {{answered}} me," [...] cried the First and Foremost. [...] "For that reason alone we will aid <b>you.</b> <b>Go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> tell your bandy-legged king {{that as soon}} as his tunnel is finished the Phanfasms will be with him and lead his legions to the conquest of Oz. The deadly desert alone has kept us from destroying Oz long ago, and your underground tunnel is a clever thought. Go home, and prepare for our coming!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go home," [...] said Dry Valley. [...] "Go home to your mother. I wonder lightnin' don't {{strike a}} fool like me. Go home {{and play in}} the sand. What {{business}} have you got cavortin' around with grown men? I reckon I was locoed to be makin' a he poll-parrot out of myself for a kid like <b>you.</b> <b>Go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> don't let me see you no more. Why I done it, will somebody tell me? Go home, and let me try and forget it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{may not be}} able {{to convict}} me, and if instead of rushing the {{sergeant}} <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> help Thorn with the sowing, we may beat him yet," [...] I continued. [...] "Even if I am convicted, I'll come back again, and stay right here until Lane is broken, or one of us is dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>you</b> would <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> Phil, <b>and</b> {{this would}} be over. But'--seeing his brother's terror--'there is no fear of that. She is not like to wish to poison me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not long. But I must go now. And {{remember}} what I told you, Tessa. Nobody {{must know that}} you ever see me, else you will lose me for ever. And now, when I have left <b>you,</b> <b>go</b> straight <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> never follow me again. Wait till I come to you. Good-bye, my little Tessa: I will come." ...|$|R
