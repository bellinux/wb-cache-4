500|$|... "Pon de Replay" [...] is a dance-pop, dancehall and R {{song that}} infuses a reggae style. According to the digital music sheet {{published}} at musicnotes.com, {{the song is}} written in the key of F-sharp minor and is set in common time with a moderated dance groove, with a metronome of 100 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F♯3 to the high note of C♯5. Lyrically, the song is about asking the DJ to play the protagonist's favorite song, {{as well as the}} fulfillment of dancing in a club. Doug Rule of Metro Weekly commented on the lyric [...] "Hey Mr. DJ, won't <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> music up?" [...] and that it follows in the footsteps of recent songs which also incorporated [...] "Hey Mr. DJ", including Madonnas [...] "Music" [...] and Jennifer Lopezs [...] "Play".|$|E
500|$|On {{references}} to the larger MCU, Ramirez said [...] "those little Easter eggs that come along the way are fun", but {{there were times when}} the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters. Petrie stated that the writers wanted to [...] "keep it in Hell's Kitchen" [...] and focus on issues such as [...] "the air conditioner doesn’t work at Nelson and Murdock. That’s really what we’re interested in." [...] He explained that the real life New York City [...] "has a larger than life presence" [...] with celebrities that live there—"If you see Derek Jeter walking down the street, that’s great, but then <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> corner and you get into an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel. We want our guys to be real New Yorkers." ...|$|E
500|$|Bart was {{described}} as [...] "television's king of 1990", [...] "television's brightest new star" [...] and an [...] "undiminished smash". Entertainment Weekly named Bart the [...] "entertainer of the year" [...] for 1990, writing that [...] "Bart {{has proved to be}} a rebel who's also a good kid, a terror who's easily terrorized, and a flake who astonishes us, and himself, with serious displays of fortitude." [...] In the United States congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial elections of 1990, Bart was one of the most popular write-in candidates, and in many areas was second only to Mickey Mouse amongst fictional characters. In the 1990 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Bart made his debut as one of the giant helium-filled balloons for which the parade is known. The Bart Simpson balloon has appeared at every parade since. This was referenced in The Simpsons in the episode [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving", which aired the same day as the parade, where Homer tells Bart, [...] "If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> parade into a farce!" [...] Meanwhile, behind and unbeknownst to him, the television briefly shows a Bart Simpson balloon.|$|E

500|$|With Brown and Damiani's departure, McCrea felt [...] "freer to experiment" [...] {{with the}} next album, 1998's Prolonging the Magic; he wrote and {{produced}} every song. As {{a result of this}} experimentation, the album was noted as [...] "loaded with spiced-up instrumentation, including a few new ingredients like the pedal steel guitar and musical saw thrown in for extra flavour". McCrea stated that he deliberately [...] "approached writing this record without the guitar as the central assumption of all life in the universe". Music Week described it as an [...] "inspired collection of leftfield rock", while Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News said that it [...] "brims with the same dry humor the Sacramento band displayed in past hits such as 'The Distance' and 'Rock and Roll Lifestyle': The leadoff track, 'Satan Is My Motor,' puts a devilish new spin on the rock 'n' roll car-song tradition, while 'When You Sleep' revolves around the question of what your fingers do {{while the rest of the}} body snoozes". Other reviewers were less complimentary, with Mike Pattenden in The Times writing that [...] "Prolonging the Magic suggests that [...] may well be destined to go down as one-hit wonders...While a handful stand out – the country waltz Mexico, <b>You</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>the</b> Screws and Hem of Your Garment – Prolonging the Magic shows McRea and company to be little more than an above average bar-room act. Cake are surviving on songwriting crumbs". The album peaked at number33 on the Billboard 200, was listed in The Columbian as the second best album of 1998, and eventually went platinum after shipping over 1million units.|$|E

2500|$|... "Fireflies" [...] is a gospel-pop song {{which was}} written and {{produced}} by Cragie Dodds from indie-rock outfit One Eskimo. The track opens with a [...] "rotating piano riff" [...] while during the verses and choruses Lewis' vocals are joined by a strings orchestra, all of which critics noted while pointing to the strong gospel influences. [...] "I to You" [...] is another song written by Sandé and produced by Loco. It is driven by a string instrument-led melody, which was performed by the orchestral collective Wired Strings and arranged by Rosie Danvers. [...] "Shake You Up," [...] was noted by critics as a [...] "modern remake" [...] of an 80's pop song with strong elements of bubblegum pop. It was written by Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins and British singer-songwriter Olivia Waithe (also known as Livvi Franc). Critics noted that [...] "Shake You Up" [...] starts with a vocal interlude from Lewis, who asks [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> music {{up a little bit}} please?" [...] The production, helmed by Darkchild, uses synths and a midtempo [...] "80's pop" [...] melody. Critics compared it to the early work of the late American entertainer Whitney Houston. [...] "Stop the Clocks" [...] returns to the electronic production present on much of the album, but according to critics it was a [...] "lighter instrumental production" [...] that could have been taken from Lewis' last album Echo (2009).|$|E
