2500|$|Compared to France, the British {{government}} relied more {{on short-term}} financing {{in the form}} of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I. Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916, and were available for terms of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at an interest rate of 5%. Although these were not formally designated as war bonds, advertising was explicit about their purpose. This April 1916 advertisement for 5% Exchequer bonds was typical of the time: [...] "LEND YOUR MONEY TO YOUR COUNTRY. The soldier does not grudge offering his life to his country. He offers it freely, for his life may be the price of Victory. But Victory cannot be won without money as well as men, and your money is needed. Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.

He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn. [...] takes the time to really establish who these people are, that you root for them, that <b>you</b> <b>invest</b> in these characters, and that you care for them. That's the best part of it." [...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film.
