He {{says that if you}} are in Lhasa airport and someone is fiddling with <b>your</b> <b>luggage,</b> yelling [...] "fuck off" [...] will effectively communicate that they should stop and leave. Morissette says, [...] "The f-word is special. Everybody uses the word 'breakfast', but not everyone feels comfortable using the word 'fuck' so there's an extra power behind it." [...] Boone argues for less use of the word, saying that he uses his surname instead. Radio talk show host Dennis Prager says that it is acceptable for youths to hear the word on television and film, but not from their family members. In the film, opponents of the word [...] "fuck" [...] use an argument commonly known as [...] "Think of the children".|$|E

Your room shall be got ready instantly! Where is <b>your</b> <b>luggage?</b> Will you let me send for it? No? You can do without <b>your</b> <b>luggage</b> to-night? What admirable fortitude! You will fetch it yourself to-morrow? What extraordinary independence! Do take off your bonnet. Do draw in to the fire! What can I offer you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That 'ere <b>your</b> governor's <b>luggage,</b> Sammy?' inquired Mr. Weller of his affectionate son, as {{he entered}} the yard of the Bull Inn, Whitechapel, with a travelling-bag and a small portmanteau.|$|R

6000|$|Colonel Stubbs will be here, and, as he will {{be coming}} [...] down on the twentieth, {{would be glad to}} travel by the same [...] train, so that he may look after your ticket and <b>your</b> [...] <b>luggage,</b> and be <b>your</b> slave for the occasion. He will leave [...] the Paddington Station by the 4 P.M. train if that will [...] suit you.|$|R

6000|$|... "Here, {{you give}} me a needle and cotton and I'll mend that net of yours, while you go on with your unpacking. Dinner's at one. Dr Macphail, you'd better go down to the wharf and see that <b>your</b> heavy <b>luggage</b> has been put in a dry place. You know what these natives are, they're quite capable of storing it where the rain will beat in on it all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] he said, [...] "this is very important. <b>Your</b> brother's <b>luggage</b> {{has been}} searched, {{and we came}} to the {{conclusion}} that the paper had been taken by those who had followed him here, and may possibly have been aware that he had it. If we can get possession of it, it will be very much to the advantage of your country and mine. I scarcely dare say more. Will you give me a letter to Sir George instructing him to deliver it up to me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The album's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the sticker used on the suitcase of Paddington Bear, who was Ezra's hero when he was a child. In an interview with the London Evening Standard, he said, [...] "I thought it sounded good. I looked into it {{and it turns out that}} back in the day if you were travelling overseas by boat, you would write 'wanted on voyage' on <b>your</b> hand <b>luggage,</b> and that was what you wanted with you for the journey, while everything went on cargo. I wrote most of the album while I was travelling around Europe so it just became the obvious title." ...|$|R

5000|$|Jake Kerridge, {{reviewing}} the entire book in UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, found: [...] "For all its bulk The Kills proves easily digestible, {{as it is}} not so much a novel as four shortish, tangentially connected novels in one". He added that it is, [...] "a hugely convoluted work in which dozens of characters execute a dance that has obviously been minutely choreographed, although one that to the reader increasingly seems to appear dizzyingly random. Motives get more shadowy and the lines between fantasy and reality are blurred; ambiguity becomes the key note. The House method of storytelling is to create brilliantly realised characters, focus on them for a brief, intense period, and then abandon them, often leaving their fates obscure". Kerridge concluded, [...] "… it is well worth ejecting five or six conventional thrillers from <b>your</b> holiday <b>luggage</b> and devoting yourself to The Kills for a few days. Like all the best thrillers, it takes you on a hell of a ride, even if by the end you’re not quite sure where exactly it is you’ve arrived at".|$|R
