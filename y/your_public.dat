25|$|Polly Vernon of British {{newspaper}} The Guardian {{summed up}} her {{analysis of what}} makes a celebrity supercouple in her May 25, 2000 article:The basic appeal of the accomplished supercouple {{can be reduced to}} this: by hooking up with another, carefully selected celeb, you can eliminate your bad points, compensate for your own shortcomings, and hint at a softer, more vulnerable side. Attach yourself to someone smarter, prettier, more fashionable, hipper, funnier than you are, and you will automatically acquire these missing qualities by osmosis. They, equally, will benefit from your particular brand of star quality. <b>Your</b> <b>public</b> perception will become more complete, more exciting. Together, you are quite literally, the ultimate individual.|$|E

500|$|Savage {{introduced}} himself to certain {{writers in the}} North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s. He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University. One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could [...] "hear and see and know why I adore <b>your</b> <b>public</b> image." [...] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1880s, Carp suggested, the {{territorial}} administration had been redesigned {{to function as}} a political machine, or [...] "giant electoral device". He believed that corruption was the direct consequence of excessive politicking and bureaucracy, which absorbed human energies out of the economic sector, and which the PNL seemed to encourage. The result of such trends, he argued, was a [...] "budgetary", [...] "budgetivore" [...] or etatist pseudo-democracy, as opposed to a working and transparent liberal democracy. Even after the 1882 rapprochement between Junimea and Brătianu, Carp attacked the PNL as a sanctuary of endemic corruption: [...] "I know Mr. Brătianu does not desire , but corruption does desire him, and, with invisible but numerous arms, like those of a giant polyp, squeezes him and will squeeze him till he's choking." [...] Shortly after the [...] "Hot Iron" [...] speech of 1911, he addressed Brătianu an equally famous exhortation: [...] "Always be fair in your private life, always be selfless in <b>your</b> <b>public</b> life." ...|$|E
