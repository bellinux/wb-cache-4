5|$|Similar effects {{should be}} found for other {{attributes}} connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> birth more. They also found that subjects liked the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests {{and return to the}} mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E
5|$|After Edmund Halley {{demonstrated}} that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759 by calculating its orbit, that comet became known as Halley's Comet. Similarly, {{the second and third}} known periodic comets, Encke's Comet and Biela's Comet, were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> appearance.|$|E

5|$|As {{successful}} as Carroll was in business, however, {{he and his}} wife experienced many personal losses throughout this period. Of the ten children born to Charles and Mary Carroll, five died within a <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> birth. Henry, their eldest son, died the year before his father in 1719, at the age of 21 or 22. Only the third child, named Charles and later known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, and their next son Daniel would marry and have children of their own.|$|E
5|$|Based on the Virata Parva of the Indian epic Mahabharata, Nartanasala {{focused on}} the trails of the Pandavas in the last <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> exile. The Pandavas assumed {{different}} identities and lived incognito in Virata Matsya Kingdom. The Kauravas wished to reveal Pandavas' real identities {{so that they would}} repeat another exile of 13 years in a cyclic fashion. The issues faced by the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi at Matsya due to various factors, notably Virata's brother-in-law Kichaka form the rest of the story.|$|E
5|$|Having gained {{permission}} to join local under 18 club in 2006, the Sandringham Dragons for numerous games during the season, Hawkins impressed in his limited appearances within the elite TAC Cup competition, highlighted by a twenty-two disposal, nine mark, and five goal effort in just his third game. In the same year, {{he was awarded}} an AIS/AFL academy scholarship {{as part of the}} ninth intake. The scholarship, awarded to outstanding young athletes entering the last <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> junior football development, saw Hawkins participate in several training camps, capped off with representation for Australia in the under 18 International Rules Series, before completing his summer training with the Geelong Football Club.|$|E

5|$|Mary met {{her husband}} in Zagreb on 4July. She officially {{remained}} Sigismund's co-ruler {{until the end of}} her life, but her influence on government was minimal. Sigismund's land grants were always confirmed with Mary's own great seal during the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> common rule, but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation. Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension, but from her husband's coronation. Nevertheless, Mary persuaded her husband to torture and execute John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was born}} on 1 April 1865 in La Chimba, a barrio on the Mapocho River in Santiago de Chile, the {{daughter}} of carpenter Ventura Morales and Marta Infante. Her father {{died when she was}} young, and she moved with her mother to Valparaiso. There she started to learn her mother's trade as a seamstress until her mother married her to an older man in 1877, at age 11. Her husband died during the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> marriage, and her mother died about the same time.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E

The team re-signed Max Starks to the largest single-year deal in franchise history, despite him not being a starter during the 2007 season. Nate Washington, Chris Kemoeatu, and Trai Essex also agreed to one-year deals. Seven-year center Justin Hartwig and running back Mewelde Moore were signed to multi-year deals, and linebacker Keyaron Fox agreed to a one-year deal. Entering the season, 14players were in the final <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> contracts.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} for Rhein and Mosel was to {{use them}} to defend the railway bridges on the Rhine {{in the event of a}} French war of revenge after the Franco-Prussian War in 18701871. The ships were both built at the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen, under construction numbers 23 and 24, respectively. The Rhine Railway Company was compelled to contribute 300,000 Thalers to the construction of the ships, as they were intended to defend the railway bridges the company used at Rheinhausen. Both ships were laid down in 1872 and launched later that year; they were both commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 25 April 1874. They spent the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> career at Rheinhausen, until 7 April 1875, when they were transferred to the defenses of Coblenz.|$|E
5|$|Tottenham {{were making}} their eighth {{appearance}} in the final, having won four previous times, last of which was in 2008. The 2008 final was the first at Wembley and was won against Chelsea. Tottenham's most recent appearance was a defeat against Manchester United in a penalty shootout the following <b>year.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>their</b> squad in the 2014–15 season, captain Younès Kaboul was an extra-time substitute in their 2008 victory, while Aaron Lennon – on loan at Everton {{at the time of}} the 2015 final – started that match and the defeat in 2009.|$|E

After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects {{might be related to}} Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they had been exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> discharge.|$|E
5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January, much earlier in than in past years. Cofidis, who {{had participated in}} the Tour every <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existence, were among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. After not racing the Tour in 2010 and indicating {{at the time that he}} may not return to it, Moncoutié decided instead to ride the 2011 Tour with hopes of winning the King of the Mountains title. The decision put a bit of doubt to his potential return to the Vuelta a España, notwithstanding the team needing a wildcard for that race as well, in spite of his three-year string of winning the mountains classification at that race. Taaramäe, Dumoulin, El Fares, and Vogondy were also named to the squad.|$|E
