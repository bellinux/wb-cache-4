5|$|In {{response}} to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews {{to take action}} to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual care of all the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church , so far as we personally can, and authorise you, if <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the teinds of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you shall transfer with the episcopal seat to the Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese , who shall have power to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.|$|E

When discussing {{the lack of}} evidence at the crime scenes, Scully points out that [...] "a crime is only as perfect as the man [...] Even if he made not one mistake, there still is a motive. If you find his motive, <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series. Furthermore, after Mulder discovers Padgett's manuscript, he arrests him [...] "without a second thought". By relying on empirical logic, Mulder is acting in the way Scully normally thinks.|$|E

500|$|In the film's {{period as}} a {{developing}} project under several studios, {{different versions of}} the screenplay were drafted by numerous screenwriters, beginning with Steve Oedekerk. Other screenwriters involved included David Hayter, Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer, Jeffrey Boam, Thompson Evans, and Chris Hauty. When Universal and DreamWorks re-partnered in 2007, they [...] hired Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus. In 2009, Ostby and Fergus were replaced by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Damon Lindelof. Kurtzman and Orci analyzed American Western films including The Searchers. Orci said, [...] "The first draft was very kind of jokey and broad and then it went very serious. You kind of swing {{back and forth between the}} two extremes and the tone until <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> exact right point where a Western and a sci-fi movie can really shake hands without it seeming unnatural." [...] "Imagine you're watching Unforgiven and then Aliens land," [...] Orci explained.|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "If It Makes You Happy", {{underwent}} {{several different}} arrangements before {{being turned into}} a rock song. According to musician Jeff Trott, who co-wrote the song along with Crow, [...] "It started off as a twangy, David Lynch-esque sort of thing. Then [...] we played it like punk rock, really fast, as well as country and funky. You know, you get a song and put clothes on it to see what looks good and what doesn't, and usually when <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> right one it's pretty obvious. With that song it was real obvious!" [...] Trott initially wrote the song {{when he was a}} member of Pete Droge's backing band, but Crow added a second verse and strengthened the melody. Sheryl Crow also has contributions by notable musicians. For example, [...] "Sweet Rosalyn" [...] features saxophone by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, while [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] features harmony vocals by Neil Finn of Crowded House.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Ultimatium" [...] {{at the end}} of {{the second}} volume of Either/Or hinted at a future {{discussion}} of the religious stage in The Two Upbuilding Discourses, [...] "Ask yourself and keep on asking until <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> answer, for one may have known something many times, acknowledged it; one may have willed something many times, attempted it-and yet, only the deep inner motion, only the heart’s indescribable emotion, only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you, that no power can take it from you-for only the truth that builds up is truth for you." [...] This discussion is included in Stages on Life's Way (1845). The first two sections revisit and refine the aesthetic and ethical stages elucidated in Either/Or, while the third section, Guilty/Not Guilty is about the religious stage and refers specifically to Goethe's other book, The Autobiography of Goethe: Truth and Poetry, from My Own Life vol 1, 2 ...|$|E

500|$|The AMAS defines machinima as [...] "animated filmmaking {{within a}} {{real-time}} virtual 3-D environment". In other 3-D animation methods, creators can control every frame and nuance of their characters but, in turn, must consider {{issues such as}} key frames and inbetweening. Machinima creators leave many rendering details to their host environments, but may thus inherit those environments' limitations. [...] Second Life Machinima film maker Ozymandius King provided {{a detailed account of}} the process by which the artists at MAGE Magazine produce their videos. [...] "Organizing for a photo shoot is similar to organizing for a film production. Once <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> actors / models, you have to scout locations, find clothes and props for the models and type up a shooting script. The more organized you are the less time it takes to shoot the scene." [...] Because game animations focus on dramatic rather than casual actions, the range of character emotions is often limited. However, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd state that a small range of emotions is often sufficient, as in successful Japanese anime television series.|$|E
500|$|The Green Book {{attracted}} sponsorship from {{a number}} of businesses, including the African-American newspapers Call and Post of Cleveland, Ohio, and the Louisville Leader of Louisville, Kentucky. Standard Oil (later Esso) was also a sponsor, owing to the efforts of James [...] "Billboard" [...] Jackson, a pioneering African-American Esso sales representative. Esso's [...] "race group", part of its marketing division, promoted the Green Book as enabling Esso's black customers to [...] "go further with less anxiety". By contrast, Shell gas stations were known to refuse black customers. The 1949 edition included an Esso endorsement message that told readers: [...] "As representatives of the Esso Standard Oil Co., we are pleased to recommend the Green Book for your travel convenience.

The fifth song and the third single [...] "Missä muruseni on" [...] (Where My Sweetheart Is) was written by Mariska who got the inspiration for the song while reading Indian erotic literature on her balcony on a hot summer's day. The song is a ballad where the singer talks about being far away from her loved one and asks the wind to blow to the place [...] "where [...] sweetheart is"by November2010, the lyrics had even found their way to Finnish obituaries and gravestones.
