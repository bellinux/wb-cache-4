60|$|MRS WARREN. Well, of course, dearie, it's {{only good}} manners {{to be ashamed}} of it: it's {{expected}} from a woman. Women have to pretend to feel a great deal that they don't feel. Liz used to be angry with me for plumping out the truth about it. She used to say that when every woman could learn enough from {{what was going on in}} the world before her eyes, there was no need to talk about it to her. But then Liz was such a perfect lady! She had the true instinct of it; while I was always a bit of a vulgarian. I used to be so pleased when you sent me your photos to see that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> like Liz: you've just her ladylike, determined way. But I can't stand saying one thing when everyone knows I mean another. Whats the use in such hypocrisy? If people arrange the world that way for women, theres no good pretending it's arranged the other way. No: I never was a bit ashamed really. I consider I had a right to be proud of how we managed everything so respectably, and never had a word against us, and how the girls were so well taken care of. Some of them did very well: one of them married an ambassador. But of course now I daren't talk about such things: whatever would they think of us! [She yawns]. Oh dear! I do believe I'm getting sleepy after all. [She stretches herself lazily, thoroughly relieved by her explosion, and placidly ready for her night's rest].|$|E

30|$|Respondents {{were also}} asked about a variety of family and {{individual}} characteristics. In terms of their parents, participants were asked about the educational attainment of their mothers and fathers. The higher of the two (when two parents were present) was then included {{as a measure of}} the highest parental education, with responses including “eighth grade or less” (1), “beyond the eighth grade but did not complete high school” (2), “high school degree” (3), “attended college but did not finish degree” (4), “four-year college degree” (5), and “graduate or professional degree” (6). Maternal employment was also assessed, with respondents being queried about whether their mother was employed for pay outside the home (yes[*]=[*] 1, no[*]=[*] 0). Since the familial context is likely to influence both dating and marriage patterns among young adults, participants were asked: “For most of the time when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> did you think your parents’ marriage was not too happy (1), just about average (2), happier than average (3), or very happy (4).” Since western culture could potentially affect dating and marriage patterns among Chinese young adults, the respondents were also queried as to whether English was spoken in their homes (1 [*]=[*]yes, 0 [*]=[*]no). In regard to parental influence, participants were offered the following statement: “I would be willing to date someone of whom my parents/family did not approve.” Responses ranged from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (5).|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} risk of a loan {{applicant}} defaulting, lenders feed applicants ‟ data into credit scoring algorithms. They are always looking to improve the effectiveness of their predictions, which means improving the algorithms and/or collecting different data. Research on financial behavior found that elements of a person‟s family history and social ties can be good predictors of financial responsibility and control. Our study investigated how loan applicants applying for a credit card would respond to questions such as “Did any of your loved ones die while <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up?</b> ” 48 participants were asked to complete a new type of credit card application form containing such requests as part of a “Consumer Acceptance Test ” of a credit card with lower interest rates, but only available to “financially responsible customers. ” This was a double-blind study – the experimenters processing participants were told exactly the same. We found that: (1) more sensitive items are disclosed less often- e. g. friends ‟ names and contact had only a 69 % answer rate; (2) privacy fundamentalists are 5. 6 times less likely to disclose data; and (3) providing a justification for a question has no effect on its answer rate. Discrepancies between acceptability and disclosure were observed – e. g. 43 % provided names and contact of friends, having said they found the question unacceptable. We conclude that collecting data items not traditionally seen as relevant could be made acceptable if lenders can credibly establish relevance, and assure applicants they will be assessed fairly. More research needs to be done on how to best communicate these qualities...|$|E
40|$|Transition into {{adulthood}} is a developmental outcome of late adolescence. The transition to independent living, for all adolescents, represents a normalizing task towards adulthood. For some adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) this transition occurs against a back-drop of impaired social relatedness, lengthy out-of-home placements, limited family support, and limited financial resources. The {{purpose of this}} study was to ascertain the experience of adolescents with PDD who have transitioned into a supervised apartment setting associated with an adult mental health services provider. The research questions addressed in this study were: What is the experience of adolescents with PDD who have transitioned into a supervised apartment setting? How do adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder perceive their current functioning? ^ The concept of transition, proposed by Chick and Meleis (1986) as a central concept of nursing, was used to guide the study. Descriptive qualitative research methodology was used to analyze data. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants. Ten individuals volunteered to participate in a face-to-face interview that occurred in their apartments. A semi-structured interview was used to gather data around living environment, presentation of self, personal history, and relationships with others. The predominant request posed to participants was: “Tell me about something that has happened in the last few months that helped you understand that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> and becoming more independent in your living. ” Thematic analysis occurred with all interview data. ^ This research resulted in a number of themes. Descriptions of the growing-up event were clustered around issues of increasing independence, clarification of relationship with mother, and accountability. Other identified themes included unrealistic goals for the future and poor physical health. The predominant and unexpected theme from all participant interviews involved chronic sorrow. Participants were sad about their life situations, what they were missing, and what they lacked in social relationships. Nurses need to be aware of the quality of life issues around managing a severely impaired population attempting to live within a community. This study described the life situations of ten impaired participants involved in structured independent living within a community. ...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} his life, Pierre Hadot was a {{professor}} at the Collège de France — a “professor’s professor” — and he helped Michel Foucault, most famously, conceptualize ethics. Hadot devoted his career to recovering the ancient conception of philosophy, according to which the discourses of universities are but a fragment of what philosophy is. His engagement with this theme helped Bendik-Keymer understand and develop a personal counter-culture to his academic work, a kind of original academics truer to the idea of the philosophical school Plato first developed in his Ἀκαδήµεια. But while Plato’s school developed a useful form of life, it had an ambivalent relation to democracy and to everyday people. Whereas Plato was in some ways one of the first egalitarians by merit (especially concerning women), he was also deeply classist in his categorization of intellectual potentials. He effectively thought some people were stupid by nature, having no philosophical worth. Hence the Ἀκαδήµεια existed outside the city, in practice exclusive and somewhat sequestered. To some extent, Plato’s vision of philosophy — at least as explained by Hadot — had the practical point of philosophy right, but this point still needed to be rendered thoroughly democratic in the polyphony and multiple intelligences of people. Doing so coheres with what Foucault was after in his application of Hadot. It is also what Bendik-Keymer is after — to extract what is good from original academics and make it democratic, as opposed to dumbing people down. This “book of becoming” weaves together poetry, photo album, exploded essay (including tears and scotch tape), philosophical commentary, memoir, and aphoristic journal. …The breathtaking result is a philosophical askesis for our time: polyphonic, democratic, practical, and urgent. …This writing is inspiring, honest, and brave. ~Lynne Huffer, author of Mad for FoucaultImagine the kind of philosophy book you might have wished for when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> Seeking a reader who would be patient and open-minded enough to live with her own questions and to walk around town with her thoughts, this book would not have a single thesis but would rather work through multiple problems and be an experience, born out of life-experience. It would not be summarizable. It would be larger than the reader and open onto different kinds of readings. This is the kind of philosophy book that was at home in the 19 th century. It is rare to come across a book that does what it says…. [Solar Calendar] enacts…[a] conversation with the reader that is generous, demanding, and disarmingly personal. Its unusual form bears some resemblance to Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet…. ~Shannon Lee Dawdy, author of Patina: a Profane ArcheologySolar Calendar (a follow-up to Bendik-Keymer’s The Ecological Life: Discovering Citizenship and a Sense of Humanity) contains six oddities: a family portrait, a parody-essay, a time-capsule poem, an exploded essay, a poetic record of an act, and an aphorism journal for a year. Their inspirations are Epictetus’ notebooks, Tarkovski’s Mirror, and Apollinaire’s roving “Zone. ” Also experiments in ecology — the study of home — the six sections originate in rifts that challenge us as growing people. They alternate between environmental problems and tensions within families, as if the fissures in love and in society wash back and forth between each other as we try to make a home in the world. Multiple times layer over each other like the sounds of a large, democratic city. The personal and the planetary intersect. The space before, and against, policy where politics arises as assertion opens up in glimpses, fragmenting the body and inertia of oppressive orders. Philosophy arises as a homely and idiosyncratic practice of multiple forms of intuition, reflection and intelligence for muddling through life. Painstaking exercises in being human are grounded in unconditional love and in truthfulness — in the desire to become. [P]hilosophy is an unfinished practice in being human. Unlike any other text I have read in recent memory, Solar Calendar expresses this practice by revealing the cosmos in the personal and the personal in the cosmos. … This is a text that does not rest complacently in the residue of its own insights. ~Ryan Johnson, Department of Philosophy, Elon UniversityTable of Contents // Preface a.

40|$|Farming - a way-of-life to {{be proud}} of? CUE: Farmers {{everywhere}} find themselves facing many pressures; they may lack access to inputs, and to markets, and their production can easily be hit by poor rains. For young farmers there {{can also be a}} pressure from their friends. Farming tends to be looked down upon, as an occupation for those who have failed to get a paid job in a more respected area like medicine or engineering. In this report, Daniel Sikazwe talks to two young farmers who have overcome these pressures. Both are members of the Zambia Young Farmers Clubs. He asks them how they feel about being farmers, and whether they have been tempted to look for white collar work. The young people come from Kabwe, a town 135 km from Zambia?s capital Lusaka. Alice is 22 years old and Viache Makunmbe is 23. Daniel?s first question, ?What made you take up farming?? is addressed to Alice. IN:		?I just came to join into ? OUT:		? that will come behind us. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 33 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Viache Makunmbe who has taken on agriculture as a way of life, despite the temptation of white collar jobs. Transcript Alice	I just came to join into farming through my parents. As I was growing up I just came to get interested in farming, because I?m not educated and I decided to be a farmer, just because I knew I can?t chance a job in Zambia. Sikazwe	And so what kind of farming did you start doing when it became difficult for you to go ahead with your education, or to get a job? Alice	I started growing maize with my parents. Later on my mum she passed away, and even now I?m depending on maize and groundnuts, including beans. Sikazwe	Is that enough to help you earn a living? Alice	Yes, at least it is much better than staying, because I?m getting whatever I want through farming. I can afford to keep my kids, to feed myself, even though selling it is a problem. In Zambia we don?t have a good market, but at least I?m pushing myself up. Sikazwe	What have been some of the major challenges that you have had to contend with as a young person in agriculture? Alice	I face problems with fertilizer at times. So now we are introducing organic for young farmers; I?m even interested in that. I think that at any time or next year, I may change. Sikazwe	OK, let?s hear your story Viache Makunmbe from Kabwe rural, that?s a remote part of Kabwe. Just tell me how you got into agriculture. Makunmbe	My parents and our family, we are all a farming family. Sikazwe	Is that what you had always wanted to do in your life? Makunmbe	Well I had wanted to do other things but after having looked at the economic crisis, and the unemployment rate in Zambia, I just settled for agriculture, which created a vacuum at the moment. Sikazwe	You obviously had friends that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> with, some that you might have shared ambitions of, for instance, becoming a doctor, becoming a pilot, becoming an engineer; how do you relate to them at the moment now that you are in farming, and they are doing probably what they might have set out to do? Makunmbe	Well we relate to each other as we related in our past days, because then as a society we are looking at each others - one has to be a farmer, one has to be a doctor, and the other one has to be doing the other job to make a complete society. Sikazwe	Are there times you feel tempted to abandon farming altogether, and take up the so called ?White Collar? jobs? Makunmbe	There have been several times I have been tempted to leave farming, due to various reasons, one of them being that you come to hit a concrete wall in Zambian farming where you can?t acquire any farming inputs, and farming cannot carry on like that. Sikazwe	So what has kept you going when things were that tough? Makunmbe	Well I have taken farming as a way of living, as a religion. I just believe in it, and I just push, and my heart pushes and I just go ahead. Sikazwe	So apart from just the issue of having problems with farming inputs, {{what are some of the}} challenges as a young person that you have had to contend with in agriculture? Makunmbe	The biggest challenge as you asked me earlier on, is how I relate to others. When they look at a young farmer in Zambia, it is sort of a downgrade of people that have been left that don?t have anything to do. That is what as the Young Farmers Club we are trying to cast out and bring something else. And in relation to others that have got a white collar job, the temptation is always there because they are always getting their salaries at the end of the month, they don?t have any problems with inputs. Come rain, come no rain, for them it?s alright. Sikazwe	So do you consider farming a career, and what would you want to say to young people out there who might still believe that farming cannot be taken upon as a career? Makunmbe	I consider farming as a career, and as a way of life. And I would like to encourage all the young farmers out there to take upon farming as a career and as a way of life, because if we look at life generally, whether we take a white collar job or not, at the end of the day, anyone of us retires to take a small farming life. So I would like to encourage most of my age folk to take up farming, so that even at the time of retirement they are well set, and everything is going on, and that will build up a foundation for all those that will come behind us, and behind those that will come behind us. End of tapeYoung people who decide to pursue a career in farming face many pressures. They may struggle to obtain farm inputs or credit. They may also feel ashamed because they are not working in a ?respectable? white-collar job. This report from Zambia features two young people who describe how they have overcome these difficulties...|$|E

"Independence is an {{excellent}} quality {{in its own right}} and proper sphere," [...] said Mr. Holiday; [...] "but when it takes the form of disregarding or rebelling against right and proper authority, it is a very bad quality. It cannot be tolerated. If it were allowed generally to prevail among mankind, the whole world would be thrown into confusion, and nothing could go on. This is now the kind of independence that you must guard against. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> rapidly, and increasing in strength and knowledge every day. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> becoming a young man, and in a great many of the situations in which <b>you</b> <b>are</b> placed, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> fully competent to take care of yourself. Still <b>you</b> <b>are</b> what the law calls a minor. That <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> have not arrived at an age when <b>you</b> can safely <b>be</b> your own master, and support and take care of yourself. Consequently, the law makes it your father's duty, for some years to come, to furnish money for your support, and to provide for you all necessary protection. And the same law makes it your duty to be under my direction, to conform your conduct to my judgment; or, in other words, to do, not as you think best, but as I, or whomsoever I may delegate to act in my stead, thinks best. This is reasonable. As long as a boy depends upon his father for the means of his support, it is right that he should act as his father's judgment dictates. It will be time enough for him to expect that he should act according to his own judgment, in his conduct, when he is able to earn his own living, and so release his father from all responsibility on his account. In a word, the pecuniary responsibility of the father, and the moral obligation of the son, go together." ...|$|R
