25|$|New {{digital signal}} {{processing}} functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Loudness Equalization and Speaker Fill have been introduced. Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers {{in a manner similar}} to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. Whether you have a multi-channel or stereo sound system in your home theater or living room, Windows Vista also includes the ability to calibrate your speakers for <b>your</b> <b>room.</b> By placing a microphone where you plan to sit and then running a wizard that measures the room response, Windows Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance for each channel accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the ability to have surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function.|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel has}} no {{check-in}} desk; {{it uses a}} smartphone check-in system in which you scan a QR code and retrieve <b>your</b> <b>room</b> key from a vending machine. The visitors use a mobile app, named Lucy, that the company describes as a [...] "personal comfort assistant". [...] According to Mary Forgione of The Los Angeles Times, the app can order more pillows, handle room service orders, {{and serve as a}} remote control for both the television and the hotel's music library. The website also suggests that the app can control room temperature, interface with the chat board, provide local knowledge, and coordinate your messages with hotel staff.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} both written and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays the part of Toby Flenderson on the show. In the episode, Jim refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms. Jim and Pam ("JandP2") post a review, which can be seen on the actual reviews page. It reads: [...] "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave <b>your</b> <b>room.</b> The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff’s attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} motivation after the Olympics. He was recruited to the Australian Institute of Sport by swimming coaches Bill Sweetenham and Dennis Pursley, but his stay was brief. The inaugural director Don Talbot, a former head coach of the Australian swimming team, expelled him for indiscipline. He then won the 1981 Australian title in the 100m freestyle without training, but his time of 52.61s was substantially slower than his personal best. Brooks then accepted a scholarship to go to the University of Arkansas to train under Sam Freas. He enjoyed the more liberal culture in the American collegiate system, particularly the relationship between swimmers and their coaches. He enjoyed the less paternalistic treatment that the coaches accorded to their swimmers, saying that [...] "In Australia, after a race they want to lock you in <b>your</b> <b>room.</b> In America, you can share a beer after the meet with the coach." [...] The shortcourse pools used in the United States played into the hands of Brooks, as his strong legs gave him an advantage in pushing away from the turns, which came twice as often in comparison to longcourse (50m) pools. He had initially planned to stay in the United States for only a year, but decided to extend his stay by a year, having enjoyed the high frequency of racing and the recognition accorded to university athletes in the United States. In both years, he won the 50m and 100m freestyle double in the Southwest Conference, and was fourth in the 100m freestyle at the 1981 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships. He also came second in the 100m freestyle at the AACC Championships to Rowdy Gaines, who {{went on to win the}} event at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.|$|E
