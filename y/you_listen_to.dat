5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

[...] There are times during the show, when I'm dancing so much, where I get out of breath, {{and we have a}} signal where I'm dying and they'll help me out. Believe me, I'd give {{anything}} to do a show where I just sit there and sing".|$|E
500|$|Bush {{opined that}} this record wasn't very {{different}} from their previous releases. [...] "It's still an Anthrax album with many different parts that can appeal to a wide audience. Our sound is recognizable each time <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> one of our songs and that's something we really want for our music. You have the fastest rhythms, the more danceable ones, you have everything you can expect from an Anthrax record." [...] Benante said that elements from their earlier albums are still present on the record, though it explores [...] "other territories".|$|E

500|$|Trademarks and {{characteristics}} that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagström notes that [...] "it doesn't really matter {{if something is}} hard to play or not. The thing is, {{what does it do}} to your mind when <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it?

500|$|By {{the twenty-first}} century, Mugabe was {{regarded}} as one of the world's most controversial political leaders. According to The Black Scholar journal, [...] "depending on who <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to...</b> Mugabe is either one of the world's great tyrants or a fearless nationalist who has incurred the wrath of the West." [...] He has been widely described as a [...] "dictator", a [...] "tyrant", and a [...] "threat", and has been referred to as one of Africa's [...] "most brutal" [...] leaders. At the same time he continued to be regarded as a hero in many Third World countries and received a warm reception when travelling throughout Africa.

500|$|In 2006, Hip Hop Connection ranked 2001 number 10 on {{its list}} of the 100 Best Albums (1995–2005) in hip hop.

500|$|Lou Reed, {{who wrote}} the {{majority}} of the album's lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Hubert Selby, Jr., saw no reason the content in their works couldn't translate well to rock and roll music. An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, Reed {{said in an interview that}} he thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was [...] "obvious". [...] "That's the kind of stuff you might read. Why wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it? You have the fun of reading that, and you get the fun of rock on top of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Just Good Old Rock and Roll is {{much more}} {{straightforward}} than past works, consisting of funk-influenced hard rock, although [...] "So Many People to Tell" [...] and [...] "Silver Passion Mine" [...] also exhibit a late-psychedelic sound. As Whetstone explains, [...] "We were fairly naive in terms of guidance; we had none, so we were experimenting {{with a lot of}} musical styles. If <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the album, you'll hear a lot of diversity, feel and tempo changes...That was our learning curve." [...] In early 1970, Whetstone and Wade departed the band and moved to Canada where they formed Stallion Thumbrock. Morgan and Kincaid constructed another line-up of The Electric Prunes that included Michael Kearns, Clay Groomer, Huey Plumeigh, and Galen Pugh; however, by mid-1970 the band dissolved.|$|E
500|$|Graveyard Mountain Home was {{generally}} well received. Rick Anderson of Allmusic regarded the album as [...] "a surprisingly affecting and powerful work." [...] Writing for Sea of Tranquility, Michael Popke noted that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Graveyard Mountain Home as a stand-alone piece of music... you probably won't be overly impressed. If, however, {{you hear this}} sophisticated mix of dark, ambient post-rock and psychedelic sounds while viewing the 1955 public-domain film Age 13, you may consider multi-instrumentalist Kevin Moore a small-time genius." [...] Popke speculated that if Moore created more albums based on obscure films, [...] "he might just alter {{the face of the}} genre." [...] Martien Koolen of DPRP described Graveyard Mountain Home as [...] "a typical album for dark, wintry afternoons," [...] although conceded that [...] "it is not [...] cup of tea." ...|$|E
