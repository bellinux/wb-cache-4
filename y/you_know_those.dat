500|$|Renewal was {{uncertain}} {{until after the}} finale aired. In April, actor Enrico Colantoni, who plays Keith, stated regarding renewal, Unofficially, everyone at CBS and Warner Bros is saying, [...] "Yeah, no worries!" [...] But <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>those</b> are always famous last words. And then last year they told us two days after we wrapped, and they {{got a lot of}} criticism over that. So I know they're not gonna make that mistake again. They're gonna wait until May. Colantoni also expressed optimism towards the show's future on The CW, believing {{that it would be a}} chance for the show to get more exposure. On May 15, before the official press release was announced, it was believed that The CW had ordered 13 episodes of Veronica Mars. Later, it was revealed that the series had been renewed for a 22-episode season, but that the season could be shortened if ratings were poor.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Ology (website)'s Josh Harrison gave it an {{eight out of}} ten rating, writing that [...] "You gotta love these Simpsons episodes that really get {{into the heart of}} a subculture. Diving head-first into the world of foodies and food blogging (after a hilarious geeky pit-stop at a video game expo), 'The Food Wife' shish-kabobs gourmet diehards while highlighting a very real problem between Homer and Marge." [...] He concluded that the episode is [...] "a definite swing for the fences, and I think it hits its mark completely." [...] The scenes at the video game convention were praised by Anthony Severino of Game Revolution as well. He commented that the writers [...] "nailed it. Everything from the massive displays, long lines, and even the look of the Los Angeles Convention Center was spot on. The best was how they portrayed people with 'VIP passes', <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>those</b> things that we journalists get, as douches who think they're better than the regulars." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two verses {{later we}} read: [...] "And remember, Children of Israel, when We made a {{covenant}} {{with you and}} raised Mount Sinai before you saying, [...] "Hold tightly to what We have revealed to you and keep it in mind so that you may guard against evil." [...] But then you turned away, and {{if it had not}} been for Allah's grace and merecy, you surely would have been among the lost. And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>those</b> among who sinned on the Sabbath. We said to them, [...] "You will be transformed into despised apes." [...] So we used them as a warning to their people and to the following generations, as well as a lesson for the God-fearing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Christians {{note that}} the Christian faith teaches [...] "salvation is by faith", [...] "But as for you, {{continue}} in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>those</b> from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which {{are able to make}} you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus." [...] The Holy Bible, New International Version. International Bible Society. 1984. and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God's existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. Søren Kierkegaard argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans. It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important to us. In The Justification of Knowledge, the Calvinist theologian Robert L. Reymond argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond's position {{is similar to that of}} his mentor Gordon Clark, which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a [...] "leap of faith". This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.|$|E
