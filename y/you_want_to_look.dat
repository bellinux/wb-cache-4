25|$|Maharlika – Members of the Tagalog warrior class {{known as}} maharlika {{had the same}} rights and {{responsibilities}} as the timawa, but {{in times of war}} they were bound to serve their datu in battle. They had to arm themselves at their own expense, but they did get to keep the loot they won – or stole, depending on which side of the transaction <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at. Although they were partly related to the nobility, the maharlikas were technically less free than the timawas because they could not leave a datu’s service without first hosting a large public feast and paying the datu between 6 and 18 pesos in gold – a large sum in those days.|$|E
500|$|My Dinosaur Life was {{released}} to acclaim from music critics upon its debut on January 19, 2010, and it represented the band's all-time best chart performance, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard 200. The group supported Weezer on several dates during this time, {{and they began}} a headlining tour in late January in the US. In {{the first three months}} following the album's release, the band continued to tour heavily: they travelled to Australia for the national Soundwave festival, as well as to Japan and the UK. The band began to receive radio airplay {{for the first time in}} their career, and released a music video for the single [...] "Her Words Destroyed My Planet". They embarked on a large tour with Say Anything between October and November 2010, and premiered a self-shot video for [...] "A Lifeless Ordinary" [...] during that time. Columbia dropped the band later that year, with the commercial performance of My Dinosaur Life leading to the split. [...] "I guess we didn't do as well as they hoped or expected us to," [...] said Pierre that year. [...] "And we felt that having all their resources at our disposal would perhaps propel us into another dimension. But we are what we are regardless of what label or machine is behind us. We did exceptionally well, though, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> strictly at sales numbers in today's climate." ...|$|E

500|$|At Fillmore East showcases the band's eclectic {{mixture of}} blues, rock, country, and jazz. [...] "Fusion {{is a term}} that came later, but if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a fusion album, it would be Fillmore East. Here was a rock 'n' roll band playing blues in the jazz vernacular. And they tore the place up," [...] said Dowd.|$|R

500|$|Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network was sharply {{critical}} {{of the first two}} episodes of the anime adaptation. He did praise the show for [...] " [...] back the terror of the fee-fi-fo-fum set", but then said that it [...] "does not a good show make". Kimlinger criticized Araki's direction, saying he [...] "clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling, but it's just crude and unpleasant." [...] On the other hand, other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it [...] "is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals", and [...] "an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> away, and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next." [...] Though there are several apocalyptic action shows, Carlo Santos noted that [...] "few get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does". Santos described it as [...] "a masterpiece of death and destruction" [...] even if he only watched the first episode. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the [...] "intense, impactful first episode" [...] despite his feeling that it has [...] "limited animation". Martin also compared Attack on Titan vibe and visual aesthetic to Claymore. John Sinnott of DVD Talk called the series one of the best ones he has ever watched and one [...] "that anime fans should not miss." ...|$|E
500|$|On 7October 1942, Walters took {{command of}} a new formation, No.1 (Fighter) Wing, at RAAF Station Richmond. Established to boost the air defence {{capability}} of Australia's North-Western Area, the wing comprised three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons that had been transferred from Europe: No.54 Squadron RAF, No.452 Squadron RAAF and No.457 Squadron RAAF. With Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying ace of the war, as his wing leader, Walters began deploying aircraft and men to Darwin, Northern Territory, in December, providing a filip for morale in the region. Proudly declaring himself Australia's oldest fighter pilot, Walters was reported as taking every opportunity to join his men in the air. He flew as Caldwell's wingman in No.1 Wing's first major action against the Japanese over Darwin on 2May 1943. [...] Eight Spitfires crashed and several others made forced landings, {{for the destruction of}} one Japanese bomber and five fighters. Walters himself narrowly avoiding being shot down when he warned Caldwell of an attacking enemy fighter, to the detriment of his own safety. After they landed, Caldwell chided his commander, [...] "You silly old so-and-so. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after your own skin instead of worrying about someone else's!" [...] On 20June, Walters participated in the wing's most successful combat against the Japanese to that time, personally accounting for one of fourteen raiders claimed by the Spitfires, for the loss of two of their own number. He posted out of Darwin a few days later, having earned the admiration of Caldwell {{and the rest of the}} wing's personnel.|$|E

Surrounded by the Japanese on the fictional island of Trinde, the soldiers contemplate their seemingly inevitable demise. Its ending seems inspired by Hemingway.

[...] "I always understood," [...] he continued, [...] "though it was so strange--so pitiful. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at life for yourself--but you were not allowed; you were punished for your wish.

5000|$|The {{authors of}} Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love & Typography add {{hierarchy}} {{to the idea}} of making structure explicit. They say: [...] "effective hierarchy gets people <b>to</b> <b>look</b> where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> <b>look</b> there. Without it the reader is left confused and frustrated. Emphasis can be stressed by size, weight, color, style, and placement". Thus, emphasis from several different font decisions joins headings as a feature that makes structure explicit.|$|R
