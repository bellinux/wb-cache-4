5|$|The time in Arles {{became one}} of Van Gogh's more {{prolific}} periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in <b>yellow,</b> <b>ultramarine</b> and mauve. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.|$|E
50|$|Raphael used an {{extensive}} palette of paints to depict this colourful scene, pigments such as lead-tin <b>yellow,</b> <b>ultramarine,</b> verdigris and ochres were identified..|$|E
50|$|The {{defeat of}} France, {{the death of}} his son and the surge of the new {{painting}} deeply moved the artist, whose work then took a tragic flavour : snow landscapes in Cantal, paintings of the Paris area and Brittany spattered with chrome <b>yellow,</b> <b>ultramarine,</b> carmine, dark descent from the cross under reddish skies, tormented standstills, which disconcerted the lovers of his paintings in the grey and green periods with their soft and strange poetry.|$|E
30|$|It is also {{uncertain}} who synthesised {{strontium chromate}} (SrCrO 4) {{for the first}} time [2, 14]. Presently it is obtained when a solution of strontium chloride is added to a sodium dichromate solution [7]. During the 19 th century onwards, it appears variously as: strontian yellow, strontaine yellow, lemon <b>yellow</b> and <b>ultramarine</b> <b>yellow</b> (the last two names could also refer to barium chromate) [2, 5, 14].|$|R
25|$|The {{material}} {{composition of}} the 1893 painted version was examined in 2010. The pigment analysis revealed the use of cadmium <b>yellow,</b> vermilion, <b>ultramarine</b> and viridian among other pigments of the 19th century.|$|R

5000|$|Yves Peintures (Eng: Yves Paintings) is an artist's book by the French artist Yves Klein, {{originally}} published in Madrid, 18 November 1954. This publication was Klein’s first public gesture as an artist, featuring pages of 'commercially printed papers ' that were seemingly reproductions of paintings that, in fact, didn't exist. Using a practice started by Marcel Duchamp, this use of readymade objects to represent nothing but themselves {{has been referred to}} as an early example of Postmodernism, using a series of carefully executed strategies to undermine its own authority, and as a precursor to conceptual art. 'The simplicity of his readymades is at once sublime and mischievous.' [...] "The booklet asserts its character straightaway in the preface: a wordless text of unbroken horizontal lines with the same two paragraph indentations on each page.... a homogenous continuum with no real beginning, middle, or end, and no content - at least insofar as there are no descriptions, analyses, or personalized utterances. The colour plates are similarly presented as anonymous entities, each a flat spatial field of an uninflected hue: turquoise, brown, purple, green, pink, gray, <b>yellow,</b> <b>ultramarine,</b> mint, orange, or red. Here, too, there is no attempt to represent or symbolize anything....The booklet thus offers an utterly pared down presentation. Unlike most art books, it provides no reverential prose about the artist or the art, and no embellishing descriptions meant to convey meaning or context. Instead the booklet itself is made into a work of art that shares the same spirit of nothingness exemplified by the monochrome paintings that it features." [...] Sidra Stich ...|$|E
30|$|Barium {{chromate}} (BaCrO 4), first synthesised and analysed by Vauquelin, {{resulted from}} adding {{a solution of}} barium nitrate to a chromate or dichromate (e.g. sodium or potassium) solution [1]. Barium chloride may {{also be used as}} an alternative source of barium [2, 13]. Throughout the 19 th century, barium chromate was known under several different names including: barium yellow, lemon <b>yellow,</b> <b>ultramarine</b> yellow, baryta yellow and Steinbühl yellow [2, 14].|$|E
50|$|The {{technical}} analysis shows that Vermeer used a limited choice of pigments for this painting: lead white, <b>yellow</b> ochre, natural <b>ultramarine</b> and madder lake {{are the main}} painting materials. His painting technique {{on the other hand}} is very elaborate and meticulous.|$|R
50|$|Most of this {{glassware}} {{was made}} in the Ohio River Valley of the United States, where access to raw materials and power made manufacturing inexpensive {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. More than twenty manufacturers made more than 100 patterns, and entire dinner sets were made in some patterns. Common colors are clear (crystal), pink, pale blue, green, and amber. Less common colors include <b>yellow</b> (canary), <b>ultramarine,</b> jadeite (opaque pale green), delphite (opaque pale blue), cobalt blue, red (ruby & royal ruby), black, amethyst, monax, and white (milk glass).|$|R
2500|$|Weiss uses a wood palette {{and a small}} {{range of}} colors; {{typically}} titanium white, <b>yellow</b> ochre, <b>ultramarine</b> blue and cadmium red light, sometimes {{with the addition of}} a deeper red, cadmium yellow light, cerulean and green. [...] He occasionally paints with a knife, but mostly with flat brushes to achieve [...] "a kind of blocky modeling". He uses Claessens oil-primed linen for portraits and panels for landscape work. After forming quick outlines, he works rapidly to block in the light and dark areas of the figure and major compositional elements with turpentine-thinned paint. Following this first stage which takes around half-an-hour, he reworks the areas a dozen times or more, constantly refining and unifying.|$|R
30|$|Summarizing, {{the study}} of painted Ottoman {{inscriptions}} and reliefs provided the first information about their palette, which was found {{to make use of}} several pigments such as red lead and more scarcely cinnabar or vermilion, chrome <b>yellow,</b> <b>ultramarine,</b> copper based blue or green pigments and a blend of Prussian blue and chrome yellow for light green hues. It was also shown that gold foil decoration was not uncommon. In the case of the limited set of Venetian inscriptions, it was found that two types of black substances were used in the engraved black figures, carbon black or manganese black, the latter possibly mixed with a copper pigment. Further analysis of painted stone carved works dating from the Ottoman and Venetian periods may reveal a more representative palette for each period and may contribute to the general historical knowledge in a number of ways, for example, assisting archaeologists to date artworks with confidence or conclude about the value of sculpture, particularly in cases luxurious decorative materials such as gold foils are found. Even more, it may assist research work concerning commercial activities and the import of goods or different materials and extend our knowledge about the technology of producing and using pigments during the late medieval and modern era in Crete.|$|E
50|$|Many vivid {{synthetic}} pigments became {{commercially available}} to artists {{for the first}} time during the 19th century. These included cobalt blue, viridian, cadmium <b>yellow,</b> and synthetic <b>ultramarine</b> blue, all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism. The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as cerulean blue, which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.|$|R
50|$|Against the {{background}} of blue, which depicts the sky, the primary theater of Air Force operations, the directional arrowhead represents the three main air routes served by the unit when it was organized in 1942. The stars allude to the squadron’s mission of support for multiple unified commands and military installations in the Southeastern United States, {{with the number of}} stars indicating its numerical designation, the large star denoting its Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The three-cup anemometer is emblematic of the weather mission. The hurricane represents the tropics, the unit’s first area of operations and the most severe that threatens its area of operation. The emblem bears the national colors of red, white, and blue and the Air Force colors of golden <b>yellow</b> and <b>ultramarine</b> blue.|$|R
50|$|Gorin was the {{greatest}} French disciple of Mondrian, but pushed the principles of neoplasticism further than others by using reliefs, which developed into wall sculptures.He always used the primary colors of bright red, light <b>yellow</b> and <b>ultramarine</b> blue on white and black backgrounds.His polychrome sculptures were very unusual for the time.He broke from Mondrian's rule of allowing only horizontal and vertical lines. While remaining true to neoplasticist geometric rigor, he introduced circles and diagonals.The angles may be unexpected, far from 45°.Between 1958 and 1962 Gorin was absorbed in painting {{the contrast between the}} circle and the linear network.After that he returned to relief. His works were now truly three-dimensional, designed to retain harmony while viewed from different angles rather than as compositions seen only from the front.|$|R
50|$|The emblem is {{symbolic}} of the squadron, and the Air Force colors, golden <b>yellow</b> and <b>ultramarine</b> blue alludes to the sky, the primary theater of Air Force operations, and the yellow to the excellence of Air Force personnel in performing their assigned duties. The sword identifies the squadron with Air Combat Command and its upward thrust denotes the function of providing the Air Force with ground control for utilization of airspace {{to the detriment of}} the enemy. The concentric red circles refer to the provision of radar, communications, and control facilities for effective air defense. The Cherokee Rose and Live Oak, the state flower and tree of Georgia, connote the squadron's organization in the Georgia, Guard. The blue strip connected with the wavy base indicates the location at Savannah, Georgia, noted for its channel which connects the city with the Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{imported}} wallpapers covered interior walls of Persian palaces and mansions, of which Vasiq-Ansari House in Isfahan, Iran, exhibits very highly elaborated examples. In this study, micro-Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, and light microscopy {{were used to}} identify pigments and other materials used in the wallpapers of Vasiq-Ansari House. Results indicated that chrome <b>yellow,</b> artificial <b>ultramarine</b> blue, brass metallic leaf, an organic red dyestuff (probably cochineal), and a copper-based green were used as colourants in the wallpapers. Different shades of brown were achieved by mixing various combinations of red lead, carbon black, and calcium carbonate. The white calcium carbonate was also used as a ground layer, applied to a paper support composed of bast and softwood fibres. Based on knowledge of the materials used, these wallpapers are most probably manufactured from the mid- to latenineteenth century...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} reveals the {{analytical}} characterisation {{carried out on}} ‘D’Aprés Cormon’ (1891) by Veloso Salgado, a copy of ‘Caïn’ (1880) by Fernando Cormon, belonging nowadays to Musée d’Orsay. Infrared Reflectography made in situ revealed underdrawing grid {{that was used to}} transpose the original painting to a smaller scale, pictorial style, execution method and retouched/restored areas. In situ EDXRF analysis together with Raman microscopy allowed the identification of gypsum, lead white, titanium white, <b>yellow</b> ochre, vermilion, <b>ultramarine</b> and lamp black. These results provide valuable information about the Salgado’s palette and his production technique...|$|R
30|$|Zinc {{chromate}} {{with the}} approximate composition of 4 ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O· 3 H 2 O {{also appeared in}} the beginning of the 19 th century, and the origin of its discovery is unclear [1]. Recently, Simonsen et al. have determined its structure as KZn 2 (CrO 4) 2 H 2 O(OH) by single-crystal X-ray crystallography [12]. This pigment is formed by precipitation when a solution of a zinc salt is added to a chromate solution (e.g. of sodium or potassium), in the presence of potassium ions [2]. During the 19 th century, the most common names for zinc chromate were zinc yellow and citron yellow but it was also labeled as <b>ultramarine</b> <b>yellow,</b> yellow button of gold and permanent yellow [2, 5, 14].|$|R
50|$|Impressionists {{generally}} used vivid colors, with often thick {{application of}} paint, and real-life subject matter. The new technology of premixed paints in tin tubes aided {{the development of}} this style. Previously, painters had made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil. In the 1860s, many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available such as cobalt blue, viridian, cadmium <b>yellow</b> and synthetic <b>ultramarine</b> blue, as well as even newer colors such as cerulean blue.As a result, the Impressionists soon moved toward a brighter style of painting. By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a light grey or beige colour, but some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white grounds.|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{illustrates}} the analytical characterization of 12 academic nude paintings by Veloso Salgado, made between 1883 and 1893. The study {{was done with}} in situ methods (infrared reflectography and EDXRF) and benchtop equipment (Raman and FTIR microscopes and SEM-EDS). Infrared reflectography revealed underdrawings, painting style, execution method and retouched/restored areas. Analytical techniques allowed the identification of gypsum, lead white, barium white, zinc white, yellow ochre, chrome yellow, zinc <b>yellow,</b> vermilion, synthetic <b>ultramarine</b> blue, cerulean blue, Prussian blue, viridian, green earth, Paris green, red ochre, raw umber and lamp black. These results provide valuable information on Salgado’s palette and his artistic production technique and allow the distinction between palettes used in Lisbon and Paris and consequently, technical interchanges between both Academies. Finally, this study intends to start a systematic analytical study of the Faculty of Fine Arts’ collection, allowing the characterization of many other authors and their influences {{for the development of}} painting methodology in this Academy...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} {{was carried out}} to obtain more information on materials and painting techniques used in Egyptian wall paintings during the 19 th century. The Hawsh al-Basha courtyard, dating back to Mohammed Ali's family period (1805 - 1952,) was studied for this purpose. The obtained results {{will be used to}} set up a scientific plan for restoration and preservation. Pigments, including white zincite, earth green, blue synthetic <b>ultramarine,</b> <b>yellow</b> massicot, black a mixture of magnetite & graphite, brownish red lead and brass were identified. The binding medium in the painting was identified as animal glue. Two preparation layers were identified: the inner coarse ground layer, composed of gypsum as a major component, with calcite and small amounts of quartz and the outer, fine ground layer, composed of calcite only. Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Microanalysis (SEM-EDX), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy with Attenuation Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) were used in our study...|$|R
50|$|Technical {{investigation}} of Rembrandt's {{paintings in the}} possession of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister and in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel) has been conducted by Hermann Kühn in 1977. The pigment analyses of some thirty paintings have shown that Rembrandt's palette consisted of the following pigments: lead white, various ochres, Vandyke brown, bone black, charcoal black, lamp black, vermilion, madder lake, azurite, <b>ultramarine,</b> <b>yellow</b> lake and lead-tin-yellow. One painting (Saskia van Uylenburgh as Flora) reportedly contains gamboge. Rembrandt very rarely used pure blue or green colors, the most pronounced exception being Belshazzar's Feast in the National Gallery in London. The book by Bomford (above reference) describes more recent technical investigations and pigment analyses of Rembrandt's paintings predominantly in the National Gallery in London. The entire array of pigments employed by Rembrandt can be found at ColourLex. The best source for technical information on Rembrandt's paintings on the web is the Rembrandt Database containing all works of Rembrandt with detailed investigative reports, infrared and radiography images and other scientific details.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper right}} of the shield {{consists}} of a compass rose against a yellow background. The compass rose signifies the global nature of the Wing mission and is set at a 30-degree angle to the east representing the magnetic variation of Alaska where the Group was first formed. The yellow background represents the midnight sun at high latitude and the day aspect of the air refueling mission. The lower left of the shield depicts a red lightning bolt running from cloud to cloud against a blue background. The red lightning bolt signifies the projection of military power, the clouds are the medium in which it performs its mission, and the blue background the Arctic night and the night aspect of its mission. The red lightning bolt is also a prominent feature of the squadron patch from which the 168th Air Refueling Group/Wing evolved. Between the yellow and blue fields is a bar of ultramarine blue containing eight <b>yellow</b> stars. The <b>ultramarine</b> blue is Air Force blue representing the 168 ARW's role in the Total Force; {{it is also the}} background color of the Alaska flag. The eight yellow stars are the stars of the big dipper also found on the Alaska flag.|$|R
