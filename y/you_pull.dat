It's about making choices, and having references—things <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> from your life that you believe in. It's about self-discovery and being creative. The record is slightly focused, but it's also eclectic. The music is intended to inspire people to feel a certain way about themselves, so they'll be able to encompass, in their own lives, a sense of inner fame that they can project to the world, and the carefree nature of the album {{is a reflection of}} that aura. I like to funnel interesting ideas {{to the rest of the}} world through a pop lens." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] is a comical Halloween episode {{which was}} filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. [...] After {{shooting}} for two days, director T.J. Scott went to producer Robert Tapert and asked permission {{to alter the}} episode's artistic style to stylised rock video horror. [...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!" [...] Ultimately, Scott felt that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> it too far out of context and try to take it seriously, it's a bit too rock video at times." ...|$|E

I guess you know what he'll do--you're so d--d secretive I can't tell whether you do or not. If <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> out, they'd have their bill on Friday." ...|$|R

2500|$|The album's {{original}} cover art featured no text, simply {{a painting of}} a clown by John Wayne Gacy. The interior photography included Polaroid pictures (faked by Manson and friends) apparently of a mutilated female body, and a photo of what Manson described as [...] "one of those dolls from the '60s and <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> a string on the back of it and the eyes get really big and they change colors." ...|$|E

2500|$|The trolley {{problem is}} a thought {{experiment}} in ethics. [...] The general form {{of the problem is}} this:There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks.

2500|$|Recalling his {{involvement}} with Foyt, Hutcherson said that [...] "A.J. had bought a Camaro to run USAC stock cars and we were running at Texas World Speedway at College Station. He had gotten mad about what some reporters had written {{about him in the}} days before the race. Well he sat on the pole and was leading the race when he pulled in with just a couple laps to go. I leaned in the car and asked him what was wrong and he said, 'Overheating.' I looked at the gauges which were normal and said, 'Why'd <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> out?' He looked at me and said, 'I didn't want to talk to those reporters in Victory Circle.' We had the race won and he parked the damn car!" ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Seventh Fleet's escort {{carriers}} {{found themselves}} {{under attack from}} the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours, a message was received from Admiral Nimitz: [...] "Where is repeat where is Task Force 34? The world wonders". The tail end of this message, The world wonders, was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat {{on the deck of}} the bridge and began cursing. Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral Robert [...] "Mick" [...] Carney, confronted him, telling Halsey [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with <b>you?</b> <b>Pull</b> yourself together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zap2it's Lisa Todorovich wrote: [...] "Oh, Shonda Rhimes, you minx. You get us {{all excited}} for the long-awaited marital union between Derek and Meredith, and <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> {{a great big}} bait-and-switch with Alex and Izzie. Congratulations on the very nice looking bridesmaids' dresses." [...] She {{described}} the wedding as [...] "great" [...] and George brilliant for helping Izzie walk down the aisle. She also praised Callie [...] "who handled the ER like a champ". Todorovich's colleague Ghosh Korbi suspected {{a week before the}} episode aired that it would center on Alex and Izzie." [...] Dustin Christian of Cinema Blend said the wedding was [...] "actually much better than the wedding we were led to expect." [...] However, he thought that everything happening before the last fifteen minutes was not interesting. Though he likes Callie and Arizona as a couple, he deemed their storyline [...] "ridiculous".|$|E
2500|$|The message (and its {{trailing}} padding) became famous, {{and created}} some ill feeling, since {{it appeared to}} be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. [...] "I was stunned as if I had been struck in the face", Halsey later recalled. [...] "The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him, shouting, [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with <b>you?</b> <b>Pull</b> yourself together!" [...] Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its lifefalsely claiming to be refueling his shipsbefore eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.|$|E

On April 16, 2011, she said Obama [...] "willfully ignored {{the will of the}} American people... when you got us into a third war for fuzzy and inconsistent reasons, a third war that we cannot afford." [...] She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama [...] "step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> out." [...] She continued, [...] "Simply put, what are we doing there? You’ve put us in a strategic no man’s land. If Gaddafi’s got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, as you and your spokesmen suggest, we’re not to tell Libya what to do when it comes to that country’s leadership, and if you can’t explain to Americans why we’re willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria’s, Yemen’s, Bahrain’s, Egypt’s, Israel’s, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 19, 1942 O'Hare assumed {{command of}} VF-3, {{relieving}} Lieutenant Commander Thach. He was relocated to Maui, Hawaii, to instruct other pilots in combat tactics.
