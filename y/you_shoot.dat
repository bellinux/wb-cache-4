One youth picked {{a rock and}} headed toward the army, only to be stopped by four other protesters. A witness interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights said that he and other protesters moved closer to army forces following the initial shooting. According to him he asked [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> us? We had our hands up. We are peaceful. What do you want from us?", one soldier replied [...] "I want you to leave. If you do not turn back, I have orders to shoot". Arriving ambulances started evacuating the injured when army opened fire again.|$|E
500|$|Third scale miniatures several {{meters in}} height {{were created to}} give the film the effect of realism, {{rather than relying on}} {{computer}} generated imagery (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of artificial snow were used (roughly 15–20 tons). A 4.5-meter miniature of an icebreaker with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: [...] "With computer graphics, you need {{to spend a lot of}} time making it real. With a miniature, <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> it and its there." [...] A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.|$|E

500|$|In March 1916, the 5th Division {{was sent}} [...] {{across the desert}} to defend the Suez Canal. The {{crossing}} was first attempted by the 14th Brigade, who suffered badly. Elliott personally inspected the route, talked with officers familiar with it, and drew up a new timetable for the march, managing to get his men across with {{only a handful of}} casualties. On the march, one man forgot the ban on smoking. Elliott characteristically started to scream at the man, even threatening to shoot him. Out from the ranks came a shout: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> him, I'll shoot you." [...] When the soldier who called out was brought forward and explained that no one talked to his brother like that, Elliott sent the man to his school for non-commissioned officers, with the rationale that anyone who could stand up to himself in full flight clearly had leadership potential.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the past films, the future of the {{franchise}} was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two films. However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. [...] But because <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> out of sequence, it's often just 'Turn left, cross the room, okay, that's a wrap.' And you're done. [...] Yeah, it's very odd. Because suddenly it was all over, just like that. It was really emotional for all of us, realising that we're never going to be doing this again.|$|E

Shaky cam… Hopefully what we strived for was to go a little retro in how <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> action scenes." [...] The film was shot in 3-D and its real 3D shots were done by lead stereographer Florian Maier and his team from Stereotec. Wirkola said: [...] "We shot half of it in real 3D and the other half was post converted. Actually the 3D thing wasn’t there in the beginning. It was something the studio suggested later on. We embraced it and I think it actually really helps in getting people into this fairy tale world." [...] The filming process took three months. A 12-minute B-roll footage was later released on the Internet.|$|E

[...] "The Love Song" [...] was {{described}} by Manson as an ode to Celebritarianism, and its title originated from his observation that [...] "Love Song" [...] {{is one of the}} most common titles in music. The lyrics are composed around an elaborate metaphor about guns. Manson explained: [...] "I was suggesting with the lyrics that the father is the hand, the mother is the gun, and the children are the bullets. Where <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> them is your responsibility as parents." [...] The chorus is a rhetorical take on a popular American bumper sticker: [...] "Do you love your God, gun, government?" [...] Kerrang! described [...] "The Fight Song" [...] as a [...] "playground punk anthem", and Manson revealed that its theme is Adam's desire to be a part of Holy Wood, saying that it is about [...] "a person who's grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, but when he finally , he realizes that it's worse than where he came from." ...|$|E

An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly am not so sure. <b>You</b> <b>shoot</b> {{a lot of things}} when you do a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so I really wish she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future." [...] A short clip of the music video was released online on June 12, 2008; a day before the video's premiere on June 13, 2008 on FNMTV.|$|E
500|$|Asteroids was {{conceived}} by Lyle Rains and programmed by Ed Logg with collaborations from other Atari staff. Logg {{was impressed with}} the Atari 2600 (then known as [...] "Atari Video Computer System") and joined Atari's coin-op division and worked on Dirt Bike, which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test. He developed Super Breakout after hearing that Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, wanted Breakout updated. Paul Mancuso joined the development team as Asteroids technician and engineer Howard Delman contributed to the hardware. During a meeting in April 1979, Rains discussed Planet Grab, a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to Cosmos. Logg did not know the name of the game, thinking Computer Space as [...] "the inspiration for the two-dimensional approach". Rains conceived of Asteroids as a mixture of Computer Space and Space Invaders, combining the two-dimensional approach of Computer Space with Space Invaders addictive gameplay of [...] "completion" [...] and [...] "eliminate all threats". The unfinished game featured a giant, indestructible asteroid, so Rains asked Logg: [...] "Well, why don’t we have a game where <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> the rocks and blow them up?" [...] In response, Logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces. Both agreed on the concept.|$|E

500|$|From 1999 to 2003, Steffy and Phoebe were {{portrayed by}} various sets of {{identical}} twin child actors. Cameryn McNabb {{took over the}} role in 2003. From January to March 2004, Jordan Mella played Steffy. In April 2004, both roles were recast with Keaton and Kylie Rae Tyndall, and Steffy was rapidly aged. Kylie portrayed the role of Steffy until April 2005, when the role was recast with Addison Hoover, whose twin sister Alex Hoover took {{over the role of}} Phoebe. The Hoover twins were downgraded to recurring status in November 2005, and eventually left the program. In June 2006, former Guiding Light actress MacKenzie Mauzy took over the role of Phoebe upon the character's return, while Steffy was written out of the series. Steffy was absent from the soap opera until June 4, 2008, when Canadian actress Jacqueline MacInnes Wood took over the part. With the casting of Wood, Phoebe and Steffy were retconned as fraternal twins. A month after Wood's arrival, Mauzy announced her exit from the show and Phoebe was killed off. Wood finds filming on the show very quick; saying, [...] "On the daily [...] we can shoot up to 90 pages, that’s 8 to 12 episodes, in 4 days with sometimes no rehearsal! In films, <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> 100 pages in 4 months." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E
500|$|IGN noted {{improved}} graphics, {{which it}} favourably {{compared to those}} of a John Woo film. GameSpot called the graphics as [...] "about {{as good as it}} gets", particularly with a 3D video card. The New Straits Times also appreciated the game's performance with a 3Dfx Voodoo card, praising the graphics of the terrain, as well as water and helicopter movements. GameFan acclaimed the attention to detail and variety in environment graphics' textures. Reviewing the PC version, Allgame called the graphics [...] "decent", but criticised the minimal progress from Soviet Strike which resulted in [...] "a slightly archaic look" [...] and lack of [...] "a feel of individuality". Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64, the website noted that the graphics ably handled numerous explosions and enemies. The reviewer praised the detail, colours and fluid motion. He also acknowledged the use of N64 Expansion Pak, but said [...] "the game still moves and looks very nice" [...] without it. Game Revolution felt: [...] "This is definitely the best-looking 'Strike' game yet." [...] It praised the [...] "gorgeously rendered" [...] maps and the detail on structures and units, while Next Generation complained of [...] "water that doesn't ripple and a few other missing touches" [...] resulting in a somewhat haphazard feel. Daily Radar praised the terrain graphics but called the vehicles [...] "horrible". Power Play praised the impressive graphics and destructible scenery. Game Revolution also praised the persistent battlefields: [...] "What really stands out is the ability to interact with everything. When <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> water, you see and hear the splashes. You can blow up almost anything that they've put on the map" [...] but noted the sometimes unrealistic results, such as ships being launched high into the air upon destruction. Edge called said the terrain graphics were [...] "some of the best yet on the PlayStation", but there were otherwise no ground-breaking visuals.|$|E

[...] Honeycutt felt {{that the success of}} the film's blend of aliens and western themes was due to [...] "the {{determination}} by everyone involved to play the damn thing straight. Even the slightest goofiness, the tiniest touch of camp, and the whole thing would blow sky high. But it doesn't." [...] He criticized the aliens, which he said [...] "don't rate as characters", existing as [...] "moving blobs <b>you</b> <b>shoot</b> at in a video game." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt's sentiments that the [...] "potential hamminess" [...] of the premise is offset by the cast, particularly Craig through a [...] "mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity." [...] He considered however, that Wilde had the opposite effect, stating she [...] "appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars". Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying [...] "beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play" [...] and concluded that [...] "a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best." [...] Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice said the Western elements of the film were [...] "lovingly" [...] handled but called felt the science aspects a [...] "gimmick" [...] and [...] "much more standard fare" [...] in comparison.
