One can interpret leadership broadly and state that “ [...] . a leader is someone who touches another’s future ” (Champlin, 1993 : 24). With this interpretation, leaders are clearly recognizable as those who affect the direction a person or a group (e. g. parish) will take. Peter Senge, writing in The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook, concurs with this understanding and notes that {{it is easy to}} perceive both good leadership and the absence of good leadership. “You can always sense {{the presence or absence of}} leadership when you begin working in a new organization. In some cases, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that something is off-kilter, though everyone is saying the ‘right ’ things. You also know that they know something’s off-kilter [...] . ” (1994 : 65) In a chapter entitled “There Are No Leaders, There Is Only Leadership, ” Richard Farson states that leadership is the less the property of a person than the property of a group. He notes the examples of leaders who successfully move from one organization to another even though they may not be experts in the second organization’s business. They are able to do this because they call forth the skills and creativity of those already within the organization. He concludes that i...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to create more {{knowledge}} about the teacher's perceptions of group dynamics {{and its impact on}} school activities. How do teachers opportunities and obstacles in order to influence group dynamics among students. The questions I have answered is how the teachers see the importance of a functioning group dynamics in school, how teachers work with group dynamics and how teachers describe the opportunities and obstacles for effective group dynamics. The method I am using at work is a qualitative research method that involves obtaining the teachers' own thoughts, feelings and experiences around the right questions. I have interviewed three teachers in primary schools in the county of Stockholm to find out their particular approach. The theory I have assumed is that the teacher's attitude affects group dynamics in class, where a democratic approach should permeate the teaching and its values. They summarized the conclusions I have is that teachers {{have a major impact on}} the group's importance and that they are working from it in different ways. The benefits of a working group dynamics is that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of security in the class to be developed further.

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} interconnected world, communicating across cultures {{is a crucial}} skill in the international networks of business, science, and technology. Subject examines a range of communication styles and techniques resulting from different cultural norms and traditions. It begins with a general theoretical framework and then moves into case studies. Topics include understanding the relationship between communication and culture, differences in verbal and non-verbal communication styles, barriers to intercultural communication, modes of specific cross-cultural communication activities (e. g. argumentation, negotiation, conflict resolution) and intercultural adjustment. Case studies explore specific ways of communicating in Asian and European cultures. Graduate {{students are expected to}} complete additional assignments. Taught in English. From the course home page: Course Description It has become commonplace knowledge that globalization {{is one of the major}} forces shaping our world. If we look at the spread of information, ideas, capital, media, cultural artifacts [...] or for that matter, people [...] we can see the boundaries and borders that have historically separated one country or one group from another are becoming more and more permeable. For proof of this close to home, you need only to look at the composition of the MIT student body: 8 percent of the undergraduates and 37 percent of the graduate students are from 109 different countries. "Communicating Across Cultures" is designed to help you meet the challenges of living in a world in which, increasingly, you will be asked to interact with people who may not be like you in fundamental ways. Its primary goals are to help you become more sensitive to intercultural communication differences, and to provide you with the knowledge and skills that will help you interact successfully with people from cultures other than your own. We hope the course will accomplish those goals by exposing you to some of the best writers and scholars on the subject of intercultural communication, and by giving you a variety of opportunities to practice intercultural communication yourself.
