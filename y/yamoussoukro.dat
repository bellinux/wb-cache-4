The force {{arrived at the}} Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels. By the time ECOMOG arrived, Prince Johnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL were fighting on the outside bounds of the port. A series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and <b>Yamoussoukro</b> in June–October 1991. The first seven peace conferences, including the <b>Yamoussoukro</b> I-IV processes and the Carter Center negotiation leading to the Cotonou Accords, failed {{due to lack of}} agreement between the warring factions. The NPFL launched an assault on Monrovia in 1992, which they named 'Operation Octopus.' The civil war lasted until the Abuja Accords of August 1996.|$|E

On 6 November 2004, at least one Ivorian Sukhoi Su-25 attacked a unit of France's Unicorn peacekeeping forces stationed in Bouaké at 1300, killing nine peacekeepers and a U.S. development worker, and wounding 37 soldiers. Shortly afterwards, the French military retaliated by attacking the air base in <b>Yamoussoukro</b> and destroyed the Ivorian air force, including its two Su-25s.|$|E

40|$|A study {{designed}} {{to characterize the}} effects of shellfish products on the chemical properties of fluvisols gleyic and yield of rice {{was carried out in}} Toumbokro, <b>Yamoussoukro’s</b> region, Côte d'Ivoire. The work has been focused on soil amendment by three types of shells (Achatina spp Donax spp and Ostrea spp). Three doses of shellfish products (500, 1000 and 1500 kg. ha- 1) and NPK fertilizer were tested in a split-plot design with three repetitions. At ground level, the study showed that the shellfish products have positive effects very marked on all the physical and chemical characteristics. The effects of these shellfish products on the richness of the soil occur gradually. The increase of pH, due to the products made, creates a condition favorable to microorganisms that become active and mineralize sufficient organic substances. The study indicates that shellfish products induce high levels of production of rice cultivation. The average of yield of the experiments carried out is set at 5. 41 t. ha- 1 in Toumbokro. These performances, never recorded insubsistence agriculture, are explained by the effective correction of mineral deficiencies unsuspected soil by the flow of shellfish products. All the variables studied define the contribution of 1000 kg. ha- 1 shredded shells of Achatina spp, as the optimum for soil amendment...|$|R

In the early 1980s, the world recession and a local drought sent shock waves through the Ivoirian economy. Due to the overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices, the country's external debt increased three-fold. Crime rose dramatically in Abidjan.|$|E

500|$|In the West, Houphouët-Boigny was {{commonly}} known as the [...] "Sage of Africa" [...] or the [...] "Grand Old Man of Africa". Houphouët-Boigny moved the country's capital from Abidjan to his hometown of <b>Yamoussoukro</b> and built the world's largest church there, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of <b>Yamoussoukro,</b> at a cost of US$300million. At the time of his death, he was the longest-serving leader in Africa's history and the third longest-serving leader in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il-sung of North Korea. In 1989, UNESCO created the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize for the [...] "safeguarding, maintaining and seeking of peace". After his death, conditions in Côte d'Ivoire quickly deteriorated. From 1994 until 2002, {{there were a number of}} coups d'état, a currency devaluation, an economic recession, and, beginning in 2002, a civil war.|$|E
500|$|According to his {{official}} biography, Houphouët-Boigny was probably born on 18 October 1908, in <b>Yamoussoukro</b> {{to a family}} of hereditary chiefs of the Baoulé people. Unofficial accounts, however, place his birth date up to seven years earlier. [...] Born into the animist Akouès tribe, he was named Dia Houphouët: his first name Dia means [...] "prophet" [...] or [...] "magician". His father was N'Doli Houphouët. Dia Houphouët was the great-nephew through his mother of Queen Yamousso and the village chief, Kouassi N'Go. When N'Go was murdered in 1910, Dia was named to succeed him as chief. Due to his young age, his stepfather Gbro Diby ruled as regent until Dia came of age; Dia's father had already died.|$|E

There is no clear consensus on the unfolding of the 1963 events; in fact, there may have been no plot at all and the entire series of events may have been part of a plan by Houphouët-Boigny to consolidate his hold on power. Between 120 and 200 secret trials were held in <b>Yamoussoukro,</b> in which key political figures—including Mockey and the president of the Supreme Court Ernest Boka—were implicated. There was discontent in the army, as the generals grew restive following the arrest of Defense Minister Jean Konan Banny, and the president had to intervene personally to pacify them.|$|E

Houphouët-Boigny offered it to Pope John Paul II as a [...] "personal gift"; the latter, after having unsuccessfully requested it being shorter than St. Peter's in Rome, consecrated it all the same on 10 September 1990. Due to a collapse of the national economy coupled with lavish amounts spent on its construction, the Basilica was criticized: it was called [...] "the basilica in the bush" [...] by several western news agencies.|$|E

Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed. [...] ECOMOG was reinforced {{in order to protect}} the interim government.

Following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 deaths, Guéï was swiftly replaced by Gbagbo. Alassane Ouattara was disqualified by the country's Supreme Court, due to his alleged Burkinabé nationality.
