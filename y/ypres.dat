5|$|Billy Geen is commemorated on panels 51 and 53 of the Menin Gate in <b>Ypres,</b> the {{memorial}} to missing {{soldiers from the}} battles of the <b>Ypres</b> Salient.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Beatrice was one {{of several}} {{members of the royal family}} who became patrons of The <b>Ypres</b> League, a society founded for {{veterans}} of the <b>Ypres</b> Salient and bereaved relatives of those killed in fighting in the Salient. She was herself a bereaved mother, as her son, Prince Maurice of Battenberg, had been killed in action during the First Battle of <b>Ypres.</b> Rare public appearances after his death included commemorations, including laying wreaths at the Cenotaph in 1930 and 1935 to mark the 10th and 15th anniversaries of the founding of the League.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Mont Sorrel (Battle of Mount Sorrel, Battle of Hill 62) {{was a local}} {{operation}} in World War I by three divisions of the British Second Army and three divisions of the German Fourth Army in the <b>Ypres</b> Salient, near <b>Ypres,</b> Belgium, from 2 to 14 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|Alexis Helmer, a close friend, {{was killed}} during the battle on May 2. McCrae {{performed}} the burial service himself, at which time he noted how poppies quickly grew around the graves {{of those who died}} at <b>Ypres.</b> The next day, he composed the poem while sitting in the back of an ambulance at an Advanced Dressing Station outside <b>Ypres.</b> This location is today known as the John McCrae Memorial Site.|$|E
5|$|Between September and November 1917, I Anzac Corps {{took part}} in a number of actions around <b>Ypres</b> in Belgium as the Allies {{launched}} a campaign in order to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau in Belgium. Collectively these actions have {{come to be known as}} the Third Battle of <b>Ypres,</b> of which they were a part, although to Australians they are more commonly known by the names of the places where the individual actions took place—Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|The British First Army {{commander}} General Henry Horne {{ordered the}} Canadian Corps to relieve I Corps from their position opposite {{the city of}} Lens on 10 July 1917 and directed Canadian Corps commander Arthur Currie {{to develop a plan}} for capturing the town by the end of July 1917. The operation was intended to engage as many German formations as possible and to prevent them from reinforcing the <b>Ypres</b> sector during the Third Battle of <b>Ypres.</b>|$|E
5|$|Begun on 9 April, Operation Georgette {{shifted the}} {{focus to the}} devastated town of <b>Ypres,</b> in Flanders. The {{bombardment}} preceding the attack was of considerable scale and included phosgene gas shells, causing severe casualties among the Liverpool Scottish.|$|E
5|$|Birks' grave {{is in the}} Perth (China Wall) Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery near <b>Ypres.</b> A {{memorial}} {{was constructed}} at his old school in Wales in 1921,funded largely by contributions from local people. When the school was demolished the Memorial was moved to outside St. Matthews Church where it stands now. On Remembrance Sunday the local branch of the British Legion continues to place a wreath of poppies on the Memorial. A portrait of Fred is {{on display at the}} Australian War Memorial in Canberra, alongside his Victoria Cross. He is also remembered in the Museum in <b>Ypres,</b> Belgium (Cloth Hall). His service during the war earned him the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used as a weapon on April 22, 1915, at <b>Ypres</b> by the German Army. The effect on the allies was devastating because the {{existing}} gas masks were difficult to deploy and had not been broadly distributed.|$|E

5|$|He {{was first}} awarded the Military Medal while {{fighting}} {{at the second}} battle of <b>Ypres,</b> Festubert and Givenchy, for courage above fire in getting important messages through to the rear.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1917, the Australians {{were moved}} to Belgium {{as the focus of}} British {{operations}} shifted to the <b>Ypres</b> sector in an effort to draw German attention away from the French. The first effort came around Messines, on the southern flank, where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines. On 7 June, 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting, the British captured Messines Ridge. Assigned a support role, the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack. The following day, it was committed to hold the gains that had been made during the attack, relieving the New Zealanders around Gooseberry Farm. The 15th remained in the <b>Ypres</b> sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of <b>Ypres</b> in September. In November 1917, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a three-month rest, spending the winter around Templeux-la-Fosse and Hollebeke.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{division}} {{had been moved}} to Flanders in February 1917. Initially based at Steenwerck, the following month it shifted north to the Messines area, which was south of <b>Ypres,</b> to relieve the 36th Division.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} battles of Ginchy and Morval, the 1/10th {{was engaged in}} a purely supporting role: trench networks were constructed and improved near Delville Wood, and the dead collected and buried. A party of two officers and 100 other ranks {{was attached to the}} Third West Lancashire Field Ambulance during the Battle of Morval. After bivouacking at Pont Rémy, the battalion transferred with its division to the relatively quiet <b>Ypres</b> Salient in October. The routine of alternating between the front line, being in support, and in reserve preoccupied the battalion until the Third Battle of <b>Ypres</b> in July 1917. Casualties were nevertheless sustained by the battalion during this period, invariably as a result of shelling and sniping.|$|E
5|$|The 12th Battalion formed part of 40th Division {{and served}} in France on the River Lys during the advance in Flanders (18 August to 6 September 1918) and the Fifth Battle of <b>Ypres,</b> and in France and Belgium during the final weeks of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Second Battle of Passchendaele was the {{culminating}} attack {{during the}} Third Battle of <b>Ypres</b> of the First World War. The battle {{took place in}} the <b>Ypres</b> Salient area of the Western Front, in and around the Belgian village of Passchendaele, between 26 October and 10 November 1917. The Canadian Corps relieved the exhausted II Anzac Corps, continuing the advance started with the First Battle of Passchendaele and ultimately capturing the village. Beyond gaining favourable observation positions, the battle was intended to gain drier winter positions on higher ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was subsequently}} {{returned to the}} <b>Ypres</b> salient, positioned at Wieltje. On 31 July 1917, a new offensive around <b>Ypres</b> was launched to try to penetrate the German lines, advance to the Belgian coast and capture German submarine bases. The Liverpool Scottish experienced some of the heaviest resistance in 166th Brigade's area, taking heavy losses around the fortified farms. The battalion remained in some captured German trenches until it was relieved on 3 August. Captain Chavasse died of wounds the next day having again tended to wounded soldiers. His actions earned him a posthumous Bar to his Victoria Cross, {{one of only three}} men to be so decorated, and the sole double recipient of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} of <b>Ypres</b> were well {{prepared for a}} siege {{by the time the}} English and their allies arrived and attacked the city on 8 June 1383. Dwellings in the outlying suburbs had been abandoned; the timber from them was used to strengthen the earth ramparts and the stone gates of the city. A mission had been dispatched to Paris to replace artillery powder stocks. The city was well organised under the command of the Castellan of <b>Ypres,</b> John d'Oultre, and had been divided into different defensive sectors. Although the ramparts were low, they were well protected with a double wet ditch, a high thorny hedge reinforced with stakes and a wooden stockade and fire-step.|$|E
5|$|The {{objectives}} of the assault were to inflict casualties and to draw German troops away from the 3rd Battle of <b>Ypres,</b> rather than to capture territory. The Canadian Corps executed an operation to capture Hill 70 and then establish defensive positions from which combined small-arms and artillery fire, some of which used the new technique of predicted fire, would repel German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible. The goals of the Canadian Corps were only partially accomplished; the Germans were prevented from transferring local divisions to the <b>Ypres</b> Salient but failed to draw in troops from other areas.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{involvement}} at Pozières from July to September 1916, the 12th Battalion {{moved to}} the <b>Ypres</b> sector in Belgium, where Whittle was promoted to sergeant on 14 October. In late November, Whittle was admitted to hospital suffering from an illness; on 18 December, he rejoined his unit, which had returned to action on the Somme.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a {{solicitor}} in Leicester before volunteering for overseas service during the First World War. He was killed in July 1915 near <b>Ypres</b> on the Western Front, after {{being hit by a}} shell splinter while serving as a lieutenant in the 1/4th Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment. Tarr was one of 27 former England internationals killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|He {{volunteered to}} join the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1915, and served with the Canadian Field Artillery {{for nearly two years}} in France and another at the Belgian front. Cook participated in several engagements, {{including}} at <b>Ypres,</b> the Somme, Vimy Ridge and Hill 70. He then fought into 1919 in Siberia as part of the allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In Belgium, the In Flanders Fields Museum in <b>Ypres,</b> {{named after}} the poem and devoted to the First World War, is {{situated}} in one of Flanders' largest tourist areas. A monument commemorating {{the writing of the}} poem is located at Essex Farm Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, which is thought to have been the location of Helmer's burial and lies within the John McCrae Memorial Site.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1917, II ANZAC Corps—along {{with two}} British corps—launched an {{operation}} in Flanders {{in order to}} eliminate a salient south of <b>Ypres.</b> The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds (454,545kg) of explosives that had been placed underneath the Messines ridge, destroying the German trenches. The advance was virtually unopposed, and despite strong German counterattacks the next day, it succeeded. Australian casualties during the Battle of Messines included nearly 6,800 men. I ANZAC Corps then {{took part in the}} Third Battle of <b>Ypres</b> in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau, between September and November 1917. Individual actions took place at Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks of fighting the Australians suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 100,000 British and German {{troops were}} {{involved}} in the unofficial cessations of hostility along the Western Front. The first truce started on Christmas Eve 1914, when German troops decorated the area around their trenches in the region of <b>Ypres,</b> Belgium and particularly in Saint-Yvon (called Saint-Yves, in Plugstreet/Ploegsteert – Comines-Warneton), where Capt. Bruce Bairnsfather described the truce.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion went to France in September 1914 {{as part of}} 17th Brigade in 6th Division. It {{took part}} in the First Battle of <b>Ypres</b> being based in the Armentières sector on the {{southern}} flank of the battle. In December 1914 it was in trenches in the Rue-du-Bois area (near Fleurbaix), and participated in the Christmas truce, where British and German soldiers fraternised in no man's land.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{refrained from}} {{attempts}} {{to recapture the}} lost ground at Lens, due {{to the demands of}} defensive operations of the Third Battle of <b>Ypres</b> and the need to avoid the diversion of forces from the main effort. The Canadian attack prevented the Germans from transferring five divisions in the Lens area to Flanders.|$|E
5|$|The battalions {{that served}} in France {{took part in}} many of the major actions of the war {{including}} the 1915 Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the 1915 Battle of Loos, the Battle of the Somme in 1916, the Third Battle of <b>Ypres</b> in 1917 and the Battle of Amiens in 1918.|$|E
