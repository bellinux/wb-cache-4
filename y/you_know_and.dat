And I thought: 'This is incredible, because no one's heard this number yet. This {{is the first time}} they're hearing it!' It obviously touched them, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>And</b> that was at the L.A. Forum, so I knew we were onto something with that one.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{critical}} {{success with}} Walk the Line, Witherspoon admits to spending several years [...] "kind of floundering career-wise". Reflecting on {{this period of}} time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent [...] "a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs." [...] She claims that she [...] "wasn't making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>And</b> it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything I was putting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I've {{considered}} [...] for two years, and in {{the last}} six months, it's seemed real clear to me. I realized that my job would become my career if I stayed. Some people stay with a series until the end, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> afterwards they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after Dallas. There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E

500|$|In a November 2003 {{interview}} with Mike Wallace {{on the television}} news magazine 60 Minutes, Taylor claimed he hired and sent prostitutes to opponents' hotel rooms the night before a game {{in an attempt to}} tire them out, and that at his peak, he spent thousands of dollars a day on narcotics. He also recounted several other instances of aberrant behavior, including arriving to a team meeting during his playing career in handcuffs after spending a night with some call girls. He said, [...] "A couple of ladies that were trying out some new equipment they had. <b>You</b> <b>know?</b> <b>And</b> I just happened to, and they just didn't happen to have the key." [...] He also said that to beat NFL drug tests, he routinely submitted the urine of his teammates.|$|E
500|$|After {{helping her}} husband with another {{unsuccessful}} parliamentary campaign, Pankhurst faced legal troubles in 1896 {{when she and}} two men violated a court order against ILP meetings at Boggart Hole Clough. With Richard's volunteering his time as legal counsel, they refused to pay fines, {{and the two men}} spent a month in prison. The punishment was never ordered for Pankhurst, however, possibly because the magistrate feared public backlash against the imprisonment of a woman so respected in the community. Asked by an ILP reporter if she were prepared to spend time in prison, Pankhurst replied: [...] "Oh, yes, quite. It wouldn't be so very dreadful, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> it would be a valuable experience." [...] Although ILP meetings were eventually permitted, the episode was a strain on Pankhurst's health and caused loss of income for their family.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{said that}} the album was [...] "refreshing", and that Collins was [...] "adept" [...] at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood. Holden {{described}} [...] "Only <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>and</b> I Know" [...] as an [...] "angry love song" [...] that had some sampling of [...] "Motown" [...] style music mixed in. [...] "In 'One More Night', Mr. Collins's recent number-one hit, a ticking snare drum injects a whisper of lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter, tenderer reprise of 'Against All Odds'", says Holden. Holden concluded by saying [...] "On the surface, No Jacket Required, is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes. But beneath its shiny exterior, Mr. Collins's drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive, enigmatic dialogue between heart and mind, obsession and repression." ...|$|E

Clarkson revealed that she finds herself similar to the titular [...] "Miss Independent". She said, [...] "It's very funny when the song came into play with me ... 'cause at that certain time of my life, I was actually going through that kind of thing," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I've always been real guarded about work and career. It wasn't even with, like, guy relationships, it was just, like, friends and just letting people in, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>And</b> so it was kinda weird 'cause I was going through that same thing at the same time, so it was very easy for me to write the bridge to the song." ...|$|E

500|$|Rashad enjoyed {{working with}} both Cosby {{and the young}} cast, {{claiming}} that the actors very much became like a real family {{as early as the}} first episode, although her real-life relationship with the child actors more-so resembled that of friends as opposed to mother. Rashad said, [...] "I think Bill and I are great role models as far as our TV professions are concerned. Kids learn by example, and I think we're very good ones." [...] Second to Cosby himself, Rashad is the series' most regular cast member, appearing in a total of 212 episodes. In response to television personality Oprah Winfrey quoting a common critique of the series – [...] "How is it realistic to have a doctor and a lawyer in the same house?" [...] – Rashad defended, [...] "I grew up in Houston, Texas, in Third Ward, and it was very realistic. … I guess it just depends on who <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> what you know." ...|$|E

Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics. [...] I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-executive {{producer}} David Munk {{said that}} {{the idea for the}} record started after his suggestion that Cole [...] "return to her R roots by recording an intimate, classic soul CD {{with a small group of}} sidemen and simple production". Munk served as an executive producer for the album. He viewed the recording sessions in Atlanta as eclectic and described Cole's ambition: [...] "he shared with me her hope of making a country-soul record in Memphis; she also spoke of doing a piano-voice album and of recording in Spanish". In an interview with American Songwriter, Cole said the album [...] "was born out of desperation" [...] to record a pop and urban project rather than a jazz one. She sought to avoid being typecast as a jazz singer by returning to R and demanding more artistic control. As an arranger on the album, she said the recording sessions reminded her of how she: [...] "missed the freedom ... ad-libbing, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> being able to holler every now and then ... all of that energy".|$|E
500|$|Rosenblat {{was given}} the storyline that ties up the second season. The scenes feature Miss Rosa being told that {{she is going to}} die from her cancer. Fellow inmate and prison van driver Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) feels sorry for her and exits the van urging Miss Rosa to escape. The final scene {{features}} Miss Rosa driving away when she notices Vee also making an escape from prison. Recalling an earlier altercation with Vee, Miss Rosa careens the vehicle at Vee killing her instantly. Rosenblat told Silman that she joyfully screamed in the bathroom for five minutes when she learned of her character's actions. She added [...] "After all this effort {{to get rid of this}} woman, just evil incarnate, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> then I stroll along in my van. [...] 'So rude, that one.' Amazing. That final scene was really great." [...] During the scene Miss Rosa morphs into her younger incarnation as she becomes free once again. Rosenblat recalled the logistics of filming having to swap backwards and forth with Andujar to create the same position behind the wheel.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] <b>You</b> <b>know?</b> <b>And</b> if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't we just go straight to the source".|$|E
500|$|Despite this, the duo {{have not}} staged a {{full-scale}} tour or performed shows since 2010. Garfunkel confirmed to Rolling Stone in 2014 {{that he believes}} they will tour in the future, although Simon had been too [...] "busy" [...] in recent years. [...] "I know that audiences {{all over the world}} like Simon and Garfunkel. I'm with them. But I don't think Paul Simon's with them," [...] he remarked. In a 2016 interview with NPR's David Greene, when asked about the possibility of reuniting, Simon stated; [...] "Well, I don't think most people do [...] The fact is, is, like, we did do two big reunions, and we're done. There's nothing really much to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] And, you know, I mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun. If it was fun, I'd say, OK, sometimes we'll go out and sing old songs in harmony. That's cool. But when it's not fun, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> you're {{going to be in a}} tense situation, well, then I have a lot of musical areas that I like to play in. So that'll never happen again. That's that." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover photo {{features}} (from left to right) Johnny, Tommy, Joey and Dee Dee Ramone, {{staring at}} the camera with blank faces. They are all wearing ripped/faded blue jeans and leather jackets, standing upright against the brick wall of a private community garden called Albert's Garden, located in the Bowery neighborhood of New York City between Bowery Street and Second Street. The stance of the group members in the photograph would influence their future cover designs as well, {{with the majority of}} their succeeding albums using a picture of the band on the front cover. Music historian Legs McNeil states that [...] "Tommy [...] standing on his tip-toes and Joey [...] hunched over a bit." [...] The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. Liner notes on the back cover fail to acknowledge backing vocalists and additional instrument players. Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: [...] "We didn't want people to get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> we didn't want people to get confused." ...|$|E

Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we get up in the morning is to take people along for the ride.

500|$|The {{formulation}} of Russell as an Asian American character, {{along with the}} casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well. Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell. EWP lauded Pixar {{for the creation of}} the character, stating, [...] "We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film." [...] The character is noted as Pixar's first lead Asian character, and was further positively received within the added context of historical non-Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment. Asian American organizations and entertainment websites, such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), Racebending.com, and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions, noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment. In an interview with NPR in 2013, Angry Asian Mans Phil Yu reflected on the character's lack of typical Asian stereotyping, stating, [...] "You know, he just happens to be Asian and he's, you know, really adorable character. But that kid could've been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian - just a little color, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> it's really wonderful when that kind of thing happens where they don't have to play that up and make it like a thing or a joke, which happens a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|Development officially {{began in}} 2009, when TNT {{announced}} that it had ordered to pilot an untitled alien invasion project. Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat, who {{is best known for}} writing the Oscar-winning film Saving Private Ryan, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. [...] "I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [...] spirit of '76. I came up — out of the blue one day — with the name Falling Skies, which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion. What is unique about this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world," [...] he stated. Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival. [...] "I've always been interested in how we survive and how resourceful we are as Americans. How would the survivors feed the children? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost?" [...] he added. Like much of Spielberg's work, such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Falling Skies running theme is family and brotherhood. He explained, [...] "It's a theme I harken back to a lot because it's something I believe in. It's something I have the closest experience with. [...] They say write what <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> with seven children and three sisters... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories." ...|$|E
