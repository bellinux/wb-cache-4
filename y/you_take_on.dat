In January 2017 he said “Let me tell you, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the {{intelligence}} community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,” {{in response to}} those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments. Later that month he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>on.</b> Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E
500|$|... "Mass Effect 2: Overlord" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Reviewer Erik Brudvig of IGN described [...] "Overlord" [...] as [...] "one {{of the best}} series of missions that the franchise has yet seen." [...] Similarly, reviewer Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer opined that the pack [...] "never lets one gameplay element dominate for too long, leavening the expected duck-and-cover combat with openworld exploration {{and a dash of}} environmental puzzling, all wrapped up in a story that builds to a satisfying and pathos-heavy finale." [...] GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd credited the on-foot action, stating that [...] "a few of the larger environments let <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> [...] from multiple angles, which are a nice change from the straight-on encounters that typify most of Mass Effect 2s battles." [...] He also praised the final boss battle, which was said to exceed that of the main game.|$|E
