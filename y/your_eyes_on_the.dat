500|$|Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now, {{published}} in 1993, is African-American writer and poet Maya Angelou's first book of essays. [...] It was published shortly after she recited her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration. Journey {{consists of a}} series of short essays, often autobiographical, along with two poems, and has been called one of Angelou's [...] "wisdom books". [...] It is titled after a lyric in the song Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Prize. At the time of its publication, Angelou was already well respected and popular as a writer and poet. [...] Like her previous works, Journey received generally positive reviews.|$|E
2500|$|When {{explaining}} {{the meaning of}} [...] "Revelation Song", Randy Phillips stated that it “captures the moment of looking up into Heaven, peeling back the curtain of eternity so we can peek in. If you keep <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dow Jones or nuclear weapons in North Korea, you’ll always be nervous. Look to the awesomeness of God instead.” The song was written by Jennie Lee Riddle.|$|E
2500|$|Denisoff {{subdivided}} protest {{songs as}} either [...] "magnetic" [...] or [...] "rhetorical". [...] "Magnetic" [...] protest songs {{were aimed at}} attracting people to the movement and promoting group solidarity and commitment – for example, [...] "Keep <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Prize" [...] and [...] "We Shall Overcome". [...] "Rhetorical" [...] protest songs, on the other hand, are often characterized by individual indignation and offer a straightforward political message designed to change political opinion. Denisoff argued that although [...] "rhetorical" [...] songs often are not overtly connected to building a larger movement, they should nevertheless be considered as [...] "protest-propaganda". Examples include Bob Dylan's [...] "Masters of War" [...] (which contains the lines [...] "I hope that you die / And your death'll come soon") and [...] "What's Going On" [...] by Marvin Gaye.|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open <b>Your</b> <b>Eyes</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. That was the one thing I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets for a moment in time.") However, Open Your Eyes [...] was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The title single [...] managed to reach number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart.|$|E
