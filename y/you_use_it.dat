Dan Offner, a partner for the video game industry analysis firm Loeb & Loeb {{believed that}} similar laws and regulations will be sought by State and Federal governments, as [...] "the regulation of mature content with respect to minors as a hot button issue for the Federal Trade Commission and the various state governments."

Sean Bersell of the EMA noted that future debates over violent video games may involve public opinion in addition to new legislation, noting that [...] "Retailers along with publishers and parents all have a role in keeping kids away from these games."

[...] Schiesel also considered that even if games with increased interactivity and reality may make the games more dangerous, this could also make the player more aware of the potential consequences of his or her actions, even when such an action is made with the purpose to gain points/level or to kill a [...] "dangerous enemy" [...] in that game.|$|E

40|$|Logic {{programming}} and functional programming {{row in the}} same boat. Methods used to achieve success with one often transpose to the other, and both face similar obstacles.
