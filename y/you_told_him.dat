500|$|Of a great Institution like Smithfield, [...] {{are unable}} to form the least conception. A Beast Market {{in the heart of}} Paris would be {{regarded}} an impossible nuisance. Nor have they any notion of slaughter-houses {{in the midst of a}} city. One of these benighted frog-eaters would scarcely understand your meaning, if <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of the existence of such a British bulwark.|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. [gravely] That was {{exceedingly}} rude of Bentley, Mrs Tarleton. I hope <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so.|$|E
60|$|Aseb. But {{you forget}} the noblest part, And master piece {{of all your}} art,-- <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he was sick at heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "He ses <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>’im</b> <b>you</b> p’isoned ’im," [...] said Henshaw, solemnly, [...] "and ’e {{give you}} two shillings to get {{something}} to cure ’im. It’s too late now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He ses <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>you</b> p'isoned 'im," [...] said Henshaw, solemnly, [...] "and 'e {{give you}} two shillings to get {{something}} to cure 'im. It's too late now." ...|$|R
6000|$|The news was, of course, {{declared}} {{to the family}} at Merle Park. [...] "I never knew anything so hard," [...] said Aunt Emmeline. [...] "Of course <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that it was all}} my fault." [...] When Lucy made no answer to this, she went on with her complaint. [...] "I know that <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that I have turned you out,--which is not true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, he knew {{exposure}} to the frost would be very dangerous for you; <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> you had been ill," [...] Lucy interposed.|$|E
6000|$|And at this tea Captain Cormorant said, {{among other}} things, [...] "Did he kick up rough {{at all when}} <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about the money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{his face}} cleared up again when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that your {{question}} was only suggested {{by what you}} had read in the Report of the Trial?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{understand}} you, Lucy. What {{truth or}} what untruth can <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> if, as <b>you</b> say, {{there has been}} nothing between you but ordinary conversation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{actually}} simple enough, Stella, {{to think that}} a man of Romayne's temper would have made you his wife if <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of the Brussels marriage?" ...|$|R
60|$|JUDITH. I disobeyed <b>you.</b> I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything. I {{expected}} him {{to come here and}} save you. I wanted him to come here and save you. He ran away instead.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Did Mr. Armadale seem surprised,' I asked, 'when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of our engagement, {{and when}} {{you said it was}} to be kept a secret from everybody?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you speak}} {{from your own}} observation," [...] said she, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that my sister loved him, or merely from my {{information}} last spring?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a disreputable lawyer, {{recently}} disbarred," [...] said I. [...] "I wish I {{had seen}} you in time. I trust <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> nothing about Carthew?" ...|$|E
60|$|From Mr. Bear I had {{the best}} {{accounts}} of <b>you.</b> I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that they did not}} surprise me, for I had unbounded faith in you. For which take my love and blessing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Fiorsen {{has done}} us the honour to wish to marry <b>you.</b> I've <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>you</b> decide such things for yourself. If you accept him, {{it will be}} against my wish, naturally." ...|$|R
60|$|BRODIE (same attitude). I {{spoke of}} you as I have found <b>you.</b> (I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were a disreputable hound, and that Moore had crossed a fight.) I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> were a drunken ass, and Moore an incompetent and dishonest boxer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did hear}} <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{not to be}} a--perhaps I had better say--a simple fool," [...] Helen {{answered}} mischievously; and Bransome coughed before he made reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{what he is}} {{required}} for, Osgod?" [...] Wulf asked, as the boy, doffing his cap, stood before him {{with an air of}} extreme humility.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} can prevent that best yourself, by telling Uncle Regie how sorry you are. He was {{specially}} grieved because he thinks <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> two direct falsehoods.' ...|$|E
6000|$|MR. WILLINGS. 'He was incredulous. Indeed, {{he seemed}} to think I was balmy. But I offered to bring him {{straight}} to <b>you.</b> I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how much <b>you</b> had {{talked to me about}} him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} bring {{yourself}} {{to tell it}} to me, nor could I understand it. He will understand everything, and if he thinks that <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything, he will at any rate respect you." ...|$|R
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] The old blind Man, [...] When <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the mischance, {{was troubled}} [...] Even to the {{shedding}} of some natural tears [...] Into the torrent over which he hung, [...] Listening in vain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to go, Mother, and didn't {{cry when}} he went, and never {{complain}} now, or {{seem as if}} you needed any help," [...] said Jo, wondering.|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave him}} a quick glance and colored. [...] "Yes, I made it and got the East-bound express. The {{engineer}} was kind. I expect <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he must help?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so, you saw Rufino!" [...] Maria said. [...] "Did he inquire after me? <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> I hope, that I {{was fading}} away rapidly from grief at his absence." ...|$|E
60|$|WOODER. Visitor who's {{been seeing}} Q 3007 asks {{to speak to}} <b>you,</b> sir. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> it wasn't usual.|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth {{moved his}} head. [...] "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "What I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> I <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> {{and he seemed}} to think that one could live--even that kind of thing--down. He is, you see, a {{somewhat}} exacting man, and that gave me the hope that you would be as merciful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] was the answer. [...] "It {{occurs to}} me that French Louis said he couldn't tally out all the sticks of giant powder that he'd stowed away a week or two ago. I think <b>you</b> foolishly <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he couldn't count straight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> also," [...] {{she said}} sternly, [...] "that, however {{deficient}} {{we may be}} in feeling, we did everything that lay in our power for our child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} to think quietly of it, my love, for your sake.--Well! well! And <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all that Anne Catherick had said to you--all that you told me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And at {{the very}} time was almost living with this woman who says that she is {{divorced}} from her husband in America! Have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that you will see him no more?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But come, {{let us go}} on. Por Sing {{is expecting}} <b>you.</b> I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that I knew that one from the {{garrison}} would come out to treat with him privately tonight, and he is expecting you, though {{he does not know}} who may come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, I {{am afraid}} I should have felt very shaky if I {{had not heard}} your account of the admiral. From what you say it is evident he is a kindly man, and after all <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about me he can’t have many {{questions}} to ask.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't {{know whether}} they came {{together}} or not. Porton showed up about two hours before Merwell arrived. Of course, they may have separated just before the camp was reached--Porton not wanting {{to appear in the}} company of a fellow <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> was a crook." ...|$|R
