500|$|According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, it is a [...] "mutating, episodic dance-floor track, [...] {{the singer}} {{presents}} {{herself as the}} goddess of love in the 'seashell bikini' painted by Botticelli [...] ". The lyrics of [...] "Venus" [...] are space-themed, name-checking the planets in the Solar System, with references to the planet's mythical counterpart, Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. The extraterrestrial themes drew comparisons to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] (2011) in the Entertainment Weekly review of the track. John Walker from MTV News noted that [...] "During Gaga's futuristic ballroom emcee moment, where she channels something straight out of Paris Is Burning she utters the line 'Uranus!/ Don't you know my ass is famous!?' That's like, the greatest version of 'Don't <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> <b>I</b> Am!?' that we've ever heard." ...|$|E

500|$|Eric Henderson for Slant Magazine {{disapproved of}} [...] "Jump", writing {{that it is}} an [...] "ice-cold" [...] and [...] "echoey dubstep torture chamber" [...] whereby Rihanna interpolates Ginuwine's [...] "Pony" [...] sample void of emotion. Rihanna's vocals on the song sound similar to the vocals by Justin Timberlake on his 2002 single [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] (Justified, 2002). Lyrically, in [...] "Jump" [...] Rihanna preaches to her former partner that she won't be chasing him. Jude Rodgers of The Guardian {{described}} it as a [...] "see sex wriggling everywhere". In the song, the singer sings [...] "Skrillex-worthy" [...] lines, [...] "You think I give a damn/ but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am/ I don't go around chasing no dude". The chorus features Rihanna singing, [...] "If you want it, let's do it/ Ridin' my pony/ My saddle is waitin'/ Come and jump on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 67-year-old deposed Saddam {{appeared}} {{confident and}} defiant throughout the 46-minute hearing. Alternating between listening to and gesturing at the judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin, he questioned {{the legitimacy of}} the tribunal set up to try him. He called the court a [...] "play" [...] aimed at Bush's chances of winning the US presidential elections. He emphatically rejected charges against him. [...] "This is all theater. The real criminal is Bush", he stated. When asked by the judge to identify himself in his first appearance before an Iraqi judge (three of the five judges and the prosecutor were never identified nor photographed for security reasons), he answered, [...] "You are an Iraqi, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am." ...|$|E

2500|$|UFF {{leader and}} self-styled [...] "Captain Black" [...] John White {{confessed to the}} killings during a police {{interrogation}} for other offences at the Castlereagh Holding Centre in 1976. He was convicted of the murders in 1978 and given two life sentences. The trial judge described the killings as [...] "a frenzied attack, a psychotic outburtst". White maintained that the UFF's second-in-command (and later North Belfast UDA brigadier) Davy Payne, also known as [...] "The Psychopath", {{was part of the}} assassination squad and played {{a leading role in the}} killings. Historian Ian S. Wood confirmed Payne's central involvement in the double killing. Although Payne had been questioned by the RUC after the killings, he admitted nothing and never faced any charges. It was alleged that whenever Payne wished to frighten or intimidate others he would shout: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am? I'm Davy Payne.

6000|$|The Quaker trading captain {{regarded}} {{him for a}} while in silence. His look, it seemed to Mainwaring, appeared to be dubitative as to how far he dared to be frank. [...] "Friend James," [...] he said at last, [...] "I may as well acknowledge that my officers and crew are somewhat worldly. Of a truth they do not hold the same testimony as I. I am inclined to think that if it came to the point of a broil with those men of iniquity, my individual voice cast for peace would not be sufficient to keep my crew from meeting violence with violence. As for myself, <b>thee</b> <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am and what is my testimony in these matters." ...|$|R
