25|$|Some dinophytes, like Kryptoperidinium and Durinskia have a diatom (heterokontophyte) derived {{chloroplast}}. These chloroplasts are {{bounded by}} up to five membranes, (depending on whether <b>you</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast, or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it). The diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original mitochondria, and has endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, a nucleus, and of course, red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete cell, all inside the host's endoplasmic reticulum lumen. However the diatom endosymbiont can't store its own food—its storage polysaccharide is found in granules in the dinophyte host's cytoplasm instead. The diatom endosymbiont's nucleus is present, but it probably can't be called a nucleomorph because it {{shows no sign of}} genome reduction, and might have even been expanded. Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.|$|E
500|$|The Japan Times gave Snow Prince a {{score of}} 2 out of 5. In the {{critical}} review entitled [...] "Weep over this princely pile of slush", Mark Schilling criticized the film as [...] "a weeper that ... left me surprisingly dry eyed" [...] and added that [...] "There's hardly a spark of originality in the entire enterprise, unless <b>you</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> casting of Tadanobu Asano – the coolest Japanese actor of his generation – as a sad-but-wise circus clown." [...] Reviewer Matiko Wataru of the [...] "Eiga-Judge" [...] website said that [...] "this innocent and sad tale tragedy of the boy is too simplistic and the screenplay did not do much.". However, the review praised the [...] "beautiful scenery {{of the city of}} Shonai" [...] and said the film was a [...] "sad and beautiful combination of children and animals".|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if <b>you</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E

6000|$|My {{very dear}} Friend,--I hear with wonder from Arabel of your {{repudiation}} of my word 'octosyllabic' {{for the two}} lines in your controversial poem. Certainly, if <b>you</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> syllables on your fingers, there are ten syllables in each line: of that I am perfectly aware; but the lines are none the less belonging to the species of versification called octosyllabic. Do you not observe, my dearest Mr. Boyd, that the final accent and rhyme fall on the eighth syllable instead of the tenth, and that that single circumstance determines the class of verse--that {{they are in fact}} octosyllabic verses with triple rhymes? ...|$|E
6000|$|Norfolk Street, King's Road--jocularly {{known among}} Mr. Pitman's lodgers as [...] "Norfolk Island"--is neither a long, a handsome, nor a {{pleasing}} thoroughfare. Dirty, undersized maids-of-all-work issue {{from it in}} pursuit of beer, or linger on its sidewalk listening {{to the voice of}} love. The cat's-meat man passes twice a day. An occasional organ-grinder wanders in and wanders out again, disgusted. In holiday-time the street is the arena of the young bloods of the neighbourhood, and the house-holders have an opportunity of studying the manly art of self-defence. And yet Norfolk Street has one claim to be respectable, for it contains not a single shop--unless <b>you</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> public-house at the corner, which is really in the King's Road.|$|E

In old bygone days we had the wars in the Low Countries always at our doors, as it were; {{there was no need}} to go far afield into malaria-stricken wilds if one wanted a life of boot and saddle and licence to kill and be killed.

60|$|There is no coign of vantage more {{effective}} than the position of young lady cashier. She sits there, easily queen of the court of commerce; she is duchess of dollars and devoirs, countess of compliments and coin, leading lady of love and luncheon. You take from her a smile and a Canadian dime, and you go your way uncomplaining. <b>You</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> cheery word or two that she tosses you as misers count their treasures; and you pocket the change for a five uncomputed. Perhaps the brass-bound inaccessibility multiplies her charms--anyhow, she is a shirt-waisted angel, immaculate, trim, manicured, seductive, bright-eyed, ready, alert--Psyche, Circe, and Ate in one, separating you from your circulating medium after your sirloin medium.|$|E
60|$|This also is {{one means}} to make souls tender of sin (it is the burned child that feareth the fire), to make them humble {{in a sense of}} their own vileness, to make them count {{everything}} that God giveth them a mercy, to make much of the least glimpse of the love of God, and to prize it above the whole world. O sinners, were you killed indeed [to sin], then Heaven would be Heaven, and Hell would be Hell indeed; but because you are not wrought upon in this manner, therefore <b>you</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> ways of God as bad as a good man counteth the ways of the devil, and the ways of the devil and Hell as good as a saint doth count the ways of God.|$|E

What can you give me but money and position in return for the youth and freedom I should sacrifice in marrying you? Not love, for <b>you</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> cost of your bargain, as no true lover could, and you reproach me for deceit when in your heart you know you only cared for me because I can amuse and serve you.

60|$|The great aim of Elizabeth's {{life was}} to make a new man of Nutty.

She liked to listen of a morning to the sound of Nutty busy in the next room with a broom and a dustpan, for in the simple lexicon of Flack's there was no such word as 'help'. The privy purse would not run to a maid. Elizabeth did the cooking and Claude Nutcombe the housework.|$|R
