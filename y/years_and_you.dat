500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E

And I responded to him by telling him that Nigeria is not Libya, not Egypt, not Cameroun, and not Togo; I said you must leave; even if it means both of us lose out, but you cannot stay." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2005, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Bryant Gumbel, Moss admitted that he has smoked marijuana during his NFL career [...] "every blue moon." [...] When asked whether he still used marijuana currently, Moss replied [...] "I might. I might have fun. And, you know, hopefully ... I won't get into any trouble by the NFL by saying that, you know. I have had fun throughout my <b>years</b> <b>and,</b> <b>you</b> know, predominantly in the offseason." [...] The interview drew criticism from the league office, and his agent tried to spin it that his words were taken out of context. In response, Moss said [...] "That was really me talking {{in the past tense}} of way back in the beginning of my career and my childhood – especially in high school and college." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jo Ann Compton's {{daughter}} Laurie Ann {{was stabbed}} to death in 1988—and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. [...] "I hope they're in the same hell I'm in," [...] she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil to help Jo Ann. He {{asked her if she}} thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain—and Compton said no. [...] "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life," [...] Phil continued. [...] "She lived for 18 vibrant <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> focus on the day she died." [...] After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: [...] "I never thought of it that way."

When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: [...] "She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive."
