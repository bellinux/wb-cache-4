In October 1942, he earned his wings and a second lieutenant's commission when he graduated with class 42I at Lake Charles, Louisiana.

25|$|Since the Portuguese {{wanted to}} keep the line of {{demarcation}} of Alcaçovas running east and west along a latitude south of Cape Bojador, a compromise was worked out and incorporated in the Treaty of Tordesillas, dated on 7 June 1494, in which the globe was split into two hemispheres dividing Spanish and Portuguese claims. These actions gave Spain exclusive rights to establish colonies in all of the New World from north to south (except Brazil), as well as the easternmost parts of Asia. The treaty of Tordesillas was confirmed by Pope Julius II in the bull Ea quae pro bono pacis on 24 January 1506. Spain's expansion and colonization was driven by economic influences, a <b>yearning</b> <b>to</b> improve national prestige, and a desire to spread Catholicism into the New World.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Hogan's friend Ed Leslie (later {{known as}} Brutus Beefcake) came to Cocoa Beach to help Hogan and Bridges manage both the Anchor Club and the Whitey and Terry's Olympic Gym. On his spare time, he and Leslie {{worked out in}} the gym together, and eventually, Beefcake {{developed}} a muscular physique; Hogan was impressed by Beefcake's physical stature and became convinced {{that the two of}} them should wrestle together as tag team partners. Depressed and <b>yearning</b> <b>to</b> return to wrestling, Hogan called Superstar Billy Graham in 1978 with hopes that Graham could find him a job wrestling outside of Florida; Graham agreed and Hogan soon joined Louie Tillet's Alabama territory. Hogan also convinced Leslie, who had yet to become a wrestler, to come with him and promised to teach him everything he knew about the sport.|$|E
25|$|A year later, the new Abbé {{arrives at}} Charenton and {{is given the}} grand tour by Royer-Collard. During the tour they meet the maid Charlotte and through the {{exchange}} between herself and Royer-Collard {{it is apparent that}} there is a connection. The asylum has been converted into a print shop, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abbé meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. <b>Yearning</b> <b>to</b> write, he begs paper and a quill from the new Abbé, and tries to strangle Royer-Collard when he ventures to close the peephole. The Abbé is herded off by Royer-Collard before he can hear anymore from his predecessor. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine's mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through. The Abbé begins to scribble furiously, with the Marquis providing the narration.|$|E

25|$|Horthy clearly saw {{his country}} as trapped between two {{stronger}} powers, {{both of them}} dangerous; evidently he considered Hitler to be the more manageable of the two, at least at first. Hitler was able to wield greater influence over Hungary than the Soviet Union could — not only as the country's major trading partner, but also because he could assist with two of Horthy's key ambitions: maintaining Hungarian sovereignty and satisfying the nationwide <b>yearning</b> <b>to</b> recover former Hungarian lands. Horthy's strategy was one of cautious, sometimes even grudging, alliance. The {{means by which the}} regent granted or resisted Hitler's demands, especially with regard to Hungarian military action and the treatment of Hungary's Jews, remain the central criteria by which his career has been judged. Horthy's relationship with Hitler was, by his own account, a tense one – largely due, he said, to his unwillingness to bend his nation's policies to the German leader's desires.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{minstrel}} show {{coincided with}} the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most had no idea how these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s minstrelsy became decidedly mean-spirited and pro-slavery as race replaced class as its main focus. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves always ready to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves <b>yearning</b> <b>to</b> return to their masters were plentiful. The message was clear: do not worry about the slaves; they are happy with their lot in life. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.|$|E
25|$|As a baby, Harry was in {{the room}} when Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul had been {{weakened}} and destabilised by his continuous murders and the creation of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead {{is a direct result of}} this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's mental and emotional states, allowing the reader to eavesdrop on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul <b>yearning</b> <b>to</b> depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.|$|E

He also carried on with corresponding through letter across the United States and to Europe. One evening he announced the betrothal of Louis G. Gregory and Louisa Mathew and astonished the crowd. Elders with ear trumpets listened. Once he took his Persian entourage aside and spoke comparing feasts of kings that were brilliant but had no enthusiasm while there they ate modestly and in hard circumstances {{or so it seemed}} but everywhere there was real enthusiasm of the heart. On August 11 he was noted speaking to a local Unitarian church with answers to questions of such length and detail that it was claimed he must have memorized the answers beforehand. He compared his <b>yearning</b> <b>to</b> see the audience to the Apostles that traveled far to see people. From there he left for Green Acre August 16.|$|E
25|$|Sara Stanley (Sarah Polley): An adventurous 10-year-old girl used to fine {{living in}} Montreal, {{including}} a nanny, {{must learn to}} adjust to Avonlea's simpler life. Her mother, Ruth King—sister to Hetty, Alec, Roger, and Olivia—died of tuberculosis when Sara was a toddler. When Sara's father runs into trouble, he arranges to have Sara and her nanny, Louisa, stay in Avonlea for a while. Sara stays without her nanny and lives with her single aunts, Hetty and Olivia, at Rose Cottage. In seasons three-five, Sara mostly concerns herself with matchmaking in Avonlea, which causes much controversy within the conservative hamlet. After season five, Sarah Polley left the show. In the middle of season six, Sara reappears, and both Louisa and Aunt Hetty start planning her future without consulting her. Sara, <b>yearning</b> <b>to</b> become a writer, though, has applied to a prestigious writing school in Paris. In the end, Louisa and Hetty accept Sara's plan. Sara later returns for Felicity's wedding in the series finale, but {{does not appear in}} the reunion film, An Avonlea Christmas. However, Felicity mentions something Felix and Sara did in the past while trying to comfort a terrified Janet when Felix is listed as missing in action.|$|E
500|$|... "Crawl" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Chris Brown. It is the second single from his third studio album Graffiti, released as a digital download on November 24, 2009. The song was produced by The Messengers and was written by Nasri Atweh, Adam Messinger, Luke James, and Brown. The song is about <b>yearning</b> <b>to</b> rebuild a failed relationship and was interpreted by critics as being about Brown's former relationship with Barbadian singer Rihanna.

Brownworth calls Angelou's prose [...] "colloquial and from the heart".
