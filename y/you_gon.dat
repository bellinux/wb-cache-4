[...] O argument blasphemous, false and proud! [...] Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n [...] Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate [...] In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. [...] Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne [...] 810 [...] The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn, [...] That to his only Son by right endu'd [...] With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n [...] Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due [...] Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist [...] Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, [...] And equal over equals to let Reigne, [...] One over all with unsucceeded power. [...] Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute [...] With him the points of libertie, who made [...] 820 [...] Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n [...] Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being? [...] Yet by experience taught we know how good, [...] And of our good, and of our dignitie [...] How provident he is, how farr from thought [...] To make us less, bent rather to exalt [...] Our happie state under one Head more neer [...] United.

Cease then this impious rage, [...] And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease [...] Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, [...] While Pardon {{may be found in}} time besought. [...] So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale [...] None seconded, as out of season judg'd, [...] Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd [...] Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd.
