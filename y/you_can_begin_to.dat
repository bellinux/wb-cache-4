5000|$|Social media becomes {{effective}} {{through a}} process called [...] "building social authority". One of the foundation concepts in social media has become that you cannot completely control your message through social media but rather <b>you</b> <b>can</b> simply <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> participate in the [...] "conversation" [...] expecting that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> achieve a significant influence in that conversation.

A marketer can generally not expect people to be receptive to a marketing message in and of itself.

50|$|Hard {{landscaping}} involves {{projects that}} cover {{the entirety of the}} yard and that are necessary before soft landscaping features come into play. Hard landscaping is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the “bricks and mortar”, and so only once this is completed <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft landscaping such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting your color schemes. One key feature of hard landscaping is to do with the absorption of water - something that is of great importance given the climate. Hard landscaping ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall isn’t an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through hard landscaping, coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that your yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are soft landscaping options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is definitely achieved through hard landscaping.|$|R

60|$|One of {{the first}} errors of our search for the Archaeological Museum, {{promoted}} by the mistaken kindness of people we asked the way, found us in the Academy of Fine Arts, where {{in the company of}} a fat and flabby Rubens (Susanna, of course, and those filthy Elders) we chanced on a portrait of Goya by himself: a fine head most takingly shrewd. But there was another portrait by him, of the ridiculous Godoy, Prince of the Peace, a sort of handsome, foolish fleshy George Fourthish person looking his character and history: one of the most incredible parasites who ever fattened on a nation. This impossible creature, hated more than feared, and despised more than hated, who misruled a generous people for twenty-five years, throughout the most heroic period of their annals, the low-born paramour of their queen and the beloved friend of the king her husband, who honored and trusted him with the most pathetic single-hearted and simple-minded devotion, could not look all that he was and was not; but in this portrait by Goya he suggested his unutterable worthlessness: a worthlessness which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> realize by successively excluding all the virtues, and contrasting it with the sort of abandon of faith on the part of the king; this in the common imbecility, the triune madness of the strange group, has its sublimity. In the next room are two pieces of Goya's which recall in their absolute realism another passage of Spanish history with unparalleled effect. They represent, one the accused heretics receiving sentence before a tribunal of the Inquisition, and the other the execution of the sentence, where the victims are mocked by a sort of fools' caps inscribed with the terms of their accusal. Their faces are turned on the spectator, who may forget them if he can.|$|R

[...] Barnet was however unable to attend the stone laying ceremony for this completion, as he had travelled to Europe to make important notes on art and architecture, continuing research and observations to justify the designs of the Pitt Street carvings.|$|R
5000|$|Female dolls {{have the}} {{non-twisting}} belly-button body mold and share an all-new face mold that sports a small nose, wide cheekbones, and large, pouty lips. In some lines (beginning with [...] "Night on the Town") dolls have rooted eyelashes and glittery eyes. Like the Bratz, these dolls have large shoes {{that serve as}} feet, {{but they also have}} traditional Barbie feet and are able to wear regular Barbie shoes. Male dolls also share exclusive face molds, with body molds from previous male dolls. In 2004, new smiling face molds were produced for both male and female characters. These were only present for a short while on the female dolls, but male dolls were made with these molds until early 2005. Beginning with the [...] "Club Birthday" [...] line, their face molds were again changed to non-smiling molds that more closely resembled the [...] "Bratz Boyz" [...] line of dolls. Beginning with the [...] "Swappin' Styles" [...] line of 2006, two new face molds have been produced for female dolls—one features a half-open smiling mouth, and another features a new, closed smirking mouth. This line also sees the return of the [...] "Getting Ready" [...] smiling face mold.

6000|$|... ... The {{assurance}} {{you speak}} of is what we all ought to have, and might have, and should not consent to live without. That {{people do not have}} it more than they do is, I believe, because persons speak so much in large-drawn, theological similitudes, and won't say out what they mean about life, and man, and God, in fair and square human language. I wonder if you or my father ever thought of the obscurities that lie upon human duty from the negative form in which the Ten Commandments are stated, or of how Christ was so continually substituting affirmations. [...] "Thou shalt not" [...] is but an example; [...] "Thou shalt" [...] is the law of God. It was this that seems meant in the phrase that [...] "not one jot nor tittle of the law should pass." [...] But what led me to the remark is this: A kind of black, angry look goes with that statement of the law of negatives. [...] "To love one's neighbour as oneself" [...] is certainly much harder, but states life so much more actively, gladly, and kindly, that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see some pleasure in it; and till you can see pleasure in these hard choices and bitter necessities, where is there any Good News to men? It is much more important to do right than not to do wrong; further, the one is possible, the other has always been and will ever be impossible; and the faithful design to do right is accepted by God; that {{seems to me to be}} the Gospel, and that was how Christ delivered us from the Law. After people are told that, surely they might hear more encouraging sermons. To blow the trumpet for good would seem the Parson's business; and since it is not in our own strength, but by faith and perseverance (no account made of slips), that we are to run the race, I do not see where they get the material for their gloomy discourses. Faith is not to believe the Bible, but to believe in God; if you believe in God (or, for it's the same thing, have that assurance you speak about), where is there any more room for terror? There are only three possible attitudes--Optimism, which has gone to smash; Pessimism, which is on the rising hand, and very popular with many clergymen who seem to think they are Christians. And this Faith, which is the Gospel. Once you hold the last, it is your business (1) to find out what is right in any given case, and (2) to try to do it; if you fail in the last, that is by commission, Christ tells you to hope; if you fail in the first, that is by omission, his picture of the last day gives you but a black lookout. The whole necessary morality is kindness; and it should spring, of itself, from the one fundamental doctrine, Faith. If you are sure that God, in the long run, means kindness by you, you should be happy; and if happy, surely you should be kind.|$|E

Online communication, access, interaction and transactions are everywhere—from banking to education to government to manufacturing—and for all types of goods and services. Every point on every value chain counts on 24 x 7 applications and data at their virtual finger tips. Organizations must now ensure that resources and information are available whenever and wherever they are needed. In other words, the Internet phenomenon has increased requirements for seamless information availability and up-to-the-minute data accuracy. In the meantime, there is world unrest, a rise in computer crime, and growing concern about interdependence among organizations and countries. Although these realities are hardly within your control, they can have a devastating effect on your World Wide Web presence. If the October 2002 DDOS on the world’s root servers was not your wake-up call, we are serving you notice today. You don’t have an adequate information availability program unless you have thoroughly considered how Internet disruptions and disasters affect the security, continuity and recovery of your organization—and vice versa.
