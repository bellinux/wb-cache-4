500|$|When Wilson was 12 years old, {{his father}} was {{diagnosed}} with cancer. His father fought the disease for five years before dying while Wilson was attending Londonderry High School; Wilson today says he had to become a man when {{his father was}} diagnosed. In a 2011 story, ESPN.com writer Elizabeth Merrill said about Wilson's high school years, [...] "He was an honor roll student at Londonderry, but clashed with various authority figures who didn't appreciate his occasional lack of a filter." [...] In the same story, a number of Londonderry faculty speculated that some teachers didn't understand Wilson's life situation at the time. Art Psaledas, an assistant principal at the school, added, [...] "It happened at probably the worst time anybody could lose <b>your</b> <b>dad.</b> Watching his dad deteriorate over the years was probably the singular thing that formed his personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's <b>your</b> <b>dad.</b> And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things. But when you become a man, you understand why." ...|$|E
500|$|Davies and Cornell {{debated whether}} {{it should have been}} Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left {{ambiguous}} in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm <b>your</b> <b>dad,</b> it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally Pete was to take a swig of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.|$|E

500|$|HIStory {{received}} generally positive reviews. Arguably Jackson's most angry, raw, emotional album, the new {{tracks on}} HIStory revealed a musician worn and torn {{by years of}} superstardom, now reportedly reacting against people who tried to bring him down. This reaction is what some people say ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times writing that [...] "It {{has been a long}} time since Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking <b>your</b> <b>dad</b> with you into a fight."

They were named [...] "Hope for 2004" [...] at the 2004 Meteor Awards. In 2005, the singles [...] "Comeback Girl" [...] and [...] "You Know It" [...] received significant airplay on Irish radio. Republic of Loose's second album Aaagh!, released in April 2006, reached number two in the Irish Albums Chart, achieving platinum sales and a Choice Music Prize nomination in the process. It spawned several more successful singles, including [...] "Break" [...] which achieved notoriety in South Africa where a radio station banned it following complaints regarding its allegedly explicit lyrics. , Republic of Loose's third album, was released in 2008. That album produced their highest chart performer to date, [...] "The Steady Song", which peaked at number twelve and stayed in the Irish Singles Chart for thirteen weeks. Bounce at the Devil, the band's fourth album, was released in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Mick Pyro {{performed}} with self-described [...] "rubbish rock bands" [...] {{for several years}} before the formation of The Republic of Loose. During this time, he was, according to himself, [...] "depressed out of my brains" [...] and listened to artists such as Manic Street Preachers. Experiencing what he termed [...] "a huge metaphysical overturning of my value system", Pyro had developed a fascination with musicians such as James Brown and The Rolling Stones, or [...] "the stuff <b>your</b> <b>Dad</b> likes". This change of musical interest prompted him to create Johnny Pyro, an alter-ego, who, according to Pyro, [...] "disassociated himself from the normal lifestyle of an Irish bourgeois kid". This alter-ego would later develop into Johnny Pyro And The Rock Coma (Mik Pyro, Dave Pyro, Coz Noleon, Mark Dennehy and Emmet Cole). The band recorded an EP, which featured four of the songs that later appeared on the Republic of Loose's first album, 'This Is The Tomb Of The Juice.' Following the departure of guitarist Emmet Cole (who wrote the song [...] "Black Bread") and bassist Mark Dennehey [...] "," [...] respectively, Johnny Pyro and Rock Coma split.|$|E

2500|$|Growing up {{in south}} London, Oldman {{supported}} his local football club Millwall, and also followed Manchester United {{so that he}} could watch his idol, George Best. In 2011, Oldman would learn from his mother that his father represented Millwall after World War II, with Oldman stating: [...] "Just after the war, she ran a boarding house, for football players, Millwall players. And I knew that my dad was involved somehow with the reserve team. But two weeks ago my mum said, 'Oh yeah, <b>your</b> <b>dad</b> played for Millwall.

2500|$|The Shizuoka District Court {{discounted}} part of Hakamada's {{confession and}} chided {{the police for}} their interrogation tactics. But, on September 11, 1968, the three-judge panel found Hakamada guilty and sentenced him to death. [...] The Japan Pro Boxing Association alleged that prejudice against boxers was involved, and said the principle of {{innocent until proven guilty}} had been violated because of rampant press reports declaring Hakamada guilty. [...] A subsequent appeal to the Tokyo High Court was denied and the Supreme Court of Japan upheld the death sentence on November 11, 1980. Hakamada maintained his innocence, writing to his son in 1983: [...] "I will prove to you that <b>your</b> <b>dad</b> never killed anybody, and it is the police who know it best and it is the judges who feel sorry. I will break this iron chain and return to you." [...] Although Hakamada remained on death row, he was not executed because the Minister of Justice refused to sign his death warrant, suspecting that the conviction was not certain. Like most death row inmates, Hakamada was placed in solitary confinement throughout his prison stay. He was not permitted to talk to guards, and rarely allowed visitors.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to <b>your</b> <b>dad</b> or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E

BostonNOW asked the band if Ross ever had [...] "any anti-fans at your shows?" [...] Ross replied: [...] "Never.
