50|$|The Iberian lynx preys {{foremost}} on the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) for {{the bulk}} of its diet, supplemented by red-legged partridge, rodents and to a smaller degree also on wild ungulates. It sometimes preys on <b>young</b> <b>fallow</b> deer, roe deer, mouflon, and ducks. A male requires one rabbit per day while a female raising kittens will eat three per day. The Iberian species has low adaptability — it continued to rely heavily on rabbits (75% of its food intake) despite the latter's repeated population crashes due to two diseases: myxomatosis, which spread to Iberia after a physician intentionally introduced it in France in 1952, and rabbit haemorrhagic disease beginning in 1988. There were two major outbreaks of the latter in 2011 and 2012. Recovery has occurred in some areas — in 2013, rabbit overpopulation was reported south of Córdoba, causing damage to transport infrastructure and farms. In December 2013, however, it was reported that wildlife officials were concerned about the spread of a new strain of the hemorraghic disease, affecting mainly young rabbits. Sierra Morena's rabbit population was worst affected, falling from an average of three per hectare to less than one — below the minimum required level of 1.5 to two per hectare. Forced to travel greater distances for food, the lynx became more susceptible to death in road accidents, particularly on Autovía A-4.|$|E
40|$|The velvet {{tamarind}} (Dialium guineense Willd) {{is one of}} the key {{species for}} domestication in Sub-Saharan Africa. In order to help the sustainable management and conservation of this species, its structural characteristics and ethnobotanical traits were studied in the 4 vegetation types (typical dense forest, degraded dense forest, <b>young</b> <b>fallow</b> and old fallow) of the Lama forest reserve. A forest inventory was carried out in 100 randomly selected squared plots of one ha each in the 4 vegetation types. One rectangular plot of 0. 15 ha was set up within each 1 ha plot for their structural description. Moreover, 10 squared plots of 10 m side were established on one of the diagonal in each one ha plot in order to estimate regeneration density. An ethnobotanical survey was also carried out among 100 randomly selected people of the Holli, Fon and Adja sociocultural groups living adjacent to the forest. Results showed that there were significant differences between the 4 vegetation types according dendrometric parameters. Stem diameter structure showed a non-normal shape.

The comparison of results in adult red and fallow deer revealed the higher body mass, total protein, triacylglyceride, creatinine, urea and glucose concentration in red deer, and higher aspartate aminotranspherase (AST) and alanine aminotranspherase (ALT) activity and cholesterol concentration in fallow deer.

It was measured the small-scale patterns of above- and belowground biomass and nutrient accumulation, root distribution, soil fertility, soil solution composition, quantity and nutrient accumulation concentration of rainwater, throughfall and stem flow, soil hydrology, soil physics and microclimate, among other variables, in a number of man-made and natural vegetation systems of differing structure and composition during two years. These included a polycultural system with Bactris gasipaes (pupunha), Theobroma grandiflorum (cupuacu), Bixa orellana (urucum), Bertholletia excelsa (castanha-do-Brasil) and Pueraria phaseoloides (pueraria) at two fertilization levels; three monocultures with pupunha (either for fruit or palmito) and cupuacu; a <b>young</b> <b>fallow</b> dominated by Vismia spp and primary rainforest.

40|$|AbstractSolitary wasps and bees (Hymenoptera) play a {{key role}} in {{ecosystem}} and agroecosystem functioning. Crops may benefit from biological pest control and pollination carried out by predatory solitary wasps and solitary bees, respectively. Here, we aimed at evaluating the abundance and faunistic compositions of solitary wasps and bees in respect to land-use (pasture, alley cropping, <b>young</b> <b>fallow</b> and old fallow) over an entire year using trap nests in the Brazilian northeastern state of Maranhão. Land-use did not influence the abundance of solitary wasps and bees, however, levels of dominance, abundance and frequency of the species Pachodynerus guadulpensis Saussure, Isodontia sp. 1, Isodontia sp. 2, Trypoxylon nitidum Smith and Megachile cfr. framea Schrottky varied with land-use. The abundance of wasps and bees varied over the period of the year with populations peeking in January (bees), and June and July (wasps). Relative humidity explained most of the variation for the abundance of wasps while temperature explained higher portions of the variance for the abundance of bees. There was an interaction between period of the year and land-use for the abundance of wasps (but not for bees). We concluded that total population abundance of solitary wasps and bees were not affected by the land-use however, levels of dominance, abundance and frequency of some species of these hymenopterans changed according to land-use.

It is unknown whether current cultural practices in this system are appropriate and how land use can further be intensified. Maize production was measured in experiments on three sites cleared from a two-, three- and four-year-old C. odorata fallow, respectively. On the two-year-old site, bearing the lowest quantity of vegetation biomass, maize response to removing, burning and intensively burning (i. e. : burning after adding vegetation from outside) the slashed vegetation was studied as well. Various weeding frequencies and fertilizers were applied in the experiments to better assess the effects of the length of the fallow period and the clearing methods. The experiments were conducted during three consecutive cropping seasons to provide an indication of changes in yield over time. During the first season after clearing, maize yield decreased from 3. 8 on the four-year-old fallow to 2. 6 t ha- 1 on the two-year-old fallow. This reduction was due to a lower availability of P and N, and to a higher competition from weeds. Burning or intensively burning the vegetation raised yields of the unfertilized crop, up to 1. 2 t ha- 1. It increased the availability of phosphorus but did not clearly reduce competition from weeds. In the second and third season, yield fell to 1. 5 t ha- 1 irrespective of the fallow age. Burning slowed down the yield decline over time. Application of P- and N-fertilizers raised crop yields under all conditions and maintained them up to 5 t ha- 1 during the three seasons. Weeding twice instead of once reduced the yield decline over time on the <b>young</b> <b>fallow</b> only.

40|$|International audienceFallow with Psiadia altissima {{is one of}} {{the most}} common post-'slash and burn' {{vegetation}} successions described in the evergreen forests of eastern Madagascar. Some fallows consist of almost pure stands of this species, of which the leaves produce an essential oil offering international commercial interest. The present research aims to evaluate the production potential of essential oil derived from different fallows rich in P. altissima. The study has revealed that fallows aged 4 and 6 years since the last crop abandonment produce the most essential oil (around 20 l ha− 1), but relative to <b>fallow</b> duration, the <b>youngest</b> <b>fallows</b> (1 - or 2 -year-old) are the most productive, respectively producing 12 and 6 l ha− 1 year− 1. Additionally, the trees from the <b>youngest</b> <b>fallows</b> have a substantial capacity for regeneration from coppice shoots, on condition that the cut is performed well above the root collar. Although farmers earn five times less from harvesting leaves than from cultivating rice from tavy, the possibility is there for them to complement their income and diversify their production.

We use allometric equation of Brown to calculate carbon stocks. The most significant aboveground biomass was in primary forest (172. 60 t C/ha).

40|$|Open Access Journal; Published online: 30 August 2017 In a twenty-year {{effort at}} Drabo, {{southern}} Benin, small remnant forests, <b>young</b> <b>fallow</b> and agricultural fields were linked and rehabilitated {{to develop a}} 14 ha forest reserve. Forest regrowth was encouraged by managing the natural growth of the local fallow vegetation and by bringing in seeds and other propagules from forest islands of Benin. The succession to shade-tolerant woody forest species of Guineo-Congolian origin {{at the expense of}} extra-regional herbs, the co-existence of species with slightly different requirements, and the fate of exotic trees in this natural forest are described. A quantitative assessment of a homogeneous lot indicated 397 trees per ha, with stem diameters > 10 cm, 43. 7 % of them below 20 cm, and a rich undergrowth of 72600 smaller plants per ha, proof of active rejuvenation. Only 4. 2 % of all plants resulted from the 1041 introduction events, i. e., species per date, mostly of the 253 plant species that were new to Drabo. A total of 635 species were recorded, but 50 did not survive and four are yet to be identified. In June 2016, the total of 581 known living species included 224 trees. Among all plants, 244 hailed from the Guineo-Congolian zone with 17 of Upper Guinean and four of Lower Guinean origin, 113 from the three savannah zones, and 224 were of extra-regional origin. Overall, 72. 8 % of all woody plants, such as many climbers, all shrubs and trees, were of forest and savanna origin (GC, SG, SZ and S), whereas 70. 4 % of all herbs came from other regions (At, PAL and Pt). Only 7. 0 % of all species from the GC zone were in decline; but the further away the plants originated from, the larger the decline in numbers and vigour, up to 64. 6 % among plants of pan-tropical origin. Particularly pan-tropical herbs became ever rarer, with 80. 0 % of them declining and confined to the few open spaces along paths. In 2017 the forest harboured 52 threatened species, with threat categories EW, CR, EN or VU on the Red List of Benin, out of 73 IUCN-listed species that could possibly survive in Drabo. Some of these species occur in only one or two other locations in Benin. The biodiversity richness of the rehabilitated forests of Drabo now rivals that of natural rainforest remnants of the region. As the surrounding landscape becomes ever more impoverished because of the high human population and its ever increasing impact, the maintenance of such managed islands of biodiversity is critical. By establishing rare local species from other locations we can compensate for direct human destruction and long-term stochastic loss of species in this highly fragmented landscape where natural seed dispersal is difficult.

40|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) {{is well known}} to {{maintain}} several functions. On the one hand, being the major component of soil organic matter (SOM),it is a determinant of soil physical and chemical properties, an important proxy for soil biological activity and a measure of soil productivity. Land use management that will enhance soil carbon (C) levels is therefore important for farmers and land use planners, particularly in semiarid and sub-humid Africa where severe soil degradation and desertification are related to perpetual food crises and overall impoverishment. On the other hand, C sequestration in the soil is an important climate changemitigation measure. The global SOC stock is about 1500 Pg, which is about three {{times the amount of}} organic C in the vegetation and twice the amount of C in the atmosphere. Since tropical soils store 26 % of the SOC stocks of the world they could serve as C storage reservoirs. Due to an incomplete knowledge of specific soil properties at a global scale and, high spatial variability of SOC and the different effects of the factorscontrolling SOC, regional studies of SOC are necessary to refine globalestimates. Both soil and land use data should be used in determining regional SOC. While soil factors are important, as are climatic factors, in explaining C storage or pools over long periods of time, changes in vegetation or land use determine the changes in C sequestration over shorter periods. Southeastern Tanzania serves as a typical example of soil degradation and SOC losses through land use change, deforestation and increased land pressure on the African continent. Therefore any policies geared to the significant reduction of current and future emissions as well as the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere should target the forest and land-use sectors. Local institutions have shown their interest in tacklingthese problems and in implementing soil conservation management measures such as reforestation of degraded soils, which could be funded by the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. In this way C sequestration opportunities could go hand in hand with local conservation of natural resources as well as poverty alleviation. However, the Kyoto Protocol limits reporting of C sequestration activities to those that are both measurable and verifiable. Even if allowed as part of an accounting system, credit for C sequestration activities could be withdrawn if highstandards of measurement cannot be met. Tools for monitoring, verification or certification will be needed in developing countries in order to measure the changes in C pools in relation to soil type, climatic conditions, land occupation and different land management practices. This research will therefore in the first place focus on SOC budgeting in the 415 ha large study area in southeastern Tanzania, based on soil and land use properties. Secondly, SOC measuring techniques that are bothcost efficient and reliable will be developed based on the spatial variation of SOC in the study area. Mapping and upscaling of SOC in southeasternern Tanzania will be based on soil and land use maps. However, no reliable soil map was available that {{could be used as a}} base for this study. Therefore, a soil map was created, based on 280 full profile descriptions available from the literature, supplemented with 354 new profile descriptions that were made by the author in the scope of this work. Soils were classified according to the World Reference Base. Spatial delineation of the boundaries was basedon both a geology as a topography layer in a GIS-environment. The geology consists of old basement sediments of the Archean period. As a resultof relative fluctuations of land and sea levels and recurrent marine transgression and regression a series of younger deposits has been laid down parallel to the shore. From east to west, southeasternern Tanzania can be divided into a coastal area, an area of plateaus and floodplains, acentral area of plains and a western area of plateaus and uplands. The oldest soils of the region are those of the large plains situated on Basement rocks. All these soils are deep and homogeneous with clayey subsoil. The most remarkable examples are the deep red Eutric Nitisols in the low areas of the central plains. The largest part of the plains consistsof Arenic or Ferralic Phaeozems which were formed on coarse-grained gneisses. Where clay illuviation resulted in an argic horizon, mainly on slopes around the higher plains, Lixisols were formed. On the inclined terrain with gneisses and quartzites of both the northern and the southern plains, erosion lead to a finer texture and clay illuviation effected inargic horizons. This resulted in Lixisols or, when fertile A-horizons were found, Luvic Phaeozems. All soils derived from the strongly weathered sandstone beds of Lower Cretaceous origin are deep and sandy: Arenic Ferralsols, Arenosols and (Ferralic) Arenic Phaeozems are the most common soils on the high plateaus while Arenic Alisols and Acrisols wereobserved on the slopes. On marine deposits of grey clays and marls and limestones from the Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene mainly Gleysols and Vertisols are formed. A complex pattern of sandy soils was formed on the marine and terrestrial layers of the Neogene: Luvic Arenosols, Alisols and Ferralsols. Quaternary deposits are present along the main rivers andat the coastline. Soils are variable: along the rivers (Calcaric) Vertisols, Gleysols, Fluvisols and Phaeozems are seen. At the coastline Arenosols are present. Besides a soil map, a land use map is necessary for SOC upscaling across the region. Land use maps from 1997 and 2005 were used to estimate land use changes that have occurred in the study area. Several authors stated that the original vegetation of southeast Tanzania consists of forestor forest-woodlands. More specific, coastal forests are the natural vegetation type of the coastal area, plateaus and southern part of the plains, miombo woodlands are naturally occurring in the rest of the plains and mangrove forests are naturally growing at the coastline and in sheltered bays. Despite its high ecological value, the coastal forest has suffered most from human intervention: only 0. 4 % of the coastal forest remains. The reason is the greater population in these areas, which is a historical development. In 1997 the coastal forest remained mainly on the less populated Rondo plateau but was replaced by secondary bushland in thecoastal area, cashew on the Makonde plateau and cropland with tree crops in the southern plains. Towards 2005 cashew expanded even more on the Makonde plateau, complemented by more than 20 % of cropland. The large expanse of cashew groves is typical of southeastern Tanzania, where most of the nations cashew is produced. The central plains and northern plateaus were formerly covered in woodland, since the extreme seasonal fluctuations in soil moisture were unsuitable for forest growth. Although the total area of woodland in the study area has not much declined, large parts of it have been disturbed and been converted to secondary vegetation. In the large plains, areas with tree crops have expanded mainly on thefertile Nitisols. The rest of the area still remains largely under woodland cover. Attributing SOC stocks to the soils and land uses that were just described can be done after calculating the SOC of 210 profiles from the reference dataset and 354 profiles sampled by the author. SOC is measured in the laboratory as the mass of C per soil mass (%C), but for upscaling toland units it is expressed as a C density (Mg C. ha- 1 to a certain soil depth). This can be calculated by multiplying %C with the bulk density. However, not all these variables are given for every dataset. They can however be estimated based on other soil properties using following methods. C percentages can be measured using different techniques, for example wet oxidation, dry oxidation or reflectance spectroscopy. A cheap and fast way of measuring soil organic matter is loss-on-ignition. It involves the removal of organic matter from an oven dry sample (dried at 105 °C) by combustion of the sample at medium temperature (375 to 600 °C) in a temperature-regulated muffle furnace. Regression equations can be used to derive SOC from SOM by loss-on-ignition. A regional regression equation was developed based on an intercept model for a subset of 100 samples, which were selected from most types of soil and land-use in the study area. This resulted in two different regression equations, one for the topsoil and one for the subsoil. The intercept and the low value of the slopeparameter for the subsoil can be explained by weight loss of other, inorganic, soil constituents. In the soils of the study area, this additional weight loss could be attributed to the desorption of clay water from kaolinite, removal of hygroscopic water of vermiculite and illite, loss of hydration water around gibbsite and goethite and loss of crystal-lattice water from gibbsite and goethite. These minerals are very common in the old soils found in the area. With these formulae all data tested forSOM with loss-on-ignition can now be converted to SOC. The soil bulk density is the mass of an oven-dry sample of undisturbed soil per unit volume. Bulk density is an important physical property which is needed for mass to volume or area conversions of soil properties; therefore it is indispensable for the assessment of soil C stocks and nutrient pools and it is the mandatory measuring unit for soil C assessment and accounting. Unfortunately, bulk density is not always determined in routine soil surveys, as the procedures are tedious, labour-intensive,time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this problem, pedotransfer functions are frequently used, which translate basic soil data into another soil property, in this case bulk density. It has been advised to calibrate and validate specific pedotransfer functions on a regional basis toenhance the accuracy and precision of bulk density prediction. Five model types of pedotransfer functions described in literature were tested against 153 horizon descriptions. By performing multiple regressions on five models based on three variables (organic carbon, texture and depth) and performing calibration and validation tests, the best function was selected. The best model for estimating bulk densities was a logarithmic function based on clay content and depth, but not on the organic carbon content. In clay-rich soils well developed micro-structures caused by the aggregation of negatively charged clay minerals such as kaolinite withsesquioxides could lower the bulk density more than the small effect ofthe low organic carbon content. Lower bulk densities higher in the profile are probably the result of the combined effect of higher organic matter contents and more decompaction by biotic activity of soil fauna and roots in the topsoil versus the subsoil. If texture and sampling depth are available from soil profile descriptions found in literature, they can now be used to derive the bulk density, which is often lacking from these data. SOC is known to decrease with soil depth. The vertical SOC distributioncan be estimated by fitting different equations found in literature. The result showed that the vertical distribution depends on the vegetation. In woodlands and bushlands a high proportion of SOC is stored in the upper layers and SOC distribution is shallow. The relatively low decomposability in wood- and bushland could increase SOC storage in surface soils compared to grasslands and croplands. The deeper distribution of C in croplands could also be the result of soil disturbance during clearing and preparation of the field, although soil preparation and ploughing is uncommon in the study area. Cashew fields have intermediate vertical SOCdistributions. The vegetation structure shows elements of the two othersystems with a tree layer of cashew trees and sometimes an undergrowth of grass or crops. The developed equations can be used to estimate SOC at depths which are not measured in certain datasets. With the previously described methodologies it is now possible to calculate SOC stocks for the 210 profile description from the literature and the 354 profiles sampled by the author. Both soil type and land use determine SOC stocks. Soil texture influences C dynamics through the formation of organo-mineral complexes that protect C from microbial oxidation which is enhanced by the high surface area of the fine silt and clay fractions. The equilibrium soil C stock, which is the result of abalance between the rate of SOC inputs and rate of mineralization, is disturbed by land use change until a new equilibrium is eventually reached in the new ecosystem. Conversion of natural vegetation to various landuses results in very rapid declines in soil organic matter and a release of C to the atmosphere. Globally, the long-term flux of C from changesin land use (1850 - 2000) released 165 Pg C to the atmosphere, about 60 % of it from the tropics and 8 % from tropical Africa. The study of 415 Kha area was divided into landscape units by intersecting the soil map and the land use maps of 1997 and 2005, thus generatinglandscape units. SOC stocks were attributed to these landscape units by assessing the relationship between SOC, soil type and land use. This information was used to create SOC maps of the study area and to calculate the total size of the soil carbon reservoir. The average SOCstock to 1 m depth in the study area is 73 Mg. ha- 1, which is comparable to other studies in Eastern Africa. The soils that can store the highestamounts of SOC in the study area are Vertisols, Phaeozems, Umbrisols and Nitisols (average SOC stock of 106 Mg. ha- 1). Although they cover less than 40 % of the total area, they contribute to almost 60 % of the total SOC stock in 2005. However, they also contributed to 50 % of the total SOCloss due to land use changes between 1997 and 2005. This can be mainly attributed to the loamy Phaeozems and Umbrisols, which have a high SOC content in their A-horizon but which offer no protection in organo-mineral complexes such as in clayey soils. Alisols, Acrisols, Lixisols, Ferralsols, Arenosols and Ferralic/Arenic Phaeozems have significantly lower SOC stocks (average of 87 Mg. ha- 1). SOC stocks of Gleysols are intermediate at 87 Mg. ha- 1, which is mainly the result of the impeded growth of bushlands on these soils. Remnants of closed forest, woodlands and bushlands of more than 20 years have SOC stocks between 66 and 70 Mg. ha- 1. The relatively low SOC stocks can be attributed to the retaining of natural vegetation on the poorest soils, to the open structure of the vegetation with often little ground cover and to the disturbances by humans and fire. However, if woodlands are preserved on fertile soils they can have high SOC stocks, for example 120 Mg. ha- 1 on Nitisols. The traditional cropping system, which consists of several years of cultivation followed by several years of bush fallow, is able to maintain high SOC stocks (120 Mg. ha- 1 in <b>young</b> <b>fallow</b> bushland 98 Mg. ha- 1 in cropped fields without cassava). On less fertile soils and when cropping becomes continuous, cassava becomes most important, since it is the most resistant to drought and low fertility. SOC stocks under cassava are less than half (39 Mg. ha- 1) of those under other crops. Shortening of the fallow period and conversion permanent agriculture will have serious implications on the SOC stocks. Another threat for the regional SOC stocks is the expansion of cashew plantations, which in 2005 already covered 33 % ofthe study area. Tree crops have the second lowest average SOC stock (50 Mg. ha- 1) which can be attributed to the removal of grass, undergrowth and litter by farmers to facilitate harvesting of cashew seeds. Planting other crops between the young trees (< 20 yr) enhances the mean SOC stocks (to 79 Mg. ha- 1) but after 20 years this effect completely disappears, since crops can only be grown in the small spaces that remain between the old trees. Grasslands, rice fields and homestead gardens are less common land uses, which occur mostly on the fertile soils and which have among the highest SOC stocks (mean total values between 114 and 128 Mg. ha- 1). Total SOC stocks of the study area were estimated at 34. 50 Tg in 1997. Based on the changes in land use during 8 years time it was estimated that this stock reduced with 14 %. It can be concluded that intensification of the agricultural system by reducing the fallow period and plantingof mainly cassava on the depleted soils as well as the large expansion of the cashew monocultures have caused a serious loss of SOC from the study area. Restoration of the traditional fallow system, intercropping ofcashew trees with crops on a substantial area of the field, also after 20 years, and reforestation could be used to restore SOC stocks. Although sequestration of SOC through aforestation or reforestation proved favourable, these measures are restricted by the ability to produce rapid, cost-effective and precise sampling schemes. Reliable measurements of SOC content are hard to get and labor-intensive due to the spatial variability. A good knowledge of the soil C stock and its spatial variation leads to a sampling strategy that is balanced between reliability and cost-effectiveness, in agreement with the error that is allowed for the purpose of the study. Factors to take into account are sample size andsample density in relation to the spatial scale of the variation. Sampling intervals can be optimized for soil mapping and for calculating average values by application of classical and geostatistical theories. In tropical forest soils geostatistic analyses were not yet used to develop sampling strategies. Therefore a SOC variability study was conducted in five common forest/woodland/plantation types (coastal dry forest, miombowoodland, teak plantation, pine plantation and cashew plantation) usingconventional statistical methods, as well as geostatistics. In the 5 forest types of this study, SOC stocks in the upper 5 cm ranges between 5 (in the cashew plantation) and 13 (in the coastal forest) Mg ha- 1. The optimal sampling distance for measuring mean SOC stocks varies between 36 m (in the patchy miombo woodland) and 422 m (in the homogenized cashew plantation). Sample sizes fluctuate between 6 and 72 (1 Mg ha- 1 precision) for respectively cashew plantation and coastal forest. A rectangular grid with a sample interval of 25 m can be used for SOC mapping with a point kriging estimation error of 3. 0 Mg ha- 1 in the coastal forest, 2. 6 Mg ha- 1 in miombo woodland, 2. 2 Mg ha- 1 in the teak plantation and 1. 1 Mg ha- 1 in the cashew plantation. Since the pine plantation has no spatial structure; samples can be arranged randomly and its best soil maphas an average C content attributed over the whole field. Refining the sampling strategy with a new spatial variability study in other forest types can be based on a regular grid with sampling distances of half the range identified in this study. It was proven that sampling schemes varystrongly as a result of the different spatial behaviour of SOC in forests and depend on the required precision and research question. Only whenthe right strategy is followed, high standards of precision can be met without economic loss or risk of statistical misinterpretation. Besides spatial structures in SOC resulting from vegetation induced patterns, other factors could locally alter SOC spatial heterogeneity. One such factor in the Tanzanian landscape is the presence of termites and their mounds, which can cover 10 % of the soil surface. Termites can influence the soil properties in different ways: they can alter the soil profile development, soil physical properties, soil chemical properties and soil microbiology and have an impact on plant growth. Both increases anddecreases in mound OC levels compared to the surrounding soil have been observed, probably depending on termite species and activity status, soil type and land use. Through the impact of termites on different soil properties, termite constructions and especially mounds can be considered as islands in ecosystems where the diversity and quantity of litter transformers, micro-predators and micro-organisms are often different from those in the surrounding soil and where nutrient release can be either enhanced or blocked depending on the age and composition of the structure. These sources of small-scale heterogeneity are increasingly seen to be vital both in the maintenance of biodiversity as in providing farmers with a least risk strategy for crop production. No information was yet available on the termite genera which occur in southeastern Tanzania, and how they specifically influence SOC on the different typical soils of the region. Therefore a characterization of the spatial patternsof SOC in and around termite mounds in a plot was made in order to adapt sampling strategies to these heterogeneities in the soil. Three different locations were selected which included the typical variation of soiltype, altitude and landscape unit of the region. In each location threeplots of 1 ha were selected with 3 common land uses: natural vegetation, crops and a cashew grove. On each plot termite diversity was studied based on the transect method, and SOC was measured in and around different types of mounds and in reference profile pits. Termite diversity decreased from natural forests to cashew plantations and agricultural fields,reflecting the change in canopy cover and resulting effects on soil humidity. Soil feeding genera are most affected by conversion from forest to crops. On the other hand cropping favours many genera known as pests...|$|E

Annual cast deposition in undisturbed systems was significantly higher on Alfisols (49, 000 kg ha 1) than on Ultisols (25, 000 kg ha 1). Vegetation clearance had significant detrimental effects on earthworm activity. With an increasing length of continuous cropping, cast deposition declined. In <b>young</b> <b>fallows,</b> cast production exceeded levels attained in previously un-cropped controls on Alfisols, yet, on Ultisols, it depended on the previous LUS and length of the previous cropping phase. Recovery was highest after agrisilviculture and after clearing bush fallow. After forest clearance, burning and one year cropping, cast deposition did not recover within three years. On Alfisols, cast production was higher under planted tree fallow and natural fallow than under herbaceous fallow. On Ultisols, fallow type had no effect. Earthworm surface cast production contributes to soil quality. However, its suitability as an indicator of soil quality is limited to rough assessments as it is dependent upon earthworm species composition, vegetation management and soil type, with more drastic changes on the poorer Ultisols than the morefertile Alfisols.

To analyse {{the effects of a}} fallow period on soil microbial performance, i. e. microbial activity and microbial biomass, samples of eight terrace soils abandoned for different periods were collected in situ, assigned to four fallow age classes and incubated for 30 days in the laboratory after rewetting. The <b>younger</b> <b>fallow</b> age classes of 1 and 5 years were based on the records of the farmers’ recollections, the two older fallow age classes of 10 – 20 and 25 – 60 years according to the increase in the D -to- L ratio of valine and leucine enantiomers. The increase in these two ratios was in agreement with that of the D -to- L ratio of lysine. The strongest relationship was observed between the increase in the D -to- L ratio of lysine and the decrease in soil microbial biomass C. However, the most stringent coherence between the increase in fallow age and soil properties was revealed by the decreases in cumulative respiration and net N mineralisation rates with decreasing availability of substrate to soil microorganisms. During the 30 -day incubation following rewetting, relative changes in microbial activity (respiration and net N mineralisation) and microbial biomass (C and N) indices were similar in the eight terrace soils on a fallow age-class-specific level, indicating that the same basic processes occurred in all of the sandy terrace soils investigated...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to carry out a survey of vascular plants in fallow lands and to perform their multifaceted analysis. The study investigated quantitative and qualitative changes taking place in fallow vegetation with the passage of time from the abandonment of purposeful cultivation. Plant patches in 1 – 2 -year, 3 – 6 -year, 7 – 10 -year and more than 10 -year fallows were studied. Vascular plants of fallow lands within the study area comprise 442 species. 3 – 6 -year fallows were richest in species (355). With increasing fallow age, the number of species decreased to 205 species in fallows older than 10 years. Hemicryptophytes dominated in plant communities of fallow lands. Therophytes were the co-dominant biological type in the <b>youngest</b> <b>fallows.</b> Chamaephytes and geophytes in all fellow age groups accounted for about 5 %. Among vascular plants of fallow lands, native species dominated and their percentage increased with increasing fallow age, while at the same time the proportion of archeophytes decreased. With the increasing age of fallows, the proportion of species characteristic of forest communities also increased, whereas the percentage of segetal species simultaneously decreased.

Soil sampling was performed along two transects in each field. Herbaceous biomass and soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics were studied with principal component analysis (PCA) and the relationships between the parameters were extracted with co-inertia analysis. Soil properties (mainly calcium, magnesium and total carbon content, and cation exchange capacity) slightly improved in the upper soil layer (0 - 5 cm) during the succession of vegetation. In contrast, in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer, microbial biomass and total soil organic carbon content showed no clear pattern of change over time, while highest charcoal stocks were found in older fallows where bush fires are frequent. In the 0 - 40 cm layer, living root biomass increased and herbaceous biomass decreased through the chronosequence. Evidence is presented here for particular relationships between some of the carbon components and the structure of the nematode community. #Pratylenchus$ and #Ditylenchus$ species were associated with the grass vegetation of the <b>youngest</b> <b>fallows.</b> In contrast #Helicotylenchus$ and #Scutellonema$ were present in old fallows.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} farmers' {{perceptions of}} Imperata infestation {{and its impact}} on agricultural land uses in a slash-and-burn area of Nambak District in Luang Prabang Province, northern Laos. Our study showed that slash-and-burn cultivation (SBC), which has been practiced for generations, remains the main agricultural land use system and provides an important source of food and income for farmers. Imperata, which first took root one and a half decades ago, is gradually proliferating, affecting the livelihoods of nearly 38 % of households in the five target villages of this study. The positive cause-and-effect relationship among such factors as accelerated land clearing, <b>young</b> <b>fallows,</b> declining soil fertility, and land shortages—suggested to be the main cause of the Imperata infestation—has reduced not only cultivable land but also its productivity. According to the majority of farmers, the most significant problems caused by Imperata infestation are reduced crop yields, increased weeding, and reduced crop growth. To overcome the problems, farmers employ a combination of strategies—the most common being weeding, fallowing the land, applying chemicals, and exchanging labor. However, the implementation of these strategies is encumbered by many constraints, primarily lack of labor and capital, rice insufficiency, and limited land. Given the constraints and the available technologies, {{it will be very difficult}} for farmers in the study area to adopt a more permanent, diversified, and productive agricultural system, which is a high priority of government development policy in the uplands. To meet this challenge, the thrust of research and development communities working in the uplands should be on more systematic and integrated interventions that combine technological, social, economic, and political resolutions based on knowledge of the causes of Imperata infestation, the problems it creates, management strategies to cope with the infestation, and the specific constraints perceived by farmers...|$|R
40|$|Wild plant {{resources}} are harvested and managed {{by people in}} a variety of land-uses but few studies examine the interactions of landscape dynamics and the use and availability of wild plant resources. I address this question using a case study of common property lands with a history of community forestry and traditional shifting cultivation. Specifically I ask: What is the perceived importance of plant resources obtained in agricultural and forest environments? Have forest and agricultural land-use/land covers changed? How do landscape changes, and in particular shorter fallow times, influence the availability and use of plant resources?The perceived importance of wild plant resources was studied using free-listing and ranking exercises with focus groups of men and women. Remote sensing and interviews served to analyse landscape dynamics (1976 - 2000) and to identify local forest conservation regulations. The impact of shorter fallow times on the availability of forage and firewood in agricultural fields was assessed by sampling 26 fields derived from short to long fallows, while a household survey served to characterize patterns of firewood collection. Men attributed highest importance to commercial forest products, while resources most valued by women were domestic resources obtained {{in a variety of}} environments. High rates of forest retention were observed; conservation was focused on forests with high densities of commercial products. The agricultural zones shifted from a mosaic of diverse successional stages to a homogeneous landscape dominated by <b>younger</b> <b>fallows</b> and shorter fallow periods; these changes led to reductions in the availability of firewood and some forage species. Firewood collection was related to accessibility; areas with the least amount of firewood available (short-fallow cycles and low forest cover) experienced the highest collection pressure. The findings demonstrate that indigenous territories can be very dynamic, even when rates of forest conservation are high, and that changes in land-use and landscape structure have important implications for the availability and use of wild plant resources. A conceptual model linking landscape dynamics to wild plant use is proposed and the significance of the results for community-based conservation initiatives is discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in agro-ecosystems of West African savannas (WAS) {{may be a}} useful tool to define sustainable intensification schemes needed {{to respond to the}} rapid increase in local populations as well as global change issues. Changes in soil properties, and particularly in the soil organic matter status, under semi-permanent cultivation were thus examined through a groundnut crop-fallow chronosequence in southern Senegal. The effect of fallowing was mainly restricted to the 0 - 20 cm soil layer and hardly affected soil physical properties. In this layer, steady improvements were recorded for Mg and Ca contents. Carbon and N amounts increased by 30 %, and by 50 % for available P (POD) within the very first year of fallow and then remained steady (C and N) or dropped back to levels recorded for crops (POD). The rapid initial change in organic status after crop abandonment was attributed to fast recovery of woody vegetation. The steady soil organic matter (SOM) content in oldest <b>fallows</b> compared to <b>young</b> <b>fallows</b> probably resulted from poor protection of soil organic matter from oxidation during biological activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by mesh-bag experiments, which indicated that > 40 - 60 % of decaying woody root biomass disappeared after 6 months of in situ incubation. In fallow systems in southern Senegal, soil fertility may in fact rely at least as much on fast organic matter cycling in soil food webs as on SOM build-up. Carbon storage in the soil-plant system of mature fallow ecosystems was only 27 t C ha(- 1) higher than in crops and consisted mainly of pools with fast turnover. Consequently, the potential of semi-permanent cultivation for C sequestration in the WAS will be rather indirect, by a shift to more intensified practices, thus avoiding the conversion of dense forests to cropping in more humid areas.

Since this resource is becoming increasingly scarce in West African savannas (WAS), {{there is a need}} to assess OM, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) allocation in local ecosystems related to land management. Carbon, N and P storage under semi-permanent cultivation in savannas in southern Senegal was thus measured through a chronosequence including 25 groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) crops and plots left to fallow for 1 - 26 years. The amounts of C, N and P in cropped C they increased to 17. 7 t C, 231 kg N and 19. 6 kg P ha(- 1) in fallow plots aged plots were 5. 5 t C, 106 kg N and 5. 9 kg P ha(- 1), 1 - 9 years. A threshold was reached after 10 years of fallow. Beyond it biomass amounts remained steady. Older fallow plots stored 29 t C, 333 kg N and 33. 8 ka P ha(- 1). Highest increases in woody components were found within the very first year following crop abandonment, and were achieved at the expense of the herbaceous layer. Carbon and nutrient allocation to woody below-ground biomass occurred only later. Massive nutrient losses were expected to occur at clearing due to both burning and wood exportation. Because storage in woody and herbaceous biomass remained steady in fallows aged more then 10 years, <b>young</b> <b>fallows</b> were found to have the highest productivity for wood and forage. However, plant productivity relied on the high resprouting capacity of local tree species, and thus on the maintenance of long breaks of fallow needed for the maintenance of perennial rooting systems.

The main objectives of this research were to assess the value and uses of NTFPs by local farmers and to compare NTFPs management strategies between accessible and remote areas. This research revealed contrasted NTFPs management strategies between accessible areas and remote areas. More NTFPs species are collected in remote areas than in accessible areas but a bigger quantity is collected in accessible areas. In the remote areas, NTFPs are mainly consumed because of poor market accessibility, while most NTFPs collected in accessible areas are sold on the market. The diversity of NTFPs species available in the landscape influences local household management less than the possibility to get access to market. As a consequence, bigger volumes of a few species are collected in accessible areas for income generation while limited volume of more diverse species are collected in remote areas for food security. In remote areas, NTFPs are primarily collected in forests and old fallows while people in accessible areas have to collect NTFPs in <b>young</b> <b>fallows</b> that are individually appropriated and on agricultural land. Some commercial species (e. g. posaa, khem, peuakmeuak) are gradually domesticated as forest and old fallow patches get smaller, fragmented and scarce in the landscape. Sustainable management about NTFPs across the Nam Khan watershed should integrate conservation – development objectives at the watershed scale by increased exchanges between upstream and downstream villages and with the emerging markets. Sustainable NTFPs management plans should be designed not only at the village level but also at higher administrative levels (e. g. kumban, district, province, watershed) to tackle both environmental and livelihood issues.

How do sown species respond to artificially cre-ated gaps and added litter at two neighbouring sites with similar physical conditions but contrasting vegetation matrix (<b>young</b> arable <b>fallow</b> field vs species-poor meadow sward) ? Location: Upper Rhine valley, southwestern Germany, 85 m a. s. l. Methods: Seeds of six typical flood-meadow species were sown in four treatment combinations of the factors gap crea-tion and litter addition. Seedling recruitment was monitored for three years. Results: Five of the six species established successfully at both sites largely irrespective of treatments, indicating seed limitation. Only in the small-seeded Arabis nemorensis, which was revealed to be strictly gap-dependent at the meadow site, could an obvious microsite limitation be shown. The non-significance of gap treatments in all other species at the relatively high productive meadow site is probably due to biomass removal by mowing in early summer. Only at the extremes of the seed size spectrum did the results meet predic-tions of plant ecological theory, such as the strict gap depend-ence of small-seeded species in closed swards or the positive to neutral response of large-seeded species to litter layers. Conclusions: Species identity was revealed to be the major factor influencing differences in recruitment.

Standing biomass of the fallow vegetation reached a peak of 22 t/ha in the third year, while in subsequent years growth stagnated as a result of dieback of C. odorata.

Both roe deer and fallow deer increased feeding site use during a hard winter and decreased their use in a mild winter. Fallow deer males used feeding sites more than roe deer and fallow deer females. The two species did use the feeding sites differently each month. Fallow deer used feeding sites more than roe deer in all months except for February and March. However, the high use by roe deer in February and March were driven by 6 females and 1 male.

40|$|Crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{has been}} more or less {{stagnant}} since 1961. This can {{be connected to the}} traditional slash-and-burn agricultural based system. A growing population has forced most farmers to cultivate the same fields repeatedly. The resulting rapidly declining crop yields led eventually to an accelerated conversion of forest land into agricultural land to cope with food demand. However, the integration of leguminous species, the use of fertilizer and tillage have been proven to increase yield especially in intensive cropping systems. Although, depending on its frequency and kind, tillage can destroy soil aggregates resulting in degradation of soil organic matter. Else, it is known that improved crop varieties can be higher-yielding and more yield responsive to increased fertilizer application than traditional crop varieties. Information is scarce on the effects of soil physical properties on plantain, maize and tomato yield formation and on their changes during their cropping phase.

This led to the setup of 4 experiments: In a first experiment, the effects of soil physical properties on plantain yield were determined in a factorial trial in three southern Cameroonian villages comparing four cropping systems comprising two planted legumes (1) Flemingia macrophylla, (2) Pueraria phaseoloides, as well as (3) a crop, i. e. hot pepper, and (4) natural regrowth, all planted with plantain, established after conversion of old forest versus <b>young</b> bush <b>fallow.</b> Between 2002 and 2006, clay and silt content, MWD, GMD and the proportion of macroaggregates increased, whereas relative sand content, bulk density, the proportions of mesoaggregates and microaggregates decreased (not absolute decreased for sand content) in all villages, fallows and cropping systems. Changes of aggregate MWD and GMD were larger in the F. macrophylla and natural regrowth systems than in Pueraria systems. Plantain fresh bunch yield was 107 unaffected by village, fallow, and cropping systems. Plantain cultivation did not lead to a degradation of the determined soil physical properties. In a follow up second trial at Mfou, it was evaluated, if maize cropped immediately after plantain was affected by the previous plantain systems and if tillage or N fertilizer would affect maize growth and grain yield and soil physical properties. In 2006, all plantain plots were cleared and split into 4 subplots, to assess the response of maize to tillage versus notill, and of 60 kg ha- 1 of N as urea compared to no N in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Freshly cleared eight years old bush fallow served as control. Maize grain yield was highest in the previously not cropped bush control and lowest in the previous Flemingia system. Grain yield in the previous Pueraria and natural regrowth systems were not different from the control. Maize grain yield was highest, when tillage was combined with fertilizer application, being significantly higher than in individual tillage or fertilizer application treatments. Soil physical properties were affected by tillage but did not remain different {{until the end of the}} maize growing phase. In a third experiment the response of different tomato cultivars to different cultivation practices in an on-farm factorial trial was tested at Essong Mintsang in the central region of Cameroon on a Rhodic Kandiudult. Treatments were: current farmer practice of manual tillage yet not destumped, with either reduced input (no tillage, not destumped) or increased input (no tillage yet destumped, manual tillage and destumped, mechanical tillage and destumped). Yields of three tomato varieties were determined to assess, if changes in intensity of land preparation can improve soil physical properties and thus yields. At harvest, across land preparations the cv. Rossol produced higher yields (8. 12 Mg ha- 1) than cv. Roma (6. 05 Mg ha- 1) and cv. Rio Grande (4. 46 Mg ha- 1). Tomato total and marketable yields were significantly higher on the destumped tractor till, destumped manual till and stumps-retained manual till treatments than in the stumps retained no-till treatment. Total fresh yields of cvs. Roma and Rossol increased, when the soil was tilled, while cv. Rio Grande had no response to land preparation. Soil aggregates were least stable in the destumped, tractor till treatment, with significantly lower MWD (p= 0. 02) and higher mesoaggregate proportions (p= 0. 05) than in the other treatments. Across tomato cultivars and treatments, the marketable fruit yield could be predicted by clay, macroaggregates and bulk density. Early flowering and fruit production combined with nematode resistance were probably the main contributing factors to the high yields of cv. Rossol. 108 In a fourth experiment, the residual effects of the previous land preparation methods on maize growth and yield as well as impacts on soil physical properties were assessed. Land preparation methods had been applied to the preceding tomato crop. At harvest, maize fresh cob yield was significantly (P< 0. 05) lowest in the stump retained no till treatment. The equivalent maize dry grain yields varied from 2. 35 Mg ha- 1 in the stump retained no-till treatment to 4. 16 and 4. 33 Mg ha- 1 in the manual till stump retained and destumped treatments, respectively. Soil aggregates were the least stable in the destumped tractor till treatment, with significantly lower (P= 0. 10) GMD than in the destumped manual till treatment. Maize fresh cob yield showed a strong correlation (R 2 ~ 0. 50, P= 0. 037) with soil aggregation and cone resistance to soil penetration. In summary, the transition from shifting to permanent cultivation with acceptable yields is possible if an appropriate combination of crops (cultivar), use of leguminous species, tillage and fertilizers is implemented. Soil physical properties can control crop yield and hence can be manipulated to maximise yield. Tillage can contribute to yield increase if there is an adequate SOM content and a suitable crop cultivar is chosen. Yet, tillage is labour intensive and degrades soil physical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to identify a minimum tillage frequency for low labour demand and minimal soil degradation, but with improved yields in conjunction with optimised fertilization and the development of improved crop cultivars adapted to a wide range of soil conditions. Die Ernteerträge in Subsahara-Afrika (SSA) stagnieren größtenteils seit 1961, teilweise bedingt durch das traditionelle Brandrodungs-System. Eine wachsende Bevölkerung hat die meisten Landwirte dazu gezwungen, die gleichen Felder wiederholt zu bebauen. Der daraus resultierende rasche Rückgang der Bodenfruchtbarkeit und der Ernteerträge führte letztendlich zu einer beschleunigten Umwandlung von Waldflächen zu Ackerland um die Nachfrage nach Lebensmitteln zu befriedigen. Allerdings wurde bereits nachgewiesen, dass die Integration von Hülsenfrüchten in die bestehenden Fruchtfolgen, die vermehrte Verwendung von mineralischen Düngemitteln und eine verbesserte Bodenbearbeitung eine wichtige Rolle bei der Erhöhung des Ertrags spielen, besonders bei intensiven Anbausystemen. Dennoch kann die Bodenbearbeitung je nach Häufigkeit und Art und Weise Bodenaggregate zerstören, was zu einem Abbau organischer Substanz im Boden führt. Auch ist bekannt, dass verbesserte Sorten höhere Erträge generieren können, sowie auf einen erhöhten Einsatz von Düngemitteln besser reagieren als traditionelle Sorten. Zurzeit gibt es nur wenige Studien über die Auswirkungen der physikalischen Eigenschaften vom Böden auf die Erträge von Kochbananen, Mais oder Tomaten, sowie über deren Veränderungen während des Anbaus. Diese Studie zielte daher darauf ab, das Verhältnis zwischen physikalischen Parametern vom Böden und Ernteerträgen in verschiedenen Anbausystemen im südlichen Kamerun zu erfassen, um verbesserte Management-Strategien identifizieren zu können. In diesem Zusammenhang wurden vier Experimente durchgeführt: In einem ersten Experiment wurden in drei Dörfern in Südkamerun die Auswirkungen der physikalischen Eigenschaften des Bodens auf den Ertrag von Kochbananen bestimmt. Diese Studie verglich vier Kochbananen Anbausysteme, zwei mit Leguminosen  (1) Flemingia macrophylla, (2) Pueraria phaseoloides , (3) zusammen mit scharfem Pfeffer (Capsicum sp.), und (4) natürlicher Wiederaufwuchs; alle Systeme gepflanzt direkt nach der Umwandlung des Regenwaldes oder nach jungem brachliegendem Buschland dominiert von Chromolaena odorata. Zwischen 2002 und 2006 hat in allen Dörfern, Brachen- und Anbausystemen der Gehalt an Ton und Schluff  MWD, GMD  und der Anteil von Makroaggregaten zugenommen, während der relative Sandgehalt, die Bodendichte, und die Proportionen von Meso- und Mikroaggregaten verringert wurden (nicht absolute verringert für Sandgehalt). Die Veränderungen der Aggregate MWD und GMD in den Systemen mit F. macrophylla und natürlichem Wiederaufwuchs waren größer als in den Pueraria Systemen. Der Ertrag von Kochbananen war vom jeweiligen Dorf, Brachen- oder Anbausystem unbeeinflusst. Der Anbau von Kochbananen hat zu keiner Verschlechterung der physikalischen Eigenschaften des Bodens geführt. In einer zweiten Folge-Studie in Mfou wurde untersucht, ob Mais, wenn er unmittelbar nach Kochbananen angebaut wurde, durch die vorherigen Anbausysteme beeinflusst wurde, und ob die Bodenbearbeitung oder die Verwendung von N-Düngern eine Auswirkung auf das Maiswachstum, den Kornertrag und die physikalischen Eigenschaften des Bodens haben. Im Jahr 2006 wurden alle Kochbananenpflanzen entfernt und die Felder in vier Parzellen unterteilt, um die Reaktion von Mais auf die konventionelle Bodenbearbeitung im Vergleich zu keiner Bodenbearbeitung zu bewerten, sowie die Reaktion auf 0 oder 60 kg N ha- 1 Gabe in einem 2 x 2 Faktorendesign zu vergleichen. Eine geräumte Buschbrache von 8 Jahren diente als Kontrolle. Der Maiskornertrag war am höchsten in der zuvor nicht bestellten Buschbrachenkontrolle und am niedrigsten im vorherigen Flemingia-System. Der Kornertrag im vorherigen Pueraria und im natürlichen Wiederaufwuchs-System unterschied sich nicht von demjenigen der Kontrollparzelle. Der Maiskornertrag war am höchsten, wenn die Bodenbearbeitung mit Düngemitteln kombiniert war, und somit deutlich höher als bei den unabhängigen Behandlungen mit ausschließlicher Bodenbearbeitung oder Behandlung mit Düngemitteln. Die physikalischen Eigenschaften des Bodens wurden von der Bodenbearbeitung beeinflusst,haben sich aber erst zum Ende der Maiswachstumsphase verändert. In einem dritten Experiment wurde auf der Basis einer On-Farm-Faktorenstudie in Essong Mintsang in der zentralen Region von Kamerun auf einem Rhodic Kandiudult die Reaktion verschiedener Tomatensorten auf verschiedene Anbauverfahren getestet. Die Verfahren waren wie folgt: aktuelle Bauernpraxis mit manueller Bodenbearbeitung ohne dem Entfernen von Baumstümpfen, entweder mit reduziertem Einsatz (keine Bodenbearbeitung  mit Baumstümpfen) oder mit erhöhtem Einsatz (keine Bodenbearbeitung  aber mit Entfernung der Baumstümpfe, manuelle oder maschinelle Bodenbearbeitung ohne Baumstöcke). Die Erträge der drei Tomatensorten wurden ermittelt, um zu bewerten, ob Veränderungen in der Intensität 111 der Landbearbeitung die physikalischen Eigenschaften des Bodens verbessern und damit auch den Ertrag. Bei der Ernte produzierte der Kultivar Rossol in Verbindung mit Landbearbeitung höhere Erträge (8. 12 Mg ha- 1) als Kultivar Roma (6. 05 Mg ha- 1) und Kultivar Rio Grande (4. 46 Mg ha- 1). Der gesamte marktfähige Tomatenertrag war deutlich höher bei der Traktoren- Bodenbearbeitung und der manuellen Bodenbearbeitung mit jeweiligem Entfernen der Baumstümpfen und bei der manuellen Bodenbearbeitung unter Beibehaltung der Baumstümpfe, als bei den Verfahren ohne Bodenbearbeitung, die Stümpfe beibehielten. Die Gesamt-Erträge von cvs. Roma und Rossol wurden erhöht, im Zusammenhang mit der Bodenbearbeitung, während cv. Rio Grande auf die Landvorbereitung nicht reagierte. Die Bodenaggregate waren weniger stabil in dem Verfahren Traktoren-Bodenbearbeitung ohne Baumstümpfe, mit einem deutlich niedrigeren MWD (p= 0. 02) und höheren Mesoaggregaten-Proportionen (p= 0. 05) als in den anderen Verfahren. Über die verschiedenen Tomatensorten und Bearbeitungsverfahren konnte der marktfähige Früchteertrag durch den Gehal an Ton, Makroaggregaten und Bodendichte vorhergesagt werden. Die frühe Blüte und Frucht-Produktion, die mit der Widerstandsfähigkeit gegenüber Nematoden verbunden waren, waren wohl die wichtigsten Faktoren für den hohen Ertrag von cv. Rossol. In einem vierten Experiment wurden die Nachwirkungen der früheren Landvorbereitungsmethoden auf das Maiswachstum, seinen Ertrag sowie deren Auswirkungen auf die physikalischen Eigenschaften des Bodens ausgewertet. Die Landvorbereitungsmethoden waren die gleichen wie bei dem vorherigen Tomatenanbauversuch. Bei der Ernte war der Konertrag von Mais im Verfahren ohne Bodenbearbeitung, die Baumstümpfe beibehielt, deutlich am niedrigsten (P< 0. 05). Die Erträge der äquivalenten trockenen Maiskörner variierten zwischen 2. 35 und 4. 16 Mg ha- 1 im Verfahren ohne Bodenbearbeitung mit Baumstümpfen, beziehungsweise 4. 33 Mg ha- 1 im Verfahren mit manueller Bodenbearbeitung, die Baumstümpfe beibehielt, und mit manueller Bodenbearbeitung mit Entfernung von Baumstümpfen. Die Bodenaggregate waren am wenigsten stabil im Verfahren mit Traktoren-Bodenbearbeitung ohne Baumstümpfe, mit einem deutlich niedrigeren GMD (P= 0. 10) als in der manuellen Bodenbearbeitung mit Entfernung von Baumstümpfen. Der Ertrag von Mais zeigte eine starke Korrelation (R 2 ~ 0. 50 und P= 0. 037) zwischen der Bodenaggregation und dem Bodenpenetrationswiderstand...|$|R
