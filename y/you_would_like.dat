5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

25|$|The pink {{sandstone}} {{sculptures of}} Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) {{to reach a}} very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art {{that the world is}} now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

500|$|Wright scored his 27th {{goal of the}} season, away at Chelsea in {{the first}} week of April; it took him seven goals short of {{breaking}} Cliff Bastin's career record at Arsenal. A win against Leicester City was Arsenal's fifth league win in six matches and boosted the club's chances of finishing second, which came with a spot in the Champions League. Wenger assessed that it was [...] "not impossible to win the title", adding [...] "but when you see Manchester United winning again, realistically <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to be in their position." [...] A last-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers against Arsenal on 19 April 1997 was controversial given the manner the opposition had scored; with Hughes cramped, Vieira kicked the ball out in order for his teammate to be treated. It was anticipated [...] "by the game's conventions", Blackburn should have thrown the ball back unchallenged, but striker Chris Sutton forced a corner. The result prompted Wenger to rule out any chance of winning the league: [...] "The best team [...] has won. But the race for second place is still open and for many weeks I have thought that was the best we could achieve." [...] A further draw against Coventry City, who were fighting to stay another season in the top-flight, moved Arsenal to within four points of Manchester United. They had however played two games more than the incumbent champions and one more than Liverpool sitting in third. Robbie Elliott scored the winner for Newcastle United against Arsenal on 3 May 1997, which reignited their chances of finishing second. Arsenal ended their league campaign against Derby County, who staged their final match at the Baseball Ground. In spite of winning by three goals to one, having played with ten men for the majority of the game, they missed out on second by goal difference to Newcastle.|$|E
500|$|Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the {{commander}} of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said [...] "Do all of you understand English?" [...] The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal", and said it had [...] "destroyed the government-making process", and that [...] "I made it clear that all the military plans I know <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to carry out are dependent on government stability", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said [...] "...you have made a real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you do things like this." [...] Taylor believed the HNC to be {{an essential part of the}} government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail—which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south—would be suspended.|$|E
