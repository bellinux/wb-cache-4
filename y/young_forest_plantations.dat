40|$|Satellite data of Landsat and SPOT type are operationally used in Sweden for {{nationwide}} forest mapping; for {{detection of}} clear felled areas and for checking {{the need for}} deciduous shrub cleaning in <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantations.</b> The data are also used by the Sami people for mapping areas of interest for reindeer grazing. The Swedish forest agency has since 1999 acquired a yearly and nationwide set of images. These images will, together with some older Landsat data collected between 1972 and 1998 and similar future data sets, be made available freely over internet. A similar data policy for Landsat data has recently also been introduced by USGS in USA. In this paper, we give three early examples where we explore the utility of using time series of image data for applications {{that are related to}} those that are already operational. In the first example, it is shown that the accuracy for satellite data based forest estimates, trained with national forest inventory field plots, is marginally improved when data from a second time point is added. In the second example, it is shown that <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> can be much better characterised by using data from a series of yearly images than by only using the latest image. In the third example, it is illustrated how a forest data base made from a time series of images, can be used as basis for an economic model that simulates future forest actions, given strictly economic priorities and how such simulations can be used to study the potential impacts on other interests, in this case food resources for reindeer. 1...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} a roe deer Capreolus capreolus (Linnaeus, 1758) population to assess the effect o f a large-scale removal of adult males on the intensity of marking behaviour. Rubs and scrapes were censused in two 150 -ha areas, one experi mental and one control, in southeastern Sweden in May 1991 and 1992. In the experimental area, 14 males (50 % of total number, 11 > 3 yrs) were culled during mid-August 1991. Removed males were replaced by the following season. Despite this, the number of scrapes, but not the number of rubs, was significantly fewer in the experimental area in May 1992 {{as compared to the}} control. This reduction could be due to a late arrival of replacement males, which would explain why the reduction involved scrapes rather than rubs, as scraping activity starts several weeks before rubbing. To cull adult males between territorial seasons is thus not an effective way to reduce rubbing intensity, and hence damages, on <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantations...</b>|$|E

40|$|Models {{and data}} used to {{describe}} species-area relationships confound sampling with ecological process as they fail to acknowledge that estimates of species richness arise due to sampling. This compromises our ability to make ecological inferences from and about species-area relationships. We develop and illustrate hierarchical community models of abundance and frequency to estimate species richness. The models we propose separate sampling from ecological processes by explicitly accounting {{for the fact that}} sampled patches are seldom completely covered by sampling plots and that individuals present in the sampling plots are imperfectly detected. We propose a multispecies abundance model in which community assembly is treated as the summation of an ensemble of species-level Poisson processes and estimate patch-level species richness as a derived parameter. We use sampling process models appropriate for specific survey methods. We propose a multispecies frequency model that treats the number of plots in which a species occurs as a binomial process. We illustrate these models using data collected in surveys of early-successional bird species and plants in <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantation</b> patches. Results indicate that only mature forest plant species deviated from the constant density hypothesis, but the null model suggested that the deviations were too small to alter the form of species-area relationships. Nevertheless, results from simulations clearly show that the aggregate pattern of individual species density-area relationships and occurrence probability-area relationships can alter the form of species-area relationships. The plant community model estimated that only half of the species present in the regional species pool were encountered during the survey. The modeling framework we propose explicitly accounts for sampling processes so that ecological processes can be examined free of sampling artefacts. Our modeling approach is extensible and could be applied to a variety of study designs and allows the inclusion of additional environmental covariates...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of managed forests in Fennoscandia are younger than 70 years old but yet {{little is known}} about their potential to host rare and threatened species. In this study, we examined red-listed bryophytes and lichens in 19 young stands originating from clear-cutting (30 – 70 years old) in the boreal region, finding 19 red-listed species (six bryophytes and 13 lichens). We used adjoining old stands, which most likely never had been clear-cut, as reference. The old stands contained significantly more species, but when taking the amount of biological legacies (i. e., remaining deciduous trees and dead wood) from the previous forest generation into account, bryophyte species number did not differ between old and young stands, and lichen number was even higher in young stands. No dispersal effect could be detected from the old to the young stands. The amount of wetlands in the surroundings was important for bryophytes, as was the area of old forest for both lichens and bryophytes. A cardinal position of young stands to the north of old stands was beneficial to red-listed bryophytes as well as lichens. We conclude that <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> may function as habitat for red-listed species, but that this depends on presence of structures from the previous forest generation, and also on qualities in the surrounding landscape. Nevertheless, at repeated clear-cuttings, a successive decrease in species populations in young production stands is likely, due to increased fragmentation and reduced substrate amounts. Retention of dead wood and deciduous trees might be efficient conservation measures. Although priority needs to be given to preservation of remnant old-growt...|$|E

40|$|Use of {{agricultural}} land for forest plantations {{has become a}} common practice in Galicia, northwest Spain, causing a change in biological diversity. Relationships between surface soil properties {{and the presence of}} vegetation species were examined in 186 <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> on abandoned agricultural lands in Galicia using a polythetic divisive classification method based on the Two-way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN). The ecological profile method was used to investigate (for each species and soil variable) whether frequency of occurrence varied significantly along soil variable gradients. Soils under herbaceous vegetation such as Plantago lanceolata and Dactylis glomerata are shown to have higher levels of calcium and phosphorus and lower organic matter content than those under Ulex europaeus. Daboecia cantabrica is associated with shallow soils and Holcus lanatus and Lotus corniculatus, with deep soils. Erica sp., more common on sandy granitic soils, is associated with low potassium soil levels. Trifolium pratense is characteristic of soils with high pH and high levels of calcium and magnesium. The corrected frequency (CF) profiles of vegetation species confirmed most of the relationships found by the polythetic method. However, some new associations were found. For example, the presence of D. cantabrica indicated low topsoil pH and available P, Erica sp. was associated with low soil exchangeable cations, and the presence of Lithodora postrata was related to low available soil P. The polythetic method seems to be useful to investigate the relationships between the presence–absence of vegetation species and continuous and discrete environmental variables from a large set of data without any hypothesis. CF profiles can then be used to confirm and evaluate the results obtained by the polythetic method.

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} into New Zealand, the Australian bush tail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, {{has become}} a major animal pest.

This paper explores a number of spatial data issues involved in possum control in an attempt to show how a GIS can assist with possum management on a conservation block. Examples are given using data obtained from a number of control operations on Mount Karioi and using the GIS packages ArcView and ARC/INFO.

40|$|Tree {{diversity}} {{is an important}} driver of forest ecosystem functioning, hypothesised to enhance tree growth and resistance to herbivores. To test this, we assessed {{the relative importance of}} tree species richness and functional diversity on tree height growth and insect herbivore damage across three tree diversity experiments in Finland, France and Germany, established within the last fifteen years. These experiments encompass species richness gradients from monocultures up to five species mixtures, with compositions drawn from a pool of eleven tree species. Tree height growth and total insect herbivory were evaluated at both the tree species and forest plot scales. Trees in mixtures tended to grow taller, but on average received more insect herbivory relative to monocultures. Gradients of tree species richness or functional diversity had only weak impact on the magnitude of these effects. Community weighted means of specific leaf area alone captured diversity effects on tree height growth, with stronger positive effects of diversity in mixtures with high community SLA. Tree species-specific responses were highly variable. No species significantly benefited both in terms of increased growth and reduced herbivory when grown in mixtures. More species showed positive height growth responses in mixed assemblages, but only the two exotic conifers experienced associational resistance to herbivores. This large-scale study shows that tree height growth in <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> tends to be higher in species mixtures than in monocultures, but incremental increases in functional diversity have, at best, weak marginal growth benefits. Moreover, there appear to be contrasting effects at forest plot versus individual species scales. Thus, while some species show lower herbivore damage in mixtures, this is not a consistent trend and contrasts the higher overall damage in mixtures observed at the forest plot scale. To improve both tree growth and resistance to herbivores in tree species mixtures seems therefore challenging. Oiko...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{forests and}} <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> {{frequently}} have {{high rates of}} tree growth and NPP – higher even than mature forests in similar situations. The nutrients required to sustain this rapid growth are derived from the soil and by external inputs such as rainfall or, {{in the case of}} nitrogen, by biological N fixation. In our study of the effects of tree species within replicated experimental plantations in a moist, lowland tropical environment in Costa Rica, high rates of biomass accumulation and productivity were coupled with high rates of N accumulation and cycling. We applied extensive sampling through time within a mass-balance approach to address the question “Where does all the nitrogen come from?”Rates of N uptake by the vegetation in these plantations were extraordinarily high, even by tropical forest standards, reaching 412 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. Rapid decay coupled to tight nitrogen cycling may have provided large amounts of available N for plant uptake, but do not explain the large quantities of N that accrued in the vegetation, up to 1075 kg N/ha over 16 years. Surface soil organic matter stocks in the plantations increased by as much as 320 kgC/ha in surface soils, but soil nitrogen varied differently. Soil N stocks to 1 m depth were depleted by an average of 2119 kg/ha relative to the mature forest. Thus, mineralization of soil organic nitrogen could have supplied the N that accrued in biomass over the 16 -yr period, but this apparently occurred without concomitant net loss of soil C. The C:N ratios of soil organic matter (SOM) in the plantations indicated either replacement of SOM with more C-rich detritus or selective removal of N from existing SOM. Regardless, high productivity in these plantations apparently {{was supported in part by}} mining of soil nitrogen. Species varied, however. Depletion of soil N stocks was only 219 kg/ha under Vochysia guatemalensis, in which 1075 kgN/ha had accrued. Asymbiotic N fixation is the next most plausible mechanism for supplying plant-available N, and may be enhanced in stands with high availability of recently produced photosynthates...|$|E
40|$|In <b>young</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plantations,</b> trees planted at high densities {{frequently}} {{show more}} rapid height and diameter growth than those plants at lower densities. This positive growth response to density (the ''density effect'') often manifests long before seedlings are {{tall enough to}} shade one another, {{so it is not}} a simple response to shade. The mechanism(s) which trigger and sustain this growth enhancement are unknown. Our objectives were to document the temporal dynamics of positive growth response to increasing density in Douglas-fir plantations and to test two hypotheses as potential mechanisms for this response. The hypotheses are (1) a canopy boundary layer effect, and (2) alterations in the quality of light reflected from neighboring trees. The ''boundary layer'' hypotheses proposes that changes in atmospheric mixing occur in high-density plantations, promoting increased concentrations of CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O vapor during early morning hours, which in turn would enhance carbon assimilation. The ''light quality'' hypothesis proposes that the presence of neighbors alters the ratio of red to far red light in the canopy environment. Plant sensors detect this change in light quality, and growth and development is altered in response. We found that boundary layer conductance was higher, as we predicted, in low-density Douglas-fir stands than in high-density stands five years after planting. The changes in boundary conductance were accompanied by higher CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O vapor during early morning hours. However, we also found that the primary manifestation of the density effect in Douglas-fir occurs two to four years after planting, and {{we were not able to}} measure differences in boundary conductance in different densities at that time. Also, we found no difference in carbon isotope composition of wood cellulose formed in high- vs. low-density stands two to three years after planting. We conclude that although stand density may have a significant impact on boundary layer conductance in young stands, it does not account for the ''density effect''. Our tests of the light quality hypothesis were slowed due to poor plantation establishment in the early phase of this study. In a variable density experiment we detected significant changes in R:FR related to density. Also in that study we measured a significant enhancement of tree height at high density. However, after three years of growth, the study trees did not show significant differences in stem diameter related to density. Experimenters at Weyerhaeuser therefore decided not to harvest the trees at the end of the 3 rd growth year, as originally planned. In a 1 -year study of seedlings planted in raised beds subjected to different light quality treatments using transparent plastic film, we found that tree height but not diameter increased in response to decreased R:FR. At this point, we conclude that R:FR remains a viable hypothesis for the ''density effect'', but evidence is not conclusive. We expect that continued measurements in the variable density test plot at Weyerhaeuser will add more evidence in the future...|$|E
40|$|<b>Young</b> {{secondary}} <b>forests</b> and <b>plantations</b> in {{the moist}} tropics often have rapid rates of biomass accumulation and thus sequester {{large amounts of}} carbon. Here, we compare results from mature forest and nearby 15 - 20 year old tree plantations in lowland Costa Rica to evaluate differences in allocation of carbon to aboveground production and root systems. We found that the tree plantations, which had fully developed, closed canopies, allocated more carbon belowground - to their root systems - than did mature forest. This increase in belowground carbon allocation correlated significantly with aboveground tree growth but not with canopy production (i. e., leaf fall or fine litter production). In contrast, there were no correlations between canopy production and either tree growth or belowground carbon allocation. Enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can enhance plant nutrient uptake, providing nutrients beyond those required {{for the production of}} short-lived tissues such as leaves and fine roots, and thus enabling biomass accumulation. Our analyses support this deduction at our site, showing that enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can be an important mechanism promoting biomass accumulation during forest growth in the moist tropics. Identifying factors that control when, where and for how long this occurs would help us to improve models of forest growth and nutrient cycling, and to ascertain the role that <b>young</b> <b>forests</b> play in mitigating increased atmospheric carbon dioxide...|$|R

40|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>plantations</b> are a {{possible}} way of increasing forest productivity in temperate and tropical forests, and therefore also increasing above- and belowground carbon pools. In {{the context of}} climate change, monospecific plantations might become an alternative to mitigate global warming; however, their contribution to the structural complexity, complementarity, and biodiversity of forests has not been addressed. Mixed <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> can ensure that objectives of climate change mitigation are met through carbon sequestration, while also delivering anticipated ecosystem services (e. g., nutrient cycling, erosion control, and wildlife habitat). However, mixed <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> pose considerable operational challenges and research opportunities. For example, {{it is essential to}} know how many species or functional traits are necessary to deliver a set of benefits, or what mixture of species and densities are key to maintaining productive plantations and delivering multiple ecosystem services. At the same time, the establishment of <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> in Mexico should not be motivated solely by timber production. <b>Forest</b> <b>plantations</b> should also increase carbon sequestration, maintain biodiversity, and provide other ecosystem services. This article analyzes some matters that affect the development of planted forests in the Mexican national context, and presents alternatives for forest resources management through the recommendation of mixed <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> as a means of contributing to climate change mitigation and the delivery of ecosystem services...|$|R

This study investigates the impacts of private <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> on local infrastructure and social services in rural Tanzania. We take a comparative approach involving households living in villages adjacent to private <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> and households in villages adjacent to a state-owned plantation. We use survey data from 338 households to analyze their perceptions about the impacts of the plantations on the number and quality of roads, bridges, and health centers, as well as on school enrolment and quality of education. We triangulate the results from a logistic regression model with observations of the size and quality of infrastructure and social services in the villages and with findings from focus group discussions. The results show that the private <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> have positively affected local infrastructure and social services in adjacent villages. The results suggest that large-scale private <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> can contribute to rural development in developing countries. We highlight the importance of taking into account the perceptions of various groups in society when assessing the sustainability of forestry investments and their impacts on local communities...|$|R

The results showed that differences in throughfall and stemflow between the three <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> were significant (p 120 cm than in the other forests, but the difference was not significant between E. ulmoides and V. fordii. Moreover, the difference in throughfall at stem distances 60 - 120 em was not significant between the different <b>forest</b> <b>plantations.</b> For E. uhnoides, throughfall under the peripheral crown part was 16. 1 % higher than that close to the stem. In contrast to E. uhnoides, Rmassoniana had 26 - 8 % lower throughfall under the peripheral crown part than close to the stem. No significant difference was found in throughfall for the various stem distances underneath V. fordii. Stemflow in E. ulmoides was 2 - 3 times higher than in the other forests (p < 0. 01). Interception loss accounted for 19. 9 % of gross rainfall for E. ulmoides, 20. 8 % for V. fordii and 27. 2 % for Rmassoniana. Surface runoff and soil loss differed considerably among the three types of <b>forest</b> <b>plantations.</b> Annual runoff and total soil loss were lowest in the Pmassoniana forest and highest in the V. fordii forest. This study indicated that P. massoniana, as a reforestation tree species, had the most positive effect on soil and water conservation among the three <b>forest</b> <b>plantations.</b> Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Assessing the {{socio-economic}} {{sustainability of}} small scale <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> provides {{the basis for}} monitoring compliance with sustainable forest management principles and prescription of appropriate interventions. Considering that state <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> in South Africa have been scheduled for transfer to community-based entities, determination of the potential of alternative forest management types is vital. This study therefore assessed the socio-economic sustainability of current forest management strategies in state <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> at Gaba and Rossbach in Limpopo Province of South Africa. It also determined the potential of alternative forest management regimes using perceptions of local communities. Summated rating scales principles were applied by using likert scaling to acquire the perceptions of local communities through scoring of indicators and verifiers. While the local community for Rossbach <b>forest</b> <b>plantation</b> was content with all indicators of socio-economic sustainability, the local community for Gaba was discontent with provision of products and the forest plantation‟s contribution to their livelihoods. Both communities perceived joint forest management to be the optimal forest management regime across all indicators while expressing total {{lack of confidence in}} managing the <b>forest</b> <b>plantations</b> communally.
