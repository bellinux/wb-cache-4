2500|$|Hunt {{was also}} a proponent of {{artillery}} practices that reflected his conservative nature. Although acknowledging the power of massed batteries to repel infantry assaults (such as at Malvern Hill or against Pickett's Charge in the Battle of Gettysburg), he urged his gun crews to fire slowly and deliberately and reprimanded them if they exceeded an average of one shot per minute. He believed that faster rates impaired accurate targeting and depleted ammunition faster than could be replenished. A story often told about Hunt was when he exclaimed to a gunner of a fast-firing gun, [...] "Young man, are <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> every round you fire costs $2.67?" [...] Fast firing also implied {{to him that the}} gun crew was not brave enough to stand fast on the battlefield, wanting to get back behind the lines for resupply.|$|E

2500|$|In 1942, Buñuel {{applied for}} American citizenship, because he {{anticipated}} that MoMA {{would soon be}} put under federal control. [...] But that same year, Dalí published his autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí, in which {{he made it clear}} that he had split with Buñuel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist. News of this reached Archbishop Spellman, who [...] angrily confronted Barry with the question: [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you are harbouring in this Museum the Antichrist, the man who made a blasphemous film L'Age d'Or?" [...] At the same time, a campaign on the part of Hollywood, through its industry trade paper, the Motion Picture Herald, to undermine the MoMA film unit resulted in a 66% reduction in the department's budget and Buñuel felt himself compelled to resign. [...] In 1944, he returned to Hollywood for the third time, this time as Spanish Dubbing Producer for Warner Brothers. Before leaving New York, he confronted Dalí at his hotel, the Sherry Netherland, to tell the painter about the damage his book had done and then shoot him in the knee. Buñuel did not carry out the violent part of his plan. Dalí explained himself by saying: [...] "I did not write my book to put YOU on a pedestal. I wrote it to put ME on a pedestal".|$|E
