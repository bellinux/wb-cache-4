500|$|In 1960 Sellers portrayed an Indian doctor, Dr Ahmed el Kabir in Anthony Asquith's {{romantic comedy}} The Millionairess, a film {{based on a}} George Bernard Shaw play of the same name. Sellers was not {{interested}} in accepting the role until he learned that Sophia Loren was to be his co-star. When asked about Loren, he explained to reporters [...] "I don't normally act with romantic, glamorous women... she's a lot different from Harry Secombe." [...] Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming, culminating in Sellers declaring his love for her in front of his wife. Sellers also woke his son at night to ask: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> divorce your mummy?" [...] Roger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions, that [...] "he'd play a role as an Indian doctor, and for the next six months, he'd be an Indian in his real [...] life." [...] The film inspired the George Martin-produced novelty hit single [...] "Goodness Gracious Me", with Sellers and Loren, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart in November 1960. A follow-up single by the duo, Bangers and Mash, reached number 22 in the UK chart. The songs were included on an album released by the couple, Peter & Sophia, which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
