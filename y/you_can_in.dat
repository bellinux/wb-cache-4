500|$|Professor Paul Kengor, {{author of}} God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has {{suggested}} that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: [...] "Do all the good you can, by all the means <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>in</b> all the ways you can." [...] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy [...] "made sure I learned [...] words from our Methodist faith." ...|$|E

During his journey, Martin added two postscripts. The first relayed Martin's fear that the Mexican army had already attacked the Alamo and ended [...] "Hurry on all the men <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> haste". The second postscript {{is more difficult to}} read, as the letter was later folded along one line of text. The paper has since partially frayed along the fold, obliterating several words. The gist of the message, however, is that the men at the Alamo were [...] "determined to do or die", and Martin intended to gather reinforcements and return as quickly as possible.|$|E

During his acceptance speech he reflected on the important influence of traditional European music and the melancholy of the Swedish soul on ABBA's brand of pop music. [...] "If {{you live in a}} country like Sweden, with five, six months of snow, and the sun disappears totally for like two months, that would be reflected in the work of artists," [...] he said. [...] "It's definitely in the Swedish folk music, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear it <b>in</b> the Russian folk songs, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear <b>in</b> the music from Jean Sibelius or Edvard Grieg from Norway, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see it <b>in</b> the eyes of Greta Garbo and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear it <b>in</b> the voice of Jussi Bj√∂rling.

2500|$|The {{authenticity}} of Abagnale's criminal exploits was questioned {{even before the}} publication of Catch Me If <b>You</b> <b>Can.</b> <b>In</b> 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anti-crime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his assertions. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was that [...] "Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information." ...|$|E
2500|$|The knot sum of {{oriented}} knots is commutative and associative. A knot is prime {{if it is}} non-trivial and {{cannot be}} written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots. A knot that can be written as such a sum is composite. There is a prime decomposition for knots, analogous to prime and composite numbers [...] [...] For oriented knots, this decomposition is also unique. Higher-dimensional knots can also be added {{but there are some}} differences. While you cannot form the unknot in three dimensions by adding two non-trivial knots, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> higher dimensions, at least when one considers smooth knots in codimension at least 3.|$|E

Harry lost both legs after the patrol he was {{commanding}} ran over a roadside bomb. Parker later spoke about {{the aftermath of the}} incident, saying [...] "it was pretty bad at that stage, they didn't know if Harry would survive or not. It helped being a soldier because all your training is about remaining as calm and calculating as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> very difficult circumstances. But it was foul." [...] Harry was injured shortly before Parker was due to take up the position of deputy commander of the International Security Assistance Force. [...] Parker did assume the post on schedule, later saying [...] "Harry would be horrified if I didn't go. He'd think I was a wimp".|$|E
