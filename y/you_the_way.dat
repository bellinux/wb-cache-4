An angry Curtis asserts his {{creative}} and psychological control over his wife, informing Deena that he would not let anyone else [...] "handle" [...] her, because, in his words, [...] "no one knows <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I do". Curtis tells Deena that he put Deena as lead singer of the Dreams because her voice [...] "had no personality. No depth. Except for what [...] put in there".|$|E

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think), and Fourth Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think).

500|$|Jean A. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times {{remarked that}} while the group {{demonstrates}} [...] "good, strong and genuine vocal ability" [...] on the album, what they need is [...] "something to set them apart from the proliferation of male harmony groups of the R/soul persuasion". Williams complimented the group's cover of [...] "Show <b>You</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> to Go" [...] as a [...] "nice effort" [...] but called [...] "House Keeper" [...] derivative. Ray Marcano of the Dayton Daily News wrote that the album's ballads - especially [...] "That's Alright" [...] and [...] "When You Need Someone" [...] - have [...] "terrific melodies and wonderful hooks that will easily keep listeners' attention". Marcano was, however, critical of the group's indistinct harmonies and said their vocals need to be [...] "a bit sharper".|$|E
500|$|Personal is a [...] "sumptuous blend" [...] {{of vocal}} R and [...] "90s {{production}} techniques", that alternates between smooth ballads and new jack swing. The album incorporates {{all of the}} band's beliefs and emotions, from love, romance and sensitivity. [...] "House Keeper" [...] {{is a story of}} reversal of the traditional roles that men and women play in relationships. The rest of the album [...] "rolls along similarly", with the songs [...] "Forgive Me", [...] "Joyride" [...] and [...] "Do Thangz", a mid-tempo song on which the group pay homage to the females in their lives. A cover of The Jackson 5's 1977 hit single [...] "Show <b>You</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> to Go" [...] is included on the album. The cover was originally recorded and released on the soundtrack of the 1995 film Money Train.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{contains}} masochistic themes {{and tells the}} story of heartbreak caused by a failed relationship: [...] "Gave you all I had / And you tossed it in the trash". The chorus has Mars singing, [...] "I'd catch a grenade for ya," [...] and speaks of unrequited love when the subject girl of his affections [...] "won't do the same". Tim Byron, writer for The Vine, [...] "'Grenade' is about the feeling of [...] ". The critic added, [...] "Mars knows she is bad for him, that's she's preventing him from thinking straight, that he can't actually have her the way he wants, but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her." [...] As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: [...] "'Grenade' represents the OTHER side of love– where you're in love with a woman and you {{know for a fact that}} she doesn't love <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you love HER." ...|$|E

2500|$|Minogue {{released}} her second album Get into You, {{which included the}} songs [...] "Show <b>You</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> to Go", [...] "This Is It" [...] and [...] "This Is the Way", in October 1993. The album contained uptempo dance tracks and mature poser, but despite her past chart success, {{failed to make the}} British top fifty. In mid-1994, Minogue returned to television as a presenter, co-hosting Channel 4's morning show The Big Breakfast in the UK. In 1995, Minogue released the singles [...] "Rescue Me" [...] and [...] "Boogie Woogie", a collaboration with dance act Eurogroove. Released only in Japan, both songs reached number one on the Japanese singles chart. She began recording her third album in 1995; however, Minogue and her record label, Mushroom Records, parted ways in late 1995 following a contract disagreement.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, David Handelman from Rolling Stone said {{the songs are}} [...] "buoyed by the deft interplay of the three voices and a poetic tornado of imagery", featuring [...] "equally far-flung" [...] musical samples on an album that is [...] "littered with bullshit tough-guy bravado, but it's clever and hilarious bullshit". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commended the Dust Brothers' [...] "deft" [...] production and the Beastie Boys' rhymes, which he called [...] "hilarious, vicious, surreal, snotty." [...] Writing for Playboy, Robert Christgau said although it [...] "doesn't jump <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> great rap usually does," [...] "the Beasties and Tone-Loc's Dust Brothers have worked out a sound that sneaks up on you with its stark beats and literal-minded samples, sometimes in a disturbing way". He commended them for [...] "bearing down on the cleverest rhymes in the biz" [...] and wrote, [...] "the Beasties concentrate on tall tales rather than boasting or dissing. In their irresponsible, exemplary way they make fun of drug misuse, racism, assault, and other real vices fools might accuse them of." [...] In a retrospective review, he said the record's [...] "high-speed volubility and riffs from nowhere will amaze and delight you", calling it [...] "an absolutely unpretentious and unsententious affirmation of cultural diversity, of where [...] came from and where they went from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani {{expressed}} that {{the album is}} [...] "definitely a slow-burner , but it's also everything pop music should be: provocative, poignant, inventive, and fun." [...] Daniel Rivera of PopMatters cited the album as Robyn's [...] "most honest and infectious outing to date" [...] and noted that [...] "the most impressive thing about Robyn is just how timeless it is proving to be." [...] Stylus Magazine's Jessica Popper wrote that the album [...] "manages to combine several of the currently popular music genres whilst still making a perfect pop album [...] It's {{one of the few}} Europop albums that not only deserves worldwide domination, but also has a really good chance of achieving it." [...] In a review for the Manchester Evening News, Paul Taylor described the album as [...] "undeniably sexy" [...] and dubbed Robyn [...] "a mini-Madonna in the making". Billboards Jill Menze commended the album for its [...] "sassy and sweet dance pop gems". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau commented that he was [...] " [...] disoriented by the hype for 'With Every Heartbeat' [...] But without that add-on, which does grow on <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> pop breakthroughs will sometimes, this 2005 EU release might never have materialized here to prepare the way for Robyn 2010". James Hunter of The Village Voice complimented its [...] "fast electro arrangements tending toward the geometric" [...] and found that [...] " [...] appeal is questionable when she tries to sound like an American rapper, but on tracks where she just sings [...] she gives Europop a swift Swedish energy and presence". Pitchfork reviewer Jess Harvell felt that Robyn's [...] "pop fun is a bit knowing—she's 26 after all. But trust the Swedes. They know what they're doing with this sort of thing." ...|$|E
