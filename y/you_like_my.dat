TV Land placed the line as 83rd in its 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases in 2006. Hadley Freeman of The Guardian noted that the teen-focused show made many {{cultural}} references due to a [...] "renewed interest in the teen market", adding {{that the use of}} cropped tops, micro-minis, and beaded flip-flops showed a [...] "decidedly West Coast approach to fashion". The episode's cultural references to fashion included Julie Cooper's question to her pre-pubescent daughter, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> hair this straight or is it too Avril Lavigne?", while another mother complains, [...] "What are you doing putting my daughter in Calvin Klein? She was supposed to be in Vera Wang!" [...] Teenage misfit Seth complains that [...] "Every day's a fashion show for these kids".|$|E

2500|$|During the {{six years}} after A ribbon of poems was {{published}} about 100 copies were sold. The first edition consisted of sewed books, printed by printer Joh. Enschedé and sons. The cover was designed by Ludwig Willem Reymert Wenckebach. The cover of the second edition, which was published by L.J. Veen in 1893, was designed by P. de Josselin de Jong, made after an idea of Louis Couperus and printed by printer H.C.A. Thieme (Nijmegen). Of this edition of about 350-500 copies, in 1905 135 still remained with the publisher, who let 25 copies bind in a blue cover with red page cuts. L.J. Veen acquired the right to publish Couperus' poetry editions A ribbon of poems and [...] Orchids in 1892 and announced a reprint of A ribbon of poems in December of that same year. After he was notified Couperus wrote to Veen: If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> poetry that much {{what would you say}} if we publish another book with verses; he wanted to include the poems called Fragment (renamed to Melancholy) Viviane, Williswinde, Ginevra, Semiramis and Fragments from the Apocapyps of John the Apostle. Veen however refused this offer because he was not interested in an enlarged reprint of Orchids. At the beginning of December 1894 Couperus informed Veen that he agreed with a reprint of Orchids and a new book {{with the rest of his}} verses for the sum of 200 guilders.|$|E
