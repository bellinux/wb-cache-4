5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

You get charged too much, and there's no access for the locals", said Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon.

Ticketmaster took legal action against RMG Technologies via the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claiming that the developed software for ticket brokers illegally [...] "allows them to cut in line". RMG Technologies representative denied the allegations and said they should not be held accountable because Ticketmaster is getting still paid for the tickets.

500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. <b>You</b> <b>allow</b> silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E
500|$|David Denby of The New Yorker {{asserted}} that the austere, but captivating installment presented a [...] "glancing, chilled view" [...] of a world where succinct moments of loyalty coexisted with constant trials of betrayal. To USA Today columnist Claudia Puig, Fincher captures the [...] "menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape" [...] by carefully approaching its most gruesome features. Puig noted a surfeit of [...] "stylistic flourishes" [...] and [...] "intriguing" [...] changes in the narrative, compared to the original film. In his three-and-a-half star review, Chris Knight of the National Post argued that it epitomized a so-called [...] "paradoxical position" [...] that was both [...] "immensely enjoyable and completely unnecessary". Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald said that the [...] "fabulously sinister entertainment" [...] surpassed the original film [...] "in every way". The film took two-and-a-half stars from Rolling Stone commentator Peter Travers, who concluded: [...] "Fincher's Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, admired the moments of [...] "brilliantly orchestrated" [...] anxiety and confusion, but felt that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was vulnerable to the [...] "lumbering proceduralism" [...] that he saw in its literary counterpart, as evident with the [...] "long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere". The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgenstern praised Cronenweth's cinematography, which he thought provided for glossy alterations in the film's darkness; [...] "Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors, and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer professed that despite its occasional incomprehensibility, the movie was [...] "technically superb" [...] and [...] "superbly acted". In contrast, Kyle Smith of New York Post censured the film, calling it [...] "rubbish" [...] and further commenting that it [...] "demonstrates merely that masses will thrill to an unaffecting, badly written, psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story so long as <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis." ...|$|E

Sulpicio Lines' counsel stated that the ship was never advised by the Coast Guard that it was not safe to sail. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo demanded an explanation from port authorities: [...] "Why did <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> it to sail and why was there no ample warning? I want answers." [...] The Maritime Industry Authority (Marina) ordered the grounding of all Sulpicio Lines vessels, pending an investigation, and Vice President Noli de Castro presided over the first meeting of the newly created [...] "Task Force Princess Stars".

2500|$|On 20 March 1839 an {{informal}} meeting {{of members of}} the Colonisation Association and the 1825 New Zealand Company learned from Hutt the disturbing news that the Government's Bill for the colonisation of New Zealand would contain a clause that land from then on would [...] be able to be bought only from the Government. Such a move would be a catastrophic blow for the Colonisation Association, for whom success depended on being able to acquire land at a cheap price, directly from Māori, and then sell it at a high price to make a profit for shareholders and fund colonisation. The news created the need for swift action if private enterprise was to beat the Government to New Zealand. In a stirring speech, Wakefield told those present: [...] "Possess yourselves of the soil and you are secure—but if from delay <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> others to do it before you, they will succeed and you will fail." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eden faulted the United States for {{forcing him}} to withdraw, but he took credit for United Nations action in patrolling the Israeli-Egyptian borders. Eden said of the invasion, [...] "Peace at any price has never averted war. We must not repeat the {{mistakes}} of the pre-war years, by behaving as though the enemies of peace and order are armed with only good intentions." [...] Recalling the incident in a 1967 interview, he declared, [...] "I am still unrepentant about Suez. People never look at {{what would have happened if}} we had done nothing. There is a parallel with the 1930s. If <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> people to break agreements with impunity, the appetite grows to feed on such things. I don't see what other we ought to have done. One cannot dodge. It is hard to act rather than dodge." [...] In his 1967 interview (which he stipulated would not be used until after his death), Eden acknowledged secret dealings with the French and [...] "intimations" [...] of the Israeli attack. He insisted, however, that [...] "the joint enterprise and the preparations for it were justified in the light of the wrongs it [...] was designed to prevent." [...] "I have no apologies to offer," [...] Eden declared.|$|E
2500|$|Baum's {{fairy tale}} {{contains}} many other allusions to American {{life in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, Dorothy's loyal companion, Toto, could be a play on [...] "teetotalers" [...] which {{is a person who}} never drinks alcohol. The prohibitionists deemed alcohol consumption should be unlawful and they were longtime political allies of Populists during the late 19th century. Toto trots [...] "soberly" [...] behind Dorothy on their adventure. The Winged Monkeys have been thought to resemble the Plains Indians who were [...] "once free people" [...] but were now enslaved by the Wicked Witch of the West. Their actions can be good or bad depending on how they are controlled; however, they [...] "belong to this country alone" [...] and therefore cannot leave, as can be said for American Indians. The Yellow Winkies that inhabit the Land of the West could represent Asian workers in California during the gold rush; their harsh work environment can be seen as enslavement. The lenses that the groups must wear before entering the City of Oz to dim the emeralds' shine turn out to be fake, like the Wizard. The Emerald City is not a city made of emeralds but a plain, white city where the emerald color lenses cast a green hue on everything and everyone. This shows that anything can be made to look spectacular if <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> yourself to be tricked. Baum traveled all over the United States and would have been introduced to all these events in the 19th century, making it very likely that he drew inspiration from the land around him.|$|E
