25|$|Patterson {{graduated}} from Dartmouth College in 1848. Like Hungerford, {{he was involved}} in a fraternity, Psi Upsilon (Zeta Chapter). After graduation, he read law for two years with a Buffalo attorney and then formed a partnership, Waters & Patterson, that made tools such as shovels and hoes. Manufacturing was a tough and grimy business in comparison to banking, where <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> most of the day at a desk counting currency and calculating figures.|$|E
500|$|The {{field day}} events were {{cancelled}} in 1922, although alumni were still expected to congregate annually for camaraderie and to remember their fellow Aggies. [...] The March 1923 Texas Aggie urged, [...] "If {{there is an}} A man in one-hundred miles of you, you are expected to get together, eat a little, and live over the days <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> at the A College of Texas." [...] The event received worldwide attention during World War II, when 25 Aggies [...] "mustered" [...] during {{the battle for the}} island of Corregidor.|$|E

60|$|NAPOLEON (dropping his rhetorical style). It's plain enough. You {{wanted some}} letters {{that belonged to}} me. <b>You</b> have <b>spent</b> the morning in {{stealing}} them--yes, stealing them, by highway robbery. And <b>you</b> have <b>spent</b> the afternoon in putting me in the wrong about them--in assuming that it was I who wanted to steal YOUR letters--in explaining that it all came about through my meanness and selfishness, and your goodness, your devotion, your self-sacrifice. That's English.|$|R

500|$|Valve {{explained}} that the focus of Episode One was character development, in particular that of Gordon's companion Alyx, because she accompanies the player for almost the entire game. Project lead Robin Walker discussed the reasoning behind this approach in an article announcing {{the game in the}} May 2005 issue of PC Gamer UK, saying, [...] "It's kind of ironic that despite so much of the theme of Half-Life 2 being about other characters and other people, <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> most of the game alone." [...] Laidlaw expanded further on the game's premise, saying, ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the book was {{finished}} in April 2008. In a newsletter sent out that month, Paolini said he was busy [...] "chewing [...] way through the editing, {{which has been a}} surprisingly enjoyable experience this time around." [...] The hardest part of editing was having to excise material that he spent days and weeks working on. [...] "However, as most any writer will tell you, just because <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> ten days slaving over a certain scene is no reason to keep it in the final manuscript. The only question that matters is whether the scene contributes to the book as a whole," [...] he said. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Alfred A. Knopf who worked with Paolini on Eragon and Eldest, assisted Paolini as the editor of Brisingr.|$|E
500|$|... “Grunge...became an anti-consumerist {{movement}} {{where the}} less <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> on clothes, the more ‘coolness’ you had.” The style did not evolve {{out of a}} conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion; music journalist Charles R. Cross said, [...] " [...] Kurt Cobain was just too lazy to shampoo", and Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "This [...] is cheap, it's durable, and it's kind of timeless. It also runs {{against the grain of}} the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s." [...] The flannel and [...] "...cracked leatherette coats" [...] in the grunge scene were part [...] "...of the Pacific Northwest's thrift-shop esthetic. [...] Grunge fashion was very much an anti-fashion response and a non-conformist move against the “manufactured image”, often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves. At the same time, Sub-Pop utilized the ‘grunge look’ in their marketing of their bands. In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad “were given blue collar identities that weren’t entirely earned. Bruce (Pavitt) really got him to dress up in flannel and a real chain saw and really play up this image of a mountain man and it worked.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, as Aggies {{returned}} from the war and settled throughout Texas, regional A clubs formed to reunite alumni. [...] With the proliferation of these groups, the Muster tradition began {{to have a more}} formal atmosphere. [...] In 1923, the student radio station WTAW broadcast a statewide program for over two dozen Aggie groups who had gathered at points across Texas. The March 1923 Texas Aggie urged, [...] "If there is an A man in one-hundred miles of you, you are expected to get together, eat a little, and live over the days <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> at the A College of Texas." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} German {{leaflets}} which appealed to American troops {{was one that}} depicted a passionate kiss {{between a man and}} woman. The leaflet read: [...] "FAREWELL Remember her last kiss... ? Gee were you happy then... ! Together, <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> marvelous times..., lounging on beaches..., dancing, enjoying parties galore ..., listening to the tunes of your favorite band...". The leaflets back side reminds the soldier that his loved one is longing for him and that most of the men he had come with are now dead. In comparison, one Allied leaflet simply showed a picture of a large open field with thousands of German graves.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Entertainment Weekly, Hilary Busis notes [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> {{the rest of}} the hour swooning, though, you may have missed out on the {{explication}} of a few crucial plot points. As its name implies, [...] "The Apprentice" [...] focused on revealing why, exactly, Rumpelstiltskin was so tickled to discover that Sorcerer's hat in the house where he and Belle honeymooned in season 4's premiere. As it turns out, the object is more than just a groovily decorated cap—it's also an artifact of immense power that could have enormous implications for the rest of our heroes. Well, that, or it's just another magical doohickey that seems important for a while until it disappears from the narrative without a trace. On this show, anything's possible!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Motoring {{journalist}} Jeremy Clarkson, {{a famous}} critic of hybrid vehicles and the Toyota Prius especially, admitted {{he loved the}} GS 450h. After claiming that <b>you</b> <b>spent</b> {{most of the time}} on the Prius [...] "chewing a lot of fuel" [...] and [...] "making a green statement," [...] he described [...] "with the Lexus I drove up and down Piccadilly all day. It was great." [...] He also felt that the GS 450h was [...] "balanced nicely by the styling, the quality and the sense that you really are in something a little bit different." [...] Clarkson also positively referred to the benefit of a hybrid car being exempt from the London congestion charge (for a £10 one off administration fee to register it). In 2009, the GS 450h received a new hybrid-only grille and refreshing.|$|E

6000|$|... "Are you the man," [...] I asked, [...] "to accuse {{others of}} crime? Let us see. <b>You</b> have <b>spent</b> {{several months in}} an English prison (I gave the name) for a crime I won't mention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, my boy, it is {{time enough}} {{to talk about that}} to-morrow, or next day. You are not obliged to think of the future before <b>you</b> have <b>spent</b> even one night in your old room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{strikes me}} as fortunate. I ran through the bank account last night, and there's no doubt that <b>you</b> have <b>spent</b> {{a good deal of}} money. It {{confirms}} my opinion that you have mighty expensive friends." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{she looks}} fairly radiant," [...] cried Edith, seizing her cousin's hand. [...] "It's quite wonderful, Honora; nobody would ever guess {{that you were}} from the West, and that <b>you</b> had <b>spent</b> the whole summer in St. Louis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{is what it}} will be. <b>You</b> have <b>spent</b> every {{shilling}} of your own,-- {{and because}} your mother is affectionate and weak you are now spending all that she has, and are bringing her and your sister to beggary.' ...|$|R
