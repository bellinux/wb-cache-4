25|$|You write: „I came to {{liberate}} the Talysh Khanate {{from the hands of}} the Persians“, allow me, general, not to believe your lying words, for you, I will say frankly and directly, as <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to enslave and oppress the Talysh people. While Mir Mustafa Khan is alive, your government will have to protect the Khan his rights, by treating him personally and with due care; but once he will die his heirs will lose its independence and autonomy, turning in speechless and unfortunate slaves, the fault of the mad and visionary would degenerate Mir Mustafa Khan, the same who pursue only their personal goals in order to meet their lust for power, being a heartless and hardened egoist, as they're not thinking about the sad and desolate future of their offspring, who will betray him to anathema, because they will invite you here and handing the fate of their homeland to unfaithful strangers — rapists turning his people into meaningless plebeians. The groans and screams of the dead people involved in this network of selfish schemer — Mir Mustafa Khan will form an eternal curse upon it, as long as the Talysh Mountains stand firm, the bitter mourning the unfortunate fate of the Talysh people.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} was done, Music for Nations founder Martin Hooker {{wanted to}} arrange a triple bill UK tour in March / April 1984 with Exciter, Metallica, and The Rods. However, the Hell on Earth Tour never materialized because of poor ticket sales. To promote Ride the Lightning, Metallica commenced the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour on November 16, in Rouen, France, with British NWOBHM band Tank as support. The tour continued with dates in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic countries to an average crowd of 1,300. After a Christmas break, the group embarked on a 50-date North American tour, firstly as a co-headlining act with W.A.S.P. and then as headliners with Armored Saint supporting. At a gig in Portland, Oregon, Metallica covered [...] "The Money Will Roll Right In" [...] by Fang, with Armored Saint onstage. The American leg ended in May 1985, and the band spent the following two months working on the next studio album, Master of Puppets, whose recording sessions were scheduled to begin in September. Metallica performed at the Monsters of Rock festival held at Castle Donington in England on August 17 in front of 70,000 fans. The band was placed between Ratt and Bon Jovi, two glam metal groups whose sound and appearance were much unlike Metallica's. At {{the start of the}} set, Hetfield pronounced to the audience: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to see spandex, eye make-up, and the words 'oh baby' in every fuckin' song, this ain't the fuckin' band!" [...] Two weeks later, Metallica appeared on the Day on the Green festival in Oakland, California, before 90,000 people. The last show Metallica played before recording began was the Loreley Metal Hammer festival in Germany, headlined by Venom. Metallica finished 1985 with a show at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on December 29 opening for Y, and a New Year's Eve concert at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on a bill with Metal Church, Exodus, and Megadeth, the first time Metallica and Megadeth shared a stage. At this gig, Metallica premiered [...] "Master of Puppets" [...] and [...] "Disposable Heroes", songs from the then-upcoming third studio album.|$|E
2500|$|During the 10th {{anniversary of}} the Bessarabian union, Buzdugan showed himself optimistic about the {{prospects}} of the region, against Halippa and Ioncu, who shared a bleaker outlook. In November 1928, at another festive meeting of the former Sfatul deputies, he clashed with Stere, who demanded that a resolution be adopted in support of [...] "people's liberties", and against the [...] "exceptional laws". Buzdugan reproached Stere: [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> for politicking." [...] In his new term in the Assembly after the 1928 election, he took a position against Bessarabian autonomism, describing it as a [...] "Russian formula" [...] and a [...] "worrisome" [...] threat. Buzdugan also questioned the PNȚ government over its alleged tolerance of communist and pro-Soviet activities in Bessarabia. Nevertheless, he endorsed decentralization of the lesser government bodies, [...] "for it won't do that someone should have to travel {{back and forth from}} Bessarabia to Bucharest".|$|E
