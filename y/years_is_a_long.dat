[...] Despite positive feelings about the movies, he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films. After Rowling hinted about writing an eighth book, Radcliffe was asked if he would do another film to which he replied: [...] " [...] very doubtful. I think 10 <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to spend with one character." [...] Despite devoting so much time to the series, Radcliffe has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors: [...] "I’ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter." ...|$|E
500|$|After a 20-year {{retirement}} {{from the film}} industry, O'Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy-drama Only the Lonely. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O'Hara stated of her return: [...] "Twenty <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, but it was surprising how little changed. The equipment is lighter now, and they work a bit faster, but I hardly felt like I'd been away". She described Candy as [...] "one of my all-time favorite leading men", and {{was surprised by the}} extent of his talent, remarking that he was a [...] "comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent" [...] who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including The Christmas Box, Cab for Canada and The Last Dance, the latter her last film in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.|$|E

In the early days of mixed martial arts, it was tough to find anybody who inspired more fear than Shamrock.

500|$|After {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} season, Duchovny {{announced}} that he would leave the show for good. In addition, lead actress Anderson's contract also expired at {{the end of the}} eighth season. Anderson had expressed her growing disinterest in the series ever since the beginning of the eighth season, saying [...] "For a lot of people, if you don't like your job, you can quit your job, I don't necessarily have that option." [...] Anderson cited the fact that [...] "eight <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time" [...] as a contributing factor to her indifference. However, Carter soon changed his position and announced he would remain on the show and continue only if Anderson agreed to do another season. Eventually, Fox offered Anderson a [...] "generous" [...] incentive to stay, resulting in the retention of Carter and Anderson and a final season of the show. With the departure of Duchovny and limited use of Anderson, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, saying the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show together for the first seven seasons of the show.|$|E

Carter had maintained for sometime that he would not continue the show without lead actor David Duchovny.

In 2009, Lytle released his memoir, entitled Still Rockin' Around The Clock. At that time, he underwent surgery to remove part of his leg.
