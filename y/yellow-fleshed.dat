60|$|In {{the second}} chapter on Selection I have given several cases proving that with {{animals and plants}} {{differences}} in colour are correlated with constitutional differences, as shown by greater or less immunity from certain diseases, from the attacks of parasitic plants and animals, from scorching by the sun, and from the action of certain poisons. When all the individuals of any one variety possess an immunity of this nature, {{we do not know}} that it stands in any sort of correlation with their colour; but when several similarly coloured varieties of the same species are thus characterised, whilst other coloured varieties are not thus favoured, we must believe in the existence of a correlation of this kind. Thus, in the United States purple- fruited plums of many kinds are far more affected by a certain disease than green or yellow-fruited varieties. On the other hand, <b>yellow-fleshed</b> peaches of various kinds suffer from another disease much more than the white-fleshed varieties. In the Mauritius red sugar-canes are much less affected by a particular disease than the white canes. White onions and verbenas are the most liable to mildew; and in Spain the green-fruited grapes suffered from the vine-disease more than other coloured varieties. Dark-coloured pelargoniums and verbenas are more scorched by the sun than varieties of other colours. Red wheats are believed to be hardier than white; and red-flowered hyacinths were more injured during one particular winter in Holland than other coloured varieties. With animals, white terriers suffer most from the distemper, white chickens from a parasitic worm in their tracheae, white pigs from scorching by the sun, and white cattle from flies; but the caterpillars of the silk-moth which yield white cocoons suffered in France less from the deadly parasitic fungus than those producing yellow silk.|$|E
6000|$|The {{correlation}} {{of a white}} colour and blue eyes in male cats with deafness, and of the tortoise-shell marking with the female sex of the same animal, are two well-known but most extraordinary cases. Equally remarkable is the fact, communicated to Darwin by Mr. Tegetmeier, that white, yellow, pale blue, or dun pigeons, of all breeds, have the young birds born naked, while in all other colours they are well covered with down. Here we have {{a case in which}} colour seems of more physiological importance than all the varied structural differences between the varieties and breeds of pigeons. In Virginia there is a plant called the paint-root (Lachnanthes tinctoria), which, when eaten by pigs, colours their bones pink, and causes the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; so that black pigs only can be kept in the district.[58] Buckwheat in flower is also said to be injurious to white pigs but not to black. In the Tarentino, black sheep are not injured by eating the Hypericum crispum--a species of St. John's-wort--which kills white sheep. White terriers suffer most from distemper; white chickens from the gapes. White-haired horses or cattle are subject to cutaneous diseases from which the dark coloured are free; while, both in Thuringia and the West Indies, it has been noticed that white or pale coloured cattle are much more troubled by flies than are those which are brown or black. The same law even extends to insects, for it is found that silkworms which produce white cocoons resist the fungus disease much better than do those which produce yellow cocoons.[59] Among plants, we have in North America green and yellow-fruited plums not affected by a disease that attacked the purple-fruited varieties. <b>Yellow-fleshed</b> peaches suffer more from disease than white-fleshed kinds. In Mauritius, white sugar-canes were attacked by a disease from which the red canes were free.

60|$|Although natural {{selection}} can act only through {{and for the}} good of each being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, and the black-grouse that of peaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey,--so much so, that on parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence I can see no reason to doubt that {{natural selection}} might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black. In plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance: yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks <b>yellow-fleshed</b> peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh. If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle which variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed fruit, should succeed.|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] 37 Pag., 6 Tabl., 3 Fig. Chilling injury (CI) is the collective term for various disorders that occur during prolonged cold storage and/or after subsequent ripening of stone fruit. Major symptoms of CI include mealiness, graininess, flesh browning, loss of flavor (off flavor), and red pigmentation (bleeding). These symptoms were evaluated over 2 years in an intra-specific progeny population {{derived from the}} cross of cultivars ‘Venus’ (freestone, melting and <b>yellow-flesh</b> nectarine) and ‘BigTop’ (clingstone, melting and <b>yellow-flesh</b> nectarine) after storage of fruit at 5 °C (CI inducing conditions) for 2 and 4 weeks. All the evaluated traits in the progeny showed continuous variation which is typical of quantitative or polygenic inheritance. Longer cold storage periods increased the incidence and severity of CI symptoms, except for bleeding and leatheriness, which were not affected by time of storage. CI symptoms showed high and significant heritability or genotype effect in the studied population, with no significant effect of harvesting year. Browning, mealiness and graininess were significantly correlated and were the main CI symptoms observed in this population. Mealiness and graininess were negatively correlated with stone adhesion which reflects the higher susceptibility to CI disorders of freestone fruit. A genetic linkage map of linkage group 4 (LG 4) was constructed with SSR and candidate genes (CGs). Significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for mealiness, graininess, leatheriness and bleeding were found in this linkage group, validating QTLs for CI symptoms previously reported in this linkage group from an unrelated progeny population. In addition, QTLs controlling other agronomic and fruit quality traits were also localized in this linkage group.

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are known {{to play an important}} role in human health due to the range of phytochemicals they contain. Twenty-one peach genotypes and 45 plum genotypes with different flesh and skin color were analyzed for their antioxidant content and antioxidant activity. Anthocyanin content, phenolic content and antioxidant activity were higher in red-flesh than in light-colored flesh peaches. Carotenoid content was higher in <b>yellow-flesh</b> peaches. Among the peaches, the antioxidant activity was well correlated with phenolic content. The anthocyanin content among the plums increased with the red color intensity. Red-flesh plums generally had higher phenolic content than the other plums. Antioxidant activity was higher in red-flesh genotypes; however, it was strongly correlated only with the phenolic content in light-colored flesh plums. Extracts from selected genotypes of peaches and plums and their fractions were evaluated against two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB- 435 and MCF- 7) and one non-cancerous breast line (MCF- 10 A). The cells were cultured in the presence of peach and plum extracts and their fractions at various concentrations (0 - 500 ??g/ml) and the cell viability and antiproliferation activity was evaluated by MTT assay and Coulter Counter. There was a dose-dependent reduction on cell viability of estrogen-negative MDA-MB- 435 breast cancer cells. Only weak activity against MCF- 7 was observed at high extract concentrations.

An initial assessment of variability for antioxidant activity provided baseline information {{to be used for}} potential potato promotion and for the development of new varieties with greater human health benefits. Wide variability in antioxidant levels provided evidence of genetic control of this trait, indicating that it could be possible to breed for enhanced levels of antioxidant compounds in potato. Accessions, varieties, and advanced breeding lines identified in the broad screen as having high antioxidant activity and high total carotenoid levels, were fine screened via HPLC to determine specific phenolic and carotenoid compounds present in potato. The objective {{of the study was to}} identify parents for use in the Texas breeding program to develop potato varieties containing increased levels antioxidant compounds. In the broad screen for total antioxidant activity, the 47 related, tuber-bearing species showed a wider range of variability than the cultivated varieties and breeding lines. Based on the DPPH assay, antioxidant activity ranged from 103 - 648 uM trolox equivalents in the cultivated varieties and advanced breeding lines, while that of the wild species was 42 - 892. HPLC analysis revealed that the phenolic content of the species, and their cultivated counterparts, was primarily composed of caffeic and chlorogenic acids. Other phenolics identified were p-coumaric acid, rutin hydrate, vanillic acid, epicatechin, t-cinnamic acid, gallic acid, and salicylic acid.

40|$|Stevens leafhopper, Empoasca stevensi, can be {{a serious}} pest of papaya. The leafhoppers are found mostly on the {{underside}} of the leaves. They feed on the plant sap, causing a drying of the leaf tissue called “hop per burn. ” The leafhopper releases saliva into the plant tissue as it inserts its needle-like stylet mouthparts. The saliva is toxic to the plant; the leaves turn yellow, their edges dry and their tissue dies, and the plant becomes stunted (Figure 1). Young plants are more susceptible, yet plants of all ages are attacked. The red-fleshed com mercial papaya cultivars like ‘Sunrise ’ are more suscep tible to hopper burn than the <b>yellow-fleshed</b> cultivars like ‘Waimanalo Low-Bearing ’ and ‘Kapoho’, although some <b>yellow-fleshed</b> cultivars (notably ‘Line 8 ’) may be susceptible. Common symptoms of leafhopper feed ing are puncture marks along the leaf veins and petiol...|$|E
40|$|Available online: 3 March 2016 Providing correct {{estimates}} of the carotenoid content of cassava varieties {{is very important in}} any cassava-breeding program for improving vitamin A intakes in sub-Saharan Africa especially among high-risk groups. The effect of different sampling methods-sampling with cork-borer(SPM 1) and sampling without cork-borer (SPM 2) -on cis- and trans-β-carotene in <b>yellow-fleshed</b> storage roots of cassava was investigated with 40 elite cassava varieties (comprises of 2 trials), grown in 2004 / 2005 growing season in replicated field trials (Randomized Complete Block Design) and harvested at 12 months after planting. The cis- and trans- isomers of β-carotene of the varieties of SPM 1 and SPM 2 was determined using HPLC. Result showed significant genotypic differences (P 0. 05) in the two sampling methods and there was also positive correlation between the cis- and trans- β -carotene contents for both trials 1 and 2. This study provides information on β-carotene distribution and the appropriateness of SPM 2 as an alternative and easy sampling method for carotenoid contents in <b>yellow-fleshed</b> cassava varieties.

40|$|The colour of papaya fruit {{flesh is}} {{determined}} {{largely by the}} presence of carotenoid pigments. Red-fleshed papaya fruit contain lycopene, whilst this pigment is absent from <b>yellow-fleshed</b> fruit. The conversion of lycopene (red) to beta-carotene (yellow) is catalysed by lycopene beta-cyclase. This present study describes the cloning and functional characterization of two different genes encoding lycopene beta-cyclases (lcy-beta 1 and lcy-beta 2) from red (Tainung) and yellow (Hybrid 1 B) papaya cultivars. A mutation in the lcy-beta 2 gene, which inactivates enzyme activity, controls lycopene production in fruit and is responsible for the difference in carotenoid production between red and <b>yellow-fleshed</b> papaya fruit. The expression level of both lcy-beta 1 and lcy-beta 2 genes is similar and low in leaves, but lcy-beta 2 expression increases markedly in ripe fruit. Isolation of the lcy-beta 2 gene from papaya, that is preferentially expressed in fruit and is correlated with fruit colour, will facilitate marker-assisted breeding for fruit colour in papaya and should create possibilities for metabolic engineering of carotenoid production in papaya fruit to alter both colour and nutritional properties. ...|$|E
30|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is a {{pathogenic}} bacterium of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.). The virulent form Psa-V is now well established in New Zealand following its first detection there in November 2010 (Everett et al. 2011). From a biological perspective, Psa-V is the causal agent {{of a number}} of disease symptoms, including leaf spots and necrosis, flower wilting, cane dieback, and branch and trunk cankers, often leading to vine death in the case of susceptible cultivars ([URL] The disease has been very damaging to the New Zealand kiwifruit industry: the cost in net present value is expected to be between 310 – 410 million NZ$ over five years (Greer and Saunders 2012). Large losses were due mainly to the complete susceptibility of the diploid A. chinensis <b>yellow-fleshed</b> kiwifruit cultivar ‘Hort 16 A’. In comparison, the green-fleshed A. deliciosa cultivar ‘Hayward’ shows a degree of resistance that allows the disease to be managed by orchard practices. Breeding for a Psa-resistant <b>yellow-fleshed</b> cultivar is a high priority for the kiwifruit industry in New Zealand. To this extent, evaluating parents and selecting those that show some degree of Psa resistance {{is an integral part of}} all current breeding programmes.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fruit quality traits (fresh weight, dry weight, soluble solids content, {{titratable acidity}} and firmness) {{as well as}} the content of {{bioactive}} compounds (phenolic compounds) and total antioxidant activity were evaluated in four commercial cultivars of peach (Greta, Ufo 4, Rome Star and Ufo 6) and four of nectarine (Neve, Planet 1, Maria Carla and Mesembrina) differing in fruit shape (standard or flat) and flesh colour (white or yellow), important cultivars of the Italian and foreign market. The higher fruit organoleptic quality and nutritional profile of flat peach and nectarine cultivars make them candidates for exploiting new market opportunities and the chance to improve profits of farmers. RESULTS: The results showed that assayed quality parameters differed greatly among cultivars. In particular, flesh color and fruit shape accounted for most of the variation in traits underlying organoleptic and nutritional quality. CONCLUSION: Overall data suggested that the flat white-fleshed nectarine Planet 1, the <b>yellow-fleshed</b> nectarine Mesembrina and the <b>yellow-fleshed</b> peach Ufo 6, because of their profiles in terms of soluble solids content, titratable acidity and bioactive compounds, have the greatest potential to meet current consumer requirements...|$|E
