25|$|I will, however, {{tell you}} {{just one thing}} about the war, my first story and my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I told myself that here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> your mouth shut after the war.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with close}} friends, I don't believe in letting your hair down, confiding {{this and that}} and the other thing—saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep'... I believe <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> your {{troubles}} to yourself. That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts... reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way. When told that most Americans, even {{at the end of his}} career, did not feel they knew him, Nixon replied, [...] "Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post said [...] "the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents" [...] and that Angelo Badalamenti [...] "contributes an {{extraordinary}} score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score," [...] but stated that Lynch [...] "isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end." [...] A general criticism from U.S. critics was Blue Velvets often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence. They asserted that this detracted from the film's seriousness {{as a work of}} art, and some condemned the film as pornographic. One of its detractors, Roger Ebert, praised Isabella Rossellini's performance as [...] "convincing and courageous" [...] but criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of misogyny: [...] "degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film." [...] While Ebert in later years came to consider Lynch a great filmmaker, his negative view of Blue Velvet remained unchanged after he revisited it in the 21st century.|$|E

2500|$|When Chris MacNeil gives Father Dyer Father Karras' medal, {{he gives}} {{it back to}} her and says [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> it", as {{depicted}} in the novel and instead of simply keeping it as in the original version. A new short scene of Regan smiling and waving at Father Dyer as they drive away and Father Dyer waving back has been added.|$|E
2500|$|Aleister Crowley {{had great}} admiration {{for the use of}} the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her {{greatest}} spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones: [...] "Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate." [...] Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated February 21, 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones, [...] "Re: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week." [...] In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him,"I'll think up another name for Ouija." [...] But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that, ...|$|E

But my first trip—and the one when I was {{bitten by a}} ferocious fairy penguin: <b>you</b> really <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> those things locked up!—was in 93 or so, talking about Linux for the Australian Unix Users Group.|$|R

6000|$|... 'All right, {{and very}} laudable,' said Squeers. 'But, first and foremost, Slider, burn the box. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> never <b>keep</b> things as {{may lead to}} discovery.

So while you pull it to pieces (which you can easily do, for it's very old and rickety) and burn it in little bits, I'll look over the papers and {{tell you what they}} are.' ...|$|R
5000|$|United Kingdom: The British Embassy advised its {{nationals}} {{to exercise}} caution and take sensible precautions, and avoid large crowds and gatherings.

6000|$|... 'By no means, Helen,' said Elizabeth; 'it is my serious opinion, that, {{unless you}} can find real friends, minds that suit you, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> to yourself, and let bores and geese keep to themselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He's very heartily welcome,' {{said the}} old man, raising himself in his chair, and {{attempting}} a gesture of courtesy, while a gleam of hospitable satisfaction seemed to pass over his faded features; 'but, Lucy, my dear, let us {{go down to the}} house; <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>keep</b> the gentleman here in the cold.

40|$|Legoland, Billund, July 1979. The children's choir {{from the}} Christian Radio program of Taiwan, "The Lutheran Voice" is singing {{from the large}} open-air scene - where they really were "stealing the show". Large audiences listened to missionary hymns and songs with melodies well known also in Denmark. Even being careful by using very large and sweet words, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>keep</b> quiet about things you know: It was both a spiritual and musical experience...|$|R

[...] "Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> really <b>keep</b> back at present, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode business. We don't know yet what may turn up. You must agree with me?" [...] he ended, looking at Mr. Farebrother.|$|R

5000|$|So you’ve {{become a}} “Great King,” have you? But {{why do you}} still {{continue}} to speak about “brotherhood” and about coming to Mt. Ammana?... For what reason <b>should</b> I call <b>you</b> “brother”?…Do {{those who are not}} on familiar terms with each other call each other “brother”? Why then <b>should</b> I call <b>you</b> “brother”? Were you and I born of the same mother? As my grandfather and my father did not call the King of Assyria “brother,” <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>keep</b> writing to me (about) “coming” and “Great King-ship.” It displeases me.

"I don't {{mean your}} resentment toward them," [...] said Philip, {{who had his}} reasons for some sympathy with this view of Tom, [...] "though a feeling of revenge is not worth much, that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> care to <b>keep</b> it.

40|$|In {{a recent}} article in American Scientist, Theodore Hill {{described}} a coin-tossing game whose pay-off is the number of heads over the total number of throws. Suppose that at a given point during the game you have 5 heads and 3 tails, <b>should</b> <b>you</b> stop and get 5 / 8, or <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> playing, hoping to get a better score? This is still an open problem. In the present article, we explore different strategies to this game from the Experimental Mathematics perspective...|$|R
