25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sense of}} agency (SA), or sense of control, is the {{subjective}} awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own volitional {{actions in the}} world. It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's [...] "sense of ownership" [...] (SO), which is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that one {{is the owner of}} an action, movement or thought.

2500|$|The {{names of}} the other Nazi executioners are also known due to their {{frequent}} presence in the village (Eilert Dieken, Michael Dziewulski and Erich Wilde). The village Vogt (...) Teofil Kielar was ordered to bury the victims {{with the help of}} other witnesses. He asked the German commander whom he had known from prior inspections and food acquisitions, why the children were also killed. Dieken answered in German, [...] "So that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any problems with them." [...] On 11 January 1945, in defiance of the Nazi prohibition, relatives of the Ulmas exhumed the bodies to bury them in the cemetery, and found out that Wiktoria's seventh child was almost born in the grave pit of its parents.|$|E

[...] Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties, because without them the leaders in society could not progress. He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too: [...] "The difference… is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment," [...] while those in the North had to search for employment.|$|E

2500|$|The general {{elections}} of June 15 in the Oviedo constituency resulted in 584,061 votes cast, for a voter turnout rate of 74.6%. PCE got 60,297 votes (10.5% of the ballot), {{good enough to}} seat one member, Dolores Ibárruri. The party with the most votes was the Spanish Workers' Socialist Party (31.8%). In contrast, the dictatorship's party, Falange Española, garnered a minuscule 0.46%. On July 13 at 10:05 AM—she notes in her memoirs— Ibárruri stepped inside the chamber of Congress she had vacated forty-one years before. Moments later she occupied the inaugural session's vice-presidential chair. The next day Radio España Independiente aired its last broadcast, number 108,300. On July 22 the king opened Parliament. She joined in the 1-minute general standing ovation, although she remained seated.

2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out and presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. [...] Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun in his hand, in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. [...] Eleven were killed in the hole. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, “but <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. [...] He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. [...] Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.” [...] When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. [...] The Indian replied in Lakota, “American Horse.” [...] Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, “No quarter!’, but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said,‘Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. [...] I can yet use them to good advantage. [...] "Tell the chief,“ he said turning to Grouard, [...] "that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.” [...] “This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. [...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|E
