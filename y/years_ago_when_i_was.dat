500|$|Lafourcade {{launched}} a promotional tour throughout Mexico and only performed at theaters {{that were at}} least 100 years old. The Village Voice, reporting on an interview with Lafourcade, noted, [...] "There are enough such grand old structures in her country to make this possible", although according to Lafourcade, [...] "some of them are better maintained than others." [...] The [...] "Hasta la Raíz Tour" [...] opened in Tijuana on April18, 2015, and also visited several cities in the United States such as San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In Hollywood, Lafourcade participated on the Latin Grammy Acoustic Sessions at the Fonda Theatre. A few dates in Argentina, Chile, Italy, and Spain were announced; however, her record label, Sony Music, announced that due to illness the performance in Spain, set for June, would be canceled. In September, Lafourcade performed at [...] "Festival DCODE 2015" [...] in Madrid, Spain. The singer also visited Colombia on October1, 2015, performing at Bogotá's Royal Center. On November4, 2015, Lafourcade fulfilled a long-held dream of performing {{for the first time}} at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. [...] "I've been here with Julieta Venegas, and someone reminded me that I opened for Juanes a few <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 13 years old, I ran away from home with my best friend to come to the Auditorio Nacional to see Christina Aguilera, and I wanted to be on stage, longing to have this opportunity. After many years of work, this became a reality." [...] To further promote the album, Lafourcade became the first Mexican female singer-songwriter to record an acoustic session for the music streaming service Spotify. Titled Spotify Sessions, the live EP includes six tracks from Hasta la Raíz ("Para Qué Sufrir", the title track, [...] "Nunca Es Suficiente", [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer", [...] "Palomas Blancas", and [...] "No Más Llorar") and a cover version of Rafael Hernández's [...] "Silencio". Lafourcade performed [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2015. Lafourcade also presented the tour in a sold-out show held at the Teatro Cariola in Santiago de Chile, Chile on November 25, 2015.|$|E

Many <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{studying}} for the gallows, I had a dear comrade, a youth {{who was not}} in my line, but still a scrupulously good fellow though devious. He was preparing {{to qualify for a}} place on the board, for {{there was going to be}} a vacancy by superannuation in about five years. This was down South, in the slavery days. It was the nature of the negro then, as now, to steal watermelons. They stole three of the melons of an adoptive brother of mine, the only good ones he had. I suspected three of a neighbor’s negroes, but there was no proof, and, besides, the watermelons in those negroes’ private patches were all green and small and not up to indemnity standard. But in the private patches of three other negroes there was a number of competent melons. I consulted with my comrade, the understudy of the board. He said that if I would approve his arrangements he would arrange. I said, “Consider me the board; I approve; arrange.” So he took a gun and went and collected three large melons for my brother-on-the-halfshell, and one over. I was greatly pleased and asked: ...|$|E

2500|$|When Brodie Innes sent on {{a sermon}} by E. B. Pusey, Darwin responded {{that he could}} [...] "hardly see how {{religion}} & science can be kept as distinct as he desires, as geology has to treat {{of the history of}} the Earth & Biology that of man.— But I most wholly agree with you that there is no reason why the disciples of either school should attack each other with bitterness, though each upholding strictly their beliefs. You, I am sure, have always practically acted in this manner in your conduct towards me & I do not doubt to all others. Nor can I remember that I have ever published a word directly against religion or the clergy." [...] In response to an enquiry about the same sermon from the botanist Henry Nicholas Ridley, Darwin stated that [...] "Dr Pusey was mistaken in imagining that I wrote the Origin with any relation whatever to Theology", and added that [...] "many <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> collecting facts for the Origin, my belief in what is called a personal God was as firm as that of Dr Pusey himself, & as to the eternity of matter I have never troubled myself about such insoluble questions.— Dr Pusey's attack will be as powerless to retard by a day the belief in evolution as were the virulent attacks made by divines fifty years ago against Geology, & the still older ones of the Catholic church against Galileo". Brodie Innes deplored [...] "unwise and violent" [...] theological attacks on his old friend, for while they had disagreements, [...] "How nicely things would go if other folk were like Darwin and Brodie Innes." ...|$|E
