Yellowfin tuna did not feed on DFAD–associated prey, while wahoo and dolphinfish did exploit resources aggregated by the DFADs, though they predominantly fed on other non–associated organisms. Opportunistic feeding on surface swarming stomatopod crustaceans was observed in yellowfin tuna and dolphinfish associated with FADs, but was not observed in wahoo...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of fishes with floating objects {{has been exploited}} {{by a number of}} fisheries.

50|$|Until October 2010, Skipjack (Euthynnus pelamis) and yellowfin <b>tuna</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>albacares)</b> were fished {{for about}} two {{months of the year}} as their year-long migratory route takes them through Chagos waters. While the {{remoteness}} of the Chagos offers some protection from extractive activities, legal and illegal fishing have had an impact. There is considerable poaching of turtles and other marine life. Sharks, which {{play a vital role in}} balancing the food web of tropical reefs, have suffered sharp declines from illegal fishing for their fins and as bycatch in legal fisheries. Sea cucumbers, which cleanse sand, are poached to feed Asian markets.|$|R
