2500|$|A common way to {{test whether}} an innate jealousy {{response}} exists between sexes {{is to use a}} forced-choice questionnaire. This style of questionnaire asks participants [...] "Yes or No" [...] and [...] "Response A or Response B" [...] style questions about certain scenarios. For example, a question might ask, [...] "If you found your partner cheating on you would <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> upset by (A) the sexual involvement or (B) the emotional involvement". As the name implies, one is forced to choose between the two options. Many studies using forced choice questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women. [...] Furthermore, studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures, although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures.|$|E
2500|$|In the end, Isac {{opted to}} throw his support behind the unionist movement. He {{attended}} the 9th Social Democratic Congress, and was elected a {{representative to the}} Alba Iulia assembly. There, on December 1, the Romanian socialist clubs, together with the Romanian National Party and the various other civic forces, demanded the union with Romania [...] (see Great Union Day). According to fellow socialist Tiron Albani, Isac first sparked disagreements within the unionist gathering, after endorsing proposals that the Romanian Kingdom become a republic in exchange for union. Isac's controversial address to his peers, as cited by Grapini, stresses: [...] "a {{quarter of an hour}} ago you have approved of the resolution [...] Now you are revolted that a human idea is being expressed. Today, when three emperors have been ejected and their crowns hurled back at them! Would <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> consistent! [...] a king may well be good and wise, but he may also be a tyrant, and he'll still be king". In the end, the socialist delegation renounced its republican aims, placated by a resolution to ensure land reform and workers' rights throughout the resulting nation.|$|E
