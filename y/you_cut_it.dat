According to one historian, [...] "In the end, no matter how <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it,</b> the British let them down". The defeat would affect {{politics}} for decades.

In May 2001, the police raided Brooks' Perth home and found a metre-high cannabis plant. Brooks claimed that the plant belonged to a friend, and then {{announced that he would}} be leaving the state. Having moved to South Australia in 2003, Brooks started Local, which he billed as the state's leading lifestyle magazine. The venture was run solely by him and his wife, and was dominated by advertising. Journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting, citing a quote from Kieren Perkins, which was rendered thus in the publication: [...] "I was over the moon. Winning is something you strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in my third Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [...]" [...] Brooks stood 200cm and weighed 95kg during his career, but {{in the early part of}} the 21st century fought a battle with obesity, after ballooning to 150kg.

2500|$|No North American {{distribution}} {{agreement for}} the film had ever been reached due to myriad corporate and legal concerns on the parts of both the Japanese Toei Company and prospective North American studios, despite mutual interest. It was said in 2005 by a representative of a prospective U.S. distributor that Japanese executives from the Toei Company were advised by American lawyers who attended test screenings in the early 2000s that [...] "they'd go to jail" [...] had the film been mass-released in the USA at the time. In the company's best interests, Toei attached prohibitive rules, costs, and legal criteria to any possible North American distribution deal. Toei representative Hideyuki Baba stated {{that the reason for}} [...] "withholding distribution" [...] in North America was [...] "due to the picture's contents and theme." [...] A representative for a prospective US distributor criticised Toei for expecting a wide release like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon rather than a limited art house run, noting that [...] "in the US it will never get past the MPAA ratings board, and the major theater chains will never play it un-rated.
