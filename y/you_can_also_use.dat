50|$|The second-person forms such as you {{are used}} with both {{singular}} and plural reference. In the Southern United States, y'all (you all) {{is used as a}} plural form, and various other phrases such as you guys are used in other places. An archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference is thou, thee, thyself, thy, thine, which are still used in religious services and can be seen in older works, such as Shakespeare's - in such texts, the you set of pronouns are used for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal V-form. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> as an indefinite pronoun, referring to a person in general (see generic you) compared to the more formal alternative, one (reflexive oneself, possessive one's).|$|R
5000|$|... #TableTalk (February 19, 2013 - March 19, 2017): A {{series that}} {{features}} {{three of the}} SourceFed co-hosts, and occasionally DeFranco, and sometimes guests from other industries, speaking about topics and questions that viewers suggested through Twitter, using the hashtag TableTalk or on Reddit via reddit.com/r/sourcefed. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> now <b>also</b> <b>use</b> the comment section of the TableTalk videos to submit topics. The series was commonly presented by Strens'ms and featured many recurring [...] "bits" [...] by all the hosts. The series {{was taken off the}} main SourceFed channel, and moved to the SourceFedNERD channel in May 2013. In April 2016 SourcefedNERD broadcast the last ever #TableTalk on that channel featuring Sam Bashor showing the new set before a final episode featuring David Kaye and James Arnold Taylor from the Ratchet and Clank video games and movie. As of May 2, 2016 #TableTalk moved back onto the main SourceFed channel broadcasting daily with Mike Falzone or Sam Bashor as the regular hosts. Along with the move back to the main SourceFed channel, TableTalk was available in podcast form on both iTunes and SoundCloud.|$|R

40|$|We have {{designed}} and implemented RestFS, a software framework {{that provides a}} uniform, configurable connector layer for mapping remote web-based resources to local filesystem-based resources, recognizing the similarity between {{these two types of}} resources. Such mappings enable programmatic access to a resource, as well as composition of two or more resources, through the local operating system’s standard filesystem application programming interface (API), script-able file-based command-line utilities, and interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms. The framework supports automatic and manual authentication. As part of this talk, we demonstrate a new filesystem that interfaces to the SketchFab. com service to support 3 D model visualization.

40|$|Automated {{digital video}} {{surveillance}} has {{come of age}} and a new threat to personal privacy is posed. Traditional physical security coupled with information systems has slowly been eroding personal privacy. But the advent of automated video analytics and the latest integrated information systems will truly open Pandora’s Box. The possibility that your employer will know when you arrive at work, when you loiter {{in front of your}} workplace, and when you leave with a package is already here. The possibility that your local retail merchant will know when you shop, with whom you shop, and what you do when you shop is around the corner. The potential for the misuse of this information is of increasing concern. However, the same technology which can be used to compile personal information about <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>used</b> to protect your privacy. In this paper, we present several examples of automated surveillance techniques which can be used to limit the information garnered from digital video surveillance. Exploiting user-defined alarm conditions which can be arbitrarily complex, we show how privacy can be preserved using vision technology in situations where privacy concerns might otherwise be overlooked. Specific examples are given at locations such as industrial entry points, parks and schools, and a retail environment. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Turmberg ('tower hill') is a vineyard-covered hill of {{the northernmost}} {{part of the}} Black Forest. A castle ruin with watch-tower are located {{on top of the}} Turmberg. The watch-tower in {{particular}} offers fine views of Karlsruhe towards the west and the Rhine River valley. On very clear days even farther west the Vosges in France can be seen. The Rhine River is the border between Germany and Alsace area of France. The South and East offer nice views of the Black Forest, and since the Turmberg is the northernmost tip of the Black Forest you have hills more than actual mountains. A staircase leads all the way up {{from the bottom of the}} hill to the top, however <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> ride up <b>using</b> the Turmbergbahn, a historic funicular railway.

5000|$|Regarding {{the set of}} columns, can be {{combined}} in various types. The Original column sets in the beginning were mainly poly(dimethylsiloxane) in the first dimension and poly(ethyleneglycol) in the second dimension. These so-called straight phase column sets are very suitable for Hydrocarbon analysis. Therefore, these are still used most frequent in Oil and Gas industry. If the application is to determine more polar compounds in a non-polar matrix. The reverse phase column set gives more resolution for the polar compounds. The first dimension column in this situation is a polar column, followed by a mid-polar second dimension column.For each application there can be an optimal column set. In this respective <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>also</b> chiral columns for optical isomer separation or for example PLOT columns for volatiles and gas samples.To optimize the application {{is a bit more}} complex compared to 1D separations, as there are more parameters involved. Flow and oven temperature program are still very important but also hot jet pulse duration, length of the second dimension column and modulation time have a big influence on the final results. The outcome is also different. No longer a traditional chromatogram is produced, but now a 3 dimensional plot is produced by specially designed software [...] packages. It is a different way of evaluate data, but you get much more information. With modern software, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> perform group-type separation as well as automated peak identification (with Mass Spectrometry).|$|R
