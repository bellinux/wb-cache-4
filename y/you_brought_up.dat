60|$|Sam Galloway's {{repertoire}} comprised {{about fifty}} funny stories and between thirty and forty songs. He {{by no means}} stopped there. He could talk through twenty cigarettes on any topic that <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up.</b> And he never sat up when he could lie down; and never stood when he could sit. I am strongly disposed to linger with him, for I am drawing a portrait {{as well as a}} blunt pencil and a tattered thesaurus will allow.|$|E
6000|$|... "You weren't crazy, partner. <b>You</b> <b>brought</b> us <b>up</b> out of {{the swamps}} and sloos of poverty, and planked us down right on to the lode," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush!' {{said the}} gentleman who had spoken first. 'You know you've got no father or mother, and that <b>you</b> were <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> by the parish, don't you?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a very close affair, sir," [...] he said; [...] "and I {{certainly}} thought that we should be rolled down the hill. I believe that we owe our safety, in no small degree, to a couple of battalions of Spaniards, I fancy, who took up their post on the opposite hill this morning. Just before <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> your reinforcement, and while things were at their worst, I heard heavy volley firing somewhere just over the crest. I don't know who it could have been, if it was not them; for there were certainly no other troops on my left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never saw}} anybody {{in your life}} that was as full of {{knowledge}} and had less sense than old Cal. He was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning, and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment. You couldn't advance him any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought. You would have thought he was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of derivations. Any subject <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> old Cal could give you an abundant synopsis of it from the Greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> the subject; I've {{felt the}} {{influence}} of this nocturnal blight upon our city, but I never thought to analyse it before. I can see now that your 'Man About Town' should have been classified long ago. In his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models; and the orchestra plays 'Let's All Go Up to Maud's' for him, by request, instead of Händel. He makes his rounds every evening; while you and I see the elephant once a week. When the cigar store is raided, he winks at the officer, familiar with his ground, and walks away immune, while you and I search among the Presidents for names, and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant." ...|$|E
6000|$|Capt. G. Thanks. I say, Pussy, I don't {{know much}} about your {{religious}} beliefs. <b>You</b> were <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> to believe in a heaven and all that, weren't you? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "O, {{it is just}} {{according}} to what <b>you</b> are <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> to," [...] said Beatrice. [...] "A Turkish lady despises us for showing our faces: {{it is just as}} you think it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Gentiles," [...] {{said the}} officer, [...] "and take count of your goods, {{that you may}} not say that we have stolen {{anything}} from you. Here are your firearms and all the ammunition that is left. These will be given to you {{at the foot of the}} pass, but not before, lest you should do more murder on the road. On those camels are fastened the boxes in which <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> the magic fire. We found them in your quarters in the cave city, ready packed, but what they contain we neither know nor care. Full or empty, take them, they are yours. Those," [...] and he pointed to two other beasts, [...] "are laden with your pay, which the Child of Kings sends to you, requesting that you will not count it till you reach Egypt or your own land, since she wishes no quarrelling with you as to the amount. The rest carry food for you to eat; also, there are two spare beasts. Now, mount and begone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's you {{women that}} make war," [...] he continued. [...] "Oh, I don't {{mean that you}} do it on purpose, but it's in your blood. It comes {{from the days when}} to live it was needful to kill. When a man who was swift and strong to kill {{was the only thing that}} could save a woman and her brood. Every other man that crept towards them through the grass was an enemy, and her only hope was that her man might kill him, while she watched and waited. And later came the tribe; and instead of the one man {{creeping}} through the grass, the everlasting warfare was against all other tribes. So you loved only the men ever ready and willing to fight, lest you and your children should be carried into slavery: then it was the only way. <b>You</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> your boys to be fighters. You told them stories of their gallant sires. You sang to them the songs of battle: the glory of killing and of conquering. You have never unlearnt the lesson. Man has learnt comradeship--would have travelled further but for you. But woman is still primitive. She would still have her man the hater and the killer. To the woman the world has never changed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Elizabeth, listen," [...] said Lassiter. [...] "Before you {{was born}} your father made a mortal enemy of a Mormon named Dyer. They was both ministers an' {{come to be}} rivals. Dyer stole your mother away from her home. She gave birth to you in Texas {{eighteen}} years ago. Then she was taken to Utah, from place to place, an' finally to the last border settlement--Cottonwoods. You was about three years old when you was taken away from Milly. She never knew {{what had become of}} you. But she lived a good while hopin' and prayin' to have you again. Then she gave up an' died. An' I may as well put in here your father died ten years ago. Well, I spent my time tracin' Milly, an' some months back I landed in Cottonwoods. An' jest lately I learned all about you. I had a talk with Oldrin' an' told him you was dead, an' he told me what I had so long been wantin' to know. It was Dyer, of course, who stole you from Milly. Part reason he was sore because Milly refused to give you Mormon teachin', but mostly he still hated Frank Erne so infernally that he made a deal with Oldrin' to take you an' bring you up as an infamous rustler an' rustler's girl. The idea was to break Frank Erne's heart if he ever came to Utah--to show him his daughter with a band of low rustlers. Well--Oldrin' took you, brought you up from childhood, an' then made you his Masked Rider. He made you infamous. He kept that part of the contract, but he learned to love you as a daughter an' never let any but his own men know you was a girl. I heard him say that with my own ears, an' I saw his big eyes grow dim. He told me how he had guarded you always, kept you locked up in his absence, was always at your side or near you on those rides that made you famous on the sage. He said he an' an old rustler whom he trusted had taught you how to read an' write. They selected the books for you. Dyer had wanted <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> the vilest of the vile! An' Oldrin' brought you up the innocentest of the innocent. He said you didn't know what vileness was. I can hear his big voice tremble now as he said it. He told me how the men--rustlers an' outlaws--who from time to time tried to approach you familiarly--he told me how he shot them dead. I'm tellin' you this 'specially because you've showed such shame--sayin' you was nameless an' all that. Nothin' on earth can be wronger than that idea of yours. An' the truth of it is here. Oldrin' swore to me that if Dyer died, releasin' the contract, he intended to hunt up your father an' give you back to him. It seems Oldrin' wasn't all bad, en' he sure loved you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Pastor John Piper {{is quoted}} as saying, [...] "Nobody {{in the area of}} {{missions}} had a greater impact on me. Ralph Winter was probably the most creative thinker I have ever known. I mean, on any topic that <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up,</b> he would come at it in a way you have never dreamed of. He saw all things in relationship to other things that you would never think of relating them to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul Armentano of NORML says: [...] "This is an {{impressive}} compendium. I think it's especially effective when you rebuke the ONDCP's claim slide-per-slide. Also, I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> {{the fact that the}} agency has recently restructured their budget numbers {{to give the impression that}} there is nearly equal funding for treatment vs interdiction." [...] And Joseph White of Change the Climate claims: [...] "... rather impressive -- very thorough ... I was especially interested in your use of [...] "ideology" [...] as a jumping off point for your critique. As a philosophy student, I appreciate your pointing to the substance behind ONDCP's madness—i.e., it is all political based on the dominant culture's morality." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Custom and use change, and any {{comparison}} limps or is {{only half}} truth; but eternity’s custom, which never becomes obsolete, {{is that you are}} a single individual, that even in the intimate relationship of marriage you should have been aware of this. …. Eternity does not ask whether <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> your children the way you saw others doing it but asks you as an individual how <b>you</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> your children. …. In eternity you are a single individual, and conscience, when it speaks with you, is no third person, no more than you are a third person when you are speaking with the conscience, because you and the conscience are one; it knows everything you know, and it knows that you know it. .... If you do not live in an out-of-the-way spot in the world, {{if you live in a}} heavily populated city and you then turn your attention outward, sympathetically give heed to people and events, do you bear in mind, every time you relate yourself in this way to the outside world, that in this relation you are relating yourself to yourself as a single individual with eternal responsibility? Or do you filter yourself into the crowd, where the one blames another, where one moment there are, as they say, a great many, and where at the next moment, every time responsibility is mentioned, there is no one? Do you judge as the crowd judges, in the capacity of the crowd? You are not obligated to have an opinion about something that you do not understand. No, on the contrary, you are eternally exempted, but as an individual you are eternally obligated to make an accounting of your opinion, of your judgment. And in eternity you will not be pryingly and busily asked, as by a journalist, whether there were a great many who had the same - wrong opinion, but only whether you had it; whether you have pamperingly accustomed your soul to judge light-mindedly and unthinkingly along with the others because the crowd judged unthinkingly; whether you perhaps have corrupted the better part in you by boasting along with the crowd that you were many and that you were justified because you were many, that is, you were many who were wrong. In eternity you will be asked whether you perhaps have harmed a good cause because you also judged along with those who did not understand how to judge but who had the crowd’s considerable power in a temporal sense, negligible power in eternity’s sense."

Every soul as I knowed was a thief, and the best thief was the best thought on. Maybe a kid not long born ought to have knowed better. I dunno, I must ha' been born bad, for it seemed right enough to me. Well, it was in prison and out o' prison—three months here and six months there—till I was sixteen. I {{sometimes}} thinks as if they'd bin half as ready to show me how to go right as they was to punish me for goin' wrong, I might have took the right turnin' and stuck to it afore this. At sixteen I got seven-year for shop-liftin', and was sent out to Port Phillip. I soon got a ticket and tried service and needlework, but no one wouldn't have me; and I got sick and tired of it all, and began to think o' putting an end to it, when I met a smooth-spoken chap—a gentleman, if you please—as wanted to save me from the danger afore me. Well, wot odds? He was a psalm-singing villain, and he soon left me. No need to tell the rest—to such as you it can't be told. I'm 'most as bad as I can be—as bad as I can be!MRS.
