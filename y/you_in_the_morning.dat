2500|$|In 2004, {{following}} {{success on}} Wawffactor, Duffy recorded a three-song Welsh extended play, titled Aimée Duffy, while working part-time in two jobs as waitress {{and in a}} fishmonger's. It later achieved 2008 Welsh chart success, charting at number-one on the [...] "Siart C2" [...] music chart. Duffy, now in high demand, appeared on Mint Royale's See <b>You</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> as a back-up singer. Duffy was introduced to Jeanette Lee of Rough Trade Records in August 2004, after singing Richard J. Parfitt's [...] "Oh Boy". Lee moved Duffy to Crouch End in London, orchestrating a meeting between Duffy and Suede's ex-guitar player Bernard Butler. Lee with Rough Trade would eventually manage Duffy. After Butler had given Duffy a soul music [...] "education" [...] by downloading tracks on to her iPod that she could listen to while around London or travelling back to Wales, the pair co-wrote with her and helped create a new retro sound. The music included tracks Al Green, Bettye Swann, Ann Peebles, Doris Duke, Scott Walker, Phil Spector and Burt Bacharach. Duffy {{was quoted as saying}} Bettye Swann [...] "is one of my biggest inspirations" [...] particularly her song [...] "Cover Me" [...] because [...] "it marks the time I got interested in physical contact. I was 19, and here was a woman singing 'Cover me, spread your precious love all over me.' It's very tender, but it's also, hilariously, quite crude." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thou forgettest {{that which}} I told <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> child. It {{would seem that}} they who named thee, have no great cause to exult in their {{judgment}} of character, since Unbelief would better describe thy disposition, than Faith." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well, sir," [...] Colonel Holliday said. [...] "My {{grandson}} {{will ride}} over with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Two well-armed lackeys shall accompany you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This must be {{our good}} night," [...] she said, [...] "and good-bye if I {{do not see}} {{anything}} of <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> I suppose {{it will be a}} terrible crush getting on shore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sh!" [...] she whispered, suddenly, [...] "methinks I hear footsteps. They {{must not}} find thee here, Norman of Torn, for the King has only this night wrung a promise {{from my father}} to take <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and hang <b>thee.</b> What shall we do, Norman? Where shall we meet again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{kept the}} address of my new house a secret from all my friends, knowing they would betray me if they paid us visits. As for my mysteriously-closed study, it was <b>the</b> place <b>in</b> which I privately rehearsed my new part. When I left <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings,</b> it {{was to go to}} the theater rehearsals. My evening {{absences}} began of course with the first performance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Robert; 'and there, indeed, {{you may be}} satisfied. <b>The</b> seed <b>you</b> sowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> is bearing its increase!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No {{trouble at}} all,' said Theodora, kindly. 'I am sorry you {{had so much}} to tire <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Now, come up to your room. I wish I could carry you, as Arthur does.' ...|$|E
60|$|Roxana. I like thy scheme very well; and I beg the {{favour of}} <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> {{as soon as}} you are up, to send Tom to Dover, with such {{instructions}} as you shall think proper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you take}} my tip," [...] said Brodie, [...] "and only sleep with one on. Then the cold'll wake <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and you'll get up because it'll be more {{comfortable}} than staying in bed." ...|$|E

6000|$|As Aunt {{attaches}} {{great importance}} to Mrs. Saxby's opinion, {{she looked at me}} relentingly and said: [...] "Well, I will think it over and let <b>you</b> know <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> Marguerite." ...|$|R
6000|$|Could you dine {{with us on}} Sunday, at {{six o'clock}} sharp? I'd come and fetch <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and we could take a ride and walk. We shall be quite alone, unless Macready comes. What say you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I don't {{like you}} coming {{as late as}} this. I'll hear any of <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> part of the day, but I can't really do with you after. What's amiss then, Gittens. How is your Missis?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will remain}} {{with your mother}} to-night, Marble," [...] I observed. [...] "I will keep the sloop at an anchor until I can see <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> when we will settle the future a little more deliberately." ...|$|E
50|$|If {{after reading}} it <b>you</b> die <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night, {{then it is}} as if you have died on 'Natural Deen' and if <b>you</b> awake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> alive then <b>you</b> will have good fortune".|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, it is {{a kindly}} moon. It will keep right along {{overhead}} {{all the way}} to West Salem. But you must go to sleep now. I shall call <b>you</b> early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to meet Grandfather." ...|$|R
60|$|THE CALIFORNIAN. You hear that? You stay {{quiet the}} rest of the time; and if that lady choses to keep us all awake the whole night, don't you say a word, or I'll settle with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I should advise <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> {{to manage}} to untie each other. We shall fasten the door {{up as we}} go out, but you will have no {{difficulty}} in bursting that open, when you are once untied.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so sorry, because I {{particularly}} {{wished to}} speak to you,--most particularly. I suppose I could not see <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning?</b> But, no; it would not do. I could not get you alone without making such a fuss of the thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|...A twenty-four-hour day.

6000|$|... "Well, now," [...] said Francis, as he {{rose from}} the table and settled his elegant waist, resting on one hip, as usual. [...] "We shall see <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> I hope. You say you are going to Venice. Why? Have you some {{engagement}} in Venice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BEFORE {{the doctor}} left me one evening, I {{asked him how}} much longer I was likely to live. He answered: [...] "It's not easy to say; you may die before I {{can get back to}} <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> or you may live {{to the end of the}} month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> see <b>in</b> Vagg Hollow, Little boy, when <b>you</b> go <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> at five on your lonely drive?" [...] "--I see men's souls, {{who follow}} Till we've passed {{where the road}} lies low, When they vanish at our creaking! ...|$|R
