[...] "We wanted to create something that combined the strategic aspects of our Baldur's Gate series and Neverwinter Nights but which presented it through fast, cinematic 3D action," [...] Hudson said. [...] "That required us to make something that hadn't really been done before." [...] The developers intended to make the game have more open-ended gameplay.

2500|$|Arthur {{became one}} of EastEnders best loved characters, and his {{reputation}} as an eternal loser endeared him to viewers. In 1995 audiences were shocked and horrified when Arthur was framed for the embezzlement of the Flowering Wilderness Campaign funds and wrongfully imprisoned. There was a public outcry and a nationwide Free Arthur Fowler campaign was launched. 'Arthur Fowler Is Innocent' T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the UK singles chart promoting the campaign. [...] Eventually the truth came out and Arthur was released. However, a gash to the head he had sustained in prison led to a brain haemorrhage and Arthur died suddenly in 1996 shortly after his release. Off-screen Bill Treacher had asked to be written out of the series after eleven years playing Arthur, saying: [...] "By the time I finished, even {{the sound of the}} theme music was making me feel ill. I felt depressed." [...] Although it was his decision to leave the soap, Treacher was shocked that the show’s bosses chose to kill Arthur off. He has said: [...] "I certainly didn’t ask them to kill him. Oh no, because you never know, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>need</b> to come back and earn a few grand." [...] Treacher also stated in a 2003 interview that he was forced to resign from the show in the end due to the negative effect it was having on his health.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} the Contract pattern, a programming pattern (idiom) {{that lets you}} apply assertions to guarantee pre-conditions and post-conditions of methods and invariants {{on the state of}} objects. The Design by Contract methodology—introduced by Meyer is available in the Eiffel context, but unfortunately not for all the other object-oriented languages interested to profit from Meyer’s contribution. This paper shows how to implement this idiom in Java. By using this idiom, developers can improve the reliability of their classes by precising what constraints must be satisfied by the client to guarantee correct functioning. Intent Provide an implementation of the Design by contract methodology [Meyer 88] for developing reliable classes and create robust objects in Java. This programming pattern lets you apply assertions to guarantee the pre-conditions and post-conditions of methods and invariants on the state of objects. Also Known As Design by contract Motivation Sometimes it’s necessary to restrict a class interface because you don’t want to provide all the possible input combinations for all collaborators. One way to achieve this goal is to make minimal and consistent methods that impose pre-conditions on input parameters. Moreover, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> want to ensure the class behavior by imposing post-conditions before methods return. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> also <b>need</b> {{to make sure that the}} class is always in a stable state. Such an approach can result in reliable classes to create robust objects...|$|R

It is evidently written in a hurried manner, and is quite inadequate as a notice of the book; but, do you know, I am of opinion that if you considered it more closely you would lose your impression of its being depreciatory and cold. He says that the only fault of the work is its shortness; a rare piece of praise to be given to a work nowadays. You see, your reputation is at the height; neither he nor another could help you; such books as yours make their own way. The 'Athenæum' doesn't give full critiques of Dickens, for instance, and it is arctical in general temperature. I thought I would say this to you. Certainly I do know that Mr. Chorley highly regards you in every capacity--as writer and as woman--and {{in the manner in which}} he named you to me in his last letter there was no chill of sentiment nor recoil of opinion. So do not admit a doubt of him; he is a sure and affectionate friend, and absolutely high-minded and reliable; of an intact and even chivalrous delicacy.

[...] Classroom management [...] Assessment [...] Lesson planning. Introduction. So, you've {{decided to go to}} China to teach English as a second language. Or, you are in China now beginning the adventure of a lifetime. Congratulations!By now, you probably have encountered the attitude that says, "You speak English; what more do you need to know?" Just {{the fact that you are}} a native English speaker makes you an expert in your subject matter. And since your students will have been studying English with non-native English speakers for 9 - 12 years already, their biggest need/lack will have been (or will be perceived to have been) exposure to native speakers. Every word you speak is an educational event! What more <b>might</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to know?This manual is designed to help you when all of the other things <b>you</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>need</b> to know become painfully apparent. What exactly is ESL? What is a good teacher [...] . a good class… a successful lesson? How do you teach American English Conversation to a class of 50, using a British English grammar text that is 10 years out of date? How do you do ANYTHING without a computer/copy machine/overhead projector? How do you plan a lesson when you've never stood up in front of a class before? How do you even know where to start?Chapter 1 will cover the history of English and English education in China. This should give you a good overview of the topic and help you to understand your place as a foreign teacher of English in China. Chapter 2 will cover a number of topics specifically dealing with the theoretical underpinnings of Teaching ESL. It will discuss methods, concepts, issues, and some of the current debates in the field of Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL). Chapter 3 will discuss several factors that may affect your students' learning. While this section cannot hope to cover all possible influences (that is beyond the scope of this thesis), a number of the major issues are addressed. Chapter 4 begins to move out of the realm of "theory" and into the nuts and bolts of actually teaching English in China. What can you expect (and what might be expected of you) if you are assigned to teach Extensive or Intensive Reading, Writing, Grammar, Vocabulary, or Oral English?Chapter 5 offers some suggestions on organizing and managing your class time and accomplishing the myriad of daily tasks involved in teaching. Chapter 6 suggests ways <b>you</b> <b>might</b> create tests that will enable you to assess your students' needs prior to planning lessons. Chapter 7 is the longest single chapter in the manual, covering lesson planning from the semester down to the individual class level. A sample of a lesson plan is presented, as well as an explanation of how it was created. All handouts and notes required to use it in an actual class are included. Department of EnglishThesis (M.
