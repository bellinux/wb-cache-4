At the moment, the ships have pulled off. But we are sure, as they have told us, that they are coming back. They had brought a child, and a woman, on one of their ships, to kinda deter us from doing anything to them. Although it is our intention[...] [...] defend ourselves. As the owner of the station has said to the Captain of the trip that brought us out here, only the agent from the shipping company in Holland, myself, and the owner Mr Erwin Meister has come out to the Mebo. Many people wanted to come out to help us. We told them they could not come on our ship, we are not interested in any fights, we are not interested in any deaths at sea. This station is not around to make trouble, this station is around to provide you with musical entertainment. This is the reason that we asked that only the shipping agent, Mr Erwin Meister, and myself, Larry Tremaine, to come out here to the Mebo II to see what the problem was. We have contacted our attorneys, our solicitors in Holland, and {{we are trying to do}} our utmost to do the best for you. So please stay tuned. Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> lighting up the switchboard at the Grand Hotel. We appreciate that very much. Also thank you very much for lighting up the switchboard in Zurich. As I understand, all the lines were flooded, showing your continued support for Radio North Sea International. We are not saying that at this time, that we do not still need help, because at this time they have pulled away. But we are sure that they are coming back. Mr Manders has no right to take this ship. There has never been a contract signed with him. There are no agreements between him and Radio North sea International. This I can assure our listeners implicitly, there is no agreement, and there is no reason for this action whatsoever. We are {{very sorry for}} all this trouble, we are very sorry to interrupt music like this. But you can understand our involved situation out here. We will protect the Mebo II to the utmost. We will not leave this ship, we are prepared for them although we do not want a fight. We do not want any deaths, or anybody hurt at all. It went so far as to tell them, when they planned to put water on the transmitter, the disk jockeys, just by thinking of the people on the ship, and not thinking of themselves, told them not to put water on the transmitter, because it would kill everybody on the tug boat. This we did not have to do, but we did it because we are a music station. We are not around to injure or endanger any lives whatsoever. So please stay tuned, if you wish to help, we want it. But meanwhile, stay with us." ...|$|E

To all concerned: Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the box {{of candy}} sent to me for Christmas. At Christmas time, I {{was out in the}} war zone, many miles away from the states. I came back to the states on February 7 th, and on February 8 th, we, the crew, {{received}} our first mail in many months. I was indeed surprised to receive the package from the Bryant Servicemens’ Club. It was in very good condition and I, together with my shipmates, enjoyed our Hallowe’en [sic], Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years on the day of our arrival in the states. I’m a yeoman second class, aboard one of the Navy’s largest minelayers. The duty aboard this type of ship is very dangerous, especially when one considers the fact that we carry tons of TNT. One hit by and enemy ship on almost any part of our ship will blow us to bits. I was in Africa, at Casablanca, where I saw service and action. We mined the coast of certain places, places which I cannot mention. Also was in the Mediterranean, Gibralter [sic] and other places. Casablanca, I would say, is a fair city. It has some beautiful buildings and parks. The fig, orange, and tangerine trees add greatly to the beauty of this place. Besides the French; Italians and Spanish live here. There are many tribes of Arabs and Moslems here. They just loiter on the streets in groups selling their wares. They are very dangerous at times and have to be dealt with. We had air-raids here, one of which occurred on or about Christmas Eve. This one lasted about five hours. The flashes of the guns and the wakes of the tracers in the sky lit up the night like a Christmas tree. The sun rises about 8 : 30 a. m., which made the days very short. Gibralter [sic] is a nice place and will be very difficult to the Axis to overpower. Can’t say much about this place. Well, I guess I’ll stop for now for I’ll be here all day just writing. Again, let me thank all of you who made it possible for me and also others in the same position, to receive this gift. I appreciate it very much and will remember it always. You know when a sailor is on watch out at sea, he had plenty to think about and you know the way it is, one’s mind just begins to wander on and on and knowing that someone thought of him makes him feel very happy and thankful. During action my battle station is in the Fire Control. This is the place from which the range and angles and scales are given to the gunners and also the word to fire.

On 31 August 1917 it was announced that the Italian government had awarded him the Silver Medal for Military Valour.

McCartney idolized Little Richard in school and later used Little Richard's recordings as inspiration for his uptempo rockers, such as [...] "I'm Down.". [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the first song McCartney performed in public. McCartney would later state, [...] "I could do Little Richard's voice, which is a wild, hoarse, screaming thing. It's like an out-of-body experience. You have to leave your current sensibilities and go about a foot above your head to sing it."

Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were also profoundly influenced by Little Richard, with Jagger citing him as his first induction to R&B music and referring to him as [...] "the originator and my first idol".

He is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> averse to taking brandy, and there was some trouble in getting him to take it. He is almost totally deaf the last five or six days. There is no chance for him at all. Quite a particular friend of mine, Oscar Cunningham, an Ohio boy, had his leg amputated yesterday close up by the thigh. It was a pretty tough operation. He was badly wounded just a year ago to-day at Chancellorsville and has suffered a great deal; lately got erysipelas in his leg and foot. I forget whether I have mentioned him before or not. He was a very large, noble-looking young man when I first see him. The doctor thinks he will live and get up, but I consider [it] by no means so certain. He is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> prostrated.

This {{would not have been}} a successful journey if it has not been for the help of many different people that gave me the support I needed in order to finish what I started many years ago. First of all I would like to thank my advisor Abraham Matta, for his patience and guidance throughout the years. He gave me the freedom to find my own path and was always there to help and advise me. I {{would also like to thank}} my co-advisor Craig Partridge that taught me how to properly document and found my work. He also showed me how to leverage prior research to expand my knowledge and understanding of a research field. Both of my advisors are great teachers and I was very fortunate to work with them. The rest of my committee – Azer, Jason, John and Mark – also provided invaluable feedback; thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> This thesis would have not been possible without the help of the JAVeLEN team. I want to thank Alberto for being my mentor while designing JTP, Dan and Will for accommodating all my crazy requests to support and implement my ideas and above all Jason that gave me the opportunity and freedom to innovate, and trusted me to develop this work within the JAVeLEN system. During these years there have been many people that ensured I do not give up and helped me to march along even when it seemed that this will be an endless journey. Specifically, I would like to thank Tim and Stan for always motivating me to continue. Through the years of working at BBN, I was very fortunate to work with people that showed great understanding and helped me find the time to work on my thesis. Thank yo...|$|R
40|$|Thank you {{does not}} seem to be quite enough to emulate the {{appreciation}} that I feel for those who’ve supported me and seen me through this process. Therefore, I will keep this quite simple, but please know that I feel a deep sense of gratitude toward you all; words simply are not enough. Thank you to the Counselor Ed Department, without <b>all</b> of <b>you</b> I would not be the counselor that I am today. To my classmates, we’ve had a lot of laughs, and I am thankful that I was able to finish this journey with the group of you, THANK YOU. To the amazing people at my internship site, I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to learn from and get to know <b>you</b> <b>all</b> and am deeply grateful for the entire experience. To my family and friends, this road has not been an easy or smooth one and yet you have stayed with me through it all, I greatly appreciate all your love and support. Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> so <b>very</b> <b>much...</b>|$|R
