[...] Keil and Knutson found the sound effects to be [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "really great" [...] respectively.

500|$|Poe {{claimed he}} wrote [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] {{before he was}} 15 years old, though he would later adapt his claim. A few {{passages}} from the poem were first published in the May 19, 1829, issue of the Baltimore Gazette signed [...] "Marlow". Poe first offered the complete poem to publishers Carey, Lea & Carey in Philadelphia around May 1829. He wrote to them, [...] "If the poem is published, succeed or not, I am 'irrecoverably a poet.' But to <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> I leave it". He met with Isaac Lea, {{who was willing to}} publish it so long as they were protected against any loss. Poe asked his foster-father John Allan to subsidize the printing but, not supportive of Poe's literary pursuits, he refused. By July 28, Poe wrote to the publishers asking for the return of his manuscript because, as he said, he had [...] "made a better disposition of my poems than I had any right to expect".|$|E
500|$|The presidential {{election}} of 1832 was approaching, and Floyd was torn: He {{wanted to see}} Vice President Calhoun as the presidential candidate, but wondered if he should first be proposed as the vice presidential candidate for the second term. He felt Calhoun had {{a better chance to}} beat Jackson than Clay, and he wrote to Calhoun in April 1831 to know his opinion: [...] "Under all these views I really do not know which course to take; whether to announce you a candidate for the presidency and take the hazard of war, or wait the fate of Clay. We would be glad to know <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> about these things." [...] Floyd, along with Tazewell and John Tyler, were considered the leaders of the Virginians that had become disaffected with Jackson and had turned to Calhoun. They felt that Jackson had repudiated [...] "virtue and ability as well as Old Republican tenets." [...] According to historian Stephen Oates, [...] "In Floyd's opinion, the federal government under [...] "King Andrew" [...] had usurped power left and right, thus allowing the majority to run roughshod over the minority." ...|$|E

500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised {{the choice of}} having Rivers guest star since {{she was able to}} [...] "employ her trademark humor within the world of The Simpsons without hijacking the plot or satire." [...] He also noted that while the Simpson family does not appear heavily, [...] "Krusty is such {{a large part of the}} supporting cast that he carries this episode well. While it may seem a little funny that Castellaneta, who voices Krusty, wrote such a large part for himself, it is also a testament to his empathy for Krusty that this episode both deepens our understanding of Krusty and actually allows him growth as a character in an organic fashion." [...] Ology's Josh Harrison similarly praised [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] for having [...] "some wonderful Krusty the Klown moments and some clutch guest star appearances". He also cited the visual gags in the episode as [...] "clever". Harrison concluded his review by writing that though the episode [...] "wasn't Simpsons gold, it was a great chance to focus on a secondary character and an opportunity for Joan Rivers to, um, be Joan Rivers. I imagine your assessment of the episode may be based largely on <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> of the guest star. That said? I dug it." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding Joan of Arc, William Wordsworth {{wrote to}} William Matthews, 21 March 1796, claiming: [...] "You were right about Southey, he is {{certainly}} a , and has proved it completely by the preface to his Joan of Arc, an epic poem which he has just published. This preface is indeed a very conceited performance and the poem though in some passages of first-rate excellence is on the whole of very inferior execution." [...] Charles Lamb, in a 10 June 1796 letter to Coleridge, stated, [...] "With Joan of Arc I have been delighted, amazed. I had not presumed to expect of any thing of such excellence from Southey. why the poem is alone sufficient to redeem {{the character of the}} age we live in from the imputation of degenerating in Poetry [...] The subject is well chosen. It opens well [...] On the whole, I expect Southey one day to rival Milton." [...] Coleridge, in a 31 December 1796 letter to John Thelwall, admitted, [...] "I entirely according with <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> of Southey's Joan [...] the poem tho' it frequently reached the sentimental, does not display, the poetical, Sublime. In language at once natural, perspicuous, & dignified, in manly pathos, in sooth & sonnet-like description, and above all, in character, & dramatic dialogue, Southey is unrivalled; but as certainly he does not possess opulence of Imagination, lofty-paced Harmony, or that toil of thinking, which is necessary in order to plan a Whole." ...|$|E

500|$|Dubbed at {{the time}} [...] "The Queen of obscene", Madonna and the Sex era is {{considered}} by many as the artist's most controversial and transgressive period. The book, widely panned by the press, is {{regarded as one of the}} factors that shaped the social reaction and critique towards Madonna during the early 1990s. Her fifth studio album Erotica was affected by the negative press surrounding the book. In March 1993, Spin magazine wrote an article praising the book, but months later in Mexico, social communicologist Nino Canún dedicated an episode of his morning talk show ¿Y usted qué opina? (English: So what's <b>your</b> <b>opinion?),</b> to Madonna. Some members of the audience, among them a priest, presented their arguments as to why [...] "this morally clueless singer shouldn't be allowed to perform in the country", making reference to The Girlie Show World Tour, which was set to visit Mexico. Later, during the concert, Madonna wore a charro sombrero and simulated an orgy with her dancers onstage, as a response to these comments. Continuing her provocative imagery, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which featured the singer fully nude and in scenes engaged in simulated sexual acts. In March 1994, Madonna appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that was required to be censored on television and handing Letterman a pair of her underwear and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit film, album and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics regard Madonna as a sexual renegade. She faced strong negative publicity from critics and fans, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over. Later, on the song [...] "Human Nature", from her sixth studio album Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna addressed the public backlash the book was still receiving, particularly with the lines [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate <b>your</b> <b>opinion</b> {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E
