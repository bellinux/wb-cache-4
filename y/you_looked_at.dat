500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} casting, Watanabe {{considered}} Kōichi Yamadera to be [...] "really perfect" [...] for Spike. The staff had him audition as a formality, but Watanabe felt that [...] "no matter how <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it, {{there was only}} Yamadera". After a decade of work in anime series, Yamadera was pleased to secure his first leading role, but Unshō Ishizuka, Jet's voice actor, was surprised that Yamadera was not cast as Jet. The two characters were designed to be opposites, with Spike being thin and wearing smart attire, while Jet was bulky and wore more casual clothing. Spike's English voice actor, Steven Blum, used film noir imagery to get himself in the right frame of mind to voice the character, but experienced some difficulty portraying in scenes where he was showing vulnerability. Reflecting on his performance, Blum said [...] "there were a few lines here and there that I felt were awkward, and could have been smoothed out better." [...] He called Spike an [...] "example of a character [...] didn't fully appreciate until the series was over", adding {{that he would like}} to reprise his role as the character if given the chance. Spike's portrayal was expanded in [...] Specifically, according to Yamadera, the character displayed more of his inner thoughts and showed a gentler side than he did in the series. This was because the team had more time available to express such details. Blum found his performance in the movie one of his most difficult from an emotional standpoint, as there were scenes where Spike was portrayed quite differently from the version he had been playing in the series.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last known}} bank robbery by Machine Gun Kelly, a Prohibition-era gangster, {{took place on}} November 30, 1932 at the Citizen’s State Bank in Tupelo; his gang netted $38,000. After the robbery, the bank’s chief teller said of Kelly, “He {{was the kind of}} guy that, if <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him, you would never thought he was a bank robber.” ...|$|E

But to say that she did all of the dancing is {{absolutely}} ridiculous to anyone that knows anything about ballet." ...|$|E

In the same article, Norman Reynolds – Production Designer originally hired by Ward – remembers an early design idea for [...] "a wooden library shaft. <b>You</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the books on this wooden platform that went up and down".
