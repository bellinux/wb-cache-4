25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not as committed to them as you thought you were.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I can assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all {{in his power to}} save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E

500|$|If a {{statement}} {{has been made}} by a person after being arrested, it is only admissible if the court is satisfied that a caution along the following lines was administered: [...] "It is my duty to warn <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not obliged to say anything or to answer any question, but anything you say, whether in {{answer to a question}} or not, may be given in evidence." [...] However, if a person makes {{a statement}} before there is time to administer a caution, the statement remains admissible if the caution is then administered as soon as possible.|$|E
500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: [...] "Signor Mortara, I am sorry to inform <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{the victim of a}} betrayal", and explained that they were under orders from Father Feletti to take Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E

500|$|Under a cloud for {{suspected}} disloyalty and treason, Stone {{was arrested}} {{just after midnight}} on February 8, 1862, on orders of Maj. Gen. McClellan, who was acting under orders from Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, dated January 28. Awaiting Stone {{near his home in}} Washington were 18 soldiers led by Brig. Gen. George Sykes. When Stone approached, Sykes stated [...] "I have now the most disagreeable duty to perform that I ever hadit is to arrest you." [...] When Stone angrily asked why, Sykes said [...] "I don't know. It's by order of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, general-in-chief of the army... I may as well tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to be sent to Fort Lafayette."

2500|$|While Smith {{still held}} to typical white South African {{views of the}} time, the seeds for his later change of {{position}} were planted in the 1960s and '70s. [...] Smith credited Swiss theologian Karl Barth for helping him eventually decide to fight apartheid. [...] In 1963, Barth {{asked him if he}} was really free to preach the Gospel in South Africa. [...] Barth asked him the question three times, concluding with [...] "Will you be free to preach the Gospel even if the government in your country tells <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> preaching against the whole system?" [...] Smith found that [...] "I could not really answer the question truthfully. I thought I was free, and yet I was not sure." [...] Smith later said that he realized he [...] "would have to decide to teach my theology but not apply it, or apply it and take the consequences." ...|$|E
2500|$|The verdict by Maurice Willson Disher in The Times Literary Supplement of 14 June 1941 was positive: [...] "To {{maintain}} {{a place at}} the head of detective-writers would be difficult enough without the ever increasing rivalry. Even Miss Christie cannot stay there unchallenged though she has a following which will swear her books are best without reading the others. Unbiased opinion may have given the verdict against her last season when new arrivals set a very hot pace; but Evil Under the Sun will take a lot of beating now". After summarising the plot, the Mr. Disher concluded: [...] "Miss Christie casts the shadow of guilt upon first one and then another with such casual ease that it is difficult for the reader not to be led by the nose. Everybody is well aware that any character most strongly indicated is not a likely criminal; yet this guiding principle is forgotten when Miss Christie persuades <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> more discerning than you really are. Then she springs her secret like a land-mine." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{founding}} {{leader of}} the group, David Chemla was born in Tunisia and raised in France. He was a former IDF officer {{who served in the}} Yom Kippur War in the Paratroopers Brigade. He left for France in 1977 after 10 years in Israel. He is chairman of Peace Now in France. He said the group seeks to support Israel's long-term future because [...] "as friends, as Jews, we want to tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going down a wrong path. I think our initiative is actually helping Israel's image in Europe. It is a pretty low image over here these days, because of what happened in Gaza, mainly, and it is commonly believed in Europe that Israel is the provocative, negative side of the conflict—the one that is blocking the peace process." [...] He claimed that [...] "We’re not saying that only Israel is responsible for the problem. As Jews tied to Israel, we speak to the Israelis. So this is a call to the Israelis, but of course [...] have a lot of the responsibility for the continuation of the conflict." [...] He affirmed, on behalf of the membership that [...] "our connection to the state of Israel is part of our identity," [...] but in Europe [...] "Israel is seen as responsible for all the problems [...]" [...] Chemla added that the group's was not a movement as such after the first petition but hoped to become one.|$|E
2500|$|Eugene {{crossed the}} Alps with some 30,000 men in May/June 1701. After {{a series of}} {{brilliant}} manoeuvres the Imperial commander defeated Catinat at the Battle of Carpi on 9 July. [...] "I have warned <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> dealing with an enterprising young prince," [...] wrote Louis XIV to his commander, [...] "he does not tie himself down {{to the rules of}} war." [...] On 1 September Eugene defeated Catinat's successor, Marshal Villeroi, at the Battle of Chiari, in a clash as destructive as any in the Italian theatre. But as so often throughout his career the Prince faced war on two fronts—the enemy in the field and the government in Vienna. Starved of supplies, money and men, Eugene was forced into unconventional means against the vastly superior enemy. During a daring raid on Cremona on the night of 31 January/1 February 1702 Eugene captured the French commander-in-chief. Yet the coup was less successful than hoped: Cremona remained in French hands, and the Duke of Vendôme, whose talents far exceeded Villeroi's, became the theatre's new commander. Villeroi's capture caused a sensation in Europe, and had a galvanising effect on English public opinion. [...] "The surprise at Cremona," [...] wrote the diarist John Evelyn, [...] "… was the greate discourse of this weeke"; but appeals for succour from Vienna remained unheeded, forcing Eugene to seek battle and gain a 'lucky hitt'. The resulting Battle of Luzzara on 15 August proved inconclusive. Although Eugene's forces inflicted double the number of casualties on the French the battle settled little except to deter Vendôme trying an all-out assault on Imperial forces that year, enabling Eugene to hold on south of the Alps. With his army rotting away, and personally grieving for his long standing friend Prince Commercy who had died at Luzzara, Eugene returned to Vienna in January 1703.|$|E
