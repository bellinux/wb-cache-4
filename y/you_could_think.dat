500|$|On September 30, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was {{scheduled}} to perform, and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met. Clapton later commented: [...] "He {{asked if he could}} play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', but I had a funny feeling about him." [...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it... He walked off, and my life was never the same again".|$|E
500|$|Biko never {{addressed}} {{questions of}} gender and sexism in his politics. The sexism was evident in many ways, according to Mamphela Ramphele, a BCM activist and doctor at the Zanempilo Clinic, including that women tended to be given responsibility for the cleaning and catering at functions. [...] "There was no way <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of Steve making {{a cup of tea}} or whatever for himself", another activist said. Feminism was viewed as irrelevant [...] "bra-burning". Surrounded by women who cared about him, Biko developed a reputation as a womaniser, something that Woods described as [...] "well earned". He displayed no racial prejudice, sleeping with both black and white women. At NUSAS, he and his friends competed to see who could have sex with the most female delegates. Responding to this behaviour, the NUSAS general secretary Sheila Lapinsky accused Biko of sexism, to which he responded: [...] "Don't worry about my sexism. What about your white racist friends in NUSAS?" [...] Sobukwe also admonished Biko for his womanising, believing that it set a bad example to other activists.|$|E
2500|$|Colin Meloy of the Decemberists, who {{recorded}} a 2005 EP of Morrissey covers titled Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey, acknowledged Morrissey's influence on his songwriting: [...] "You could either bask in that glow of fatalistic narcissism, or <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> it was funny. I {{always thought that}} was an interesting dynamic in his songwriting, and I can only aspire {{to have that kind}} of dynamic in my songs". Brandon Flowers of the American rock band The Killers has revealed his admiration for Morrissey on several occasions and admits that his interest for writing songs about murder such as [...] "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine" [...] and [...] "Midnight Show" [...] traces back to Morrissey singing about loving [...] "the romance of crime" [...] in the song [...] "Sister I'm a Poet". Flowers was quoted as saying, [...] "I studied that line a lot. And it's kind of embedded in me". Noel Gallagher called Morrissey [...] "the best lyricist I've ever heard".|$|E

2500|$|In November 2016, Feige {{confirmed}} that Keaton would play the Vulture, the Adrian Toomes {{incarnation of the}} character, while Woodbine was revealed as Herman Schultz / Shocker. In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing reshoots, and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video. Watts was inspired by The President's Fitness Challenge for this, feeling that Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other public service announcements (PSA) starring Captain America, [...] "about just everything, [...] brushing your teeth. Just anything <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, we had poor Captain America do it." [...] Watts said {{that many of the}} additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film. Watts {{confirmed that}} the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is Damage Control, which Watts felt [...] "just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell" [...] and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use [...] "to drive the story".|$|E

You {{never think of}} {{anything}} but your own selfishness. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> to {{come all the way}} over here from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That Hurry Harry {{should talk}} in this-a-way, is nat'ral, and {{according}} to the gifts of the man. He knows no better, and, therefore, he is little likely to feel or to act any better; but, Judith, I put it to your heart and conscience--would <b>you,</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of me as favorably, as I hope and believe you now do, was I to forget my furlough and not go back to the camp?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Thank you, Markham,' said Guy, {{after an}} effort; 'I cannot {{tell you about}} it. I will only set you at rest by saying it is nothing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> I {{ought to be ashamed}} of.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thinking!' he cried. 'You, you! Do {{you imagine}} I chose you out because <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>think?</b> Let me hear of your doing {{such a thing}} again! You, the one man--but, there! You {{meet me at the}} {{fir-tree}} at ten o'clock.' ...|$|E

60|$|L. Yes; but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think,</b> Egypt, what {{a strange}} feeling of utter {{loneliness}} {{came over me}} when {{the presence of the}} two gods passed away.

6000|$|... "I know it {{must seem}} to take {{something}} for granted which I've no right to take for granted. I don't believe <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> that I cared for anything but you, or at all for what Mrs. Lander has done for you." ...|$|E
