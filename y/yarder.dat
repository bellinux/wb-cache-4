40|$|Processor tower <b>yarders</b> (PTY) {{represent}} {{the current state}} of yarding technology being extensively used in mountainous conditions such as those from Central Europe where they were also developed and used for the first time. In proper technical conditions which are mostly related to forest road infrastructure such equipment may be introduced by technology transfer in other countries such as Romania where they could replace actual less-efficient forest equipment used in steep terrains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of such equipment in conditions of thinning operations by adapting a time study to the general concepts and by using data collection techniques to suit the operational conditions imposed by such equipment. In conditions of a mean tree volume of 0. 21 m 3  × tree- 1, the results of our study indicate net production rates as high as  12. 72 m 3 × h- 1 when processing trees on landing, which could be also improved up to 17. 52 m 3 × h- 1 if the PTY have been be adequately installed on the forest road. Another key aspect which could improve the efficiency of such equipment performing landing operations is the number of planned and realized wood assortments since the time expenditure was affected by their number. Given the reduced impact on forest soils as well as the increased efficiency of tower <b>yarders,</b> our study concludes that there would be a lot of potential in actually using them in the Romanian forests located in steep terrain, if proper transportation infrastructure would exist. </p...|$|R

The equations provide reasonable approximations of delay-free hourly production for several cable <b>yarders</b> operating skyline thinnings {{under a variety of}} conditions. The equations have been limited to three independent variables which can be influenced by management decisions. The independent variables are relatively easy to obtain and include: cut volume per acre, average slope yarding distance, and average log volume. The production equations which were linearly regressed for user simplicity have an inherent source of error since some of the data is nonlinear. A log bucking model is presented which aids in the determination of average log volume. Suggestions for future transformations are offered...|$|R

40|$|This project {{considers}} {{the conditions under}} which it might be beneficial to use terrain-going cable-yarders as opposed to building forest roads and yarding the timber directly to roadside. Yarding in the terrain implies that the timber still needs to be forwarded to roadside. However, the relatively low productivity rates achievable with cable <b>yarders</b> increases the cost of forwarding due to long waiting times when distances are short. These systems are found to be a competitive option when small volumes must be harvested far from a forest road, when there are other considerations to be taken account of in avoiding road construction, or in playing an important role in connection with catastrophes such as widespread wind-fall where road construction cannot be carried out in time to extract the timber...|$|R
5000|$|The early <b>yarders</b> were steam powered. They {{traveled}} on railroads, known as [...] "dummylines" [...] and the felled trees were dragged or [...] "skidded" [...] to the railroad {{where they were}} later loaded onto rail cars. Popular brands were: Willamette, Skagit, Washington, Tyee, or Lidgerwood and Clyde built by Clyde Ironworks in Duluth, Minnesota. Although these machines appear to be large and cumbersome, they were true workhorses of their day. The Clyde was capable of retrieving logs from four different points at the same time. Each cable, or lead, was approximately 1000 feet in length. Once the logs were attached and a clearance signal was sent for retrieval, they could be skidded at a speed of 1000 feet per minute (1MPH = 88 fpm = 26.8 meter per minute) this is around 10 mph. Working conditions around these machines were very dangerous.|$|R
