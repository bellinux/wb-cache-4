[...] Kim Alessi from Common Sense Media considered the music video for [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] worth seeing for its caricature of contemporary Asian and American urban lifestyles, but also warned that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] contains sexually suggestive images and [...] "degrading messages" [...] which could be inappropriate for children and teenagers.|$|E

In addition, Kaiser commented on Veronica and Logan's relationship. [...] "I'm not entirely sold on the relationship, either from a character point of view or a quality point of view.

The publication praised the new Logan-Veronica dynamic and said [...] "The few episodes just before this one showed the softer, vulnerable side of Logan and just when <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he's really so bad, he saves the day and an innocent peck turned into a passionate embrace." ...|$|E

Subhra Gupta gave the film a half-star out of five in The Indian Express, saying [...] "After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> there's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick. Or are we heading for a third-time-in-Mumbai-Tibara?" [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 out of five stars, describing the film as the [...] "equivalent of getting a root canal". He criticised the naivety of the three leads: Kumar for his [...] "in-your-face flamboyance", Khan for playing an [...] "urban rich kid slumming it out at a dress-up party" [...] and both for [...] "rat-a-tat punch lines", but praised Sonali Bendre's cameo as Mumtaz. Mohar Basu gave the film two out of five stars in Koimoi, criticising the melodrama and the [...] "lacklustre chemistry", remarking that the film [...] "lacks the effervescence and naturalness of its prequel".|$|E

500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's an interesting thing. I had a really good time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager. He is remembered for helping bring about [...] "The Oriole Way", Baltimore's {{tradition}} of excellence. The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport and {{the skills needed to}} play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who kept in touch with Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was because you could learn from him, no matter how long you had been in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, only a little more than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days. Yet Ripken's example makes <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the century, not Senior, has lost its way."

500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy called Doctor Strange [...] "an engaging, smartly {{cast and}} {{sporadically}} eye-popping addition" [...] to the franchise, adding [...] "this action movie ostensibly {{rooted in the}} mind-expanding tenets of Eastern mysticism is different enough to establish a solid niche alongside the blockbuster combine's established money machines." [...] McCarthy, in addition to praising the acting, felt that there were certain sequences that [...] "go far beyond [...] in visual spectacle" [...] and that the time manipulation sequences, [...] "seen to outstanding advantage in 3D, [...] mind-trip-seeking audiences back in Doctor Strange's origin days would have called 'far-out' but today's fans will simply deem 'amazing'." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety called the film [...] "Marvel’s most satisfying entry since Spider-Man 2," [...] and wrote that despite having [...] "the same look, feel, and fancy corporate sheen" [...] as the other MCU films, it [...] "boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from the increasingly cookie-cutter comic-book realm of late." [...] Debruge also praised the casting along with the multitude of visual effects the film was able to achieve. Alonso Duralde, reviewing for TheWrap said, [...] "True, Doctor Strange is an origin story, and occasionally hemmed in by the genre's narrative requirements, but it's smart enough to bring in great British actors to make the predictable paces and life lessons feel fresh and fascinating." [...] Regarding the film's visuals, Duralde praised them, exclaiming, [...] "In a year where bloated, empty spectacles have induced a crushing level of CG fatigue, this funny, freaky adventure reminds us of how effective VFX can be when they've got some imagination behind them." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "The giddily enjoyable Doctor Strange... is part of Marvel's strategy for world domination, yet it's also so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Within the familiar narrative contours of the origin story, writer-director Scott Derrickson crams in enough out-of-body experiences, spatial-temporal shenanigans and dazzlingly kaleidoscopic visuals to make <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he and his co-writers ... were dropping acid behind the scenes." ...|$|E

[...] Additionally, Marshall Fine of USA Today, found the film to be [...] "Fascinating, visionary filmmaking."

2500|$|In 2005, Deol {{starred in}} Vikram Bhatt's thriller Jurm as the wealthy {{businessman}} Avinash Malhotra who suspects his wife Sanjana (Lara Dutt) {{of having an}} affair with Rohit (Milind Soman). Deol's performance was praised by a number of critics, with Vivek Fernandes of Rediff.com remarking, [...] "Bobby Deol, Bhatt's schoolmate, does his alma mater proud with his controlled performance. There's a sense of maturity about his candour, which is good news." [...] Deol then starred alongside Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty and Ajay Devgan in Mani Shankar's war movie Tango Charlie as an Indian trooper named Tarun Chauhan of the 101st BSF Battalion, operating in the northeastern Indian province fighting Bodo militants in Upper Assam. He followed this role by featuring in Suneel Darshan's romance film Barsaat as the ambitious young Indian Arav, who, in living in the United States, becomes involved in a love triangle with beauties Priyanka Chopra and Bipasha Basu. The film was not a critical success, with Ziya us Salaam of The Hindu concluding, [...] "A moth-eaten love triangle with all the stereotypes Bollywood survives on – a devoted wife with her karva chauth ki thali, the other woman with her mini-skirts, a joint family, songs, festivities..... No shower of rejuvenation, this [...] "Barsaat" [...] is just drenched in mediocrity." [...] She was equally unimpressed with Deol's performance, remarking, [...] "The girls are ready with their curls and curves, the guy just appears lost, making <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> Bobby has grown even an inch as an actor since he made his debut in Rajkumar Santoshi's film by the same name." [...] His final role of 2005 was as Karan in , opposite Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta, Kareena Kapoor, and Juhi Chawla. He once again plays a wealthy businessman but is down on his luck with his finances and romancing women. The film, although performing below average in India was a major success in the United Kingdom, where it became the highest grosser of Bollywood in 2005, grossing around £888,000.|$|E
