25|$|There {{is also a}} trail {{referred}} to as the Dutcher Step Trail that traverses the private property of the Winnisook Club. Anyone attempting to hike this trail should seek permission from the club first. The trail has some interesting views that the main trail does not. The club seems willing to allow hikers on a limited basis as long as you leave the trail as <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> and sign a release first.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E

6000|$|Lady Merrifield laughed. 'The {{girls are}} very good about it!' she said. 'Now <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> out, see whether that note will make Miss Hacket swallow it.' ...|$|R

5000|$|He once said: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>found</b> my corpse,throw <b>it</b> over mines...maybe {{at least}} my corpse helps Islamic government." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} it if you go far enough; and be sure you {{go as far as}} Sonoma Valley and our ranch. Then, if <b>you</b> haven't <b>found</b> <b>it</b> yet, we'll see what we can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Douglas Guest," [...] he said. [...] "Well, {{we shall}} {{know who he}} was, at any rate. It's lucky <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>it,</b> sir. Now we'll get on, if you please." ...|$|E
