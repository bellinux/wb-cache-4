In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Receptacle For the Respectable" [...] {{reflects}} the eclecticism {{of the album}} as it [...] "undergoes a complete personality change" [...] {{over the course of}} its four-minute thirty-two-second duration, veering from prog rock to death metal. The song begins as an acoustic guitar-driven pop song and then shifts into a slower bridge section which leads to an even slower coda which has been compared to the music of Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys' Smiley Smile album and features Paul McCartney chewing carrots and celery to the beat. The track ends with a [...] "pantomime death metal" [...] section with Rhys's [...] "distorted, bellowed vocals" [...] screaming the title phrase. According to Cian Ciaran, the song initially comprised just the first two parts when recorded at Monnow Valley Studios but, by the time the group relocated to Bearsville Studios, Rhys had written and added the third section. While there the band added the fourth section by [...] "pissing about with Pro Tools", looping the bass {{from the end of the}} third section [...] "by accident" [...] to create the musical backing. A fifth, hip hop, section was discussed but the band decided against it, reasoning that [...] "if you're going to do a fifth bit, you'd probably do a sixth, and before <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, you're doing a concept album made up of nothing but bits!". According to the band, the track is the only time on the album where they tried to achieve comedy and [...] "completely went with [...] silly streak".|$|E
