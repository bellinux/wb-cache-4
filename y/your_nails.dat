IndiaGlitz gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "The biggest strength of Drushyam is not its genre, but the fact that an excellent screenplay has been written around too less characters for a movie of this genre and without sub plots and the like", and added that [...] "Drushyam is edge-of-the-seat, but it doesn't demand the audience to connect the threads. An unconventional film, this film is refreshing as it is not formulaic".|$|E

[...] She had another pause, holding the while the thread of that larger {{perception}} into which her view of Mrs. Verver's obligation to Maggie had suddenly expanded. [...] "even if her debt was not to the others--even then {{it ought to be}} quite sufficiently to the Prince himself to keep her straight. For what, really, did the Prince do," [...] she asked herself, [...] "but generously trust her? What did he do but take it from her that if she felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong? That creates for her, upon my word," [...] Mrs. Assingham pursued, [...] "a duty of considering him, of honourably repaying his trust, which --well, which she'll be really a fiend if she doesn't make the law of her conduct. I mean of course his trust that she wouldn't interfere with him--expressed by his holding himself quiet at the critical time." ...|$|R

40|$|If {{one or more}} of <b>your</b> toe <b>nails</b> is {{discolored}} (yellow or brown), thickened, {{and difficult}} to trim, you may have a fungal infection. A less common type of infection turns the nail white, soft, and flaky.

The dark, moist conditions underneath a nail promote the growth of fungi. Nail fungus is very common, found in up to 5 % of the general population and almost half of people over age 70...|$|R

50|$|Pop-off Slip : {{is done by}} coating {{a section}} of the {{exterior}} of the piece with the slip taping off anywhere on the piece that you want to turn black after reduction. Then you place the piece directly into the kiln and slowly heat up to about 500 degrees Fahrenheit until the slip has dried. Once dry continue heating until 1400 degrees Fahrenheit. When you reach temperature you can pull the piece from the kiln and place the piece into the reduction chamber. In reduction the carbon will soak into the clay where the slip has cracked and turn black, but where the slip is stuck on the clay will keep its natural color.
