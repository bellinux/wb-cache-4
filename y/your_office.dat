500|$|When {{the song}} was first {{released}} as a single in 1994, no remixes were commissioned except for the instrumental version; [...] however, this version was not released on the single that year. Carey re-released the song commercially in Japan in 2000, with a new remix known as the So So Def remix.

The remix appears on Carey's compilation album Greatest Hits (2001) as a bonus track. In 2009, a remix produced by Carey and Low Sunday, called [...] "Mariah's New Dance Mix", was released. The mix laid the original 1994 vocals over new electronic instrumentation. The remix garnered a positive response. MTV's Kyle Anderson wrote that [...] "it's difficult to improve perfection," [...] but that the remix [...] "does dress up the song in a disco thump that should make <b>your</b> <b>office</b> Christmas party 28 percent funkier than it was last year." [...] Idolator's Becky Bain praised the song's catchiness.|$|E

2500|$|On March 7, 2007, Rosselló {{stated that}} he was no longer {{interested}} in the Senate Presidency and then focused his attention in preventing Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño from winning the March 2008 gubernatorial primary, and allowed his name to be placed in nomination for the party's gubernatorial primary. McClintock and four other senators won in San Juan Superior Court a suit to nullify the sanctions and expulsions that the party leadership has levied against them. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court confirmed the lower court decision by a 5-to-1 vote. As a result, McClintock and his supporters were recognized as NPP members and free to run under the party banner. [...] Shortly after the primary polls closed on March 9, 2008, Pedro Rosselló conceded the victory to Luis Fortuño after a large margin of votes in favor of his opponent in the NPP party primaries for the presidency of the party and gubernatorial nomination. Rosselló admitted defeat even before the votes were completely tallied claiming Fortuño as the next candidate of the PNP party. In Rosselló's conceding speech he said [...] "Luis Fortuño has been selected by the people to be the new president of this party and the candidate for governor. I always say the people speak and I obey, Fortuño here is your party and here is <b>your</b> <b>office</b> (signaling the party's official headquarters). Now it's up to you, the loyal members of this party, {{to make sure that this}} new leadership works for statehood for Puerto Rico". After this conceding speech it was rumored and even announced at Fortuño's headquarters that the former Governor would arrive there along with his loyal supporter and mayor of the capital city of San Juan, Jorge Santini, but after Fortuño's followers waited for hours to see their leaders united neither Rosselló or Santini arrived. After the primary was over it was heavily rumored by many that Rosselló would not be campaigning for Fortuño and that he'd resign as senator to go back to his home in Virginia. On March 10, 2008, Rosselló sent the media a written statement regarding his future in which he confirmed he will be retiring from active politics and will not be campaigning for any candidate, however he would finish his term as senator for the Arecibo District, which he did.|$|E

Generally, identity fraud involves "stealing" another person's personal identifying information, e. g., Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and mother's maiden name. Criminals use such information to fraudulently establish credit, run up debt, or to take over existing financial accounts. The methods used to obtain personal identifying information can range from basic street theft to sophisticated, organized crime schemes involving the use of computerized databases or the bribing of employees with access to personal information on customer or personnel records. As agreed with <b>your</b> <b>offices,</b> this document provides information on (1) law enforcement's responsibilities for investigating identity fraud and the difficulties in tracking such crime; (2) statistics or other data showing the prevalence of identity fraud; (3) the costs of identity fraud; an...|$|R
