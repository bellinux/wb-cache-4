5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were {{becoming}} more common as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record breaking of the following <b>year</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower.

5|$|Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 {{until he}} {{suffered}} a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged {{him to become a}} bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior <b>year</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.|$|E
5|$|The Australian New South Wales colonial team {{became the}} first {{overseas}} rugby side to tour New Zealand in 1882 and played seven matches throughout the country. By this point Warbrick was back in Auckland, but this time playing for the North Shore club, and he again won selection for the provincial side. He appeared in both of Auckland's matches against the New South Welshmen: 7–0 and 18–4 victories over the tourists. Warwick remained in Auckland the following <b>year</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> toured with the province again, playing in away matches against Wellington, Canterbury and Otago.|$|E
50|$|At the {{election}} of 1857 Sir William, who had meantime been defeated at Harwich, was again returned at Barnstaple. He was, however, defeated in 1859, but was elected in 1863 at Ludlow. This seat he held for only two <b>years,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was again defeated and did not re-enter parliament until 1874, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was returned for Kidderminster, a constituency he represented for six <b>years,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> retired. He was a familiar figure at the Carlton Club, always ready with a copious collection of anecdotes of Wellington, Benjamin Disraeli and Napoleon III.|$|R

5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox. It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that <b>year</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Astle {{made his}} Test debut against Zimbabwe in 1996, {{a year after}} he started playing {{international}} cricket. Later that <b>year,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was picked up for the West Indies tour where he scored back-to-back hundreds. His highest score was recorded against England at the Jade Stadium, Christchurch in 2002 when he made 222 from 168 balls. In {{the course of the}} innings, he set two records—fastest double-century scored in Test cricket, and the second-highest individual score in the fourth innings of a Test match. As of August 2015, he has the most centuries for New Zealand in international cricket. Astle played four Twenty20 International matches between 2005 and 2006, without recording a century. His highest score in the format was 40 not out.|$|E

5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next <b>year</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{his senior}} year, many scouts had Croyle ranked {{as high as}} the #2 quarterback in the country behind Joe Mauer, who would go on to play Major League Baseball. However, Croyle's high school career ended {{abruptly}} in the first game of his senior season against Glencoe High School after a hit by an opposing player tore Croyle's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), causing him to miss the remainder of his senior <b>year.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> graduated, he held the Alabama state records for career passing yards with 9,323, and career touchdowns with 105. He set marks for most passing yards in a single season, passing yards in a single game, touchdown passes in a season, and touchdown passes in a game.|$|E
5|$|He {{published}} for {{the first}} time under his own name in 1829. Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same <b>year</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode. He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.|$|E
