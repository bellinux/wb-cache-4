Our aim is to relate the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of these mixtures to the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the suspending cement paste, to the time passed at rest, and to the coarse particle volume fraction. We present here procedures that allow for (i) studying a homogeneous and isotropic suspension, (ii) comparing the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of a given cement paste {{to that of the}} same cement paste added with particles, and (iii) accounting for the thixotropy of the cement paste. We observe that the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of these suspensions of cement paste with coarse particles follows the very simple Chateau-Ovarlez-Trung model {[}X. Chateau, G. Ovarlez. K. L.

This consistency between the results obtained in various <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> fluids shows that the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the suspension does not depend on the physicochemical properties of the suspending <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> fluid; it only depends on its <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> value.

Moreover, we show that the thixotropic structuration rate of the interstitial paste (its static <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> increase rate in time) is not affected by the presence of the particles. As a consequence, it is sufficient to measure the thixotropic properties of the constitutive cement paste in order to predict the thixotropic structuration rate of a given fresh concrete.

The compressive <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> of the consolidated sediment beds from settled and centrifuged flocs were determined using the volume fraction profile method.

The compressive <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> of sediment beds fromflocs induced by the 10 % charged polymer were observed to increase with an increase in polymer dose, initial solids concentration, and background electrolyte concentration at all volume fraction. In comparison, polymer dose has marginal effect on the compressive <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> of sediment beds from flocs induced by 40 % and 100 % charged polymers. Initial solids concentration has no influence on the compressive <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> of sediment beds from flocs induced by either 40 % or 100 % charged polymers at the polymer doses used. The compressive <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> of sediments from flocs induced by the 40 % charged polymer are independent of salt concentration whereas the addition of salt decreases the compressive <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> of sediments from flocs induced by the 100 % charged polymer.

When flocculated at the optimum dose for each polymer (12 mg/g silica for the 10 % charged polymer at 0. 03 M NaCl, 12 mg/g for 40 % and 2 mg/g for 100 %), compressive yield stress increases as polymer charge increases.

The counterions investigated were Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, and Cs⁺, while the co-ion was always Cl⁻. The poorly hydrated ions (Cs⁺ and K⁺) adsorb in greater quantity to the silica surface than the well-hydrated ions (Li⁺ and Na⁺) and produce lower magnitude negative zeta potentials at high pH. At high electrolyte concentrations and at low pH the poorly hydrated counterions adsorb in great enough quantity to reverse the sign of the zeta potential from negative to positive. This specific adsorption of counterions shifts the iep to higher values. The shift in the iep {{is directly related to the}} hydration of the counterion with the least hydrated ions creating the greatest iep shift. The <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> of silica suspensions at high pH were found to increase in the order Li⁺<Na⁺<K⁺<Cs⁺.
