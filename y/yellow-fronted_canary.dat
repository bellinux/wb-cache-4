5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary</b> (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary</b> [...] (Crithagra mozambica), {{also called}} Yellow-eyed Canary, {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the finch family. It is known elsewhere and in aviculture as the green singing finch.The <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary</b> was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split {{and a number of}} species including the <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary</b> were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra Swainson 1827.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary</b> is a common, gregarious seedeater. Its song is a warbled zee-zeree-chereeo.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of bird species around the lake. These include African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer), {{malachite}} kingfishers (Alcedo cristata), pied kingfishers (Ceryle rudis), swamp flycatchers (Muscicapa aquatica), village weavers (Ploceus cucullatus), [...] speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus), black-lored (Turdoides melanops) and arrow-marked (T. jardineii) babblers, African paradise-flycatchers (Terpsiphone viridis), scarlet-chested (Nectarinia senegalensis), bronze (N. kilimensis) and green-headed (N. verticalis) sunbirds, <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canaries</b> (Serinus mozambicus), green-winged pytilias (Pytilia melba), great (Phalacrocorax carbo) and white-breasted (P. lucidus) cormorants, openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus) and yellow-billed (Mycteria ibis) storks and cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis). There is also a pair of semi-domesticated grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum) at the Jambo Beach resort in Gahini.|$|R
50|$|The Cape siskin’s call is a voyp-veeyr, {{often given}} in flight. {{and the song}} is a weak, {{pleasant}} warble similar to the <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{brimstone}} canary can {{be confused with}} the <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary,</b> but that species is smaller billed with a much more defined head pattern and a bright yellow rump.|$|E
50|$|The Drakensberg siskin’s call is a schwee, {{often given}} in flight. and the song, {{like that of}} Cape siskin, is a weak, {{pleasant}} warble similar to the <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} easily {{distinguished}} from the <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary</b> by its lack of black facial markings, and its bill is less heavy than that of other similar African Crithagra species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary</b> is 11-13 cm in length. The {{adult male}} has a green back and brown wings and tail. The underparts and rump are yellow, {{and the head}} is yellow with a grey crown and nape, and black malar stripe. The female is similar, but with a weaker head pattern and duller underparts. Juveniles are greyer than the female, {{especially}} on the head.|$|E
50|$|These are Marmaronetta angustirostris (VU), Aythya nyroca (VU), Circus macrourus (NT), Falco naumanni (VU), Neotis nuba (Nubian bustard) (NT), Gallinago media (NT), Glareola nordmanni (NT), Acrocephalus paludicola (VU), Lagonosticta virata (NT), Prinia fluviatilis (DD), Ceratogymna elata (NT). The Inner Delta is also rich in heron species, {{particularly}} Bubulcus ibis and Casmerodius albus. Poicephalus senegalus (Senegal parrot), Serinus mozambicus (<b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary)</b> and Haliaeetus vocifer (African fish eagle) {{are some}} of the other species reported in Mali.|$|E
50|$|The Cape canary is 11-13 cm in length. The {{adult male}} has a green back with black edging to the wing {{feathers}} wings and tail. The underparts, rump and tail sides are yellow, {{and the lower}} belly is white. The rear head and neck are grey, and the face is cinnamon. The female is similar, but with a less grey on the head. The juvenile has greenish-yellow underparts with heavy brown streaking. This species is easily distinguished from the <b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary</b> by its lack of black face markings.|$|E

50|$|The faunal species {{reported}} are 163 {{species of}} vertebrates, 52 species of reptiles, 56 species of amphibians and 215 fish species. It is {{also reported that}} at high altitudes, endemicity is distinct in 17 species of mammals and 22 species of birds. Lake Tanganyika has 200 species of fish and {{an equal number of}} molluscs. A scientific exploration team of the University of Texas at El Paso found the Bururi long-fingered frog (Cardioglossa cyaneospila) (considered extinct for decades), in December 2011 in the Bururi Forest Nature Reserve, after it was last seen in 1949. Seven important species of fauna reported are Genetta piscivora (aquatic genet), Serinus mozambicus (<b>yellow-fronted</b> <b>canary),</b> Cercopithecus lhoesti (L'hoest's monkey), Agapornis fischeri (Fischer's lovebird), Galago moholi (South African galago), Hyperolius viridiflavus, and Hippopotamus amphibius (hippopotamus).|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. The objectives of this survey for lowland birds in Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park (HAVO) were to (1) document at least 90 % of bird species present, (2) estimate relative abundance and distribution of species, and (3) establish baseline information to use for future monitoring in the park. Results were derived from both area search and line transect methodologies. Counts were conducted on 25 days between 14 April and 14 July 2005. Our diversity index indicates that the HAVO lowland bird assemblage is relatively diverse and comprised of 25 species, including nine natives and 16 non-natives. We observed more than 80 % of the bird species expected to inhabit lowland areas of HAVO. Most species, including both native and non-natives, were relatively rare and were observed at only a few sites or transects. No federally listed endangered species were detected during our surveys. Extra search effort was given to detect the introduced Close-barred Francolin (Francolinus adspersus), but we conclude that the species, once found in the park, is no longer present. We documented the presence of two species new to HAVO, the Yellow-billed Cardinal (Paroaria capitata) and <b>Yellow-fronted</b> <b>Canary</b> (Serinus mozambicus). We make recommendations of sampling effort for future monitoring of the lowland bird community in HAVO. This project was carried out under a cooperative agreement (No. H 8080040012, task agreement No. J 8080040035) with the University of Hawaii at Manoa...|$|E
