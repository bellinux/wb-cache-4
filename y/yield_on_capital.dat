The question then is, how can the whole production of a product - from the factory gate to the final consumer - be organized so that it can sell to the final consumer at a price that the market will bear - and still make a good profit? Marx sometimes implies an [...] "economic production price" [...] when, for the sake of argument, he simply abstracts from everything that happens between the factory gate and the final consumer of a commodity.|$|E
40|$|Price/earnings {{ratio is}} the most popular and most {{widespread}} evaluation model used to assess relative capital asset value on financial markets. In functional terms, company earnings in the very long term can be described with high significance. Empirically, it is visible from long-term statistics that the demanded (required) <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> markets has certain regularity. Thus, investors first require a yield above the stable inflation rate and then a dividend yield and a capital increase caused by the growth of earnings that influence the price, with the assumption that the P/E ratio is stable. By combining the Gordon model for current dividend value, the model of market capitalization of earnings (price/earnings ratio) and bearing in mind the influence of the general price levels on company earnings, it is possible to adjust the price/earnings ratio by deriving a function of the required <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> markets measured by a market index through dividend yield and inflation rate above the stable inflation rate increased by profit growth. The S&P 500 index for example, has in the last 100 years grown by exactly the inflation rate above the stable inflation rate increased by profit growth. The comparison of two series of price/earnings ratios, a modelled one and an average 7 -year ratio, shows a notable correlation in the movement of two series of variables, with a three year deviation. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that three years of the expected inflation level, dividend yield and profit growth rate of the market index are discounted in the current market prices. The conclusion is that, at the present time, the relationship between the adjusted average price/earnings ratio and its effect on the market index on one hand and the modelled price/earnings ratio on the other can clearly show the expected dynamics and course in the following period...|$|E

40|$|Given {{the recent}} focus on Eurozone debt {{crisis and the}} credit rating {{downgrade}} not only of US debt, but that of other countries and many UK major banking institutions, this paper aims to explain the concept of bond yield, its different measures and bond pricing equation. <b>Yields</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> market instruments are rarely quoted on the same basis, which makes direct comparison between different as investment choices impossible. Some debt instruments are quoted on discount basis, whilst coupon-bearing ones accrue interest differently, offer different compounding opportunities, have different coupon payment frequencies, and manage non-business day maturity dates differently. Moreover, rules governing debt vary across countries, markets and currencies, making yield calculation and comparison a rather complex issue. Thus, some fundamental concepts applicable to debt instrument yield measurement, with focus on bond equation, are presented here. In addition, bond equation expressed in annuity form and used to apply Newton-Raphson algorithm to derive true bond yield is also shown...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} long-run impact of fiscal {{policies}} on inflation and capital formation. The analysis uses an expanded monetary growth {{model in which}} the government finances its deficit by issueing both money and interest-bearing debt. One major focus of the paper is the effect of a permanent increase in the government's rea ~ defic~t in a fully employed economy. The analysis shows that a greater deficit must increase inflation, reduce capital forma-tion, or both. With U. S. tax rules and the prevailing monetary and debt-management policies, a greater deficit is likely to cause both more inflation and lower capital intensity. The second purpose of the paper is to analyze the effect of an exogenous increase in the saving rate and the possibility of "excessive saving " that arises when the <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> becomes so low that individuals prefer to hold government bonds rather than the more risky claims to real capital. Under some such conditions, an increase in saving could cause unemployment. The analysis shows that this problem can be avoided however by reducing the tax on capital income (or, in some cases, by an increased deficit that absorbs some but not all of the higher savings rate). In short, by using fiscal incentives as well as monetary accomodation, an increased saving rate can be converted to greater capital intensity...|$|E
50|$|According to Marx, {{this was}} not simply a logical problem, a social {{accounting}} problem or theoretical problem, but a structural contradiction intrinsic to the capitalist mode of production, which had to be continually mediated. The fact that more or less value could be appropriated by investors from the labour-efforts of the workers employed, and thus that different labour efforts were unequally rewarded, was in his eyes central to the competitive process - in which the norms of labour effort continually clashed with the norms of profitability. On the surface, it looked to the individual observer as if profit <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> determine expenditures <b>on</b> labour, but in aggregate, it is - according to Marx - just the other way around, since the volume of labour-time worked determined how much profit could be distributed among producing capitalists, via the sales of their products. The mass of surplus labour performed in the sphere of production set a limit for the mass of surplus value that could be distributed as profit in the sphere of circulation.|$|R

40|$|This paper shows that, {{contrary}} to the suggestion of some investment advisors, for an individual Canadian investor subject to personal income taxation, the after-tax return on a discount bond is always higher (or, at worse, equal) to the return on an otherwise identical premium bond. This follows because the tax rate <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> gains {{is lower than the}} tax rate on coupon income in Canada. It is also shown that a decline in the capital gains tax rate raises the after-tax <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> discount bonds, but reduces the after-tax <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> premium bonds, and may even cause the <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> premium bonds to become negative. Further, a cut in the tax rate on interest income raises the after-tax <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> all bonds, but raises the <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> premium bonds relative to discount bonds. While the lower after-tax returns on higher coupon bonds might be expected to cause the pre-tax <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> these bonds to rise, no evidence of such tax capitalization is found using a large dataset of matched pairs of Government of Canada bonds for the period 1986 - 2006. The observed near equality of pre-tax yields since 1995 for otherwise equivalent bonds with different coupons implies that individuals in Canada earn a significantly smaller after-tax return from holding premium bonds than discount bonds. The empirical analysis suggests that the marginal investor in the bond market is an investor who pays the same rate of tax <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> gains and interest income, such as professional investors, financial institutions or pension funds, rather than an individual taxpayer...|$|R

40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of Alcell (R) lignin in iso-propanol/formic acid mixtures (1 : 1 mass ratio) was explored in a batch set-up using Ru/C as the catalyst (673 K, 4 h, 28 % mass lignin intake on solvent). Lignin oils were obtained in good yields (71 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) and shown {{to consist of}} a mixture of mainly aromatics (10. 5 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), alkylphenolics (6 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), catechols (8. 7 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), guaiacols (1. 3 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), and alkanes (5. 2 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), the remainder being soluble higher molecular weight compounds (GCxGC-FID and GPC). The results for the catalytic experiments using formic acid were {{compared with those of}} a non-catalysed experiment and a catalytic hydrotreatment with molecular hydrogen and Ru/C {{in the absence of a}} solvent. Distinct differences in product yields and compositions were observed, and highest lignin oil yields were obtained by catalytic solvolysis (71 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) versus 18 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input for noncatalytic solvolysis and 63 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input for catalytic hydrotreatment. The effect of reaction time <b>on</b> oil <b>yields</b> and product composition was established and a reaction network involving depolymerisation, and hydro(-deoxy) genation pathways is proposed to explain the product yields and composition. Besides iso-isopropanol, the use of ethanol and methanol in combination with formic acid was also explored for catalytic solvolysis. Best results were obtained in methanol (4 h, 673 K) leading to a lignin oil (68 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) containing 11 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input of alkylphenolics and 19 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input of aromatics.
