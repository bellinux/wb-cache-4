500|$|Jonny Greenwood {{described}} [...] "Scatterbrain (As Dead as Leaves)" [...] as [...] "very {{simple and}} sort of quite pretty, but there's something about the music for me, the chords for me, where it never quite resolves." [...] The NME described the album's final track, [...] "A Wolf at the Door (It Girl. Rag Doll.)" [...] as [...] "a pretty song, with a sinister monologue {{over the top of}} it"; Greenwood likened its lyrics to a Grimms' fairy tale. Yorke described the song's placement {{at the end of the}} album as [...] "sort of like waking <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the end... it's all been a nightmare and you need to go and get a glass of water now." ...|$|E
500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leapholes, Grippando's {{first novel}} for young adults, {{was also the}} first novel for young readers ever to be {{published}} by the American Bar Association. [...] That same year (2006), Grippando's first short story, Operation Northwoods, was published in an anthology (Thriller: Stories to Keep <b>you</b> <b>Up</b> <b>at</b> Night Thriller (book)) with other top thriller writers. [...] His first novella, The Penny Jumper, was published in 2016.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, lad, I'd {{rather go}} on, now I'm in harness. Thee't {{help me to}} carry it to Brox'on when it's done. I'll call <b>thee</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> sunrise. Go and eat thy supper, {{and shut the door}} so as I mayn't hear Mother's talk." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't think he'd take <b>you</b> <b>up</b> so <b>at</b> {{the first}} word," [...] said Mrs. Ray;--and {{then there was}} again silence for a few minutes.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{media outlets}} noted that Scissor Sisters [...] "stick {{out like a}} sore thumb" [...] {{on the list of}} artists who have sold over 2million copies of an album in the UK in the 21st century; the others being James Blunt, Robbie Williams, Keane, Dido, Coldplay and Norah Jones—artists {{considered}} [...] "mainstream" [...] compared to the Scissor Sisters' brash and controversial image. The band had been particularly keen on producing an album that fitted together well rather than simply producing a string of singles. According to Babydaddy, their purpose was [...] "to create a perfect pop rock album that would pick <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the beginning, take you on a journey in the middle, and set you right back down again in the same place at the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{staircase}} is {{just outside}} this door,' Swithin answered. 'I am at your lordship's service, and will show <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he grumbled, [...] "why {{they have}} shut us up together, or why Sotillo should have shut <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> all, since {{it seems to}} me you have been fairly chummy up there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is to do, Myles?" [...] {{said his}} friend, anxiously. [...] "What {{is all this}} talk I hear {{concerning}} <b>thee</b> <b>up</b> yonder <b>at</b> the armory?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The economists {{all think}} that if <b>you</b> show <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the cashier's cage with enough currency, God will put more oil in ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am, rather, but----" [...] Her hedging uncomfortable tone {{changed to}} a cry of distress. [...] "Milt! I must see <b>you.</b> Come <b>up</b> <b>at</b> four this afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|CAESAR (cheerfully). Then {{let them}} swing <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the same time; {{and if the}} chain breaks, you and the pigeons' eggs will perish together. (He goes to the chairs and looks up along it, {{examining}} it curiously.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There wasn't a {{word about}} any reward," [...] Inspector Jacks was told, [...] "until this morning. We had a {{telephone}} message from the chief's bedroom and phoned <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once. It's a pretty stiff amount, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Gar'ner," [...] {{interrupted}} the deacon, solemnly, [...] "this is trifling, {{and we must}} {{come to terms with}} this man, or write to Mr. Hazard to engage another in his place. Come ashore, sir; I have business with <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the house." ...|$|E
500|$|Interest in {{adapting}} Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed {{shortly after}} its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese {{was interested in}} filming the novel, but never optioned it. Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: [...] "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said {{to him when he}} got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat <b>you</b> <b>up</b> here <b>at</b> the airport, or shall I beat <b>you</b> <b>up</b> back <b>at</b> my apartment? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{down and}} tell what <b>you</b> did <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Squire's. Was he cross? Did {{you have to}} work hard? Do you like it?" [...] asked Bab, when the noise had subsided.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{says the}} other, [...] "and so <b>you</b> be <b>up</b> <b>at</b> last, and no great harm done, I'll be bound. And {{how does your}} head feel by now, my young master?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, John, {{friend of}} my youth," [...] he said, [...] "where have you been hiding all this time? I called <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> your office weeks ago, and an acid voice {{informed}} me that you were no longer there. Have you been fired?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{the great}} {{straight}} comely lubbers {{have it all}} their own way with the women," [...] said he bitterly. [...] "I remember how he rushed headlong at me with the horse-whip when I tripped <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Slype, and you have never forgiven that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enjoying? Keeping <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> dances {{till you}} drop asleep {{whenever}} you sit down? And then coming home {{and talking to}} a person who won't mention your name! Do you call that enjoying? I can't speak of you to any one; and no one speaks to me----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're about ninety {{miles from}} Brandon. The Brandon's a good paint," [...] said Lapham conscientiously. [...] "Like to show <b>you</b> round <b>up</b> <b>at</b> our place some odd time, {{if you get}} off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} come in and tell you how much I liked your speech last night, and how much I liked a speech <b>you</b> made <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Rock River, at the grange picinic." ...|$|R
6000|$|AUNT--[Pretending boredom but irritated.] Did the {{sociology}} <b>you</b> took <b>up</b> <b>at</b> college teach <b>you</b> that--to play the ghoul on every possible occasion, excavating old bones? Why not let your great-grandmother rest in her grave? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{you check}} your bag {{at the station}} because I wasn't quite sure where you'd stay. I'm dreadfully sorry we haven't room to put <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the flat. We ought to have seen about a room for you before. Don't you think you better call up the Willard or the Washington now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{shall be}} happy to take <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once, Miss Armstrong. Everything is tidy just at present, for I have had a message from Colonel Somerset {{that he and the}} General are coming round the wards. I don't suppose they will be here for half an hour, so you can come up at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You puzzle me," [...] she said, {{in a low}} tone. [...] "You had no {{taste for}} dissipation. You look as though life had {{scorched}} <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> some time or other. But how? where? You were found in Canada, I know, when your brother died. But you had only {{been there for a}} few years. Before then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|GIUSEPPE (piteously, as {{he places}} {{the light on}} the table). Excellency: what were <b>you</b> looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> just now--out there? (He points across his {{shoulder}} to the vineyard, but is afraid to look round.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} elder Mavering, rising and pulling down the rolling {{top of his}} desk, [...] "I'm glad to hear it, for your sake, Dan. Have <b>you</b> been <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the house yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The college {{talks about}} you still," [...] said Pen, {{who had a}} generous admiration for talent and pluck. [...] "The {{bargeman}} you thrashed, Bill Simes, don't you remember, wants <b>you</b> <b>up</b> again <b>at</b> Oxbridge. The Miss Notleys, the haberdashers----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not! You are {{a marked}} man everywhere. Every door is closed to you. I shall {{nominally}} stick to my post. You must {{be content to}} be the actual looker-on, though you had better not abandon your inquiries altogether. I will put <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Cercle Anglais. It will serve to pass the time, and you may gain information at the most unlikely places. And now good-bye." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the level}} voice of J. B. Midgeley, the steward. The {{stewards}} of the White Star Line, besides being the civillest and most obliging body {{of men in}} the world, all have soft and pleasant voices. A White Star steward, waking <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> six-thirty, to tell you that your bath is ready, when you wanted to sleep on till twelve, is the nearest human approach to the nightingale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Coulson, isn't it?" [...] {{the young}} man asked, {{accepting}} the other's outstretched hand. [...] "We are awfully sorry to disturb you, so soon after your arrival, too, {{but the fact is}} that this young lady, Miss Penelope Morse,"--Mr. Coulson bowed,--"was exceedingly anxious to make your acquaintance. You Americans are such birds of passage that she was afraid you might have moved on if she didn't look <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, there's {{just one}} chance. If that doesn't come off, I'm done. My pater said he'd {{give me a}} quid for every race I won at the sports. I got the half {{yesterday}} all right when <b>you</b> were <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Aldershot.' ...|$|R
