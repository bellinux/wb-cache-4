40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{we use the}} {{strategic}} profit model (SPM) and the economic value-added (EVA to measure shareholder value). SPM measures the return on net worth (RONW) which {{is defined as the}} return on assets (ROA) multiplied by the financial leverage. EVA is defined as the firm’s net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) minus the capital charge. Both, RONW and EVA provide an indication of how much shareholder value a firm creates for its shareholders, <b>year</b> <b>on</b> <b>year.</b> With the <b>increasing</b> focus <b>on</b> creation of shareholder value and core competen-cies, many companies are outsourcing their information technology (IT) related activities to third party software companies.

We use the SPM and EVA models to analyse the four listed players of the software industry using the publicly available published data. We compare the financial data obtained from the models, and use peer average data to provide customized recommendations for each company to improve their shareholder value. Assuming that the companies follow these rules, we also predict future RONW and EVA for the companies for the financial year 2005.

Since China has emerged as India’s largest trading partner and increased India’s dependence on its products, addressing the trade deficit is crucial to ensuring that the Sino-Indian relationship continues to prosper. A significant degree of planning and strategies that include such measures as advancing India’s domestic economy to make it competitive with Chinese imports, enabling policies to enhance Indian exports to China and addressing the constraints and non-tariff barriers that China places on Indian imports, are required. Although there have been some efforts and discussions by Indian authorities on the issue, these have not provided positive results and India, consequently, {{has not been able to}} find a long-term solution to the problem. In this context, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s agenda-based visit to China in May provides a major opportunity to recalibrate the imbalance. Key points 	India’s rising {{trade deficit with}} China is now close to US$ 40 billion and is likely to double to $ 60 billion in the next two years, leading to serious concerns over India’s ability to sustain it. 	The deficit is the result of China’s structural shift from a primary products base to a manufacturing regime. 	For the long-term benefit of the bilateral relationship, the trade imbalance must be addressed. This would include assessing India’s export opportunities and potential, addressing the non-tariff barriers that China imposes on Indian exports, encouraging foreign direct investment and addressing India’s structural challenges.

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} a {{significant}} <b>year</b> <b>on</b> <b>year</b> <b>increase</b> in the use of illicit drugs since the 1980 ’s. Consequently the rate of emergency admissions of people with physical complications of drug use to acute medical wards has increased. Negative attitudes held by health care staff towards illicit drugs users (McLaughlin et al, 2000) alongside repeated calls for education to better equip Adult registered nurses (Nkowane and Saxena, 2004) have largely gone unheard. This may ultimately contribute to inappropriate and ineffective care in non specialist secondary care settings. Aim: This study sought to examine the everyday experiences of nurses delivering and illicit drug users receiving care in medical wards to reveal the primacy of care. Method: A constructivist grounded theory approach was adopted for this study using the techniques and procedures described by Strauss and Corbin (1998). Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of nurses (n= 29) and illicit drug users (n= 12) in a Northern NHS Trust. Data collection and analysis was undertaken using constant comparison and data capture was directed by theoretical sampling. Results: Three categories and the core category that emerged from the data analysis will be presented. These were; knowledge to care, perceptions of distrust and detachment, and providing nursing care. Discussions: These are integrated to form the core category ‘dissonant care management of illicit drug users within medical wards’ which describes the paradoxes inherent in care delivery for a client group whose behaviour was perceived by nurse informants as complex, disruptive and challenging. Conclusion: This study reinforced the urgent need for education to enable RN’s working in non-specialist settings to deliver effective care. It also highlighted the necessity for a coherent approach for supporting illicit drug users in order to reduce/avoid readmission and capitalise on the opportunity to facilitate entry to rehabilitation...|$|E

In {{the world}} market of tourist {{services}} the extreme tourism is very popular, as {{it does not require}} the significant financial costs and enables <b>year</b> <b>on</b> <b>year</b> to <b>increase</b> the offers of holiday packages, associated with active travel. Ukraine has significant potential for the development of extreme kinds of rest, but it is not developed enough. Forms of extreme tourism are unknown for domestic tourists, and therefore, they formed a negative attitude. The aim of the article is the analysis of extreme resort potential of Ukraine and promotion of the development of extreme tourism destinations in the travel market. Theoretical and methodological basis of research is the system analysis of the problems of ensuring the competitiveness of the tourism industry, theoretical principles of economic science in the field of the effectiveness of extreme tourism and management of tourist flows. Methodology. The author offers the directions of tourist flows control, which differ from the current expansion of services to tourists in Ukraine. The development of extreme tourism with the help of co-operation of railways and sport federations was proposed. Findings. During the research the author proved that the implementation of the tasks will be promote: 1) increase in budget revenues {{at all levels of the}} inner extreme tourism; 2) raise the image of Ukraine and Ukrainian Railways; 3) increase the share of tourism and resorts in the gross domestic product to the level of developed countries; 4) bringing the number of employees in tourism and resorts to the level of developed countries; 5) the creation of an effective system of monitoring the quality of tourist services; 6) the creation of an attractive investment climate for attracting the investment in the broad development of tourism, engineering and transport and municipal infrastructure; 7) improvement the safety of tourists, ensure the effective protection of their rights and legitimate interests and preservation of the property. Originality. The author shows the theoretical generalization and new solution of a scientific problem. It manifests itself in the development of theoretical and methodological approaches to the development of extreme tourism. Practical value. Rational use of measures proposed by the author of directional control of tourist flows will significantly increase the country's revenues from domestic tourism. ...|$|R

The trends in obesity in Year 6 boys and girls continue to show <b>year</b> - <b>on</b> - <b>year</b> <b>increases</b> but the rates of increase are slowing down compared with data to 2013 / 14. Underweight prevalence has stabilised in Year 6 boys and girls and no longer shows a significant downward trend, {{though there is a}} significant small annual declining trend in underweight prevalence in Reception boys and girls. Analysis by Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile continues to show a widening inequality gap in the overweight, obese and excess weight categories for Reception boys and girls and Year 6 boys and girls. Obesity and excess weight prevalence in Black Caribbean Reception boys are now showing significant annual declines, as is overweight prevalence in White British Reception boys. The upward trend in obesity prevalence in Indian Year 6 boys has become significant. Significant increases in mean BMI z-score over time in obesity and excess weight among Year 6 boys and girls indicate that the children in these weight categories are on average getting heavier (given their height) over time. Obese children living in more deprived areas are on average heavier, given their height, than obese children in less deprived areas. Analysis of repeat measured cohorts shows that the 2006 / 7 to 2012 / 13 NCMP cohort exhibits a lower relative increase in obesity prevalence from Reception to Year 6 than the two later repeating cohorts(2007 / 8 to 2013 / 14 and 2008 / 9 to 2014 / 15).

However, data are equivocal and these findings remain inconclusive. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between FMS and habitual PA in primary school children, looking at the various correlates associated with FMS such as age, gender and weight status. Following ethics approval, parental informed consent and child assent, 264 children from years 1 - 6 in a West Midlands primary school volunteered for the study. Children underwent assessment of 7 FMS (sprint, side-gallop, hop, jump, catch, throw, balance) using established criteria (Booth et al. 1997). Data was recorded and video clips subsequently analysed (Quintic Software, Coventry) against NSW performance criteria (New South Wales Health, 2003) to determine percentage mastery of each FMS. Correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship between PA and FMS. A series of 2 (gender) by 6 (year group) by 2 (weight status) ANOVAs (Analysis of variance) were used to examine differences. If differences were found Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to allocate where these differences were PASW (version 17) was used for all analysis and alpha level was set a priori at P = 0. 05.

40|$|Traditionally seen as {{ambulance}} {{personnel who}} stabilise patients, and transport to Accident and Emergency (A&E), {{the introduction of}} state registered paramedics in 1999 (Collage of Paramedics, 2015) has developed a shift towards treating patients within their own surroundings, rather than A&E. Conversely this {{is more likely to}} happen with physical health (PH) as opposed to Mental Health (MH) and a disparity of esteem exists (Panday, 2016). With this disparity of treatment highlighted, the aim is to move away from this ‘scoop and run’ attitude that exists for MH patients and deliver a more patient centred and evidence based approach. The National Audit Office (2017) report a 5. 2 % <b>year</b> <b>on</b> <b>year</b> <b>increase</b> in MH patients to ambulance services, with a 4. 9 % increase on patients attending A&E. Training and care delivery to these patients should be appropriate to this increased need, therefore it is necessary to introduce changes to meet this increased demand. Nevertheless with MH services and funding being cut, training is not being delivered (Kings Fund, 2015), resulting in patients not having the appropriate assessment and treatment options that are set out by the Crisis Care Concordat (CCC, Department of Health, DOH, 2014). Working as a paramedic team leader based on an emergency ambulance in the North West of England, the author encounters MH patients regularly. This project will apply changes to the current methods of assessment by way of a more robust assessment tool, providing adequate MH assessment, allowing for further referral to Crisis Resolution Home Teams (CRHT). This will decrease the need for MH patients to be taken directly to A&E, where they potentially have long waits to access CRHT. 4 out of 139 hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK) currently meet the 4 hour standard of 95 % of MH patients seen within a 4 hours (Kings Fund, 2017). This change will not only provide better patient care for MH patients by bypassing A&E, but is also advantageous to paramedics as it could reduce {{the amount of time spent}} in A&E with patients. This time could be better utilised developing training needs, and applying the knowledge gained from this training to both PH and MH patients. The change will also ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting; using best available evidence based care, and treated within a timely manner, in line with the Bradley Report (DOH, 2005) of taking healthcare to the patient...|$|E

The level of methodological rigour across this body of work however is varied and outputs {{do not appear to}} have been developed or translated into clinical practice. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the latest guidelines, standards of care and current recommendations relative to people with chronic conditions to ascertain the level of supporting evidence concerning the management of foot health. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, SCOPUS and The Cochrane Library) for literature on recommendations for foot health management for people with chronic conditions was performed between 2000 and 2016 using predefined criteria. Data from the included publications was synthesised via template analysis, employing a thematic organisation and structure. The methodological quality of all included publications was appraised using the Appraisal for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. A more in-depth analysis was carried out that specifically considered the levels of evidence that underpinned the strength of their recommendations concerning management of foot health. Results The data collected revealed 166 publications in which the majority (102) were guidelines, standards of care or recommendations related to the treatment and management of diabetes. We noted a trend towards a systematic <b>year</b> <b>on</b> <b>year</b> <b>increase</b> in guidelines standards of care or recommendations related to the treatment and management of long term conditions other than diabetes over the past decade. The most common recommendation is for preventive care or assessments (e. g. vascular tests), followed by clinical interventions such as foot orthoses, foot ulcer care and foot health education. Methodological quality was spread across the range of AGREE II scores with 62 publications falling into the category of high quality (scores 6 – 7). The number of publications providing a recommendation {{in the context of a}} narrative but without an indication of the strength or quality of the underlying evidence was high (79 out of 166). Conclusions It is clear that evidence needs to be accelerated and in place to support the future of the Podiatry workforce. Whilst high level evidence for podiatry is currently low in quantity, the methodological quality is growing. Where levels of evidence have been given in in high quality guidelines, standards of care or recommendations, they also tend to be strong-moderate quality such that further strategically prioritised research, if performed, is likely to have an important impact in the field...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{influenza}} is a prevalent {{and highly}} contagious acute respiratory disease that, <b>year</b> <b>on</b> <b>year,</b> results in <b>increased</b> {{morbidity and mortality}} on a global scale. Because of the widespread and debilitating nature of the disease, annual influenza epidemics result in substantial workplace absenteeism, and the associated cost of lost productivity is a significant component of the substantial financial burden of the disease to society. The objective of this review was to identify studies that had attempted to quantify the impact of influenza upon otherwise healthy adults in terms of working days lost associated with an episode of influenza. Studies were included if they reported estimates of working days lost due to clinical, physician and/or self-diagnosis in adult patients or their dependants, or where this figure could be estimated from the data. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and the Cochrane Collaboration for articles published since 1995 in English, French or German. Of the 289 papers identified in the search, 28 (9. 7 %) met the inclusion criteria. The studies, involving study sites in North America, Western Europe, Asia and Australia, were categorized into three groups: (i) those reporting influenza diagnoses confirmed by laboratory testing, i. e. studies where influenza was the unambiguous cause of the working days lost (n_=_ 7 studies reported in ten publications); (ii) those where influenza was confirmed by a physician without an accompanying laboratory test (n_=_ 4 studies); and (iii) those where influenza was self-reported by study participants (n_=_ 14 studies). Qualitative reporting of results was performed {{because of the large}} degree of heterogeneity observed between studies, potentially complicating the interpretation of any meta-analysis. The results from studies involving a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis suggested that the mean number of working days lost ranged between 1. 5 and 4. 9 days per episode. Those papers that detailed working days lost per episode following physician diagnosis of influenza reported a range of 3. 7 - 5. 9 days per episode. Finally, estimates from papers reporting working days lost per episode of self-reported influenza ranged fromIndirect-costs, Influenza-virus-infections, Productivity-costs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the motivations and trends of festival attendees, the effect these are having on the atmosphere and the way the festival is produced. Furthermore, it will investigate if the current trends in the UK are having an impact on festivals, the type of people they now attract, and if that audience has changed over recent years. The study will focus specifically on Glastonbury Festival, looking at the changing culture of its audience, and the strategy that the festival is using to cope with such changes. The events industry has regularly carried out extensive research within visitor motivations for events, and more recently, there has been an increase in the research being done specifically on music festivals. The number of festivals occurring <b>year</b> <b>on</b> <b>year</b> is <b>increasing,</b> which is {{making it one of the}} fastest growing areas of the leisure industry (Nicholson and Pearce 2001). However, there is a noticeable gap in the qualitative area of the research; therefore, for this study, qualitative data was collected through semi structured interviews and online questionnaires. Two research methods were chosen in order to collect data from both the organizers and the attendees of Glastonbury Festival. From the research, it was found that music was the key motivation for attending a festival. However, the majority of questionnaire respondents had more than one reason for their motivation to attend. The majority of attendees also agreed that Glastonbury Festival offered something different to most other festivals, through its wide range of music and activities, appealing to all ages and all musical tastes. As a result, a very different atmosphere is created at Glastonbury Festival, showing that the motivations relate to a specific festival. This indicates that, more in-depth research, by individual festivals, would benefit the industry to reveal the variance in motivations between one festival and another. The research showed that trends are affecting festivals more than before, with the introduction of social media, technology and more identifiable social classes, although from the results it was found that the attendees have recognized these changes more than the organizers. The organizers may wish to carry out further research to find out how important maintaining the original ethos of the festival is, in retaining its devoted audience. Moreover, both sample groups agreed that the culture of the festival has changed since the festival’s inception. The audience has become more diverse, moving the festival away from its initial hippy and green image into something that appeals to all generations, but also noticeably more towards middle class, because of the rising ticket prices and trends such as ‘glamping’. Finally, the Festival aims to stay ahead of the trends in order to maintain their current position at the top of the UK festival market. Glastonbury needs to control the size of the festival, but also needs to have an awareness of the motivations of its clientele, so that any change accommodates its faithful attendees, whilst also attracting a new audience...|$|R
