500|$|When SpongeBob {{goes around}} {{to the back of the}} Krusty Krab to take out the trash, he reads some {{graffiti}} written on a dumpster, one of which he does not understand. SpongeBob asks Patrick what is it and Patrick says that the word is a [...] "sentence enhancer" [...] which is used [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> fancy." [...] The next day, SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab and says the word to Patrick and then over the intercom. The Krusty Krab customers are appalled by SpongeBob's use of his [...] "word" [...] and leave. Squidward then informs Mr. Krabs, who then decides to tell them that they were using profanity, and mentions that there are 13 swear words they should not use. SpongeBob and Patrick vow Mr. Krabs that they will never use swear words again.|$|E
500|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob reads a [...] "bad word" [...] off a dumpster behind the Krusty Krab, but {{does not know what}} it means. Patrick explains to him that it is a [...] "sentence enhancer" [...] which is used [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> fancy." [...] The two start using it in every sentence they speak. However, when Mr. Krabs hears them, he warns the two never to use the word again or any of the 13 bad words. Later on, SpongeBob accidentally swears again. Patrick then runs to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him. However, when Mr. Krabs accidentally injures his toe, he utters all the 13 bad words. The two cannot believe it and run to Mama Krabs to tell on him. Mama Krabs, who is appalled by their use of the words, makes the three paint her house as punishment.|$|E
500|$|On 20 January 2009, Lewis' {{performed}} the {{song on the}} Late Show with David Letterman to promote its release as a single. Complimentary of her performance, Letterman said [...] "Beautiful! Oh my God that was lovely" [...] after Lewis finished the song. Lizzie Smith for The Guardian wrote that her performance was the [...] "latest step towards her domination of the American music scene." [...] She also commented on the interaction between Lewis and Letterman after her performance, writing [...] "It's rare for American chatshow host David Letterman {{to do more than}} shake the hands of performers on his U.S. show, but when X Factor winner Leona Lewis made an appearance he could hardly keep his hands off her. Hugging Leona, a smitten Letterman caught her by surprise by asking: 'Anything <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about?' As Leona looked bemused Letterman cheekily added: 'Let's go up to the house and we'll talk about it. Smith concluded her review of the performance with [...] "But rather than looking pleased with his attentions a blushing Leona looked distinctly uncomfortable." ...|$|E

500|$|R.E.M. reconvened in mid-1990 {{to record}} its seventh album, Out of Time. In a {{departure}} from Green, the band members often wrote the music with non-traditional rock instrumentation including mandolin, organ, and acoustic guitar instead of adding them as overdubs later in the creative process. Released in March 1991, Out of Time was the band's first album to top both the US and UK charts. The record eventually sold 4.2million copies in the US alone, and about 12 million copies worldwide by 1996. The album's lead single [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was a worldwide hit that received heavy rotation on radio, as did the music video on MTV. [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was R.E.M.'s highest-charting single in the US, reaching number four on the Billboard charts. [...] "There've been very few life-changing events in our career because our career has been so gradual," [...] Mills said years later. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about life changing, I think 'Losing My Religion' is the closest it gets". The album's second single, [...] "Shiny Happy People" [...] (one of three songs on the record to feature vocals from Kate Pierson of fellow Athens band The B-52's), was also a major hit, reaching number 10 in the US and number six in the UK. Out of Time garnered R.E.M. seven nominations at the 1992 Grammy Awards, the most nominations of any artist that year. The band won three awards: one for Best Alternative Music Album and two for [...] "Losing My Religion", Best Short Form Music Video and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. R.E.M. did not tour to promote Out of Time; instead the group played a series of one-off shows, including an appearance taped for an episode of MTV Unplugged and released music videos for each song on the video album This Film Is On. The MTV Unplugged session of [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was recorded {{with members of the}} Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in Madison, Georgia, at [...]|$|E
2500|$|As of the Rogers-produced Hockey Night, Coach's Corner was noticeably shortened, from {{as long as}} 10 {{minutes to}} as short as 5—a change that was lampshaded by both Cherry and MacLean during their first segment of the new season. The {{following}} Monday, Scott Moore had a short discussion with Cherry regarding the matter, laughing it off and explaining that [...] "if you have more to talk about, {{all you need to}} do is make sure you tell the executive producer what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about and we'll make sure you have lots of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The President, {{who was a}} {{foot and}} a half taller and a hundred pounds heavier than George, struck him a resounding clap on the back and caught his hand in an immense fist. Wrenching George's arm up and down with a pumping motion that might have drawn oil from a dry Texas well, Johnson congratulated him on the briefing, and on his {{services}} to the country and its voters. As he released George, he said, 'Anytime <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me, just pick up the phone and come over.' It was a vintage LBJ performance." ...|$|E

6000|$|Again d'Alcacer {{managed not to}} {{interrupt}} his regular pacing. [...] "Do you know what I think?" [...] he said, abruptly. [...] "I think, Travers, that <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about her. I think that <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about anything.

6000|$|... “Oh, I know <b>you</b> don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me!” she said. “Still, though I {{feel most}} horribly mean, I {{did it because}} I had to.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to my desk. And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're {{not going to let you}} keep talking about the things <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Continuing as Test captain, Waugh led {{the team}} to a 2–1 victory in South Africa to retain Australia's ranking as the number one team. Australia crushed the hosts in the First Test by an innings and 360 runs, won the Second Test by four wickets, before losing the last. His own form was poor, with 95 runs at 19.00. He left the tour once the ODI series began. Arriving in Australia alone, he faced media {{questioning}} over his playing future. Waugh's reply was, [...] "We've just beaten the next {{best team in the}} world 5–1, and all <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about is getting me out of the team." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with the Washington Post, Steel commented on gun control: [...] "Society should draw lines. What do you need an assault weapon for, if you're going hunting? That's overkill. But I don't think that means {{you go to a}} total ban {{for those who want to}} use gun for skeet shooting or hunting or things like that. But what's the point of passing gun laws if we're not going to enforce them? If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about gun control, that's where you need to start. We've got 300 gun laws on the books right now. At the end of the day, it's about how we enforce the law." ...|$|E
60|$|Anyway, {{things are}} not so bad. You see it was just {{at this time that}} Mr. Smith's caff opened, and Mr. Smith came to Jeff's Woman and said he wanted seven dozen eggs a day, and wanted them handy, and so the hens are back, and more of them, and they exult so every morning over the eggs they lay that if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of Rockefeller in the barber shop you couldn't hear his name for the cackling.|$|R

5000|$|Halutz We have to {{find the}} right clause in the law and place them on trial in Israel. Yes. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about morality, and I say that a state that does not protect itself is acting immorally. A state that does not back up its fighters will not survive. Happily, the State of Israel does back up its fighters. This vocal but {{negligible}} minority brings to mind dark times {{in the history of the}} Jewish people, when a minority among us went and informed on another part of the nation. That must not happen again. Who would have believed that pilots of the air force would find their cars spray-painted with savage graffiti because of a mission they carried out? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} would be nice in the least," [...] said Mrs. March, [...] "and if <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> seriously, I would rather not talk at all." ...|$|R
