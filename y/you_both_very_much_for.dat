"Yes, I read Bessie's {{letter about}} a couple of hours ago, and I congratulate <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> I think that you will have the sweetest and loveliest wife in South Africa, Captain Niel; and I think that Bessie will have a husband any woman might be proud of;" [...] and she half bowed and half curtseyed to him as she said it, with a graceful little air of dignity that was very taking.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} Jonas, [...] "you, Rollo, {{were playing}} here alone. Your little cousin {{came to see}} you; and you were very glad to have him come. He helped you build, and {{when he wanted to}} have the window in a particular way, you ought to have let him. To quarrel with a visitor for such a cause as that, was very ungentlemanly and unkind. So you see <b>you</b> were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to blame." ...|$|R
40|$|To my husband, Todd, who has {{inspired}} me to accomplish goals that I had never thought attainable. “You have supported me throughout our lives together as a wife, mother, student, and professional. All that I have and have accomplished is because of your love and support. You are {{the love of my}} life, and I am the person I have become because of your partnership. I will love you forever. To my children, Haiden and Gable, who have accommodated their lives when their mother had class or had to accomplish her work. I hope you feel that in some, simple way, I’ve provided a role model for <b>both</b> of <b>you</b> and have demonstrated the importance of advancing your education, working hard, balancing life, and achieving your goals. Haiden, you will accomplish all the goals that you set for yourself, and I am so proud of how you’ve grown to support the family throughout my journey in accomplishing this goal. Gable, you have always been the one to bring laughter to any situation. You have made me see stressful situations from a different viewpoint filled with laughter. I am so proud to have the <b>both</b> of <b>you</b> and am priviledged to be your mother. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> To my mother, father, and brother. Thank you all for being such a supportive syste...|$|R
40|$|To {{my sweet}} aunties, Nora and Toots, I miss <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Acknowledgments This {{study is the}} {{capstone}} experience of the very special years I have spent in my doctoral program at The University of Texas at Austin. My time in Austin has been highly rewarding, both personally and professionally. For giving me this opportunity, I {{would like to thank}} my advisor and mentor, Dr. Herb Rieth, for inviting me to be one of his advisees, and for his unqualified and unwavering support over the years. His vision of what I could achieve and the daily modeling of kindness and humor as he prodded me along set a very high standard—I can only hope {{to be the kind of}} mentor to others that he has been to me. I would like to express my appreciation to my committee members, Diane and Brian Bryant, Mark O’Reilly, and Min Liu, for the time and energy each of you has invested in my work, not just in this dissertation process, but over the years at UT. I would like to thank two professors from my master’s program at Montclair State University, too. To Elaine Fine, thank you for your love and enthusiasm for the field of special education and for encouraging me to pursue a higher level of learning, and thank you to Dr. Pau...|$|R

"I am very sorry," [...] said Mrs. Drane, [...] "that I {{should appear}} to have been discourteous to one who had done us a service, for which, I assure <b>you,</b> we are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> obliged, but Dr. and Mrs. Tolbridge managed the whole affair of our removal from Mrs. Brinkly's house, and I did not suppose there was any one, besides them and ourselves, who would take the {{slightest}} interest in the matter." ...|$|R
40|$|First and {{foremost}} I {{would like to}} thank Bryan Hunt (my bobsie twin) for whom no amount of words can describe the generous help I have received throughout the years. You have been the greatest support system anyone could have or wish for. Thank you for being my friend unconditionally. If it weren’t for your six simple words “you know what you could do, ” I would not have finished my bachelor’s degree a year early and I would not have even attempted a master’s degree. I would not, for certain, have made it without you. For that I will forever be indebted to you. Thank you to my parents who listened to tearful phone calls late into the evening and always made sure that I knew things would be okay. Thank you for being my friend as well as my parent. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> A huge thanks extended to my committee for not only taking the time to read and re-read drafts of this thesis but for being flexible and willing to meet whenever I needed them to. And finally, last but certainly not least, I {{would like to thank}} Colleen and Emily for coming to visit me in Pullman when I needed them most. You gave me {{something to look forward to}} when I returned home and the last needed push to finish my thesis. I am so happy <b>you</b> <b>both</b> came back into my life. Colleen, thank you for your wedding, it took my mind off of my thesis and the daily grind of grad school...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} so many people {{throughout}} this scholarly journey who have shared their time, wit, wisdom and experiences with me and without the benefit of {{each and every one of}} them, this thesis would have been depleted. My first thoughts turn to my family who have all appeared during the creation of this tome. My never ending love and appreciation go firstly to my husband Andy who, apart from the endless reading, re-reading and tactful editing, has supported and encouraged me throughout the process. Without his unwavering love, understanding and support, completing this thesis would have been a lonelier and less agreeable task, so thank you for your support and your belief in me. Thank you to my two precious bundles of joy, Hayden and Keira, who were born during my candidature and who have been very patient during this journey. You are the very best and most beautiful of distractions and I look forward to spending more time together. Your smiling faces kept me going during difficult stages and you helped to keep things in perspective. So thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> for your patience and understanding. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> I couldn’t have managed to complete this without the help given by my parents and friends. Many, many thanks go to my mother with her constant encouragement and help with childcare, to my father who has inspired me throughout this process – whether he knew it or not – and to my stepmother Julia who unleashed the passion for green men. And finally, many thanks to Joan and Peter, my parents-in-law in England for you...|$|R
40|$|First and foremost, I want {{to thank}} {{my mom and dad}} for {{supporting}} me, both emotionally and financially, as I continued to embark on strengthening my educational career. Your quest to encourage me to continue my education has gotten me to the where I am today. The value <b>you</b> <b>both</b> place on education and how you continued to instill this value in me while growing up has provided me with a significant motivation to continue this journey. We have been through so much, but our strong, little family has not faltered as we continue to support and love one another unconditionally. Thank you for everything you have given me [...] . <b>you</b> are <b>both</b> truly an inspiration. I love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> so <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> To my sister, Megan. Although you are not physically here, I felt your support through your strong and ever-present spirit. You are {{a very important part of}} my life and a key contributor as to who I have become today. You embraced life for what it was worth and because of that, you have taught me to love, cherish, and value the short life we are given. I know that you are proud of my accomplishments. Thank you for always being there for me [...] . you will always be in my heart. I love you...|$|R
60|$|We were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> out of breath. We {{spoke in}} panting, broken sentences.|$|R
60|$|Jasper {{sets the}} example of nearly {{emptying}} his glass, and Neville follows it. Edwin Drood says, ‘Thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much,’ and follows the double example.|$|R
60|$|As he said himself, and as {{many men}} found out rather to their surprise, there were two Burkes, <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> at your service.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> kindly," [...] {{said the}} widow, [...] "a good {{neighbour}} as our minister says, is {{the pool of}} Bethesda; and as you say, Mowbray will rally." ...|$|R
5000|$|Though Kyla and Rich were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{involved}} in the wedding preparations, the couple preferred to keep the wedding itself and the details at a very low key ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and Miss Fairclough," [...] Lessingham went on, [...] "have rather {{scoffed at}} my {{presence}} here {{on behalf of}} our Secret Service. It seemed to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>very</b> ridiculous. Now <b>you</b> understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear, hear," [...] cried Ogilvie; [...] "and I {{should like}} to know {{what is to be done}} with Brand and Anson, for they are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> down with fever of some sort this morning." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mitchell later recalls, [...] "I {{think we}} both felt a pretty {{fair amount of}} {{pressure}} when we started shooting. It was Julie’s picture, {{but it was still}} Roger’s company, and he was the bottom line. We <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> wanted to make him happy." ...|$|R
60|$|And this {{conversation}} was continued by Ralph and George when Bob {{was obliged to}} drive ahead, <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> excited about it, and both building air-castles {{on the strength of}} the idea, even until the weary horses trotted up the lane to the Kenniston farm-house.|$|R
60|$|On our way upstairs, I {{called her}} {{attention}} to the sudden disappearance of Mrs. Crupp's pitfalls, and also to the prints of recent footsteps. We were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> surprised, coming higher up, to find my outer door standing open (which I had shut) and to hear voices inside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] he repeated, {{and then}} he laughed. [...] "You are not, Jane; and if you {{will return to the}} city of Opar and ask them who dwell there they will tell you that I was not dead a few short hours ago. No, dear, we are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{end of it}} was," [...] ses Alf, [...] "that you and Mrs. Pearce was <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> upset, as o' {{course you}} couldn't marry while 'er fust was alive, {{and the last thing}} I see afore I woke up was her boxes {{standing}} at the front door waiting for a cab." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Queer thing altogether, sir," [...] Mr. Jarvis admitted; [...] "a queer business, sir. However, it's {{over and}} done with, and the less said about it, the better. We are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> obliged to <b>you,</b> Mr. Neville, for your kind offices, and I am only thankful that {{the results have been}} so satisfactory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} also, sir, {{and so does}} my wife. But to tell the truth, sir, we were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{attached}} to Sir Charles, and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall." ...|$|R
60|$|By no {{conceivable}} mental gymnastics {{could he}} {{think of the}} two as antagonists. Between them there was no imaginable issue. They had <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the same scientific disposition; with perhaps more dash and inspiration {{in the quality of}} Hugh; more docility and method in the case of Karl. Until war had smashed them one against the other....|$|R
6000|$|LADY BRITOMART [highly indignant] How {{dare you}} say Pip! pip! to me, Sarah? <b>You</b> are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> naughty children. What do you want, Barbara? ...|$|R
25|$|Beloved and Sethe are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> emotionally {{impaired}} as {{a result}} of Sethe’s previous enslavement. Slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child, which has devastating consequences for both parties. Furthermore, the earliest need a child has is related to the mother: the baby needs milk from the mother. Sethe is traumatized by the experience of having her milk stolen because it means she cannot form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{indebted to}} <b>you,</b> sir, for your politeness in calling," [...] he said, with {{excessive}} civility of manner. [...] "But our stay {{at this place}} has drawn to an end. I only came here for the re-establishment of my daughter's health. She has benefited greatly by the change of air, and we have arranged to return home to-morrow. Otherwise, we should have gladly profited by your kind offer of tickets for the ball." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] ejaculated the Captain; then rising he {{carefully}} closed {{and locked the}} door before continuing the conversation. They were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> interested in it; but when it was at last over, and the Captain took his departure, Rosie did not bounce away as usual with tumbled hair and merry flushed face. She left the drawing-room looking pale and a little scared perhaps, {{and for the rest of}} the day was unusually silent and subdued.|$|R
60|$|May God bless <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> my <b>very</b> dear friends! My husband bids me {{remember}} him {{to you in}} cordial regard. I long to see you, and to hear (first) that you are well.|$|R
50|$|Renfrow {{competed in}} two races in 1997 for the Turnage team. He was 32nd at Bristol and 24th at Richmond, <b>both</b> without <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to comment on. He did not finish either race.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Flynn, at {{any rate}} {{it must be a}} great comfort for you to know that you did all you could for him. <b>You</b> were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> kind to him, I must say." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{assurance}} {{and advice}} removed the last shadow of anxiety from Fan's mind, and after some more conversation they returned home, <b>both</b> feeling <b>very</b> <b>much</b> happier {{than when they}} had started for this eventful walk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, indeed, he did. He is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{hurt that}} you should behave {{to me as if}} you had a sort of enmity towards me. He would like you to make a friend of me. I assure <b>you</b> we <b>both</b> feel <b>very</b> kindly towards you, and are sorry you should cherish such feelings.' ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{then said}} that he meant to try a very short {{pendulum}} indeed, and he asked Mary to tie one up for him, not more than an inch in length. She, however, {{said that it would}} not be necessary to tie it to the branch; but, instead of that, she took hold of the string of one of the pebbles which was already hanging before them, about an inch above the pebble itself, and then set the pebble in motion; and they were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> interested in observing how quick it vibrated to and fro.|$|R
50|$|Zillah's gluttonous companions and twin brothers, <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alike. They {{are rarely}} found apart from one another. Twig is the taller of the two, he has sharp {{features}} and wicked demeanor. Twig also drives the trio's van around the country. Molochai is slightly shorter, with roundish, babyish features. He favors sweets and cakes to the other's more adult tastes.There is no {{explanation of how}} the two found each other yet there is an account of their first encounter with Zillah whereupon they misjudge his true nature and attack him. They are easily overpowered by the older and more experienced vampire and thereafter act under his supervision.|$|R
60|$|The ladies Fitz-Warene were sandy girls, {{somewhat}} tall, with rather good {{figures and}} a grand air; the eldest very ugly, the second rather pretty; and yet <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alike. They had both great conversational powers, though in different ways. Lady Joan was doctrinal; Lady Maud inquisitive: the first often imparted information which {{you did not}} previously possess; the other suggested ideas which were often before in your own mind, but lay tranquil and unobserved, till called into life and notice by her fanciful and vivacious tongue. Both of them were endowed with a very remarkable self-possession; but Lady Joan wanted softness, and Lady Maud repose.|$|R
60|$|Once in the carriage, we related {{all that}} we had seen, {{and that there was}} no sign of the will to be found. Mr. Petersfield and papa were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> disappointed. Mr. Petersfield remarked that most likely we had been within arm's reach of the will, for it was certain now that Mr. Harmer did use that room for a study, and that no doubt there was some secret hiding-place there, made {{originally}} for the concealment of important papers in case the entrance to the secret chamber should be discovered. It was a singular fancy of Mr. Harmer's to use that little place for writing in.|$|R
