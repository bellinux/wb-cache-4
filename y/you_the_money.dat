[...] "He was like, hey, I'll front <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and we'll split the profits until you pay me back," [...] {{recalled}} Hoppus in 2001. The two had met when Secor transferred from a north San Diego location. The two became friends quickly, despite Secor's seniority of post. [...] "At that point they'd played around enough to get their chops up so I took all the money I had in savings and we went into the studio for two days," [...] said Secor.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 1788, the New Jersey Legislature gave Baron von Steuben {{full title}} to the former Zabriskie estate. A month later, {{recognizing}} his financial embarrassment, Steuben wrote another former aide-de-camp and companion, William North, recognizing: [...] "The jersey Estate must and is to be sold. Walker is my administrator, all debts are to be paid out of it." [...] On November6, 1788, Steuben again wrote North (at his new home in Duanesburg), noting [...] "My Jersey Estate is Advertised but not yet Sold, from this Walker Shall immediately pay to <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> you so generously lend me and all my debts in New-York will be payed. I support my present poverty with more heroism than I Expected. All Clubs and parties are renounced, I seldom leave the House." [...] Steuben eventually sold the New Jersey property to a son of the previous owner, and it remained in the Zabriskie family until 1909. It is the only remaining eighteenth-century building that von Steuben owned.|$|E
