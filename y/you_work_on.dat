For instance, she had resisted hang-dogging (hanging {{on the rope}} at any point during the climb), holding with the philosophy that it was cheating, but after experimenting with it during her ascent of Vandals, she found it a useful way to learn challenging climbs. During the mid-1980s, there was great tension in the climbing community between traditionalists and new sport climbers. There was even a [...] "Great Debate" [...] in 1986 at the American Alpine Club at which a panel of all-star participants—including Hill—were invited to discuss {{the merits of the}} two different styles, especially sport climbing that required the insertion of fixed bolts into the rock. Hill has argued that [...] "the purpose of climbing is to adapt yourself to the rock. <b>You</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> yourself to overcome the obstacle of the rock... I believe climbers should leave the rock as unaltered as possible... you have a responsibility not only to put in safe bolts but to put them in logical places—to do the least possible alteration of the rock to establish the best possible experience for others".|$|E

500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E

5000|$|Computing Reviews {{writes about}} this book [...] "This book {{addresses}} a controversial and timely issue {{in the field of}} network security. Rootkits are notoriously used by the black hat hacking community. A rootkit allows an attacker to subvert a compromised system. This subversion can take place at the application level, as is the case for the early rootkits that replaced a set of common administrative tools, but can be more dangerous when it occurs at the kernel level. A rootkit hides the network traffic, processes, and files that an attacker decides to keep invisible to administrators and system management tools… If <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> defensive solutions—anti-virus and malware detection tools—or are interested in low-level system programming, you must read this book.

Blink-182 entered Big Fish Studios in Rancho Santa Fe, California in December 1996 to record Dude Ranch. Big Fish was a converted guesthouse which had just survived a wildfire months before. However, the gloomy atmosphere did not faze Blink-182 at all, and what was a tragedy to local individuals became fodder for jokes for the group; bassist Mark Hoppus had just bought a new video camera and he filmed stunts with guitarist Tom DeLonge on the burnt landscape in spare time such as having Mark run around naked as Tom explained to the camera what happened in the fire and that it's [...] "Mating Season". Thanks to improved economics, the band had more time in the studio to record the album they wanted to make. The trio were listening to music such as Jawbreaker, Bad Religion and Lagwagon, setting the backdrop for the recordings under guidance of Mark Trombino, who provided additional piano and keyboards on Dude Ranch. The trio picked Trombino based on his work he had done on Jimmy Eat World's Static Prevails (1996). The group spent much time trying to get Trombino to laugh at their antics, to no avail. Hoppus' sister, Anne Hoppus, described Trombino as very quiet and [...] "very much his own person." [...] In addition to the record, Trombino produced [...] "I Won't Be Home for Christmas", a holiday song recorded during the Dude Ranch sessions.|$|E
