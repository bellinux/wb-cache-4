5|$|Imaginos was envisioned {{as a rock}} opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult to decipher for the casual reader. However, thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Edwards, by now an {{established}} scholar of diplomatic history, was appointed Official Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975. Based {{out of the}} Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, the multi-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards continued the tradition established by Charles Bean, Gavin Long and Robert J. O'Neill in Australia's earlier official war histories by adopting a holistic approach that sought to analyse the operational, strategic, political, social and medical aspects of the Australian experience. But in dealing with twenty-seven <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> the series spanned the longest time period of an Australian official history commissioned to that time. The end result was a nine-volume series, published between 1992 and 2012, with contributions from nine historians.|$|E

5|$|Over its 950 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> Warwick Castle {{has been}} owned by 36 {{different}} individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It {{was the family}} seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, {{and has been a}} family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had a woman (or girl) as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.|$|E
5|$|The University seal as it {{is today}} is {{symbolic}} of hundreds of <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>history.</b> The seal combines attributes from the Bayley Coat of Arms and the Seton family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as 1216 and symbolizes Scottish nobility. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest, which is notable for its three crescents and three torteau. The motto on the seal Hazard Zet Forward (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of Norman French and archaic English meaning at whatever risk, yet go forward. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal {{in the middle of the}} university green. It is said that students who step on the seal will not graduate on time.|$|E
