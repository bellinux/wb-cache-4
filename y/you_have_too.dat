2500|$|Ortiz {{said that}} Sukeban Games was founded {{when he and}} Damas started a blog to write about anime and video games. They {{eventually}} managed to grow a [...] "small but awesome" [...] community, which lead them to create a short dating sim for the blog's first anniversary. After enjoying the video game creation process, they decided to continue following that path. The majority of influences for VA-11 HALL-A come from old PC-98 games, because they are [...] "retro" [...] yet also [...] "look futuristic"; especially X-Girl Cyber Punk Adventure which served as the blueprint for the game's aesthetic. According to Ortiz, in the 70s–90s, [...] "the world {{was under the impression}} that Japan was going to take over with its superior technology." [...] As such, the game is set in a parallel universe where Japan did conquer the world through technology, leading to the game's strong Japanese influences. Blade Runner, Neuromancer, Ghost in the Shell, and Bubblegum Crisis were also sources of inspiration. Anime influence has also resulted in the game's female protagonist and mostly female character list. Ortiz says that they focus their games on anime fans rather than mainstream appeal, as [...] "the bigger your audience is the more creative troubles <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> <b>Too</b> many opinions and it's hard to see one that will truly help your creative process." ...|$|E
