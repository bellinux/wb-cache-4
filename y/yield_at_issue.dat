40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} and main features of bank bonds held by Italian households and presents {{an estimate of}} the gross yield to maturity of the bonds purchased at issue. Since 1950 the share of these assets in households' portfolios has shown wide fluctuations, primarily reflecting the issuance policies of banks and changes in the tax treatment of securities, as well as changes in preferences. The share of bonds in the financial wealth of households reached a peak of 11 percent in 1973 and 2011. Since 2012 investment in bonds has started to decrease: by March 2016 the share of bank bonds in the financial wealth of households had returned to below 5 percent. The gross <b>yield</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> of bank bonds placed with Italian households increased during the sovereign debt crisis but has now fallen back to the levels reached in the years preceding 2011. The yield spread with respect to five-year BTPs, which was mostly negative between 2009 and 2012, has been positive since the end of 2013. financial wealth, investment decisions, bond fundin...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the Effect of Climate {{on the growth}} and <b>yield</b> of Sorghum <b>at</b> Wailo, Ganjuwa Local Government Area, Bauchi State of Nigeria. Correlation and regression analysis {{were used to determine}} the relationship between Sorghum yield and weather elements for different phonological stages of the crop’s growth. The results of the correlation analysis show that at pre-sowing stage, the total rainfall is found to be significantly and positively correlated with <b>yield</b> <b>at</b> 5 % significant level. Relative humidity at flowering stage also shows significant and positive correlation at 1 % significant level with the final <b>yield.</b> <b>At</b> total growing season, seasonality of rainfall is significantly and positively correlated with the final <b>yield</b> <b>at</b> 5 % significant level, which is seasonality of rainfall. Multiple regression analysis shows that these three elements (total rainfall, relative humidity and seasonality index) accounted for 76. 7 % of the variation of Sorghum <b>yield</b> <b>at</b> Wailo. The implications of the results are discussed with respect to sorghum farming in the study area...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{existence}} of bidimensional bosonic models for which the spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon <b>yields,</b> <b>at</b> classical level, non-equivalent vacua. Once we introduce the concept of vacuum manifold V, {{defined in terms of}} the vacuum field configurations, the behavior of the models <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> can be analyzed by means of the so-called classical moduli space M c (V). The aforementioned structure allows us to classify the kink-like excitations into loops and links. To be precise, the loops interpolate smoothly between equivalent minima of the classical potential while the links connect vacua located at different points in M c (V). Although exact results are very hard to come by, we resort to models nice enough to provide us with the solitary waves in closed form. 1. Introduction.

The association among different yield contributing traits was studied at genotypic and phenotypic levels. The results revealed positive correlation in case of number of spikelets per spike, number of grains per spike and 1000 grain weight with grain <b>yield</b> <b>at</b> both genotypic and phenotypic levels. However, number of tillers per m 2 and spike length contributed negatively towards grain <b>yield</b> <b>at</b> both levels. Plant height {{was positively correlated with}} grain <b>yield</b> <b>at</b> genotypic level, whereas negatively correlated at phenotypic levels.

40|$|Abstract. Results of {{identified}} charged hadrons {{produced in}} Au+Au collisions at sNN = 130 GeV {{as a function}} of centrality are discussed. The 〈pT 〉 of protons and antiprotons is significantly larger than in p–p collisions at the same center of mass energy. Its scaling with the number of participant nucleons, an increase of 20 ± 5 % from peripheral to central, may be due to radial expansion. In a hydrodynamical picture a simultaneous fit of pions, kaons and protons is consistent with a radial flow velocity of βTsurface = 0. 72 ± 0. 01 and a temperature of T = 122 ± 4 MeV for the 5 % most central collisions. Dominant proton <b>yields</b> <b>at</b> pT> 1. 5 GeV/c and antiproton <b>yields</b> <b>at</b> pT> 1. 8 GeV/c may be explained by a combination of suppression of pion <b>yields</b> <b>at</b> high pT and the boost of low pT protons to high pT from radial flow...|$|R
