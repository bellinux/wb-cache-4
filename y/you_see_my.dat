500|$|Willie Dixon's [...] "The Red Rooster"/"Little Red Rooster" [...] uses {{elements}} from several earlier blues songs. [...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What you want with a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know my dog anywhere I hear him bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have a little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>My</b> Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E

As he finally dies, he is taken before God, who condemns him for his selfish behavior and sends him to Hell.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary Barbadian folk songs, {{especially}} {{through the}} pioneering albums of author and singer-songwriter Anthony Kellman, show a bold fusion of indigenous rhythms such as tuk and calypso with African, Latin, jazz, pop, and East Indian influences. Kellman's {{songs such as}} [...] "Mountain" [...] (from 2000 album [...] "Wings of A Stranger"); [...] "King Jaja" [...] and [...] "My Dog, Your Dog" [...] (from 2005 album [...] "Limestone"); and [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>My</b> Girl" [...] and [...] "Tuk, Tabla, and Fedounoum" [...] (from 2009 album Blood Mates), exemplify his eclectic style. More {{than any of his}} contemporaries, Kellman, through his songs, poems, and novels, demonstrates {{what it means to be}} Barbadian through a hybrid mix of African and European cultural elements.≤ ...|$|E
500|$|Although Wyman noted {{some early}} {{criticism}} of their rendition, Janovitz {{described it as}} [...] "a fairly faithful version [...] ". It is performed as a moderately slow (74 bpm) blues in the key of G. [...] Although AllMusic reviewer Matthew Greenwald describes their arrangement as having a straight I-IV-V twelve-bar blues progression, they sometimes vary the changes, {{but not in the}} same manner as Howlin' Wolf. [...] Jagger uses the lyrics from the original (omitting Cooke's extra verse), but makes one important change—instead of [...] "I got a little red rooster", he sings [...] "I am the little red rooster", although the later verse reverts to [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> little red rooster". Instrumentally, Bill Wyman generally follows Dixon's bass lines. Charlie Watts later admitted that his drum part was inspired by Sam Cooke's version, which was played by Hal Blaine. Keith Richards adds a rhythm guitar part; according to Egan, [...] "the juxtaposition of acoustic guitar and electric slide all make for something richer and warmer than any blues they had ever attempted before".|$|E

He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1953, Miller {{traveled}} to Hawaii and rejoined her I Walk Alone costar, Burt Lancaster. She spent 10 days in the islands. She was cast as Georgette, Donna Reed's roommate in From Here to Eternity. But most of her footage {{ended up on the}} cutting room floor: [...] "'I don't even say I made that one; I'm hardly in it. I think <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> arm; that's about it' (laughs)." [...] Miller was more impressed by the performances of Frank Sinatra and Montgomery Clift, whom she watched performing before the camera. Production ran March 7–May 5, 1953. On July 27, 1953, Miller finally married William Schuyler in Santa Barbara. That October, it was announced that the Schuylers were expecting their first baby. Their daughter, Linda Elizabeth, was born on February 22, 1954.|$|E

In 1941 Rawlings married Ocala hotelier Norton Baskin (1901–1997), and he remodeled an old mansion into the Castle Warden Hotel in St. Augustine (currently the Ripley's Believe it or Not Museum). After World War II, he sold the hotel and managed the Dolphin Restaurant at Marineland, which was then Florida's number one tourist attraction. Rawlings and Baskin made their primary home at Crescent Beach, and Rawlings and Baskin both {{continued}} their respective occupations independently. When a visitor to the Castle Warden Hotel suggested she saw the influence of Rawlings in the decor, Baskin protested, saying, [...] "You do not see Mrs. Rawlings' fine hand in this place. Nor will <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> big foot in her next book. That's our agreement. She writes. I run a hotel." [...] After purchasing her land in New York, Rawlings spent half the year there and half the year with Baskin in St. Augustine.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in the United States, [...] "Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)" [...] {{began to}} make its impact from April 13, 2010.

Keys was ranked as the top R recording artist of the 2000–2009 decade by Billboard magazine and ranked at number five as artist of the decade, while [...] "No One" [...] was ranked at number six on the magazine's top songs of the decade. In the United Kingdom, The Element of Freedom became Keys' first album to top the UK Albums Chart. The album's second single, [...] "Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart", was released in November and peaked at number twenty-seven on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album's third single [...] "Put It in a Love Song" [...] featured recording artist Beyoncé.
