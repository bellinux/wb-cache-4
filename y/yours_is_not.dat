2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine considered the album to be a [...] "crushing disappointment" [...] concluding with, [...] "Mine Is <b>Yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just the questionable effort of a once-promising band, but perhaps even worse: {{a work of}} obviously borrowed ideas from a group highly capable of succeeding with their own." [...] PopMatters contributor David Gassmann said that despite some strong hooks and instrumental choices, he felt the album lacked the idiosyncratic personality from the band's previous records and resembled more of The Script and Train due to King's production. He added that listeners will consider this as a gateway introduction to the band itself. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club gave the album a D+ grade. He found their sound to be [...] "dulled for maximum accessibility" [...] coupled with [...] "uninspired melodies" [...] and lyrics that were [...] "formless" [...] concluding with, [...] "Mine Is Yours is the bland sound of a band trading identity for ambition." [...] The most critical about the album was NMEs Katherine Rodgers who found some of the tracks to be generic and found the highlights to be [...] "asphyxiated in lubricious studio slime." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now look here, Captain, {{though the}} thing is but begun at present, yet there is enough to show that one idea at least of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> feasible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, señor; my {{ears are}} {{accustomed}} {{to the sounds of}} the forests, <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> If you <b>were</b> watching I should still have no sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{creature}} of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I {{must be careful}} of you, my treasure: nerves like <b>yours</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> made for rough handling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} need to ask it," [...] replied Master de Cressi, [...] "and if you and that lean henchman of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> to blame, then say who is?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lau. Methinks <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> very hard, for a serving-man's. But where, in {{the name}} of wonder, have you learned to talk so courtly? You are a strange valet de chambre.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Harding grimly; [...] "we {{understand}} all right. <b>Yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a singular case; {{the trouble is}} that it's too common. But we'll quit talking about it. You can't go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{imagine that}} this Derek of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{one of our}} leading sunbeams. Well, I suppose he could hardly be, if that's his mother and there is {{anything}} in heredity." ...|$|E
5000|$|A fat man, Heton was {{supposedly}} complimented {{by the king}} James I with the comment [...] "Fat men are apt to make lean sermons; but <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> lean, but larded with good learning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "great {{fortunes}} {{even like}} <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> above {{the chances of}} the money-markets. Your fortune, or {{a great part of}} it, might go. What would happen to you then? You would be a pauper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Feemy, {{now just}} look at the matter this way, one moment: supposing now--only just for supposition--this lover of <b>yours</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the sort of man we all take him to be, and that he was to turn out false, or inconstant; suppose now it turned out he had another wife somewhere else--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have become}} an enigma again. But <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the creed of a simpleton. You are playing with me--revealing your wisdom from beneath a veil of {{infantile}} guilelessness. I have no more to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What you too are {{beginning}} to suspect.... That other things may be conceivable {{even if they are}} not possible. That this life of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> everything. That it is not to be taken too seriously. Because ... there are better dreams!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My first German prisoner," [...] said Kurt, half seriously. [...] "Now, Miss Anderson, we must {{be doing}} things. We don't want to {{meet a lot of}} I.W.W.'s out here. My car is out of commission. I hope <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> broken." ...|$|E
6000|$|And you, dark Senate of {{the public}} pen, [...] You may not, like yon tyrant, deal in spies. [...] Yours are the public acts of public men, [...] But <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> their {{household}} privacies. [...] I grant {{you one of the}} great Powers on earth, [...] But <b>be</b> <b>not</b> you the blatant traitors of the hearth.|$|R
6000|$|Said the prince, who {{despite all}} efforts could not entirely shake off his unhappy habit of being modest, [...] "Those very {{delicate}} hands of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> fit to ply the pankha.[FN#64] Why {{do you take}} so much trouble? I am cool and refreshed {{by the sight of}} you. Do give the fan to me and sit down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is useless," [...] {{he replied}} curtly. [...] "I am sorry for you. We all {{understand}} your feelings, that <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{the principles of}} the border. If you had lived long here you could appreciate what these outlaws and renegades have done to us. This man is a hardened criminal; he is a thief, a murderer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here are two hearts {{concerned}} in {{the affair}} already, {{and no one}} can foresee the consequences; but," [...] turning to Paul, [...] "describe, this miniature, if you please, for there are many in the vessel, and <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the only one that has been mislaid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Harry, don't {{let there}} be any subject between us that we don't care to think about and discuss. I know what you meant by not {{answering}} me. You meant to punish me, did you not, for having an opinion different from <b>yours?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>not</b> that true, Harry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear child, I do {{wish you}} would ever think to get any thing for yourself," [...] said Mrs. Ames. [...] "I cannot consent to use up all your earnings, as I have done lately, and all Ellen's too; {{you must have a}} new dress this spring, and that bonnet of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> decent any longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jean and Peter Stein," [...] said Henri. [...] "Why, Jacques, <b>are</b> they <b>not</b> {{friends of}} <b>yours?</b> <b>are</b> they <b>not</b> sons of Michael Stein, the smith?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} where the joke comes in," [...] she said, and took the Hoppers away to a distance, where the Horners could not hear them. [...] "You know," [...] she then explained, [...] "those neighbors of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> very bright, poor things, and {{what they think is}} a joke isn't a joke at all--it's true, don't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Wife, we will try, {{though to}} see such high visions the spirit should be calm, which I fear <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> not--nay, <b>be</b> <b>not</b> angry. We will try, we will try. Sit here now, and gaze, and above all be silent while I say the {{appropriate}} spells." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes... But Sue--my wife, as you are!" [...] {{he burst}} out; [...] "my old reproach to you was, after all, a true one. You have never loved me as I love you--never--never! <b>Yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a passionate heart--your heart does not burn in a flame! You are, upon the whole, {{a sort of}} fay, or sprite--not a woman!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} should {{conclude}} that, because Mr. Shiner wants a different music, he has any ill-feeling for you. I myself, I must own, prefer organ-music to any other. I consider it most proper, and feel justified in endeavouring to introduce it; but then, although other music is better, I don't say <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} keeping our end up," [...] he said, [...] "in the {{legitimate}} branch of our profession. You needn't grin like that," [...] he added, a little irritably. [...] "There is a legitimate side, and a very wonderful side, only a brain like <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> capable of assimilating it. You should have heard my paper to-night upon self-directed mesmeric waves." ...|$|E
6000|$|A cry of [...] "Shame!" [...] {{arose from}} the entire body of spectators; when it abated Rupert said, quietly but clearly, [...] "My prayers are said, Captain Muller. If <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> say them now, for assuredly I will kill you--not as a dog, for a dog is a true and {{faithful}} animal, but as I would kill a tiger, or any other beast whose existence was a scourge to mankind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have that}} pleasure," [...] he said quietly. [...] "Mr. Maddison is a {{neighbor}} of <b>yours,</b> <b>is</b> he <b>not?</b> I met him, you know, on a certain very melancholy occasion." ...|$|R
5000|$|Good man, did {{it never}} {{occur to you}} - an {{intelligent}} and mature man - [...] "I too am subject to ageing, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> exempt from ageing: surely I had better do good by body, speech, and mind"? ...This evil action of <b>yours</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> done by your mother or your father, or by your brother or your sister, or by your friends and companions, or by your kinsmen and relatives, or by recluses and brahmins, or by gods: this evil action was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its result.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you call}} this a nosegay?' said Elizabeth, 'I call it a forest of flowers. Really, a Consecration opens people's hearts;--I do not mean that <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> open enough on {{ordinary}} occasions, Aunt Anne; but when the children took their walk in the alms-house court this morning, they were loaded with flowers from all quarters, beginning with old Mr. Dillon offering Winifred his best variegated dahlia, by name Dod's Mary.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha, ha, ha!" [...] Mr. Jones {{let out a}} ghostly, squeaky laugh. [...] "I've {{never been}} placed in such a ridiculous {{position}} before," [...] he went on, with a sepulchral equanimity of tone. [...] "It's you, Martin, who dragged me into it. However, it's my own fault too. I ought to--but I was really too bored to use my brain, and <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to be trusted. You are a hothead!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{may be the}} stoutest of men hereabouts," [...] quoth Guy of Gisbourne, [...] "yet, I tell thee, fellow, this sty of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the wide}} world. I lay my life upon it I am the better man of the two. He an outlaw, forsooth! Why, I hear that he hath never let blood in all his life, saving {{when he first came}} to the forest. Some call him a great archer; marry, I would not be afraid to stand against him all the days of the year with a bow in my hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you've made a mistake," [...] said Miss Wilson, {{handing him}} back his money. [...] "Here. If it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>yours,</b> it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> ours; {{so you had}} better keep it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{cried the}} Portuguese interpreter, in broken English; [...] "you have saved our lives! Thank you, thank you! but {{all we have}} <b>is</b> <b>yours.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> much, but you may take it between you." [...] The amount was {{seventeen}} pounds! ...|$|R
