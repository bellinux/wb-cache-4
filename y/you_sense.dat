500|$|Pat {{has been}} portrayed by Joan Allen in the 1995 film Nixon, Patty McCormack in the 2008 film Frost/Nixon and Nicole Sullivan in the 2009 film Black Dynamite. She was sung by soprano Carolann Page in John Adams' opera Nixon in China 1987 world premiere in Houston, Texas; a New York Times critic {{noted that the}} {{performance}} captured [...] "the First Lady's shy mannerisms" [...] while one from the Los Angeles Times described the subject as the [...] "chronically demure First Lady". The part was later sung by Scottish soprano Janis Kelly in the 2011 Metropolitan Opera premiere in New York. This New York Times critic wrote that Kelly [...] "was wonderful as Pat Nixon. During the affecting Act II scene in which she is guided by Chinese escorts and journalists to a glass factory, a people's commune and a health clinic, she is finally taken to a school. She speaks of coming from a poor family and tells the obliging children {{that for a while}} she was a schoolteacher. In Mr. Adams's tender music, as sung by Ms. Kelly, <b>you</b> <b>sense</b> Mrs. Nixon wistfully pondering the much different life she might have had." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore is {{particularly}} known for playing troubled women, and specializes in [...] "ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions". Oliver Burkeman of The Guardian writes that her characters are typically [...] "struggling {{to maintain a}} purchase on normality {{in the face of}} some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure". Suzie Mackenzie, also of The Guardian, has identified a theme of [...] "characters in a state of alienation... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question." [...] Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until there comes a point when the character breaks. The journalist Kira Cochrane has identified this as a [...] "trademark moment" [...] in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the [...] "queen of the big-screen breakdown". [...] "When she does finally crack," [...] writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, [...] "it's a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore." [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is [...] "peerless" [...] in her [...] "portraits of troubled womanhood." [...] When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is [...] "a bit of a bore". [...] "Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty," [...] he says, [...] "and it's here that <b>you</b> <b>sense</b> the magic she is capable of." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{a handful}} of matches, Petracca became the {{favourite}} to win the Rising Star and received praise from Australian Football Hall of Fame members, Matthew Lloyd and Wayne Carey, with the former claiming his ability would bring fans through the gates, and the latter compared him to Norm Smith Medallist and three-time premiership player, Steve Johnson. Fox Sports Australia journalist, Ben Waterworth, made further comparisons to Steve Johnson, while also declaring Petracca edged Johnson with his overhead marking ability, with former St Kilda captain, Danny Frawley reiterating during the Queen's Birthday clash, [...] "every time he goes near the ball, <b>you</b> <b>sense</b> he's going to mark the ball because he's got a beautiful pair of hands." [...] He played every match following his debut, and finished the season with seventeen in total. After tailing off {{towards the end of}} the season, which he later attributed to his body tiring from the demands of AFL football, he finished sixth in the Rising Star and finished twelfth in Melbourne's best and fairest count. Despite finishing sixth in the Rising Star, he ranked first for inside-50s, second for goal assists and third for contested possessions per game out of all the Rising Star nominees. Furthermore, he was recognised as one of the best young players in the league when he was named in the 22under22 team on the half-forward flank.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, Killer Love {{received}} a mixed to positive response from critics. Some praised Scherzinger's strong vocals and conviction to convey emotion, while others criticized {{her choice of}} allowing RedOne to produce {{the majority of the}} album, stating that some of the songs sounded too similar to each other. The Observers Michael Cragg noted the album as being consistent with most other modern R albums, stating [...] "Killer Love is two thirds deliriously catchy pop stompers and one third balladry." [...] Cragg also noted that Scherzinger's [...] "not so inconsiderable voice" [...] takes a backseat allowing the record producers to inject their own influences into her music. Alex Macpherson from BBC Online commented that [...] "Scherzinger {{is one of the few}} pop performers with the requisite power to dominate [...] beats rather than vice versa. Killer Love is far from the album <b>you</b> <b>sense</b> Scherzinger could still deliver: at times, her personality is all that – barely – carries substandard, unmemorable songs." [...] Kim Dawson from The Daily Star was positive, saying that [...] "Nicole's solo record truly is killer and no filler." [...] Another positive reaction came from [...] "Entertainment Focus" [...] who went to say that: [...] "Killer Love is a competent and enjoyable record from one of the nicest women in pop. Fingers crossed this time it works out for her." [...] The 4Music review was also positive, noting that [...] "Killer Love will definitely establish her as a viable act in her own right." [...] Robert Copsey wrote favorably for Digital Spy that [...] "Killer Love is a sturdy debut from the part-time X Factor judge that, in part, lives up to her promise of being [...] "in your face and strong".|$|E
