40|$|Classroom inquiry moves {{beyond the}} {{standard}} teaching methodologies, expanding the horizons {{of teachers and}} students. Using inquiry-based teaching, teachers and students examine and issues and ideas in a self-directed study and then present their findings and conclusions through writing and oral presentations. <b>Inquiry</b> <b>yields</b> authentic assessment, which is imperative in a standards-driven society. However, inquiry is a non-exact science, and it is particularly difficult for teachers who were most comfortable in a very controlled environment. Success often comes through the act of exploration; the result may be teaching students a process rather than a fact or skill. Learning is tied to exploration and the excitement of discovery. According to Maxine Greene, by “refusing externally provided multiple-choice tests and being willing to see things big when they encounter students, teachers can devise the modes of teaching that are appropriate for these persons, that can leach them in diverse ways into what we now understand as inquiry ” (1995).

It will also discuss the performance related to equality, violence, and weak economic performance after the consolidation of democracy in 1985. Based on historical evidence, the paper will also provide explanations concerning the weak performance in Brazil. The case of Brazil provides a support that open access to political organizations and activities does not necessarily lead to better political representation. Further, open access in the political sphere does not necessarily result in better economic performance. The case of Brazil also shows that open access to economic organizations and activities {{in the absence of}} developing and improving the necessary interconnected institutions does not support economic performance. Empirical evidence in Brazil is a challenge to North and his colleagues concerning their theories on open access orders. This brings scholars back to institutional building and policy rationalization. Political scientists might have spent too much time on political contestation and participation.

40|$|Understanding the {{biosphere}} and howhuman activities affect it nearly al-ways requires {{the efforts of}} many in-vestigators, usually from various sci-entific disciplines. The collective analysis of data originally gathered by individuals but subse-quently stored in shared databases can <b>yield</b> in-sights beyond <b>inquiry</b> of a single data set. To put it all together, ecologists need large, complex data warehouses and data-mining facilities. 1, 2 A ma-jor barrier to such data warehouses is scientists’ inadequate documentation of field data so that others can use that data. Early integration of database technology into the research process would enable more efficient data documentation, but the payback to researchers for any additional work must be real and immediate. The Canopy Database Project is one of sev-eral national efforts building prototype systems that deepen {{our understanding of how}} field ecol-ogists could use database technology. It focuses on forest canopy research, an emerging ecolog-ical subfield. The canopy is one of the richest but most poorly studied habitats in {{the biosphere}} (see Figure 1). 3, 4 The field’s relative youth, with its lack of entrenched methods, legacy data sets, and conflicting camps of competing groups, pro-vides an excellent opportunity to integrate data management and analysis tools into the research process. And, because canopy research is inher-ently multidisciplinary, the work is generalizable to other fields of ecology. This article presents one aspect of our approach to building a data archive for canopy researchers. We show how small, ecologist-centered projects that produce immediate short-term value to par-ticipating researchers are essential to achieving long-term ecosystem informatics research and de-velopment goals. Such projects keep ecologists interested and involved, provide experience with real data and problems, and increase our ability to use effective software engineering techniques to construct larger systems iteratively...|$|R
40|$|Our {{life stories}} {{enable us to}} reflect upon and share our {{personal}} histories. Through emerging digital technologies the possibility of collecting life experiences digitally is increasingly feasible; consequently so is the potential to create a digital counterpart to our personal narratives. In this work, lifelogging tools are used to collect digital artifacts continuously and passively throughout our day. These include images, documents, emails and webpages accessed; texts messages and mobile activity. This range of data when brought together {{is known as a}} lifelog. Given the complexity, volume and multimodal nature of such collections, it is clear that there are significant challenges to be addressed in order to achieve coherent and meaningful digital narratives of our events from our life histories. This work investigates the construction of personal digital narratives from lifelog collections. It examines the underlying questions, issues and challenges relating to construction of personal digital narratives from lifelogs. Fundamentally, it addresses how to organize and transform data sampled from an individual’s day-to-day activities into a coherent narrative account. This enquiry is enabled by three 20 -month long-term lifelogs collected by participants and produces a narrative system which enables the semi-automatic construction of digital stories from lifelog content. Inspired by probative studies conducted into current practices of curation, from which a set of fundamental requirements are established, this solution employs a 2 -dimensional spatial framework for storytelling. It delivers integrated support for the structuring of lifelog content and its distillation into storyform through information retrieval approaches. We describe and contribute flexible algorithmic approaches to achieve both. Finally, this research <b>inquiry</b> <b>yields</b> qualitative and quantitative insights into such digital narratives and their generation, composition and construction. The opportunities for such personal narrative accounts to enable recollection, reminiscence and reflection with the collection owners are established and its benefit in sharing past personal experience experiences is outlined.

The program was selected because it sustained the involvement of parents for a prolonged period of time. It was also selected because the program was facilitated by social workers. ^ Derived from the literature, four lines of inquiry were examined: (a) the relationship between PI and parent strengths and development; (b) the relationship between PI and children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement; (c) facilitators for PI; and (d) barriers to PI. These lines of <b>inquiry</b> <b>yielded</b> the study 2 ̆ 7 s four primary research questions.

All 33 parents resided in a high poverty community. ^ Quantitative methods were selected to examine differences between study participants and PI. Measures of parental empowerment, social support, self-esteem, and direct and indirect measures of their children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement were utilized. Qualitative methods were developed to identify and describe SI and NSI parents 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of facilitators for and barriers to PI. ^ This study 2 ̆ 7 s findings suggest that PI may yield important benefits for SI parents.

40|$|South Africa {{has been}} in a process of {{far-reaching}} restructuring and currently is still experiencing a bombardment of many educational change policies. Education policy for educational change only becomes reality once it is implemented at the micro (classroom) level. Teachers indeed are the key role-players in this implementation phase and are unfortunately, more often than not, the silent voices in this process, ignored and discounted in this stage of educational change. How they experience and understand the policy change, or how the human side of policy change is contextualized, remains a mystery to be explored and explained. Furthermore, despite the growing literature on educational change and policy change, relatively little has been done on the experiences of primary school teachers and policy change in the context of developing countries such as South Africa. Available international literature on teachers’ experiences of policy change relates mostly to educational practices that are well-resourced, where teachers are highly qualified, and teacher-student ratios are low. It appears reasonable to assume that teachers’ experiences of education policy change in developing South African circumstances would be influenced and constructed by the contexts in which they work. The broad purpose of this inquiry is to describe and explain primary school teachers’ experiences of education policy change in South Africa. The immediate objective is to obtain new, deeper and more complex understandings of the less obvious issues that influence teachers’ roles as implementers of education policy change. This study was conducted in an interpretive or qualitative mode. The following key question guided this investigation. How do primary school teachers experience education policy change? Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and open-ended questionnaires were utilized in this study. This data was transcribed, and analysed using computer-aided qualitative data software, Atlas. ti. The data was analysed inductively, using open coding and a grounded theory approach. This approach facilitated the coding process of the data. The data was interpreted {{on the basis of the}} literature, and presented in the last two chapters of this report. The findings from this inquiry revealed four significant and interdependent themes, with a variety of sub-themes, which appear meaningful in understanding education policy change from the perspectives of teachers. These include the affective domain, emotional responses and contestations, issues relating to discipline and control, outcomes-based education, and lastly matters of values, teacher roles and their view of professionalism. While the contributions of this inquiry are not original in the sense of a prototype, the findings could add to the knowledge base of the complexities of education policy change. Some further questions are raised, which emerged during the inquiry and which might contribute to additional investigations on a wider spectrum and launch some critical debates on education policy change. The <b>inquiry</b> <b>yields</b> some concluding thoughts, which may inform policy change and its implementation. Thesis (PhD (Education Management)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} how the art student {{teaching}} seminar {{can serve as a}} space for inquiry and reflection, and how student teachers process their experiences, negotiate personal meanings, and understand teaching complexities through inquiry based methods. The overarching question in this research study asked: How might participation in an inquiry based seminar impact the meaning student teachers make from their practicum experiences? In order to address this main question, I employed three sub-questions: How do art student teachers perceive and describe their teaching field experiences in a seminar space? What kinds of inquiry activities can facilitate reflection with art student teachers? How do art teachers relate to and value inquiry based methods of reflection?I approached these questions through a constructivist framework that supports the idea that individuals actively construct and reconstruct their own understandings, meanings, and ultimately knowledge of the world through experience and reflection upon these experiences. Utilizing a case study methodology I designed a multi-case qualitative study that aimed to interpret the student teacher seminar through the experiences of four art student teacher participants. I was the facilitator of the student teaching seminar course at a large, public university in the Southwestern United States and the art student teachers and I met roughly every two weeks, {{over the course of a}} 16 week semester, on the university campus. I implemented a scaffolded, inquiry based curriculum which offered a variety of methods aimed to encourage inquiry and promote reflection amongst student teachers. Research data consisted of seminar audio recordings, participants' written journal entries, participants' artworks, and my reflective researcher notes. Employing narrative data analysis I constructed a case for each participant using the assignments as both chronological organization and categorical scaffolding for the arrangement and presentation of the data. I then compared the individual cases to identify similarities and differences within the whole. My analysis of research findings indicated the following: First, student teachers identified personal concerns related to affective awareness, vulnerability from uncertainty, desire for efficacy, and identity confusion during their student teaching experiences. Second, written forms of inquiry produced evidence of open-mindedness and responsibility amongst student teacher participants, while artistic forms of <b>inquiry</b> <b>yielded</b> evidence of wholeheartedness and self-knowledge amongst student teacher participants. Third, the data indicated that although benefits could be located in written inquiry, participants attached little value or meaning to this method; whereas, artistic inquiry was perceived as an especially impactful and meaningful method of inquiry by student teacher participants. Overall, the student teaching seminar served as a space where student teacher participants shared stories, described contexts, identified issues, navigated tensions, and exhibited personal and insightful developments that demonstrated reflective learning connected to self-understanding and personal growth. Implications for the research suggest that facilitators of such a course should have a concentrated awareness of the constraints of the seminar structure; approach problem exploring rather than problem solving techniques with teacher candidates; and that there is an acute need for supportive and safe spaces for student teachers to process their experiences through multiple methods. This study generated detailed insight into art student teachers' unequivocally unique, yet fundamentally shared journeys, in processing, negotiating, and ultimately understanding their practicum experiences.

40|$|There is a long-held {{assumption}} that Outdoor Adventure Education (OAE) can develop character. However, {{little research has}} explored this belief. While many practitioners, and some scholars, remain committed to character development through OAE, the literature also reveals {{a growing body of}} discomfort and suspicion surrounding this assumption. This dissent centres on the vague nature of the term “character,” and the moral philosophical complexities surrounding the concept of character itself. Until “character” is more clearly explicated, any resolution to the current confusion is unlikely. This thesis employs Aristotle’s virtue theory, as espoused in his Nicomachean Ethics, to articulate an understanding of character. Although several scholars have used virtue ethics, commonly referred to as character ethics, to support their claims of character development through OAE, these treatments have been preliminary, warranting this more detailed account. When viewed from this virtue ethical perspective, the question, “Can character be developed through OAE?,” becomes problematic. For Aristotle cautions that different subjects of <b>inquiry</b> <b>yield</b> differing levels of accuracy, and with regard to ethical investigations, such as those into character, one must be content to “indicate the truth roughly and in outline” (I 3 § 4). Further complicating the matter, Aristotle asserts that virtue, a disposition, and the building block of character is gradually and arduously inculcated {{over long periods of time}} (I 7 § 16). While virtue theory implies that radical character transformation is, in any context, unlikely over brief stints of time, this does not mean that OAE programmes are of little moral worth. To the contrary, a detailed examination into a virtue ethical understanding of character suggests that certain elements of OAE programmes may xii have strong moral relevance. This relevance is found in Aristotle’s three conditions that cultivate the development of virtue, conditions readily found within many OAE courses: moral reflection; moral practice; and sharing in the moral lives of others. Drawing on my own interest and experience within OAE, an expedition seemed an ideal setting to explore the presence and content of Aristotle’s three conditions. In hope of discovering this moral narrative, a qualitative case study was conducted on a two-week wilderness expedition in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. The expedition was a first-year transition experience for students attending a Christian liberal college in the United States. Utilising interviews as a primary method, and observations and texts as secondary methods, the research explored the participants’ expedition experience from a virtue ethical perspective. A thematic analysis revealed that participants reported reflecting on their moral lives in both formal (e. g. group reviews, solo, journals) and informal (e. g. while hiking and performing camp chores) settings. Similarly, whether through the mental and physical endurance required in off-trail navigation, or the care expressed through the acts of service and gracious tolerance necessitated by the social demands of expeditionary life, the participants viewed their wilderness travel as a constant opportunity for moral practice. Lastly, the participants identified the community formed on their expedition to be integral to their increased moral self-perception. Although a virtue ethical perspective precludes claiming anything definitive regarding the participants’ character development, at the least, the expedition can be said to have contributed to their moral journey in ways that are directly relevant to their character...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to chart the {{resources}} and background factors involved in the life control of dismissed, unemployed women, previously working in the budget account centre of the Kouvola office of Finnish National Savings Bank and dismissed in 1993. The study is a continuation of the Master's Thesis written in 1995, dealing with the same group. The {{aim of the}} study was to describe the changes in the central features of the life control of the employees atter the dismissal. A particular emphasis was put on the stability/changes in various sub-groups of the dismissed employees, categorized on the basis of their life control resources, as well as their "coping" during years 1995 - 1999, the period after the dismissal. Another point of focus was whether it was possible to make predictions about the coping vs. alienation on the basis of the situation in 1995 - whether the dismissal had led to one inevitable outcome. The frame of reference {{of the study was}} based on previous research into unemployment. The outlining key concepts were life control and resources of life control. Life control was described in terms of both internal and external life control. Both social background factors and social support were viewed as external life control resources. The description of internal life control resources was based on a reliance on the manageability of life and a feeling of happiness. The material studied in the research was gathered using a standardized telephone interview questionnaire, and the method used in the gathering of the material was telephone interview. The total number of observations in the original material was 119, and the telephone <b>inquiry</b> <b>yielded</b> 98 responses. The basic quantitative and qualitative methods used in the field of social studies were applied in the analysis of the material, the main emphasis being on the quantitative approach. The definition was mainly based on viewing the variables in terms of distribution, averages and deviations. At the first stage of the study, correlation coefficients and factor analysis were applied in order to clarify the parameters of the various conceptual fields and to t emulate the compound variables. At the second stage of the study (1999), the subgroups were classified on the basis of a cluster analysis, and the significance of life control in the various subgroups was charted through cross-tabulation. The open-ended questions of the qualitative material were mainly used for the purpose of illustrating the quantitative approach. Despite the constant uniformity of the subgroups observed during the years 1995 - 1999 in terms of coping/alienation, a survey of case studies carried out in 1999 seems to have confirmed the outcome of the study made in 1995, namely that alienation and coping can be experienced in a variety of ways. It seems that previous strength in terms of life control does not necessarily imply coping with life after the dismissal. On the other hand, previous deficiencies in life control do not seem to imply a lack of solutions in problematic situations. In addition to the material based on telephone interviews, the primary sources used in the research process were studies to which unemployment was observed from the viewpoint of life control/alienation.
