25|$|In Rationality in Action (2001), Searle {{argues that}} {{standard}} notions of rationality are badly flawed. According {{to what he}} calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something like a train track: <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel you all the way to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.|$|E
500|$|Canada {{entered the}} final facing {{pressure}} {{to defeat the}} Soviets. [...] The Soviet national team's easy victory over the National Hockey League's all-stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup left the Canadians searching to regain command of their rivalry with the Soviets. [...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember you for a long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the bus after the game and admire you." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , but when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> set {{you have so many}} different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E

500|$|Ion Storm {{contracted}} Soundelux Design Music Group {{to provide}} music for Anachronox. The firm hired Bill Brown for additional music. Tom Hall {{was impressed with}} Brown's work, particularly music for the planet Democratus. Hall worked with musician Ron Jones and a local Dallas band to record the game's two funk numbers by mid-1998. Tom Hall planned for each character {{to have their own}} theme music, and for songs to change via interaction or exploration. He spoke of the planned music, [...] "The Anachronox sound will be industrial, mixed with forties bluesy swing. As <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> later in the game, the music gets scarier, more chaotic, and gets down to hard-core metal." [...] Developers integrated DirectMusic support in 1999 to allow dynamic changing of background music. Sound programmer Henrik Jonsson implemented 3D sound and other capabilities using the Miles Sound System. Developers also planned to use software called Magpie Pro to lip-sync animated mouths to spoken words. The team chose not to record voices for each line of dialogue, as Tom Hall felt certain speech would become repetitive. The Undermain Theatre group of Dallas provided several voices. Tom Hall voiced PAL-18 reportedly because [...] "no one else got it goofy enough".|$|E
500|$|Shelley (Daily Mail) {{regularly}} spoke negatively of {{the character}} and wrote, [...] "The most eccentric member of the Carter clan may dress like a female version of Compo from Last of The Summer Wine but she acts like the meanest con in Prisoner Cell Block H." [...] He added that the characters of Babe, Sylvie and Stan are [...] "unremittingly grim and unappealing", but Babe was namingly [...] "gratuitously vile". Shelley was pleased when Babe left in May 2015 and said [...] "the last thing anyone wanted was {{for her to come}} back" [...] when discussing her return in September 2015. Laura Morgan of Digital Spy praised Babe's introduction, writing that her addition [...] "worked beautifully". Sally Brockway, writing for magazine Soaplife, wrote, [...] "She may rustle up a mean trifle, but you'll pay the price if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the wrong side of Aunt Babe Smith." [...] Ellis (Inside Soap) said, [...] "Of all the villains in Walford, we never would have thought that a trifle-making, Reliant-Robin-driving, apron-wearing aunt {{would turn out to be}} the most fearsome! She may not have the brute force of Phil Mitchell or the steely determination of Gavin Sullivan, but Babe is not someone we'd ever want to do battle with." [...] A reporter from Soaplife noted that [...] " [...] Babe's own desperation that makes her the monster of the woman she is..." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, all of that stuff - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. Or I could no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E

2500|$|Felt was {{publicly}} {{optimistic about}} the American intervention, declaring at a 1963 press conference that the war could be won in three years. He bristled at {{members of the press}} who did not seem sufficiently enthusiastic about ongoing American military operations. Introduced to Associated Press correspondent Malcolm W. Browne at a Saigon press conference, Felt growled, [...] "So you're Browne. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the team?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} afternoon, Petrelis, {{dressed in a}} mock {{concentration}} camp uniform with a pink triangle, told a panel on confidentiality, “There’s {{no such thing as}} confidentiality. I can tell you, as soon as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> Social Security, your disability is AIDS, and everybody knows it.” Petrelis accused federal health officials of genocide in mishandling the AIDS epidemic and said, “You locked up the Japanese during World War II, and you’ll do it again if you want to. You should start talking about new treatments.” Lavender Hill Mob members also passed out leaflets that said “Test drugs, not people,” and referred to the CDC as “Center for Detention Camps.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{international}} public {{following the}} trial received the verdict with varying opinions. Some high-profile copyright holders publicly defended the verdict, with former Beatles member Paul McCartney commenting to the BBC that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> a bus, you've got to pay. And I think it's fair, you {{should pay for}} your ticket." [...] Mark Mulligan from Forrester Research considered the verdict very important for music industry PR, and copyright holder organisations indeed praised it as a landmark verdict. Likewise, The European Association of Internet Service Providers welcomed the verdict, commending judicial resolution to copyright infringement issues over internet filtering or three strikes policies. The Economist went further by criticising that the sentence {{might not have been}} strong enough to act as a deterrent for setting up similar services in the future.|$|E

2500|$|Paul {{warned the}} Galatians {{that those who}} live in idolatry “will not inherit the kingdom of God,” and in the same passage {{associates}} witchcraft with idolatry. In his letter to the Philippians, he refers to those whose “god is their stomach.” [...] In several New Testament scriptures, including the Sermon on the Mount, the term idolatry is applied to the love of money. The apostle James rebukes those who focus on material things, using language similar to that of Old Testament prophets: “When you ask , you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> your pleasures. You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Beg" [...] is a midtempo pop {{song with}} a percussion-driven chorus, about a {{relationship}} growing distant. [...] "Died and Gone to Heaven" [...] {{is an old}} school R song of love and passion, which features big harmonies and falsetto vocals. [...] "Gold" [...] is an uptempo soul song. Sebastian inserted a horn line into it from [...] "Shake", a live recording of an Otis Redding track. He said, [...] "You hear an old soul track, old Motown or Memphis, and it just makes <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> your feet." [...] "Battle Scars", a collaboration with Lupe Fiasco, is an R ballad with a hip hop rap about the scars left from hurtful and broken relationships. Sebastian said that usually when he writes a song he comes up with the melody first with no words, but this time some of the lyrics came at the same time. After finishing the song with David Ryan Harris it was recorded leaving the parts where Sebastian envisaged the rap should go. When Fiasco was in Australia for Supafest, Sebastian recorded his rap at his Sydney studio.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Beale {{has gone}} on to be the longest running {{character}} in the soap's history and, until the returns of Sharon Watts in August 2012, Kathy Beale in February 2015 and Michelle Fowler in December 2016, was the only remaining original character. Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm {{not going to get the}} chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series? And you're not going to get the same viewing figures either. You have your moments when things go wrong and you perhaps don't want to work with a certain person. In any office there are going to be people who don't get along but <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with it and on the whole I enjoy it. Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember. There have been peaks and troughs, like with any show, but right now things are good." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New Testament {{also uses}} the term [...] "idol" [...] in {{reference}} to conceptual constructs, as in Paul’s letter to the church in Colosse: [...] "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed which is idolatry." [...] This expands the scope of that which is included in idolatry to certain behaviors and priorities, which capture attention and regard {{at the expense of}} that which is owed to God. (See also Thou shalt have no other gods before me.) Paul warned the Galatians that those who live in idolatry [...] "will not inherit the kingdom of God", and in the same passage associates witchcraft with idolatry. In his letter to the Philippians, he refers to those whose [...] "god is their stomach". [...] In several New Testament scriptures, including the Sermon on the Mount, the term idolatry is applied to the love of money.
