She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> <b>You</b> always remember them. There was something about her. She basically made me feel very good about myself as a 15-year-old girl."

[...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have {{me for the rest of}} <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> <b>you</b> don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.'

But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about.

500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> <b>you</b> get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 13, 2011, Kiss began {{recording}} {{a new album}} due for release later in the year. Simmons stated, the album [...] "is gonna be the next step to Sonic Boom. Very similar– straight rock songs, no ballads, no keyboards, no nothing, just rock." [...] The band also used old analog equipment instead of more popular digital recording gear. Simmons said: [...] "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't have to do anything. But analog is the love of <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> <b>You</b> can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board.

2500|$|Estruch cites, for instance, {{the fact}} that the first edition of Escrivá's The Way, {{finished}} in Burgos and published in Valencia during 1939, had the dateline Año de la Victoria ("Year of the Victory"), referring to Franco's military triumph over the Republican forces in the civil war, as well as a prologue by a pro-Franco bishop, Msgr. Xavier Lauzurica, which ended with the admonition to the reader to [...] "always stay vigilant and alert, because the enemy does not sleep. If you make these maxims <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> <b>you</b> will be a perfect imitator of Jesus Christ and a gentleman without blemish. And with Christs like you Spain will return to the old grandeur of its saints, wise men, and heroes."

Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was {{handed over to the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: [...] "It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, to do what you can with the rest of <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> <b>You</b> are still a young man.

2500|$|Concurrently {{with his}} {{individual}} achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Real Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. In the knockout {{phase of the}} competition, he scored a brace in each leg of a 9–2 aggregate win against Schalke 04, helping Madrid advance to the quarter-finals. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Borussia Dortmund—his 100th Champions League match—took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before. After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final victory over Atlético Madrid, becoming {{the first player to}} score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: [...] "In <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>you</b> do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks." [...] As the Champions League top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|W. B. Yeats and Arthur Symons {{described}} Nietzsche as {{the intellectual}} heir to William Blake. Symons {{went on to}} compare {{the ideas of the}} two thinkers in The Symbolist Movement in Literature, while Yeats tried to raise awareness of Nietzsche in Ireland. A similar notion was espoused by W. H. Auden who wrote of Nietzsche in his New Year Letter (released in 1941 in The Double Man): [...] "O masterly debunker of our liberal fallacies [...] all <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>you</b> stormed, like your English forerunner Blake". Nietzsche made an impact on composers during the 1890s. Writer on music Donald Mitchell notes that Gustav Mahler was [...] "attracted to the poetic fire of Zarathustra, but repelled by the intellectual core of its writings." [...] He also quotes Mahler himself, and adds that he was influenced by Nietzsche's conception and affirmative approach to nature, which Mahler presented in his Third Symphony using Zarathustra's roundelay. Frederick Delius produced a piece of choral music, A Mass of Life, based on a text of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, while Richard Strauss (who also based his Also sprach Zarathustra on the same book), was only interested in finishing [...] "another chapter of symphonic autobiography". Famous writers and poets influenced by Nietzsche include André Gide, August Strindberg, Robinson Jeffers, Pío Baroja, D. H. Lawrence, Edith Södergran and Yukio Mishima.|$|E
