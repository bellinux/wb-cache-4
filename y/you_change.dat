25|$|Reason {{and logic}} can however {{be thought of}} as distinct, {{although}} logic is one important aspect of reason. Author Douglas Hofstadter, in Gödel, Escher, Bach, characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if <b>you</b> <b>change</b> the rules of the system.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} Democratic primary debate, the presidential {{candidates}} were asked whether black lives matter or all lives matter.

[...] In response, Hillary Clinton pushed for criminal justice reform, and said, [...] "We need a new New Deal for communities of color." [...] Jim Webb, on the other hand, replied: [...] "As the president of the United States, every life in this country matters." [...] Hillary Clinton was not directly asked the same question, but was instead asked: [...] "What would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?" [...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe <b>you</b> <b>change</b> hearts.

500|$|The 12-6 elbow {{has often}} been criticized for its brutality, however, the rules prohibiting them have also been criticized. In particular, {{it has been argued}} that the term [...] "downward elbow strikes" [...] is too strict, as it only applies to {{straight}} motions and does not make elbows on an arc illegal. Matt Hume, chief referee of the One Fighting Championship, explained that while 12-6 elbows were illegal, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>change</b> the time to 11:59, it is no longer illegal." [...] Hume felt that the authors of the Unified Rules did not have an understanding of MMA, with McCarthy affirming that view by stating that Lembo [...] "wasn't a big MMA guy at the time". Hume also argued that the rule meant that other elbow strikes that could gain more velocity than 12-6 elbows were legal yet were hitting with the same point of the elbow.|$|E

500|$|After being {{attacked}} by the crows, Homer is seen being treated by Dr. Hibbert at the Springfield General Hospital. While there are no visible scars on him, the character instead has a slightly curled hair. During a color screening of the scene, Homer's body looked [...] "a little too bloody" [...] and damaged, prompting the staff to change it. [...] "One thing I learned {{a long time ago}} is, you gotta be careful how <b>you</b> <b>change</b> [...] basic model pack", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary. He also said that he was happy that many viewers identify with the characters and don't want to see them get hurt or injured in any way. [...] "They don't mind if [...] falls down a cliff but [...] he should recover." [...] While working on the episode, the series' staff debated what size to make Homer's pupils when he is under the influence of marijuana. Because a common effect of smoking marijuana is to get dilated pupils, the animators initially suggested to widen them, but settled on only dilating Homer's pupils slightly.|$|E

According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If <b>you</b> <b>change</b> my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cyrus, {{the song}} had {{been rejected by}} several country artists. It was eventually picked up by Peter Chelsom, director of Hannah Montana: The Movie, who gave it to Cyrus to record for the film. Chelsom found what would become [...] "The Climb" [...] while visiting Nashville, Tennessee, during a quest to find eleven new songs for Hannah Montana: The Movie. After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded [...] "It's the Climb" [...] on a CD {{and gave it to}} him. Several weeks later, Chelsom called to say that [...] "the song was gonna {{be an integral part of}} the movie". However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song from third person to first person. Alexander felt the changes amounted to a [...] "substantial amount of the song" [...] and commented, [...] "For me, when <b>you</b> <b>change</b> something from third person to first person, it can change the whole meaning of a line." [...] She and Mabe [...] "wrestl over taking words out" [...] and how much they could change while maintaining the song's integrity. After a number of drafts, Mabe and Alexander finally created a version they felt was [...] "perfect for the movie".|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then {{he pulled out the}} pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and <b>you</b> <b>change</b> one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E

500|$|On the {{decision}} to downplay Raziel's quest for vengeance against Kain in this sequel, Hennig explained, [...] "he's being pretty simple-minded, he's sort of being very black-and-white in his interpretation of things, and being kind of petulant [...] he's not really as heroic as Kain is, {{and he has a}} lot of stuff to figure out, basically, about what's going on". Soul Reaver 2 was crafted to feature a more cinematic, story-focused experience than its predecessor, which the developers felt had been [...] "patchy" [...] in this regard. It entered production after Blood Omen 2, but shipped almost six months before the latter game. A separate team within Crystal Dynamics, with creative autonomy, developed Blood Omen 2, and contradictions created by its scenario hindered work on Soul Reaver 2. After researching time travel fiction, Hennig devised a subplot concerning temporal paradoxes to resolve the continuity problems between both titles, and established that Blood Omen 2s story is a product of the final paradox created when Kain saves Raziel at the end of Soul Reaver 2. Other themes were inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, and theology surrounding Gnosticism. Concepts which formulated the crux of the story included the idea [...] "that the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path", and the question, [...] "can <b>you</b> <b>change</b> history or not? And if so, what does it mean to change history - in terms of being responsible for the repercussions?" ...|$|E
