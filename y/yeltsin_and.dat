5|$|In early 1996 a {{group of}} Moscow academics, journalists and intellectuals {{suggested}} that Vladimir Bukovsky should run for President of Russia as an alternative candidate to both incumbent President Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> his main challenger Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. However, no formal nomination process was initiated.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} August Coup of 1991 Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> the Ministry of Finance of the RSFSR claimed {{authority}} over the Ministry of Finance of the USSR, the state bank and the Bank of Foreign Economic Activity. This meant that the institutions could not carry out any orders {{without the consent of}} the RSFSR government. The Ministry of Finance continued functioning until the RSFSR government issued a decree completing its takeover of the Soviet financial system. It was succeeded by the Ministry of Economics and Finance of the Russian Federation (1991) and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (1992). The last Soviet Minister of Finance was Vladimir Yefimovich Orlov, and Vladimir Rayevsky was acting Minister during the period of transition.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Jack Matlock, United States {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union, told Gorbachev {{of the possibility of}} a coup attempt against him, and the Soviet leader became worried when Anatoly Chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside Moscow. On 21 June, four days after Pavlov's speech, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and Pavlov. Even when {{he had been able to}} secure his position, Gorbachev's power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was not over, with Gorbachev promising <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the Chairman of the KGB, would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty.|$|E

5|$|The first manned mission flown from an {{independent}} Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM-14, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the EO-11 crew to Mir, docking on 19 March before {{the departure of}} Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, Russian President Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> US President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle-Mir programme, a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of Spektr and Priroda). EO-12 followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel Tognini. The following crew, EO-13, began preparations for the Shuttle-Mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, Soyuz TM-16 (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an APAS-89 docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to dock to Kristall and test the port which would later be used by US space shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's longitudinal axis, in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called Rezonans conducted on 28 January. Soyuz TM-15, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.|$|E
25|$|On 9 August 1999 Yeltsin {{fired his}} prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, {{and for the}} fourth time, fired his entire cabinet. In Stepashin's place he {{appointed}} Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor. In late 1999 <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> President Clinton openly disagreed {{on the war in}} Chechnya. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Clinton pointed his finger at <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties.

25|$|The {{constitutional}} crisis of 1993 {{was a political}} stand-off between the Russian president Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> the Russian parliament that was resolved by using military force. The relations {{between the president and}} the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The {{constitutional crisis}} reached a tipping point on September21, 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the Congress of People's Deputies and its Supreme Soviet), although the president did not have the power to dissolve the parliament according to the constitution. Yeltsin used the results of the referendum of April 1993 to justify his actions. In response, the parliament declared that the president's decision was null and void, impeached <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> proclaimed vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy to be acting president.|$|E
25|$|This time, the Constitutional Court {{supported}} <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> {{ruled that}} the president required only a simple majority on two issues: confidence in him, and economic and social policy; he would need the support of half the electorate in order to call new parliamentary and presidential elections.|$|E

25|$|At {{the crucial}} {{moments of the}} August Coup, arguably the last attempt by the Soviet hardliners to prevent {{the breakup of the}} state, some {{military}} units did enter Moscow to act against Boris Yeltsin but ultimately refused to crush the protesters surrounding the Russian parliament building. In effect, the leadership of the Soviet military decided to side with Gorbachev and <b>Yeltsin,</b> <b>and</b> thus finally doomed the old order.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 1987, after {{a lecture}} from hard-liner Yegor Ligachev at the Politburo for {{allowing}} two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, Yeltsin {{wrote a letter}} of resignation to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea. When Gorbachev received the letter he was stunned – nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned {{from the ranks of}} the Politburo. Gorbachev phoned <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> asked him to reconsider.|$|E

During the Soviet epoch, it was turned into the most high-profile cemetery in the Soviet Union, with the likes of Peter Kropotkin, Nikita Khrushchev, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Konstantin Stanislavski, Boris <b>Yeltsin,</b> <b>and</b> Mstislav Rostropovich being interred there.|$|E

Ligachyov was critical of <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> Gorbachev to an extent, although he is often held as most remarkable for being Gorbachev's primary critic.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin's December 1992 {{compromise}} with the seventh Congress of the People's Deputies temporarily backfired. Early 1993 saw increasing tension between <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>and</b> the parliament over {{the language of the}} referendum and power sharing. In a series of collisions over policy, the congress whittled away the president's extraordinary powers, which it had granted him in late 1991. The legislature, marshaled by Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, began to sense that it could block and even defeat the president. The tactic that it adopted was gradually to erode presidential control over the government. In response, the president called a referendum on a constitution for April11.|$|E
