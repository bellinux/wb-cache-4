5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} <b>yeast.</b> In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the <b>yeast</b> is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} <b>yeast</b> and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the <b>yeast</b> also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the role}} of <b>yeast</b> in {{fermentation}} was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts. A few styles such as lambics rely on this method today, but most modern fermentation adds pure <b>yeast</b> cultures.|$|E
5|$|The fungi {{have several}} {{unicellular}} species, such as baker's <b>yeast</b> (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission <b>yeast</b> (Schizosaccharomyces pombe).

50|$|<b>Yeasts</b> {{are very}} common in the environment, and are often {{isolated}} from sugar-rich materials. Examples include naturally occurring <b>yeasts</b> on the skins of fruits and berries (such as grapes, apples, or peaches), and exudates from plants (such as plant saps or cacti). Some <b>yeasts</b> are found in association with soil and insects. The ecological function and biodiversity of <b>yeasts</b> are relatively unknown compared {{to those of other}} microorganisms. <b>Yeasts,</b> including Candida albicans, Rhodotorula rubra, Torulopsis and Trichosporon cutaneum, have been found living in between people's toes as part of their skin flora. <b>Yeasts</b> are also present in the gut flora of mammals and some insects and even deep-sea environments host an array of <b>yeasts.</b>|$|R

40|$|Dekkera <b>yeasts</b> {{have often}} been {{considered}} as alternative sources of ethanol production that could compete with S. cerevisiae. The two lineages of <b>yeasts</b> independently evolved traits that include high glucose and ethanol tolerance, aerobic fermentation, and a rapid ethanol fermentation rate. The Saccharomyces <b>yeasts</b> attained these traits mainly through whole genome duplication approximately 100 million years ago (Mya). However, the Dekkera <b>yeasts,</b> which were separated from S. cerevisiae approximately 200 Mya, did not undergo whole genome duplication (WGD) but still occupy a niche similar to S. cerevisiae. Upon analysis of two Dekkera <b>yeasts</b> and five closely related non-WGD <b>yeasts,</b> we found that a massive loss of cis-regulatory elements occurred in an ancestor of the Dekkera <b>yeasts,</b> which led to improved mitochondrial functions similar to the S. cerevisiae <b>yeasts.</b> The evolutionary analysis indicated that genes involved in the transcription and translation process exhibited faster evolution in the Dekkera <b>yeasts.</b> We detected 90 positively selected genes, suggesting that the Dekkera <b>yeasts</b> evolved an efficient translation system to facilitate adaptive evolution. Moreover, we identified that 12 vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) function genes that were under positive selection, which assists in developing tolerance to high alcohol and high sugar stress. We also revealed that the enzyme PGK 1 {{is responsible for the}} increased rate of glycolysis in the Dekkera <b>yeasts.</b> These results provide important insights to understand the independent adaptive evolution of the Dekkera <b>yeasts</b> and provide tools for genetic modification promoting industrial usage...|$|R

5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} <b>yeast</b> by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans.

40|$|Human {{neutrophils}} (PMN) demonstrated potent fungistatic activity against Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) <b>yeasts</b> in {{a sensitive}} microassay that quantifies {{the growth of}} <b>yeasts</b> by the incorporation of [3 H]leucine. At a PMN:yeast ratio of 1 : 2, PMN inhibited the growth of <b>yeasts</b> by 37 %. Maximum inhibition of 85 % to 95 % was achieved at a PMN/yeast ratio of 10 : 1 to 50 : 1. Opsonization of the <b>yeasts</b> in fresh or heat-inactivated serum was required for PMN-mediated fungistasis, but ingestion of the <b>yeasts</b> was not required. Recognition and phagocytosis of opsonized <b>yeasts</b> was via PMN complement receptor (CR) type 1 (CR 1), CR 3, and FcRIII (CD 16). PMN fungistatic activity was evident by 2 h, was maximum at 24 h, and persisted up to 5 d. In contrast, <b>yeasts</b> multiplied within monocytes {{to a greater extent}} than in culture medium alone. PMN from three patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) inhibited the growth of Hc <b>yeasts</b> by an average of 97 %, compared with 86 % in three normal controls. Furthermore, preincubation of PMN with the lysosomotropic agent NH 4 Cl inhibited fungistatic activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, experiments with subcellular fractions of PMN demonstrated that the principal component of the fungistatic activity of PMN was localized in the azurophil granules. These data demonstrate that human PMN possess potent fungistatic activity against Hc <b>yeasts</b> and further show that fungistasis is mediated by antimicrobial agents contained in the azurophil granules...|$|R
