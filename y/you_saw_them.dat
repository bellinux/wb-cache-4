500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They sat down at desks. I have no clue what work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, you looked the other way, you'd leave the area if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeni LeGon, a {{black female}} tap dance star, recalls {{her life as}} a film dancer: [...] "But of course, in those times it was a 'black-and-white world.' You didn't {{associate}} too much socially with any of the stars. <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> at the studio, you know, nice—but they didn't invite. The only ones that ever invited us home for a visit was Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler." [...] British performer Brian Conley, former star of the 1995 British play Jolson, stated during an interview, [...] "I found out Jolson was actually a hero to the black people of America. At his funeral, black actors lined the way, they really appreciated what he'd done for them." [...] Noble Sissle, then president of the Negro Actors Guild, represented that organization at his funeral.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As much,' said I, 'and as little; for you {{can neither}} {{estimate}} their real worth nor mine. I know <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> when last in Edinburgh.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{choose to}} suppose {{anything}} of the kind," [...] said Mrs. Crowder. [...] "Thee tried to do right, but I am glad thee did not deprive the world of any of Petrarch's poetry. But now I want thee to {{tell us something about}} ancient Egypt, and those wonderfully cultivated people who built pyramids and carved hieroglyphics. Perhaps <b>thee</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> building the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fair maiden, who are you, and {{who gave}} you that wreath of singing roses?' asked he, for the birds were so tiny that till you looked closely <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{have now}} said all I have to say: except {{that this young}} couple parted, firmly, though not without tears and sorrow, on the evening when <b>you</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> together.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Wakeman, {{you have}} sworn {{that you saw}} these gentlemen kick the plaintiff. Do I {{understand}} you to swear that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> both do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} Littlepage gal; if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> {{out this}} morning in the carriage, you saw two York gals and parson Warren's da'ghter with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sherikov laughed. [...] "What can he do? How can he stop me? I {{have my own}} men. <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> They landed {{all around}} you. You'll be returned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are gentle, the gentlest hands I {{have ever}} known," [...] she said softly. [...] "And {{you are a}} dear to have noticed it, for <b>you</b> only <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> {{yesterday}} in passing." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{recovered}} himself. [...] "Oh!--oh--yes!--Hah! I had forgotten. <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> me put <b>'em</b> to flight? I was {{a little}} late, but I gave service, don't you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh Eda," [...] she cried, [...] "do <b>you</b> remember, we <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> being picked--in the movies? All {{those old}} {{trees on the}} side of a hill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doubtless {{you thought}} <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> David," [...] {{answered}} Hugh, adding with meaning, [...] "and {{it is not}} always well to talk of things we think that we have seen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} fancying <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> I suppose.' She grows tremulous again. 'You will {{be nice to}} them, John, won't you, and wish them luck? They have their trials before them.' ...|$|E
60|$|Warn. This is past enduring. [Aside.] There was an ill play set up, sir, on the posts; but I {{can assure}} you the bills are altered since <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> {{and now there are}} two admirable comedies at both houses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Harkness," [...] said Wilson, [...] "you say <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> these gentlemen, my clients, {{kick the}} plaintiff. Are you sure--and please {{remember}} that you are on oath--are you perfectly sure that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> both of <b>them</b> kick him, or only one? Now be careful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But here,' he said, recovering, 'are my daughters, Martin; my two only children, whom (if <b>you</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>them)</b> <b>you</b> {{have not}} beheld--ah, these sad family divisions!--since you were infants together. Nay, my dears, why blush at being {{detected}} in your everyday pursuits? We had {{prepared to give}} you the reception of a visitor, Martin, in our little room of state,' said Mr Pecksniff, smiling, 'but I like this better, I like this better!' ...|$|R
60|$|And so when Mrs. Darling {{went back}} to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The {{children}} waited for her cry of joy, but it did not come. She <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> but she did not believe they were there. <b>You</b> see, she <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still.|$|R
6000|$|ALICE. 'There was no plan; there wasn't {{time for}} one. But you were {{certainly}} rather horrid, Robert, {{in the way}} you gloated over me when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> take to you. I have been gloating a little perhaps in taking them from you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Beaton. [...] "If I could paint {{pictures}} for righteousness' sake, I {{should have been}} glad to do Conrad Dryfoos for his father. I felt sorry for him. Did the rest seem very much broken up? <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> all?" ...|$|E
60|$|Bartley. You {{would know}} that if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them!</b> They have stones and sticks. Raging they are, and calling for our lives. They say we brought {{witchcraft}} and ill-luck on the place! Come to the boat, it's in the rushes; they won't see us, we'll get to the island. Hurry, hurry! [He runs out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have told}} Markham,' said he presently, 'to send you my desk. There {{are all sorts}} of things in it, just as I threw them in when I cleared out my rooms at Oxford. I had rather nobody but <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> some of <b>them.</b> There is nothing of any importance, so you may look at them when you please, or not at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would think}} so if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> some of <b>them.</b> They are a great deal too {{inquisitive}} and familiar for Reynolds. He detests them. It is far more interesting {{to think of that}} Catholic priest who was here the other day. He lingered about the place as though he had known it all his life, and loved it; and, Reynolds says, he prayed for two hours in the chapel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hand me up four of them, Tom; I did {{not know}} how much I wanted a change of food till my eyes lit on those beauties. We <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> pulling <b>them</b> out, but I did not expect {{it was going to be}} as good as this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{with them}} soldiers. <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> pass, doctor--eh? They'd forgot their stocks. Not one on 'em had his stock on." [...] He croaked and chuckled {{for a long}} time over his discovery. [...] "It wouldn't ha' done for the Dook!" [...] he muttered. [...] "No, by Jimini! the Dook would ha' had a word there." ...|$|E
6000|$|OSWALD [...] Stoop for a moment; 'tis {{an act of}} justice; [...] And where's {{the triumph}} if the {{delegate}} [...] Must fall in the execution of his office? [...] The deed is done--if you will have it so-- [...] Here where we stand--that tribe of vulgar wretches [...] (<b>You</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> gathering for the festival) [...] Rush in--the villains seize us-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Trial? There was no trial." [...] Gian Maria chewed vigorously for a moment. [...] "I {{tell you}} I was so heated with anger at this base ingratitude, that I {{had not even}} the wit to have {{the names of their}} {{associates}} tortured out of them. Within a half-hour of their arrival in Babbiano, the heads of these men whom it had pleased Heaven to deliver up to me were where <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Mortimer, {{one would}} think the {{schoolmaster}} had left behind him a catechizing infection. You are ruffled by the want of another cigar. Take one of these, I entreat. Light it at mine, which is in perfect order. So! Now do me the justice to observe that I am doing all I can towards self-improvement, {{and that you have}} a light thrown on those household implements which, when <b>you</b> only <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as in a glass darkly, you were hastily--I must say hastily--inclined to depreciate. Sensible of my deficiencies, I have surrounded myself with moral influences expressly meant to promote the formation of the domestic virtues. To those influences, and to the improving society of my friend from boyhood, commend me with your best wishes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "High {{sparks of}} pride and passion!" [...] said the unfortunate youth; [...] "but when <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> <b>them</b> {{supported}} by the resolution that should have backed them? The sparks you speak of fell on my dastardly heart as {{on a piece of}} ice which could catch fire from nothing: if my offended pride urged me to strike, my weakness of mind prompted me the next moment to fly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Everett {{is quite}} outspoken with his beliefs, and his remarks have proven {{controversial}} on several occasions. Perhaps the best-known {{of these was}} his denial {{of the existence of}} dinosaurs. He was quoted as saying, [...] "God created the sun, the stars, the heavens and the earth, and then made Adam and Eve. The Bible never says anything about dinosaurs. You can't say there were dinosaurs when <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> Somebody actually <b>saw</b> Adam and Eve eating apples. No one ever saw a Tyrannosaurus rex." [...] He also derided fossils of dinosaur bones as man-made fakes. In reference to these comments, Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy dubbed Everett [...] "Jurassic Carl." [...] Everett, in turn, referred to Shaughnessy as the [...] "curly-haired boyfriend" [...] of Globe beat writer Gordon Edes.|$|R
6000|$|After {{the story}} had been told Dias said: [...] "That was a capital plan of keeping the torches burning all night, and {{especially}} of throwing two of them up the ravine {{when you heard the}} fellows coming. Of course they calculated on getting within fifteen yards or so before <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> Well, there is no fear of our hearing any more of them. I expect you must have been gone hours before they found out that you had left, ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently a {{thousand}} noses appeared, and nervously disappeared like the wink of an eye. Then they appeared again, and {{a thousand}} pairs of eyes followed. Instantly, like Jack in the box, they were all {{on the top of}} their hillocks again, chattering and wagging their little tails as vigorously as ever. You could not say that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> jump out of their holes. Suddenly, as if by magic, they were out; then Dick tossed up his arms, and, suddenly, as if by magic, they were gone! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Above all things," [...] he said, [...] "you must {{sleep in}} the room which you slept in, on the {{birthday}} night, {{and it must be}} furnished in the same way. The stairs, the corridors, and Miss Verinder's sitting-room, must also be restored to what they were when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> last. It is absolutely necessary, Mr. Blake, to replace every article of furniture {{in that part of the}} house which may now be put away. The sacrifice of your cigars will be useless, unless we can get Miss Verinder's permission to do that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon release, Classic Rock stated: [...] "For {{those who}} regard Slade {{as nothing more}} than a '70s hit machine, Live at the BBC is gonna be a right old shock. This is Slade before the hits, a raw, rocking high paced crew. But then, if <b>you</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> live, you'll know how good this lot were - one of the best." [...] The Guardian said: [...] "This is a treat, tracing the Black Country rockers' {{fascinating}} 1969-72 progress from a band Tony Blackburn introduces as [...] "the skinhead set" [...] to the biggest pop phenomenon since Beatlemania. These long-lost radio sessions give some feeling of how they arrived in the peace'n'love era like a force-10 gale. The second CD captures a band at the peak of their glam stomp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I do {{not find}} it hard, for we have always said you had splendid points about <b>you.</b> Miss Merry <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> though <b>you</b> were a skeleton, when she bought you; so did the skilful Cornish {{blacksmith}} when he shod you. And {{it is easy to}} see that you belong to a good family by the way you hold your head without a check-rein and carry your tail like a plume,' I said, with a look of admiration which comforted her as much as if she had been a passée belle.|$|R
5000|$|He {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "Yes, I {{have to admit that}} during these 40 years of {{separation}} from my dear ones that I have often longed for my sisters; and sometimes the images of my mom and my middle brother (Uzeyir) replaced the images of my sisters in my mind.Both of them were crying bitterly when we were saying good-bye. I was trying to convince them that I was going away for only two months. I was asking them why they were crying? Now I tell myself, Jeyhun bey, you deceived them because you yourself were not aware of what would happen. Now you’re living 41 years separated from <b>them.</b> <b>You</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again nor will you ever see them in the future - your dear ones—men and women are passing away one by one... And you yourself will, too." ...|$|R
