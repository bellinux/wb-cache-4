500|$|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's {{version of}} intimacy. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me...</b> You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you {{recognize}} my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} what you think of my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Ten Year War, Michigan's {{regular season}} {{performance}} declined, but their post season performance improved. The 1979 season included a memorable game against Indiana that ended with a touchdown pass from John Wangler to Anthony Carter with six seconds left in the game. The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's emotional radio narration: [...] "Under center is Wangler at the 45, he goes back. He's looking for a receiver. He throws downfield to Carter. Carter has it. [...] Carter scores[...] [...] [...] I have {{never seen anything like this}} in all my 40 years of covering Michigan football[...] [...] [...] I hope <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> – because I've never been so happy in all my cotton-picking 59 years! [...] [...] [...] Johnny Wangler to Anthony Carter will be heard until another 100 years of Michigan football is played! [...] [...] [...] Meeeshigan wins, 27 to 21. They aren't even going to try the extra point. Who cares? Who gives a damn?". Michigan went 84 on the season, losing to North Carolina in the 1979 Gator Bowl.|$|E

2500|$|In Michigan's eighth {{game against}} an unranked Indiana team, Wangler had his most replayed {{moment in a}} Michigan uniform. [...] Dickey started the game, and Wangler entered the game as a substitute. [...] The game was tied at 2121 in the fourth quarter. [...] There was no {{overtime}} in college football, and Michigan fans would have regarded a tie as {{the equivalent of a}} defeat. [...] With six seconds left on the clock, Michigan had the ball on the Indiana 45-yard line. [...] Wangler dropped back to pass from his own 45-yard line, and his pass hit Anthony Carter at the 23-yard line. [...] Carter ran into the end zone as time ran out to give the Wolverines a 2721 victory. [...] The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's colorful and emotional radio narration as the play unfolded. [...] A portion of Ufer's oft-replayed call follows:"Under center is Wangler at the 45, he goes back. He's looking for a receiver. He throws downfield to Carter. [...] Carter has it.
