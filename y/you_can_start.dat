500|$|Björk's vocals on Homogenic {{range from}} primitive-sounding screams to a {{traditional}} singing method used by Icelandic choir men, a combination of speaking and singing as illustrated in the song [...] "Unravel". The majority of songs on Homogenic have lyrics about love and failed relationships. The song [...] "Jóga" [...] was written {{as a tribute to}} her best friend and tour masseuse of the same name. Björk called [...] "All is Full of Love" [...] a song about [...] "believing in love" [...] and that [...] "Love isn't just about two persons. It's everywhere around you". [...] "All Neon Like" [...] contains snippets of a poem Björk wrote called [...] "Techno Prayer" [...] in 1996. The song [...] "5 Years" [...] appeared in live form a few weeks after her breakup with musician Tricky and music journalists considered it a response to it. [...] "Bachelorette" [...] was originally written for director Bernardo Bertolucci for his film Stealing Beauty. Björk later faxed Bertolucci, informing him the song would be used for her album instead. [...] "Bachelorette" [...] and [...] "Jóga" [...] were written with Icelandic poet Sjón, because Björk wanted to use epic lyrics. [...] "Immature" [...] was written about mistakes in past relationships, shortly after the breakup with Goldie. Björk described [...] "Pluto" [...] as about [...] "being plastered, that need to destroy everything so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>start</b> again". [...] "Unravel" [...] is a song about lamenting love, with brief flashes of hope.|$|E
