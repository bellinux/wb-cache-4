After starting in row 2 Andretti got victimized by a controversial wreck during the pace-laps when rookie Kevin Cogan suddenly spun out for no apparent reason.

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1982 Indianapolis 500, second-year driver Kevin Cogan, {{teammate}} to polesitter Rick Mears, suddenly spun right when accelerating for the green flag. Cogan bounced off A. J. Foyt, slamming Foyt's steering rod. That contact turned Cogan's car left at a 90 degree angle to the field where he was promptly t-boned by Mario. Andretti was livid and engaged in a shoving match with Cogan before walking off. In an interview, 3 minutes after the wreck, an irked Andretti was heard saying [...] "This is what happens when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> doing a man's job up front." [...] Andretti's Patrick Racing teammate that year was the eventual race winner, Gordon Johncock, who started next to Andretti in the middle of row two. In later years, Johncock pointed out that Andretti had jumped the start, and could have avoided the spinning car of Cogan had he been lined up properly in the second row next to Gordy.|$|E

But {{this seems to}} overlook something significant: in both cases, you are still seeking to regulate when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> And so if one concludes that {{it is wrong to}} seek to regulate the timing and size of a family, then {{it would have to be}} concluded that natural family planning is just as wrong as [...] "artificial" [...] means. But if one concludes that it is appropriate to steward the timing and size of one's family, then what makes [...] "artificial" [...] means wrong but natural family planning right? Surely it is not because God is [...] "more free" [...] to overrule our plans with natural family planning! Perhaps some have concluded that artificial forms are wrong because they allow one more fully to separate intercourse from the possibility of procreation. But if it is wrong to have intercourse without a significant possibility of procreation, then it would also be wrong to have intercourse during pregnancy or after a woman is past her childbearing years. There is no reason to {{conclude that}} natural family planning is appropriate but that [...] "artificial" [...] means are not.' ...|$|E

It is a very long distance either to Agra or to Allahabad; and with the whole country up in arms against us, and the cavalry here at our heels, the prospect seems absolutely hopeless.

60|$|But of all chamber {{furniture}} in the world, best calculated to cure a had temper, and breed a pleasant one, is {{the sight of a}} lovely wife. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> however, that are teething, the nursery should be a good way up stairs; at sea, it ought to be in the mizzen-top. Indeed, teething children play the very deuce with a husband's temper. I have known three promising young husbands completely spoil on their wives' hands, by reason of a teething child, whose worrisomeness happened to be aggravated at the time by the summer-complaint. With a breaking heart, and my handkerchief to my eyes, I followed those three hapless young husbands, one after the other, to their premature graves.|$|E

I know nothing of his ideas or of his {{knowledge}} about sex and all that side of life. I do not know {{of the things he}} finds beautiful. I can guess at times; that's all; when he betrays himself.... You see, you don't know really what love is until <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> One doesn't love women. Indeed you don't! One gives and gets; it's a trade. One may have tremendous excitements and expectations and overwhelming desires. That's all very well in its way. But the love of children is an exquisite tenderness: it rends the heart. It's a thing of God. And I lie awake at nights and stretch out my hands in the darkness to this lad--who will never know--until his sons come in their time...." ...|$|E

Superstition, sentiment, the habit of wrong thinking or of not thinking at all have struck in too deep, the habit of unreasoning acceptance of authority is too paralyzing. Some may be stung back into life, spurred on {{to find out what the}} world really is, but not many. The hope lies in those who are coming after us--we must do for them what wasn't done for us. We really didn't have much of a chance, Paret. What did our instructors at Harvard know about the age that was dawning? what did anybody know? You can educate yourself--or rather reeducate yourself. All this"--and he waved his hand towards his bookshelves--"all this has sprung up since you and I were at Cambridge; if we don't try to become familiar with it, if we fail to grasp the point of view from which it's written, there's little hope for us. Go away from all this and get straightened out, make yourself acquainted with the modern trend in literature and criticism, with modern history, find out what's being done in the field of education, read the modern sciences, especially biology, and psychology and sociology, and try to get a glimpse of the fundamental human needs underlying such phenomena as the labour and woman's movements. God knows I've just begun to get my glimpse, and I've floundered around ever since I left college....
