500|$|Originally, {{the mythology}} for season seven was {{supposed}} to continue from and show the ramifications of the [...] "Two Fathers"/"One Son" [...] story arc. Frank Spotnitz, in an interview, explained that the mythology episodes for season seven would feature [...] "characters <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> 'One Son' coming back" [...] and explore [...] "what happens now that the conspiracy has been destroyed, what are {{the politics of the}} new landscape that exists. [...] There are aliens from outer space, two different races that are warring with each other." [...] In addition, he said that the then-planned series finale would feature [...] "the big idea that Chris [...] had in the beginning." [...] However, these ideas never came to pass, and the season finale, [...] "Requiem", segued directly into the eighth season premiere [...] "Within". Duchovny later revealed that, had the show ended, the final three episodes would have been devoted to the myth-arc.|$|E
2500|$|Davis's actions {{when it came}} to {{regulating}} business {{suggested that}} Davis was a more moderate governor. He worked to kill a comprehensive bill opposed by banks and insurance companies to protect consumers' personal financial information. [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> the campaign was what you got," [...] said UC Berkeley professor Bruce Cain. [...] "He's tried to negotiate a course between the different interest groups and keep Democrats on a more centrist, business-oriented track".|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.2 out of 10. He was {{critical}} of the general gameplay, which he argued [...] "quickly boils down to you running from room to room, killing anything that pops up along the way." [...] He was also critical of the creature design, which he felt was [...] "largely recycled from last year's game, which is disappointing. The way the monsters in the last game were based on various methods of execution was interesting, but retrofitting them to fit Baltimore street crime seems cheap." [...] He concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind has its moments, {{but most of these}} moments are the same sorts of moments that <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> last year's game. If you're a fan of the previous game and you're looking for more of the same, Ties That Bind fits the bill, but more expansion on the themes of the first game would have made for a much more interesting final product." ...|$|E

[...] goes on George, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> Harry <b>in</b> grief, <b>you</b> {{would be}} seeing a genuine affliction, a real tragedy; you would grieve too. But you wouldn't be {{affected}} if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> the undertaker <b>in</b> weepers and a black cloak!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then {{you were}} {{watching}} the boat very closely just now when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me. What else did you see? Anything before that--before <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me <b>in</b> the water?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Pretty {{much the}} same as what <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> the Herald this mornin', only that they're offerin' to pay for any news of Joe Potter an' a feller what's called 'Plums.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|SHE: [...] "Oh, {{then you}} {{acknowledge}} {{that you did}} presume upon something you thought <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> me {{to tell me that}} you loved me, and that you were in love with me all the time?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, miss," [...] said Jeff, {{with direct}} simplicity, [...] "I've always {{wondered}} what <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> {{it to make}} you content to stay, {{when it would be}} so much prettier, and more suitable for you at the 'Summit.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} would have felt awfully if I had gone {{straight}} off with her. So I waited. It may never come to anything in the world, and I don't suppose it will; but it's quite enough to account for everything <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{judge was}} looking at Father Brown with level and {{piercing}} eyes. [...] "You are a most extraordinary witness," [...] he said; [...] "but {{there is something about}} you that makes me think you are trying to tell the truth.

6000|$|... "You see, I was so dreadfully in {{love with}} you. I did {{everything}} I could to make you care for me. I thought you were incapable of loving anyone.

6000|$|Character? I {{should have}} thought it needed {{a good deal of}} {{character}} to throw up a career after half an hour's meditation, because <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> another way of living a more intense significance.

6000|$|... "I {{think if}} we had the thing to do over again," [...] {{continued}} the colonel, raising himself on his feet, [...] "we might alter the case very materially, though the chief thing the rebels have now to boast of is my capture; they were repulsed, <b>you</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>in</b> their attempt to drive us from the wood." ...|$|E
