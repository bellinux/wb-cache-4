5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

500|$|Champollion was {{particularly}} {{captured by the}} array of important monuments and inscriptions at Thebes, and decided {{to spend as much}} time there as possible on the way back north. South of Thebes, the Isis sprang leak and nearly sank. Having lost many provisions and spent several days repairing the boat they continued south to Aswan where the boats had to be left, since they could not make it across the first Cataract. They traveled by small boats and camelback to Elephantine and Philae. At Philae, Champollion spent several days recovering from an attack of gout brought on by the hard trip, and he also received letters from his wife and brother, both sent many months earlier. Champollion attributed their delay to Drovetti's ill will. They arrived at Abu Simbel on November 26, the site had been visited by Bankes and Belzoni in 1815 and 1817 respectively, but the sand that they had cleared from the entrance had now returned. On January 1, 1829, they reached Wadi Halfa and returned north. That day, Champollion composed a letter to M. Dacier stating that [...] "I am proud now, having followed the course of the Nile from its mouth to the second cataract, {{to have the right to}} announce to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is nothing to modify in our [...] "Letter on the Alphabet of the Hieroglyphs."

2500|$|Nolan’s gesture was imprecise, {{and pointed}} {{not to the}} redoubts and the {{captured}} British guns but, it seemed — at least to Lucan and his staff officers present — to the Russian battery guarding Ryzhov's cavalry {{at the end of}} the valley. Seeing Lucan's confusion, Nolan could have explained what Raglan intended, perhaps making the link – if he himself knew of the connection — between the third and fourth order; however, taken aback by Nolan's insolence, Lucan refused further discussion, and rode over to Cardigan standing in front of his brigade. Both cavalry commanders knew the dangers of attacking down the valley. When Cardigan learned what was expected of his brigade, he questioned the sanity of the order as conveyed to him by Lucan: [...] "… allow me to point out to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a battery in front, battery on each flank, and the ground is covered with Russian riflemen." ...|$|E

Delivering what news reports called a [...] "stinging criticism of the contractor," [...] Petraeus said that [...] "It is disturbing. This is a serious concern to me and to the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do."

At the Labour Party conference on 1 October 1973, he said, [...] "I warn <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are going to be}} howls of anguish from those rich enough to pay over 75% on their last slice of earnings". In a speech in Lincoln on 18 February 1974, Healey went further, promising he would [...] "squeeze property speculators until the pips squeak." [...] He alleged that Lord Carrington, the Conservative Secretary of State for Energy, had made £10m profit from selling agricultural land at prices 30 to 60 times as high as it would command as farming land. When accused by colleagues including Eric Heffer of putting Labour's chances of winning the next election in jeopardy through his tax proposals, Healey said the party and the country must face the consequences of Labour's policy of the redistribution of income and wealth; [...] "That is what our policy is, the party must face the realities of it".|$|E
2500|$|The ride {{starts with}} an indoor section, where riders pass Jigsaw's {{equipment}} and Billy on his tricycle, who laughs {{as the train}} passes by. If {{you are on the}} second dispatched car (two cars are dispatched one after the other, seemingly plunging them directly into a pit of strobe-lit spikes which are narrowly avoided), the vehicle will stop while Billy gives a speech, informing <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no escape, and proclaiming, [...] "Here's what happens when you lose", before allowing the train to pass – this regulates the distance between cars. Riders then approach two dimly-lit swinging blades which appear to get closer, before a hidden drop that is nearly vertical moves riders out of the way. Air blasts at riders imitating the firing of syringes from loaded crossbows, which appear to miss over riders' heads. The train then enters a heartline roll, as riders can see Jigsaw in a pool of blood. Water is sprayed at the train during the roll to imitate blood, and a loud scream can be heard at the same time. The train exits the warehouse and travels towards the [...] vertical lift hill.|$|E

2500|$|When Brodie Innes sent on {{a sermon}} by E. B.

You, I am sure, have always practically acted in this manner in your conduct towards me & I do not doubt to all others. Nor can I remember that I have ever published a word directly against religion or the clergy." [...] In response to an enquiry about the same sermon from the botanist Henry Nicholas Ridley, Darwin stated that [...] "Dr Pusey was mistaken in imagining that I wrote the Origin with any relation whatever to Theology", and added that [...] "many years ago when I was collecting facts for the Origin, my belief in what is called a personal God was as firm as that of Dr Pusey himself, & as to the eternity of matter I have never troubled myself about such insoluble questions.— Dr Pusey's attack will be as powerless to retard by a day the belief in evolution as were the virulent attacks made by divines fifty years ago against Geology, & the still older ones of the Catholic church against Galileo".

2500|$|Burton next {{featured}} as Jimmy Porter, [...] "an angry young man" [...] role, in {{the film}} version of John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger (1959), a gritty drama about middle-class life in the British Midlands, directed by Tony Richardson, again with Claire Bloom as co-star. Biographer Bragg observed that Look Back in Anger [...] "had defined a generation, provided a watershed in Britain's view of itself and brought [...] into the public prints as a controversial, dangerous figure". Burton was able to identify himself with Porter, finding it [...] "fascinating to find a man who came presumably from my sort of class, who actually could talk the way I would like to talk". The film, and Burton's performance, received mixed reviews upon release. [...] Biographer Alpert noted that though reviews in the UK were favourable, those in the United States were more negative. Crowther wrote of Burton: [...] "His tirades are eloquent but tiring, his breast beatings are dramatic but dull and his occasional lapses into sadness are pathetic but endurable." [...] Both Geoff Andrew of Time Out magazine and Schwartz felt Burton was too old for the part, and the Variety reviewer thought [...] "the role gives him little opportunity for variety". Contemporary reviews of the film have been better and it has a rating of 89% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Look Back in Anger is now considered one of the defining films of the British New Wave cinema, a movement from the late 1950s to the late 1960s in which working-class characters became the focus of the film and conflict of social classes a central theme. Jimmy Porter is also considered as one of Burton's best on-screen roles; he was nominated in the Best Actor categories at the BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards but lost to Peter Sellers for I'm All Right Jack (1959) and Anthony Franciosa for Career (1959) respectively. Though it didn't do well commercially, Burton was proud of the effort and wrote to Philip, [...] "I promise <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> isn't a shred of self-pity in my performance. I am {{for the first time ever}} looking forward to seeing a film in which I play." [...] While filming Look Back in Anger, Burton did another play for BBC Radio, participating in two versions, one in Welsh and another in English, of Welsh poet Saunders Lewis' Brad, which was about the 20 July plot. Burton voiced one of the conspirators, Caesar von Hofacker.|$|E
