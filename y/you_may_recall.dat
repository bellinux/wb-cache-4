500|$|Neuromancer {{was written}} on a [...] "clockwork typewriter," [...] the very one <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates {{from somewhere in the}} 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs {{slightly}} less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black [...] "crackle" [...] paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 {{was one of the best}} portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Reynolds {{played for}} Stanford's {{freshman}} football team. The team included Reynolds, Bobby Grayson, Monk Moscrip and Bones Hamilton, {{and came to}} be known as the [...] "Vow Boys." [...] The 1932 Stanford varsity team was soundly defeated by the USC Trojans. After watching the defeat, the freshmen players got together and vowed that they would never lose to the Trojans. [...] The Stanford team proceeded to beat USC three straight years from 1933–1935 — making good on the vow. Stanford was the dominant team on the Pacific Coast, appearing in the New Year's Day Rose Bowl game in each of those three years. Reynolds established a record that has never been matched by playing in every minute of three consecutive Rose Bowl games. In each of those games, Reynold played all 60 minutes on offense and defense without substitution. [...] Two years after Reynolds completed the feat, Los Angeles Times sports columnist Braven Dyer wrote:"A young man arrived in town yesterday enjoying perhaps the most unique distinction in the history of the Tournament of Roses football. He is the only athlete who ever played through three consecutive Rose Bowl games without substitution. His name is Bob Reynolds. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> him as 'Horse' Reynolds. … Reynolds left the field that afternoon with no fanfare or trumpets but on January 1, 1936, he set a record which may never be equalled in this annual classic. He was never removed for a substitute durying any of the three games." ...|$|E

It is this opinion of yours indeed which induces me to offer you another tale of a like complexion. Especially am I encouraged thereto by a certain conversation between us in Cairo, while we gazed at the majestic countenance of the Pharaoh Meneptah, for then it was, as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>recall,</b> that you said you thought the plan of this book probable and that it commended itself to your knowledge of those dim days.|$|E
60|$|A pistol cracked behind me; then another, and a sharp, {{stinging}} pain in {{the shoulder}} warned me that I was hit. But I took no heed of it then. The wound could not be serious, else I had already {{been out of the}} saddle, and it would be time enough to look to it when I had outdistanced my pursuers. I say my pursuers, for already there were hoofbeats behind me, and I knew that those gentlemen had taken to their horses. But, as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>recall,</b> I had on their arrival noted the jaded condition of their cattle, whilst I bestrode a horse that was comparatively fresh, so that pursuit had but small terrors for me. Nevertheless, they held out longer, and gave me more to do than I had imagined would be the case. For nigh upon a half-hour I rode, before I could be said to have got clear of them, and then for aught I knew they were still following, resolved to hound me down by the aid of such information as they might cull upon their way.|$|E

"I was in Sulphur City, and did {{not hear}} of it till it was nearly all over," [...] Redfield resumed, his speech showing {{a little of the}} {{excitement}} which thrilled through the girl's voice. [...] "Well, the first act of vengeance was so ill-considered that it practically ended the whole campaign. The invaders fell upon and killed two ranchers--one of whom was probably not a rustler at all, but a peaceable settler, and the other one they most barbarously hanged. More than this, they attacked and vainly tried to kill two settlers whom they met on the road--German farmers, with no connection, so far as known, with the thieves. These men escaped, and gave the alarm. In a few hours the whole range was aflame with vengeful fire. The Forks, as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>recall,</b> was like a swarm of bumblebees. Every man and boy was armed and mounted. The storekeepers distributed guns and ammunition, leaders developed, and the embattled 'punkin rollers,' rustlers, and townsmen rode out to meet the invaders." ...|$|E
60|$|When all is so {{interesting}} {{it is hard}} to pick examples, but to me there has always seemed to be something peculiarly impressive in the first entrance of a new race on to the stage of history. It has something of the glamour which hangs round the early youth of a great man. You remember how the Russians made their debut--came down the great rivers and appeared at the Bosphorus in two hundred canoes, from which they endeavoured to board the Imperial galleys. Singular that a thousand years have passed and that the ambition of the Russians is still to carry out the task at which their skin-clad ancestors failed. Or the Turks again; <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> the characteristic ferocity with which they opened their career. A handful of them were on some mission to the Emperor. The town was besieged from the landward side by the barbarians, and the Asiatics obtained leave {{to take part in a}} skirmish. The first Turk galloped out, shot a barbarian with his arrow, and then, lying down beside him, proceeded to suck his blood, which so horrified the man's comrades that they could not be brought to face such uncanny adversaries. So, from opposite sides, those two great races arrived at the city which was to be the stronghold of the one and the ambition of the other for so many centuries.|$|E

At the time of Mr. Hastings's departure, I represented to him [...] that I had no resources for the expenses of the gentlemen.

60|$|Crossed {{the fields}} near Brookhouse's villa, and {{came upon a}} long beach,-- at least a mile long, I should think,--terminated by craggy rocks at either end, and backed by a high broken bank, the grassy summit of which, year by year, is {{continually}} breaking away, and precipitated to the bottom. At {{the foot of the}} bank, in some parts, is a vast number of pebbles and paving-stones, rolled up thither by the sea long ago. The beach is of a brown sand, with hardly any pebbles intermixed upon it. When the tide is part way down, there is a margin of several yards from the water's edge, along the whole mile length of the beach, which glistens like a mirror, and reflects objects, and shines bright in the sunshine, the sand being wet to that distance from the water. Above this margin the sand is not wet, and grows less and less damp the farther towards the bank you keep. In some places your footstep is perfectly implanted, showing the whole shape, and the square toe, and every nail in the heel of your boot. Elsewhere, the impression is imperfect, and even when you stamp, you cannot imprint the whole. As you tread, a dry spot flashes around your step, and grows moist as you lift your foot again. Pleasant to pass along this extensive walk, watching the surf-wave;--how sometimes it seems to make a feint of breaking, but dies away ineffectually, merely kissing the strand; then, after many such abortive efforts, it gathers itself, and forms a high wall, and rolls onward, heightening and heightening without foam at the summit of the green line, and at last throws itself fiercely on the beach, with a loud roar, the spray flying above. As you walk along, you are preceded by a flock of twenty or thirty beach birds, which are seeking, I suppose, for food on the margin of the surf, yet seem to be merely sporting, chasing the sea as it retires, and running up before the impending wave. Sometimes they let it bear them off their feet, and float lightly on its breaking summit; sometimes they flutter and seem to rest on the feathery spray. They are little birds with gray backs and snow-white breasts; their images may be seen in the wet sand almost or quite as distinctly as the reality. Their legs are long. As you draw near, they take a flight of a score of yards or more, and then recommence their dalliance with the surf-wave. You may behold their multitudinous little tracks all along your way. Before you reach the end of the beach, you become quite attached to these little sea-birds, and take much interest in their occupations. After passing in one direction, it is pleasant then to retrace your footsteps. Your tracks being all traceable, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> the whole mood and occupation of your mind during your first passage. Here you turned somewhat aside to pick up a shell that you saw nearer the water's edge. Here you examined a long sea-weed, and trailed its length after you for a considerable distance. Here the effect of the wide sea struck you suddenly. Here you fronted the ocean, looking at a sail, distant in the sunny blue. Here you looked at some plant on the bank. Here some vagary of mind seems to have bewildered you; for your tracks go round and round, and interchange each other without visible reason. Here you picked up pebbles and skipped them upon the water. Here you wrote names and drew faces with a razor sea-shell in the sand.|$|E
