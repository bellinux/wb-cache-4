We investigated whether this principle {{could be used to}} determine the genetic composition of monopronuclear human <b>zygotes</b> in conventional IVF and ICSI. First we determined whether male female asymmetry is conserved from mouse to human by staining polypronuclear <b>zygotes</b> with antibodies against a subset of histone N-tail post-translational modifications. To analyze human monopronuclear <b>zygotes,</b> a modification, H 3 K 9 me 3, was selected that is present in the maternal chromatin. After IVF a total of 45 monopronuclear <b>zygotes</b> were obtained. In 39 (87 %) of <b>zygotes</b> a nonuniform staining pattern was observed, proof of a bi-parental origin and assumed to result into a diploid conception. Two <b>zygotes</b> showed no staining for the modification, indicating that the single pronucleus was of paternal origin. Four <b>zygotes</b> contained only maternally derived chromatin. ICSI-derived monopronuclear <b>zygotes</b> (n = 33) could also be divided into three groups based on the staining pattern of their chromatin: (1) of maternal origin (n = 15), (2) of paternal origin (n = 8) or (3) consisting of two chromatin domains as dominating in IVF (n = 10). Our data show that monopronuclear <b>zygotes</b> originating from IVF generally arise through fusion of parental chromatin after sperm penetration. Monopronuclear <b>zygotes</b> derived from ICSI in most cases contain uni-parental chromatin.

With medium change, the development rate of vitrified-warmed <b>zygotes</b> exposed in 7 M ethylene glycol for 1 or 2 min was similar to that of unvitrified <b>zygotes.</b> However, prolonged exposure (5 min) markedly reduced the development rates of vitrified-warmed <b>zygotes</b> to the expanded blastocyst stage (p< 0. 05). When the <b>zygotes</b> were vitrified in 7 M ethylene glycol and diluted at 18 ℃ to 22 ℃, a slower efflux of ethylene glycol from the cell might have occurred, leading to a toxic effect of ethylene glycol in culture.

5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts.

Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on <b>zygote</b> formation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{in vitro}} culture of presumed <b>zygotes</b> derived from single cow ovum pick-up (OPU) is {{important}} for the production of quality blastocysts maintaining pedigree. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the agar chip-embedded helper embryo coculture system for single cow OPU-derived <b>zygotes</b> by assessing embryo quality. Methods Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from Hanwoo cows with high genetic merit twice a week using the ultra-sound guided OPU technique and from slaughterhouse ovaries. The Hanwoo cow COCs and slaughterhouse ovaries were matured in vitro, fertilized in vitro with thawed Hanwoo sperm and cultured for 24 h. The presumed <b>zygotes</b> were subsequently placed in three different culture systems: (1) control OPU (controlOPU) with single cow OPU-derived presumed <b>zygotes</b> (2 ~ 8); (2) agar chip-embedded slaughterhouse helper embryo coculture (agarOPU) with ten presumed <b>zygotes</b> including all presumed <b>zygotes</b> from a cow (2 ~ 8) and the rest from agar chip-embedded slaughterhouse presumed <b>zygotes</b> (8 ~ 2); and (3) slaughterhouse in vitro embryo production (sIVP) with ten slaughterhouse ovary-derived presumed <b>zygotes,</b> each in 50 μL droplets. Day 8 blastocysts were assayed for apoptosis and gene expression using real time PCR. Results The coculture system promoted higher blastocyst development in OPU <b>zygotes</b> compared to control OPU <b>zygotes</b> cultured alone (35. 2 vs. 13. 9 %; P CD 9, 0. 4 -fold; AKRAB 1, 0. 3 -fold) and in cocultured <b>zygotes</b> (CD 9, 0. 3 -fold; AKRAB 1, 0. 3 -fold) compared to sIVP blastocysts (1. 0 -fold). Moreover, genes involved in implantation and/or normal calf delivery were up-regulated (P PGSH 2, 5. 0 -fold; TXN, 4. 3 -fold; PLAU, 1. 7 -fold) and cocultured <b>zygotes</b> (PGSH 2, 14. 5 -fold; TXN, 3. 2 -fold; PLAU, 6. 8 -fold) compared to sIVP (1. 0 -fold) blastocysts. However, the expression of PLAC 8, TGF-β 1, ODC 1, ATP 5 A 1 and CASP 3 did not differ between the three culture groups.

40|$|One {{difficulty}} {{in analyzing the}} damage response is {{that the effect of}} damage itself and that of cellular response are hard to distinguish in irradiated cells. In mouse <b>zygotes,</b> damage can be introduced by irradiated sperm, while damage response can be studied in the unirradiated maternal pronucleus. We have analyzed the p 53 -dependent damage responses in irradiated-sperm mouse <b>zygotes</b> and found that a p 53 -responsive reporter was efficiently activated in the female pronucleus. [3 H]thymidine labeling experiments indicated that irradiated-sperm <b>zygotes</b> were devoid of G 1 /S arrest, but pronuclear DNA synthesis was suppressed equally in male and female pronuclei. p 53 −/− <b>zygotes</b> lacked this suppression, which was corrected by microinjection of glutathione S-transferase-p 53 fusion protein.

5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism.

Diseases caused by mutation in the mtDNA include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the <b>zygote</b> derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E

5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the <b>zygote</b> nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Infertility due to {{the absence}} of gametes {{is one of the last}} frontiers in {{reproductive}} medicine. Sperm or oocyte donation is currently the only treatment option but this approach lacks the genetic contribution of both partners. Arti®cial production of gametes through haploidization may offer an alternative strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ef®ciency of producing arti®cial oocytes and <b>zygotes</b> with correct chromosome number. METHODS and RESULTS: Somatic cumulus cell nuclei were injected into non-enucleated oocytes to pro-duce arti®cial <b>zygotes</b> and into enucleated mature mouse oocytes to produce arti®cial oocytes. The expected chromo-some number of arti®cial <b>zygotes</b> and oocytes is 40 and 20 chromosomes respectively. Fertilization and developmental potential of arti®cial <b>zygotes</b> and oocytes inseminated by IVF or ICSI were investigated. The expected chromosome numbers were found in 12 % of arti®cial <b>zygotes</b> and 15 % of arti®cial oocytes. Varying the time interval between injection of the somatic nucleus and activation (3, 5, 8 h) tended to increase the ef®ciency up to 18 and 23 % for <b>zygotes</b> and oocytes respectively. Two-cell formation rates were 90 % for arti®cial <b>zygotes</b> and 37 % for arti®cial oocytes after IVF and 53 % for arti®cial oocytes after ICSI.

Second polar bodies were used as biopsy samples for diagnosis of mtDNA genotypes of mito-mouse <b>zygotes.</b> Nuclear transplantation was carried out from mito-mouse <b>zygotes</b> to enucleated normal <b>zygotes</b> and was shown to rescue all of the F 0 progeny from expression of respiration defects throughout their lives. This procedure should be applicable to patients with mitochondrial diseases for preventing their children from developing the diseases...|$|R
