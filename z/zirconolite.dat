Four series of hydrothermal experiments were carried out with Ce-doped <b>zirconolite</b> powders: (1) a solution series (1 M HCl, 2 M NaCl, 1 M NaOH, 1 M NH 3, pure H 2 O), (2) a temperature series (T = 100 – 300 C), (3) a surface area-to-fluid volume ratio series, and (4) a series using different reactor materials (Teflon, Ni, and Ag). In addition, experiments on 238 Pu- and 239 Pu-doped <b>zirconolite</b> ceramics in a 1 M HCl solution have been performed. The 238 Pu-doped <b>zirconolite</b> had already accumulated significant radiation damage and was X-ray amorphous, while the 239 Pu-doped <b>zirconolite</b> was still well-crystalline. The results of the different experimental series can be summarized as follows: (1) After 14 days the degree of alteration is insignificant for all solutions other than 1 M HCl, which was therefore used for all other experimental series; (2) TiO 2 and m-ZrO 2 replaced the <b>zirconolite</b> grains to varying degrees in the 1 M HCl solution, i. e., <b>zirconolite</b> dissolution is incongruent; (3) the degree of alteration increases only slightly with increasing temperature; (4) the alteration rate is independent on the surface to volume ratio; (5) Ag dissolved from the silver reactors dramatically increases the reaction rate, while Ni from the Ni reactors reduces the solubility of Ti and Zr in the HCl solution, indicating that background electrolytes have a strong effect on the alteration rate.

40|$|<b>Zirconolite</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} host phases for {{actinides}} in various wasteforms for immobilizing high level radioactive waste (HLW). Over time, zirconolite's crystalline matrix is damaged by {alpha}-particles and energetic recoil nuclei recoil resulting from {alpha}-decay events. The cumulative damage caused by these particles results in amorphization. Data from natural zirconolites suggest that radiation damage anneals over geologic time and is dependant on the thermal history of the material. Proposed HLW containment strategies rely on both a suitable wasteform and geologic isolation. Depending on the waste loading, depth of burial, and the repository-specific geothermal gradient, burial could result in a wasteform being exposed to temperatures of between 100 [...] 450 C. Consequently, it is important to assess the effect of temperature on radiation damage in synthetic <b>zirconolite.</b> <b>Zirconolite</b> containing wasteforms are likely to be hot pressed at or below 1, 473 K (1, 200 C) and/or sintered at or below 1, 623 K (1, 350 C). <b>Zirconolite</b> fabricated at temperatures below 1, 523 K (1, 250 C) contains many stacking faults.

In this study, they simulate {alpha}-decay damage in two <b>zirconolite</b> samples by irradiating them with 1. 5 MeV Kr{sup +} ions using the High Voltage Electron Microscope-Tandem User Facility (HTUF) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and measure the critical dose for amorphization (D{sub c}) at several temperatures between 20 and 773 K. One of the samples has a high degree of crystallographic perfection, the other contains many stacking faults on the unit cell scale. Previous authors proposed a model for estimating the activation energy of self annealing in <b>zirconolite</b> and for predicting the critical dose for amorphization at any temperature. The authors discuss their results and earlier published data in relation to that model...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} mine dump {{material}} from Koberg, Bergslagen, Sweden has revealed a varied mineral assemblage, including Zr-, REE-, Th- and U-bearing minerals {{associated with the}} sulphide ore deposit. Detailed descriptions and microprobe analyses are presented of the rare earth minerals yttrian <b>zirconolite</b> and allanite-(Ce), and the zirconium oxide baddeleyite. Yttrian <b>zirconolite</b> is patchily zoned in the actinide lements Th and U, and the low analytical totals suggest the presence of several weight per cent of H 20. The implications of these features with respect o synthetic <b>zirconolite</b> in SYNROC and to radioactive waste management are briefly discussed. Chemical zoning of individual REE in yttrian <b>zirconolite</b> is described and the REE distribution {{compared with those of}} zirconolites from other localities. Allanite-(Ce) is generally unzoned, but contains REE-rich rims which are considered to be sub-micron intergrowths of allanite plus a bastn~isite-type mineral phase. The MgO content of allanite-(Ce) is unusually high and appears to be a characteristic feature of allanite from other cerium and mineral occurrences of Central Sweden. The rare earth minerals at Koberg are interpretated as having been formed as a result of localized remobilization of elements including Ti and Zr with H 20 -and CO 2 -rich fluids...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{radiation}} damage and noble gas accommodation in potential ceramic hosts for plutonium disposition is necessary to evaluate their long-term behaviour during geological disposal. Polycrystalline samples of Nd-doped <b>zirconolite</b> and Nd-doped perovskite were irradiated ex situ with 2 MeV Kr+ at a dose of 5 1015 ions cm 2 to simulate recoil of Pu nuclei during alpha decay. The feasibility of thin section preparation of both pristine and irradiated samples by Focused Ion Beam sectioning was demonstrated. After irradiation, the Nd-doped <b>zirconolite</b> revealed a well defined amorphous region separated from the pristine material by a thin (40 – 60 nm) damaged interface. The <b>zirconolite</b> lattice {{was lost in the}} damaged interface, but the fluorite sublattice was retained. The Nd-doped perovskite contained a defined irradiated layer composed of an amorphous region surrounded by damaged but still crystalline layers. The structural evolution of the damaged regions is consistent with a change from orthorhombic to cubic symmetry. In addition in Nd-doped perovskite, the amorphisation dose depended on crystallographic orientation and possibly sample configuration (thin section or bulk). Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy revealed Ti remained in the 4 + oxidation state but there was a change in Ti coordination in both Nd-doped perovskite and Nd-doped <b>zirconolite</b> associated with the crystalline to amorphous transition...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} new {{occurrence}} of the mineral <b>zirconolite,</b> ideally CaZrTi 2 O 7, from xenoliths in the pyroclastic formations outcropping near Niedermendig, Laacher See eruptive center, Eifel volcanic region, Germany. This example of <b>zirconolite</b> is crystalline, a rare feature for a mineral of this group; it gives an X-ray-diffraction pattern corresponding to the orthorhombic polytype (zirconolite- 3 O), space group Acam, with a 10. 145 (8), b 14. 18 (8), c 7. 284 (5) Å. It contains the highest concentration of Mn reported from natural <b>zirconolite</b> (6 % MnO); it is also rich in Nb (~ 18 % Nb 2 O 5) and REE (up to 19. 4 % Y 2 O 3 + REE 2 O 3), with Ce the dominant REE. The mineral formula, {{expressed in terms of}} three of the five end-member components identified for the compositional space of <b>zirconolite,</b> is: 32 % CaZrTi 2 O 7, 53 % REEZrMe 5 +Me 2 +O 7, and 6 % ACTZrTiMe 2 +O 7 (with 9 % unas-signed). The compositional variation can best be described by the coupled substitution: REE 3 + + (Fe 2 +,Mn 2 +) + Nb 5 + $ Ca + 2 Ti. The host rock is an alkali syenite xenolith almost exclusively composed of alkali feldspar (Or 45 Ab 55), with minor biotite. <b>Zirconolite</b> crystallizes as an accessory mineral in voids between feldspar crystals, together with baddeleyite, manganoan mag-netite, and monazite-(La), a rare species of monazite. This suite of minerals, with their unusual chemical compositions, crystal-lized from late-stage metasomatic fluids enriched in Nb and Mn, and having an exceptional La-enriched REE signature...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} {{technological advancements}} {{have been made}} in the Synroc scheme for the immobilization high-level nuclear waste. However, many basic scientific issues related to Synroc fabrication have yet to be addressed. The CaO-TiO{sub 2 }-ZrO{sub 2 } system is an integral part of the Synroc formulation. Phase equilibria are established in the CaO-TiO{sub 2 }-ZrO{sub 2 } system at 1, 200 C, using X-ray diffraction and electron probe microanalysis. The existence of two previously reported ternary phases, <b>zirconolite</b> (CaZrTi{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }) and calzirtite (Ca{sub 2 }Zr{sub 5 }Ti{sub 2 }O{sub 16 }), is confirmed. Each of these phases exhibits a significant range of homogeneity between TiO{sub 2 } and ZrO{sub 2 } while maintaining a nearly constant concentration of CaO. The ternary solubilities of the constituent binary phases are found to be negligible, with the exceptions of the perovskites, which display mutual solubility of at least 22 mol. % and may in fact form a series of continuous solid solutions. The solubilities of Hf and Gd in <b>zirconolite</b> are also investigated. While Hf-bearing samples did not reach thermodynamic equilibrium under the experimental conditions employed, the existence of a Hf analog to <b>zirconolite,</b> CaHfTi{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }, is conclusively demonstrated. The phase is stable at the stoichiometric composition, and its lattice parameters are very close to those reported in the literature for stoichiometric <b>zirconolite.</b> A Gd-bearing sample of the composition Ca{sub 0. 88 }Zr{sub 0. 88 }Gd{sub 9. 24 }Ti{sub 2 }O{sub 7 } is found to be essentially single phase <b>zirconolite,</b> in agreement with previous investigations at higher temperatures...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{glass-ceramic}} matrices {{designed for the}} conditionning of minor actinides, in which <b>zirconolite</b> crystals (CaZrTi 2 O 7) are homogeneously dispersed in a residual glassy matrix. Good immobilization performances require a high enrichment of actinides in the crystalline phase (double containment principle). Glass-ceramics are obtained by controlled devitrification of an aluminosilicate parent glass containing large amounts of TiO 2 and ZrO 2. Neodymium was selected to simulate the trivalent minor actinides. Crystallization was performed at 1200 °C for various Nd 2 O 3 contents (0 - 10 wt. %). In all cases, <b>zirconolite</b> crystallization is obtained in the bulk of glass-ceramics. The evolution of Nd 3 + location between the crystals and the residual glass was followed by electron spin resonance and optical absorption. Both techniques demonstrate that neodymium is partly incorporated in <b>zirconolite</b> crystals. Moreover, total Nd 2 O 3 content in parent glass has a strong effect on Nd 3 + ions distribution...|$|E
