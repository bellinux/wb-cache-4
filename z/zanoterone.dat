50|$|<b>Zanoterone</b> {{was derived}} from dihydroethisterone (17α-ethynyl-5α-dihydrotestosterone https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/14887213). It is an {{antagonist}} of the androgen receptor (Ki = 2.2 μM), and {{with the exception of}} antiprogestogen activity in rat and rabbit models, is devoid of other hormonal activities. <b>Zanoterone</b> does not inhibit 5α-reductase, aromatase, or 3α- or 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in vitro. The drug significantly increases testosterone and estradiol levels in men. <b>Zanoterone</b> has been found to not significantly inhibit mating performance or fertility in adult male rats at high dosages {{for an extended period of}} time. It has been found to act as an inducer of the enzyme CYP3A4 in vivo in rats.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zanoterone</b> (WIN-49596): A pure AR {{antagonist}} without other hormonal activity except some antiprogestogenic {{activity in}} animal models. Was under {{development for the}} treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia but showed poor effectiveness and a high rate of breast pain and gynecomastia in clinical trials and was subsequently abandoned.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zanoterone</b> (INN, USAN) (former {{developmental}} codename WIN-49596), {{also known}} as (5α,17α)-1'-(methylsulfonyl)-1'-H-pregn-20-yno3,2-cpyrazol-17-ol, is a steroidal antiandrogen that was never marketed. It was investigated {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy in phase II clinical trials, and also showed an unacceptable incidence rate and severity of side effects (e.g., breast pain and gynecomastia). As such, it was not further developed.|$|E
