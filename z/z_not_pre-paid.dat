50|$|The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is a {{publicly}} funded healthcare system that provides coverage to everyone normally resident in the UK. It is not strictly an insurance system because (a) {{there are no}} premiums collected, (b) costs are not charged at the patient level and (c) costs are <b>not</b> <b>pre-paid</b> from a pool. However, it does achieve the main aim of insurance which is to spread financial risk arising from ill-health. The costs of running the NHS (est. £104 billion in 2007-8) are met directly from general taxation. The NHS provides the majority {{of health care in}} the UK, including primary care, in-patient care, long-term health care, ophthalmology, and dentistry.|$|R

The charge distribution showed 83 nuclei of <b>Z</b> <b>not</b> less than 65, 6 nuclei of charge not less than 90, one with <b>Z</b> <b>not</b> less than 93, and no superheavy nuclei (<b>Z</b> <b>not</b> less than 110). Measured Pb/Pt and U/Pt abundance ratios are examined for information on a possible r-process, on solar system abundances, and on the time and time scale of the related nucleosynthesis events. The resolution of the experiment is deemed adequate {{to rule out the}} presence of superheavy nuclei. Experimental procedures, statistical treatment, and correlation with balloon data are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Reducing or {{eliminating}} {{the cost to}} the public of using leisure facilities is one tool that local authorities have available to reduce inequalities in physical activity (PA). There is limited evidence about the effect of leisure entrance charges and their impact on participation. This study aimed to ascertain how facility pricing influenced the decisions people made about how to pay and what to pay for and how, in turn, these decisions impacted on participation for different groups. A total of 83 members of the public living in 4 local authorities in the North West of England were involved in focus groups or individual interviews. The results show that cost was a key factor which influenced PA participation in low income neighbourhoods. In practise, however, the majority of service users navigated the range of prices or payment options to find one that was suitable rather than simply reporting whether leisure was affordable or <b>not.</b> Whilst <b>pre-paid</b> options (e. g. direct debit memberships) encouraged participation, entrance charges incurred each time an individual participated had a negative impact on frequency but were a convenient way of paying for occasional use or for people who were unable to afford a pre-paid option. Free access also helped people who could <b>not</b> afford <b>pre-paid</b> membership to exercise regularly as well as incentivizing non-users to try activities. The research concluded that policies that include components of free access and offer more flexible payment options are most likely to contribute to reducing inequalities in PA...|$|R
