5|$|In February 2016, in {{response}} to the spread of the <b>Zika</b> <b>virus,</b> the Obama administration requested that Congress appropriate $1.9billion to fight the spread of the disease. Congress did not initially take action, leaving Burwell to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram $589million in funds previously designated as part of the response to Ebola, to fight the spread of the <b>Zika</b> <b>virus.</b> Of the initial Zika funding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) received $222million to lead the domestic fight against the virus with the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority splitting $152million for the domestic effort. In response to Congressional complaints that the money was not being spent fast enough, Burwell informed Congress that without further funding the CDC's funding to fight Zika would be depleted by September30, 2016. After Burwell moved funding from other HHS programs, Congress finally appropriated $1.1billion to fight the spread of Zika in the United States. By the end of September 2016, the United States reported 23,000 cases in the territory of Puerto Rico, 3,000 cases in the states, and 21babies born in the United States with microcephaly testing positive for Zika.|$|E

25|$|Zika fever, {{also known}} as <b>Zika</b> <b>virus</b> disease or simply Zika, is an {{infectious}} disease caused by the <b>Zika</b> <b>virus.</b> Most cases have no symptoms, but when present they are usually mild and can resemble dengue fever. Symptoms may include fever, red eyes, joint pain, headache, and a maculopapular rash. Symptoms generally last less than seven days. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults {{have been linked to}} Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS).|$|E
25|$|<b>Zika</b> <b>virus</b> infections {{have been}} {{strongly}} associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. While both GBS and Zika infection can simultaneously occur in the same individual, {{it is difficult to}} definitively identify <b>Zika</b> <b>virus</b> as the cause of GBS. Several countries affected by Zika outbreaks have reported increases in the rate of new cases of GBS. During the 2013–2014 outbreak in French Polynesia there were 42 reported cases of GBS over a 3-month period, compared to between 3 and 10 annually prior to the outbreak.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} viruses are {{transmitted}} by the bite from an infected arthropod (mosquito or tick) and hence, classified as arboviruses. Human infections {{with most of}} these arboviruses are incidental, as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titers to reinfect the arthropods needed to continue the virus lifecycle– humans are then a dead end host. The exceptions to this are the yellow fever, dengue, and <b>zika</b> <b>viruses.</b> These three viruses still require mosquito vectors, but are well-enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts (although they continue to have important animal transmission routes, as well).|$|R

40|$|Background The Pacific {{region is}} an area unique in the world, {{composed}} of thousands of islands with dif-fering climates and environments. The spreading and establishment of the mosquito Aedes aegypti in these islands might be linked to human migration. Ae. aegypti is the major vector of arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya and <b>Zika</b> <b>viruses)</b> in the region. The intense circulation of these viruses in the Pacific {{during the last decade}} led to an increase of vector control measures by local health authorities.

Our generic model permits analytic analysis while producing a rich diversity of infection profiles in terms of their shapes, durations, and intensities. The general features of these theoretical profiles compare well to real-world data of recent social contagion phenomena. Comment: 14 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
40|$|Arboviruses such as Dengue, Chikungunya, and <b>Zika</b> <b>viruses</b> {{represent}} {{a major public}} health problem due to globalization and propagation of susceptible vectors worldwide. Arthropod vector-derived salivary factors {{have the capacity to}} modulate human cells function by enhancing or suppressing viral replication and, therefore, modify the establishment of local and systemic viral infection. Here, we discuss how mosquito saliva may interfere with Dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. Identification of saliva factors that enhance infectivity will allow the production of vector-based vaccines and therapeutics that would interfere with viral transmission by targeting arthropod saliva components. Understanding the role of salivary proteins in DENV transmission will provide tools to control not only Dengue but also other arboviral diseases transmitted by the same vectors...|$|R
50|$|Like other flaviviruses {{it could}} {{potentially}} be transmitted by blood transfusion and several affected countries have developed strategies to screen blood donors.

25|$|This {{mosquito}} {{has become}} a significant pest in many communities because it closely associates with humans (rather than living in wetlands), and typically flies and feeds in the daytime in addition to at dusk and dawn. The insect is called a tiger mosquito for its striped appearance, which resembles that of the tiger. Ae. albopictus is an epidemiologically important vector for the transmission of many viral pathogens, including the yellow fever virus, dengue fever, and Chikungunya fever, {{as well as several}} filarial nematodes such as Dirofilaria immitis. Aedes albopictus is capable of hosting the <b>Zika</b> <b>virus</b> and is considered a potential vector for Zika transmission among humans.|$|E
