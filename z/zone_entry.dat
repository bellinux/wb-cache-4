Slow-moving vehicles are a problem in reducing traffic flow. This research investigated {{the effectiveness of a}} system of pulsing lights, that gave the illusion of movement (Phi phenomenon), in causing drivers to unknowingly synchronize their vehicle speed with the light pulses. Forty drivers participated: 20 young (10 female, 10 male; 21 - 42 years) and 20 older adults (10 female, 10 male; 55 - 87 years). Each participant made 15 passes through the work zone: a control pass with stationary white lights, two control passes with no lights, and 12 passes of test conditions [...] 2 colors (red & green) x 3 apparent pulse speeds (- 80, 0, & + 80 mph) x 2 <b>zone</b> <b>entry</b> speeds (40 & 70 mph).

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare two {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging techniques for demonstration of vascular {{contact with the}} trigeminal nerve. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with unilateral trigeminal neuralgia and 50 control subjects underwent three-dimensional fast inflow with steady-state precession (FISP) and contrast material-enhanced magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) MR imaging. The images were independently reviewed by two neuroradiologists, who were blinded to the clinical details. Six of the 13 patients underwent surgery. RESULTS: Vascular contact with the trigeminal nerve at the root <b>entry</b> <b>zone</b> was seen on FISP images in 10 of 13 (77 %) symptomatic nerves and in eight of 113 (7 %) asymptomatic nerves (P <. 001). MP-RAGE and FISP images demonstrated arterial contacts equally well. MP-RAGE images demonstrated one additional venous contact at the root <b>entry</b> <b>zone</b> in a patient with ipsilateral trigeminal neuralgia. Interobserver agreement was good for both FISP (kappa = 0. 69) and MP-RAGE (kappa = 0. 78) images.

40|$|The most {{important}} mechanism through which monetary policy affects the real economy in Hungary is {{the exchange rate}} channel. With euro adoption, this mechanism will largely disappear {{and the impact of}} monetary policy will be transmitted via the interest rate channel, presently seen as rather weak. This has raised concerns that the influence of monetary policy on the real economy in Hungary could be very limited after euro adoption. On top of this, other concerns have been voiced as regards potential asymmetries in the wage-setting behaviour, the exchange rate and credit channels. Based on the experience of today’s euro area participating countries and the structural characteristics of the Hungarian economy, this paper argues that after euro adoption 1) we may expect a broadening of the scope of the interest rate channel of monetary policy after euro adoption, 2) there are no institutional obstacles {{in the way of the}} effective functioning of the expectations channel in Hungary 3) substantially different monetary conditions from that in the euro area as a result of a different trade orientation are unlikely, and, finally 4) some asymmetries in the balance sheet channel may continue to exist for some time between Hungary and the core euro area countries but its effect will be significantly smaller after euro <b>zone</b> <b>entry.</b> monetary transmission mechanism, transmission channels, EMU participation. ...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescent {{retroreflective}} materials {{increase the}} brightness of traffic signs. In construction work zones a benefit is expected from the increased conspicuity of fluorescent retroreflective signs. Fluorescent material can be used instead of non-fluorescent materials both for the advance warning signs that indicate {{the configuration of the}} upcoming work zone and for additional backing boards behind traffic signs, e. g. to attract attention to a posted speed limit sign. In a field experiment at a construction work zone on a motorway, conspicuity measurements during daytime showed that fluorescent retroreflective material doubled the conspicuity with respect to non-fluorescent material, corresponding to a daytime luminance which was twice as high. Driver behaviour in the approach area of a construction work zone was observed via video recordings during dusk, daylight and nighttime conditions. On consecutive days, three types of signing were installed in the approach area of the work zone: non-fluorescent signing (High Intensity Grade (HIG)), fluorescent signing (Diamond Grade (DG)) and the combination of fluorescent signing and backing boards (DG+BB). Driver behaviour was analysed in terms of speed (average speeds and percentage of vehicles entering the work zone at excessive speeds), Time-To-Collision (TTC), and lane changes. Results showed that fluorescent retroreflective material reduced the (very high) speeds during dusk conditions (especially during low ambient light conditions, fluorescent materials have a very bright appearance). At night, speeds increased with fluorescent signing. Backing boards behind the posted speed signs reduced average speeds and excessive speeds at the entry of the work zone during daytime. Without fluorescent backing boards more than 25 % of the cars drove faster than 100 km/h during daylight at the work <b>zone</b> <b>entry,</b> while with fluorescent backing boards only 10 % drove that fast. With respect to the interaction between vehicles, a decrease of the proportion of small TTCs during night showed that DG and DG+BB signing caused a shift into a safer direction, even though a speed increase was recorded at night in the condition with DG signing. Furthermore, during dusk and night, fluorescent backing boards reduced last minute lane changes. In daylight the opposite was found...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} issue of the local management system governing the heritage conservation in Malaysia which has not clearly defined the value of the cultural heritage in order to justify any benefits of preserving the cultural heritage as a tourism product for the sustainable heritage site conservation. There are conflicts between stakeholders relating to the benefits of the UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS) designation. Stakeholders such as the local community are often neglected or ignored and have derived very few benefits from tourism development of WHS in Malaysia. Thus, there is a dire need to evaluate the value of a cultural heritage in formulating heritage development plans making it physically, economically and socially acceptable as well as equally beneficial amongst the local stakeholders in order to preserve their cultural heritage sites, thus contributing towards the overall sustainable development of the WHS in Malaysia. The research adopts various approaches of study and triangulates the findings. The case study, Contingent Valuation questionnaire survey and interviews are the main strategies used for data collection. The single case study approach was carried out in search of empirical data on one of the historic cities in Malaysia i. e. George Town, Penang which has been recently inscribed as a UNESCO WHS. Three separate sets of questionnaires were designed and administered among the three key stakeholders in the field: local community, tourists and management personnel in the tourism and heritage site management. The Contingent Valuation is a direct Stated Preferences technique where respondents were asked their willingness-to-pay (WTP) value for the benefits received. The WTP value {{is one of the best}} techniques for estimating the total economic value of the cultural heritage resources that were not traded in the market. The public preferences, as measured by their WTP for the cultural heritage iv conservation, should be given due consideration in the decision-making process in order to promote the sustainability of a heritage site. This research has found that the George Town households were willing to pay RM 57. 46 per year and the tourist respondents were willing to pay RM 42. 54 per visit in the form of the conservation <b>zone</b> <b>entry</b> ticket or heritage building admission fee as a contribution for the George Town Heritage Conservation Fund. Both categories of respondents have shown their strong support for the George Town WHS conservation with the WTP value of the George Town WHS conservation. The managers also have shown their positive support for the proposed management of the WTP value of the cultural heritage for the sustainable George Town WHS conservation. Finally, this research has established a framework for the management of the WTP value of the cultural heritage for the sustainable George Town WHS conservation in Malaysia...|$|E
