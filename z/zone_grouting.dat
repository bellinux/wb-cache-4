30|$|Generally, bed separations {{developed}} in the caving zone and fissure zone closer to the goaf area do not require grouting and backfilling treatment. Bed separation at a great distance from the goaf area (such as the bed separation in the mid or {{upper part of the}} bending zone) contains less-threatening water log, making grouting and backfilling unnecessary (unless ground subsidence demands such treatment). For disastrous bed separation (i.e., the bed separation in {{the lower part of the}} bending zone, which is over the fissure <b>zone),</b> <b>grouting</b> and backfilling is imperative.|$|E
40|$|The {{injection}} of solution grouts into the subsurface {{can be used}} to form underground barriers for the containment of contaminants. The technology requires identifying suitable grout materials, specifically fluids which exhibit a large increase in viscosity after injection and eventually solidify after a controllable period, thus sealing permeable zones. The authors have developed a new fluid property module for the reservoir simulator TOUGH 2 to model grout injection, taking into account the increase of liquid viscosity as a function of time and gel concentration. They have also incorporated into the simulator a model which calculates soil hydraulic properties after solidification of the gel within the pore space. The new fluid property module has been used to design and analyze laboratory experiments and field pilot tests in saturated and unsaturated formations under a variety of subsurface conditions. These applications include modeling barrier emplacement in highly heterogeneous soils in the vadose <b>zone,</b> <b>grout</b> injection into the saturated zone in combination with extraction wells for flow control, the design of verification strategies, and the analysis of barrier performance. In this paper the authors discuss the modeling approach and present simulation results of multiple grout injections into a heterogeneous, unsaturated formation...|$|R
40|$|High level {{radioactive}} waste (HLW) {{is stored in}} underground storage tanks at the Savannah River Site. The SRS is proceeding with closure of the 22 tanks located in F-Area. Closure consists of removing {{the bulk of the}} waste, chemical cleaning, heel removal, stabilizing remaining residuals with tailored grout formulations and severing/sealing external penetrations. A performance assessment is being performed in support of closure of the F-Tank Farm. Initially, the carbon steel construction materials of the high level waste tanks will provide a barrier to the leaching of radionuclides into the soil. However, the carbon steel liners will degrade over time, most likely due to corrosion, and no longer provide a barrier. The tank life estimation in support of the performance assessment has been completed. The estimation considered general and localized corrosion mechanisms of the tank steel exposed to the contamination <b>zone,</b> <b>grouted,</b> and soil conditions. The estimation was completed for Type I, Type III, and Type IV tanks in the F-Tank Farm. The tank life estimation in support of the F-Tank Farm closure performance assessment has been completed. The estimation considered general and localized corrosion mechanisms of the tank steel exposed to the contamination <b>zone,</b> <b>grouted,</b> and soil conditions. The estimation was completed for Type I, Type III, and Type IV tanks in the F-Tank Farm. Consumption of the tank steel encased in grouted conditions was determined to occur either due to carbonation of the concrete leading to low pH conditions, or the chloride-induced de-passivation of the steel leading to accelerated corrosion. A deterministic approach was initially followed to estimate the life of the tank liner in grouted conditions or in soil conditions. The results of this life estimation are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 for grouted and soil conditions respectively. The tank life has been estimated under conservative assumptions of diffusion rates. However, the same process of calculation can be followed, once {{a better understanding of the}} concrete degradation and consequent diffusion rates is developed. A stochastic approach was also followed to estimate the distributions of failures based upon the same mechanisms of corrosion, but accounting for variances in each of the independent variables. The recommended distributions for time to failure of the tank liner for use in stochastic modeling are shown in Table 3. The distributions are based upon based upon known parameters of SRS waste tank construction and groundwater analyses. The results recommended for modeling are based upon discrete diffusion coefficients of 1 x 10 {sup - 6 } cm{sup 2 }/sec for oxygen diffusion as well as CO{sub 2 } diffusion...|$|R

40|$|After a short {{introduction}} in Chapter 1, typical {{properties of}} sedimentary rocks {{are given in}} Chapter 2, exemplified with limestone formations in the Malmö Region in southern Sweden. Two main grouting techniques are defined in Chapter 3, grouting by permeation (pressure not causing fracture in the rock) and grouting by hydraulic fracturing (pressure causing opening of existing fissures or tensile fracture in the rock). The deformations caused by the two methods are discussed. Permeation grouting and permeability of different rock materials are discussed in Chapter 4. The permeability of cement based grouts in soil and rock is often overestimated. In a diagram, a relationship is given between Darcy's coefficient of permeability, k [m/s]; and a crack pattern defined {{by the number of}} cracks per meter, n [1 /m]; crack widths, t [mm]; and crack volume ratio [%]. Hydraulic fracturing is treated in Chapter 5. For confined conditions, equations and diagrams are given for the maximum gap deformation in the cracks and for the widths of the <b>grouted</b> <b>zone.</b> The equations and diagrams are given as functions of the injected grout volume per round and the ratio of the modulus of Elasticity and the injection pressure. Two loading cases are treated: (a) two-dimensional loading with a <b>grouting</b> <b>zone</b> length L [m] and (b) conical loading with a <b>grouting</b> <b>zone</b> diameter D [m]. For unconfined conditions the risk for spreading of the grout is discussed. The importance of the deformations is illustrated with case studies. Final remarks are given in Chapter 6. One main conclusion is that the injection pressure is not a satisfactory stop criterion. As unintended hydraulic fractures often take place, when permeation grouting is intended, an uncontrolled spread of grout may occur. Instead, the volume of grout injected per stage, or round, should be limited. It is often best to inject small amounts of grout, in several rounds, allowing the grout to stiffen between the rounds. This procedure is illustrated with two examples in an Appendix. Godkänd; 2004; 20080522 (ysko...|$|R

According to the applied analyses, two zones at the narrow <b>zone</b> of the <b>grout</b> curtain, characterized by different hydraulic mechanisms were detected.

The beds {{of the formation}} are about 250 m thick composed of Marls, chalky limestone; gypsum, anhydrite, and limestone form a layered sequence. They are highly karstified. As a consequence, plenty of grouting operations were carried out to fill all the cavities, fractures, joints and to stop the seepage under {{the foundation of the}} dam. The main grouting operations were Blanket grouting and deep grout curtain.

30|$|Both {{room and}} pillar mining and panel and pillar mining take the {{principle}} of partial extraction, i.e., some remaining pillars support the ground and thus control surface subsidence. Such mining layout inevitably results in a low recovery rate of coal resources, whereas longwall mining overcomes this shortcoming at the high expense of causing the most serious surface subsidence issues. In China, non-pillar longwall panel layout is typically appllied {{for the purpose of}} achieving a high recovery rate or gate supporting, which means no pillar or a narrow pillar (around 5 – 10  m) is left between the adjacent longwall panels. Mining with  such panel layouts induces very serious subsidence-related issues; thus, some special mining method should be used during longwall extraction under surface structures, e.g., mining with backfill. For longwall mining, there are relatively more filling methods, e.g., gob backfill, grout injection into the caved <b>zone</b> and <b>grout</b> injection in bed separation zone (Palarski 2004; Xu et al. 2006). The first one is the most traditional and common method, which is referred to as complete backfill. More than a decade, complete backfill has been well developed in China (Qian et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2004). It appears that complete backfill techniques have provided a new path for the Chinese coal mines that suffer from mining under populated-areas for long, in particular for those in the old mining districts.|$|R
30|$|The {{grouting}} anchor rode was 2000  mm long. The bolt for {{base angle}} grouting was 3000  mm long and spaced by 1350  mm ×  1600  mm.

The amount of additive is 8  % of that of cement; water cement ratio is 2 : 1; the grouting pressure is controlled at 3 – 5  MPa. The grouting amount is determined by considering three perspectives: the grouting requires to be ceased in the cases when grouting pressure reaches 3 – 5  MPa, or the cement more than two bags is grouted.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{procedures and}} {{results are presented}} for a one-tenth scale laboratory investigation of changes in achievable <b>grouted</b> <b>zones</b> through alterations in helical pier parameters. The parameters investigated were {{the location of the}} grouting holes with respect to the position of the helices, the grouting pressure and the rate of helical pile installation. The results showed that the total treated volume was 40 % to 158 % greater than the grouted volume and that the thickness of the treated zone beyond that which was strictly grout was 15 % to 61 % of the radius of the grouted, cross-sectional area, which was largely controlled by the diameter of the bottom helix. Increases in pressure generate non-linear improvements with increasing effectiveness at higher pressures. The placement of grout holes beneath the bottom helix was shown to be more effective in grout delivery than the standard industry practice of placing the holes above the helix...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of tunnels in granular deposits often requires the preliminary grouting {{of the soil}} mass to stabilize the opening before its temporary support is installed. When applied to shallow tunnels in urban areas this procedure could induce heaves of the ground surface, which are followed by settlements during excavation, with consequent damages of existing buildings. The application of two elastic-plastic finite element approaches in discussed here for evaluating the displacements induced by this technology. The critical evaluation of the numerical results shows the limits of an approach that simulates the grouting process through a non-elastic volume strain. To overcome them an alternative scheme is adopted based on {{the application of a}} neutral pressure within the <b>grouted</b> <b>zone.</b> This method leads to a better estimation of the displacements measured in situ during the tunnel construction. The numerical results demonstrate also the relevant role of the plastic flow rule on the predicted surface displacements...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} the hydraulic stimulation of a gob-degasification borehole {{to determine if}} this procedure would aid in degasifying a longwall panel. The stimulated borehole did not degasify the longwall panel as expected either before or after mining of the panel started. It reduced the underground methane emission only 11 pct, considerably less than the reductions effected by two unstimulated boreholes in the same panel. Some probable reasons for the reduced methane flow from the hydraulically stimulated borehole are very low reservoir gas pressure, location of hydraulically stimulated <b>zones</b> within the <b>grouted</b> casing, a casing break caused by lateral shifting, possible vertical movement of rock strata during caving, grouting of a 4 -inch pipe blocking three stimulated zones, plasticity of shales, and possible hole damage by swelling of water-sensitive minerals. The borehole was also located between two second-mined areas, which may have allowed partial degasification of the overburden and the coalbed in advance of mining. Finally, a period of 3 months is probably not {{long enough for the}} borehole to degasify the overburden before mining...|$|R

The 3. 0 m high by 2. 8 m wide rectangular, tracked-tunnel was constructed by Trafalgar House Construction using drill and blast techniques to intercept a series of pre-drilled diffuser units 25 m below the sea-bed in St Ives Bay. In view of the {{close proximity to the}} sea-bed, and the risk of water ingress, systematic probe drilling was performed at regular intervals during construction. Where necessary, {{in order to reduce the}} water-make to within pre-defined limits, cementitious grouting of the ground ahead of the advancing face was undertaken. One major fault <b>zone</b> required extensive <b>grouting,</b> as initial probe holes were making in the order of 200 gallons per minute. Tunnel advance through exceptionally poor ground required modification to the excavation methodology and implementation of additional support measures. Evaluation of geotechnical data from the undersea tunnel suggests that the Q-system provided a sound basis for assessment of rock quality and for guidance on associated support requirements. Good correlation was obtained between mapped Qvalues and tunnel advance rates. Importantly, engineering judgement informed final support recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Compensation {{grouting}} is {{a multiple}} injection {{process in which}} large numbers of grout injections are carried out in a designated <b>grouting</b> <b>zone.</b> Each injection alters the in-situ stress state {{at the site of}} neighbouring injections, influencing the grout behaviour as well as the deforma-tion of the surrounding soil. In this study, multiple grout injection tests were performed in the laboratory on clay specimens prepared at different overconsolidation ratios ranging from 1 to 10. Two types of grouting mode for compensation grouting were examined: (a) facture grout-ing by injecting epoxy resin, and (b) compaction grouting by expanding a latex balloon placed inside the soil speci-men. The sequence of multiple injections was also varied by injecting either simultaneously or sequentially with different waiting periods. For highly overconsolidated clay the grout efficiency, defined as the ratio of the volume of heave achieved to the injected grout volume, was close to 1 irrespective of grout spacing and injection sequence. For normally consolidated and lightly overcon-solidated clays the grout efficiency increased when the separation in space and time between the injections was reduced. A better grout efficiency was obtained in com-paction grouting than in fracture grouting. The results from finite element analyses of the laboratory tests show that the magnitude and extent of excess pore pressure reduce when many closely spaced simultaneous injections are performed. A few non-simultaneous injections create large stress concentrations around the injection points, leading to larger soil consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Earth, as a {{building}} material, {{has been used}} since ancient times, and is still being used with that purpose. It was used for building shelters, houses, temples and even military constructions, like fortresses. As a consequence, currently, {{there is a great}} architectural heritage stock on this kind of constructions. Nevertheless, earthen materials are very sensitive when compared with modern materials, since they are more vulnerable to external aggressive agents, revealing most of the times a faster degradation rate. From a structural perspective they present a very low tensile strength, a low compressive strength and a fragile behaviour, making the earthen structures strongly vulnerable to earthquakes. The structural damage in this kind of structures manifests, in general, in the form of cracks or voids. Repairing these cracks is fundamental in order to obtain an improved structural behaviour, especially if the earth construction was built in a seismic <b>zone.</b> Injecting mud <b>grouts</b> may constitute a feasible and reliable solution for repair this kind of damage. Although, mud grouts experience many problems that hinder their application and the knowledge about them is still very limited. This requires that deep studies have to be carried out in order to solve their problems and to make this solution reliable. In this paper it is discussed the methodology that should be established for the design of mud grouts suitable for earth constructions. But first a summarized explanation about earth constructions and their problems is presented. This results from an ongoing PhD research that still is in an initial phase, and it aims, precisely, the development of grouts specifically to be applied in earth constructions.

40|$|Construction of {{a nuclear}} waste {{repository}} requires information {{and an understanding of}} the fractured rock. The Swedish concept for nuclear waste deposition that is currently being developed by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co (SKB) includes a natural barrier in the form of crystalline rock, and engineered barriers in the form of bentonite and a copper canister. This paper aims to present two in situ field experiments: the first is the Large fractures experiment and the second is BRIE, the Bentonite Rock Interaction Experiment. Important issues include possible deformation (shearing) of fractures and deformation zones influencing the localization of canisters, and fluid flow, resulting in hydration of the bentonite. The aim of Large fractures is to further develop strategies and integrated investigation and modelling methodology for the identification and characterization of geological structures to ensure that (size) determination of large fractures or minor deformation zones to a greater extent can be based on real properties and to a lesser degree on a criterion related to the existence of a full perimeter fracture – tunnel intersection. BRIE is a field experiment which addresses the hydraulic interaction between the system components of compacted bentonite and the near-field host rock composed of hard and fractured bedrock. The above experiments are presented in terms of investigations performed to obtain discrete fracture descriptions. Grouting of fractures intersecting the investigation borehole of the Large fractures experiment was designed based on field data and a decrease in flow from above 200 liters/min to below 1 liter/min was achieved. The magnitude of the transmissivity of the fracture/deformation <b>zone</b> that was <b>grouted</b> indicates a large fracture size. This is also indicated by the ongoing integrated interpretation (geology, hydrogeology and geophysics).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have been {{following}} 5 grouting rounds at Cyberport shaft and 4 grouting rounds at Sandy Bay shaft. There were some communication problems between the grouting team and the geologists, resulting in missing water inflow measurements. The rock quality was very poor (Q-value 0. 1 – 1), with coarse ash tuff as the most common rock mass in Cyberport, and rhyolitic tuff as the most common rock mass in Sandy Bay. The Q-values were below 1, with Cyberport just a bit higher than Sandy Bay. The rock mass was highly fractured, which was indicated by a low RQD value. Sand and silty infill was found in both shafts. Sandy bay hit a fault <b>zone</b> at <b>grouting</b> 3, with a very jointed rock at various orientations, often clay infill on joints. Micro cement with super plasticizer was the primary grouting material. Water to cement ratio 1 was mostly used. The ratio was sometimes dropped down to 0. 8 and 0. 6 after {{a certain amount of}} micro cement w/c 1 had been pumped. Polyurethane was used to block leakages. Pressure at 40 bar was mostly used as stop criteria. 5 out of 5 grouting rounds in Sandy Bay were with 40 bar as stop criteria, and 6 out of 9 in Cyberport. 60 bar pressure as stop criteria was only used twice, in round 3 a and 5 c at Cyberport. Grouting was normally stopped by overpressure, which means that the pressure exceeded 40 bar. If the stop criteria had been 60 bar, higher amounts of micro cement would most likely have been pumped into the rock mass. The drilling pattern followed a standard description mentioned in the method statement. Every contour hole was placed 1 m from each other, forming the outer circle. Ten holes were placed {{in the middle of the}} shaft. 5 m overlap between the different grouting screens was set as minimum. The water level sometimes fell to alarm level, measured from the piezometer. When this happened, grouting was immediately started to increase the water level, and it worked. Water level started increasing just hours after grouting was started. Material costs were low for both shafts. This is directly related to the small amount of material that was pumped into the rock mass. Infill of sand and silt might be the reason to this. Labour costs are roughly estimated to around 308 000 NOK per day. Delay and deviation from the planned time usage, when it comes to grouting works, will cost the project around 1 130 000 NOK, for the grouting rounds mentioned in this thesis. Sandy Bay only needed one extra grouting round, this at grouting number 2. Cyberport on the other hand, needed four extra grouting rounds, this at grouting number 3, 4 and 5. </p...|$|R
40|$|Geothermal energy, and {{especially}} the use of low enthalpy resources, has a rising importance; ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) systems have been used increasingly because {{they are among the}} cleanest and most energy efficient heating and cooling systems for buildings. Simulation models can be applied for a more effective use of the subsoil for geothermal purposes. In fact they are useful tools for the design of efficient systems which consider also the need to avoid abnormal temperature distributions in soil and aquifers. In the hydrogeology field the Modflow/MT 3 DMS codes are the most widely used programs to face environmental problems and forecast quantity and quality impacts on groundwater resources. Although Modflow/MT 3 DMS are used to represent open circuit heat pumps, they had never been used to represent borehole heat exchangers (BHE). Aim {{of this study is to}} simulate a Thermal Response Test (TRT) through Modflow/MT 3 MS codes implementing into the model all the components of a Ground Heat Exchanger system: from the U-shaped BHE to the grout material surrounding it. For GCHP systems, the TRT is commonly used to determine the heat transport parameters of the subsurface as thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. It also allows to determine the BHE thermal resistance which mainly depends on the geometry of the dug area and on the thermal properties of the surrounding grout material. Starting from a model implemented in a previous work (Angelotti et. al., 2014) Modflow has been used for the simulation of a TRT. Two cases have been analysed and compared: in the first the cells around the BHE are assigned the aquifer parameters while in the second they have been assigned the characteristics of the grout material (hydraulically impermeable but highly conductive from the thermal point of view). A 10 - 6 m/s groundwater Darcy velocity case is analysed applying a 40 W/m specific heat rate to the fluid circulating into the BHE. Considering the temperature distribution in the ground, the differences between the two simulated cases (with/without-grout) result essentially negligible presenting a maximum value equal to 0. 07 °C in the proximity of the BHE (around 20 cm from the centre of the U-pipes). A slightly more relevant difference (0. 55 °C) in simulated temperature is registered very close to the BHE, into the area occupied by the grout (only 6 cm from the centre of the U-pipes). This is due to the absence of the advective term in the <b>zone</b> where the <b>grout</b> is present and the heat transfer is linked just to conduction term. By the way there are almost no differences in the temperature of the heat-carrier fluid in the two cases (0. 02 °C). These results lead to conclude that, simulating a TRT, the effect of the grout is negligible, therefore is advantageous to avoid modeling its geometry and thermal/physical parameters so as to save time and energies in the model implementation phase...|$|R
40|$|In {{mechanized}} tunneling the annular {{gap between}} the segmental lining and the surrounding soil caused by tunnel driving must be backfilled instantaneously with an adequate mortar. The annular gap is caused due to the conical shape, overcut and design of the shield. The soft ground tunneling has a prime focus on the settlement control and optimization of the parameters involved. The backfilling is a key component to reduce the surface settlements and deformations {{after the passage of}} the TBM. The main functions of backfilling are to 1. lock the segmental lining in position avoiding movements due to self-weight of the lining and other forces present; 2. To bear the loads transmitted by TBM backup weight; 3. Provide a uniform contact between the lining and surrounding soil and 4. Waterproofing the tunnel. Recent developments in the field of backfilling have {{led to the development of}} a state-of-the-art two-component grouting system. A two-component grout consists of two components, Component A (Bentonite, water, cement and a retarder), component B (Sodium silicate based accelerator and water). When these two components are mixed just behind the annular gap, the grout starts to attain plasticity in a very quick time and thus, is able to transfer the load to the segmental lining in a very short time after its injection to the annular gap. For a good backfilling grout it is important to satisfy certain engineering aspects (Fluidity, binding and gelling time, mechanical strength). The aim of this research is to understand the behavior of a two component grout in its fresh and hardened state and implement those obtained parameters in a numerical code. A series of laboratory tests are to perform on the two-component grout to determine its physical and mechanical behaviour. Bleeding, Marsh cone and gelling time tests are conducted on the fresh grout sample to test its chemical binding, viscosity and time taken to achieve plastic strain. A series of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests are conducted on the grout sample to obtain its elastic modulus in its early days of setting (up to 28 days). In order to obtain and examine the state and strength of the grout in long term, a string of UCS tests are carried out on two-component grout samples cured at natural humidity of the soil in long terms (up to 1080 days). In addition to this, permeability and dewatering properties of a two-component are determined in its early state. Furthermore, the stiffness of the hardened grout sample in confined condition is determined by conducting oedometer tests. The oedeometer tests are conducted at various time intervals to obtain a complete time-dependent stiffness of the grout. The research deals with the development of a robust numerical model taking into account all the relevant factors involved in mechanized tunnelling but focusing mainly on the backfilling procedure using FDM software FLAC 3 D. The backfilling in the tail grout is modeled as normally applied pressure in a liquid state and later a time-dependent hardening behavior of the grout is initiated. The time-dependent behavior parameters are obtained from the laboratory tests conducted. A new constitutive model (CM) named as Plastic-Hardening (PH) is implemented to model the behavior of the surrounding soil. This CM gives the user a freedom to implement different stiffness for loading and unloading. Since the Mohr-Coulomb (MC) model specifies only one elastic modulus for both loading and unloading, it is unsuitable for cyclic and staged excavation procedures such as mechanized tunnelling itself. The PH CM is validated with the FEM software PLAXIS 3 D before implementing it in FLAC 3 D. Moreover, Hydro-mechanical coupled analysis is also conducted in the near-field domain of the <b>grouting</b> <b>zones</b> to update the permeability and stiffness of the grout due to consolidation...|$|R
