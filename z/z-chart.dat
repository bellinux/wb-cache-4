40|$|Traditional multivariate {{statistical}} {{process control}} (SPC) techniques {{are based on the}} assumption that the successive observation vectors are independent. In recent years, due to automation of measurement and data collection systems, a process can be sampled at higher rates, which ultimately leads to autocorrelation. Consequently, when the autocorrelation is present in the data, it can have a serious impact on the performance of classical control charts. This paper considers the problem of monitoring the mean vector of a process in which observations can be modelled as a first-order vector autoregressive VAR (1) process. We propose a control chart called <b>Z-chart</b> which is based on the single step finite intersection test (Timm, 1996). An important feature of the proposed method is that it not only detects an out of control status but also helps in identifying variable(s) responsible for the out of control situation. The proposed method is illustrated with the help of suitable illustrations. Multivariate {{statistical process control}}, autocorrelation,...|$|E
40|$|A {{nomogram}} {{is presented}} {{for use in}} calculating concentrations for colorimetric systems having an inverse linear relationship between absorbance and concentration. An example is given of its use for the calculation of glucose concentration. The nomogram is sufficiently accurate for clinical use, and can be rapidly used. NOMOGRAMS ARE used regularly in our laboratory for various routine calculations (1). A frequent calculation, which may be performed rapidly with the nomogram presented here, is typified by the colorimetric deter-mination of glucose concentration with a reaction in which absorbance decreases as glucose concentration increases (Figure 1). The system uses an AutoAnalyzer and depends upon the reduction of yellow ferricyanide to colorless ferrocyanide (2). The linear relationship between glucose concentra-tion (x) and absorbance (y) may be expressed by the equation y = mx + b where m is the slope (negative in this case) and b is the intercept (b is the absorbance {{in the absence of}} glucose). Generally, values of y are known from the readings for standard solutions for several corresponding values x. For unknown glucose solutions, the y values are known and the x values are wanted. The nomogram (Figure 2) essentially solves the necessary equation x = (y- b) /m. The inset of Figure 2 is a key {{to the use of the}} nomo-gram. The left side of Figure 2 performs the subtraction y- b and the <b>Z-chart</b> of the right side divides the difference by m. The algebraic and geometrical bases fo...|$|E
