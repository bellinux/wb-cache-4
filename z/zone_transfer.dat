25|$|DNS {{responses}} traditionally do {{not have}} a cryptographic signature, leading to many attack possibilities; the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) modify DNS to add support for cryptographically signed responses. DNSCurve has been proposed as an alternative to DNSSEC. Other extensions, such as TSIG, add support for cryptographic authentication between trusted peers and are commonly used to authorize <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> or dynamic update operations.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{a number}} of {{learning}} communities and special interest housing options are available, providing opportunity for students who share interests or majors to live together. Most of these communities occupy certain floors of buildings or halls, rather than consisting of separate buildings. Included among the options are: FIT (Freshman in Transition, College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources), athletic training, career exploration (College of Arts and Sciences), computer science floor, engineering floors, health and sciences floor, HS housing (College of Human and Environmental Sciences), journalism and broadcasting housing, Kamm Leadership House, Ketchum House (Native American interests), James Building (Young Engineers House), Maude's Quad (Women in Engineering House), Recovery House (students recovering from drug and/or alcohol dependence), Spanish House (language immersion), Spears School of Business House, Stout Honors housing (University's Honors Program), Uhuru House (African Centered Cultural House), Wellness House, and The Transfer <b>Zone</b> (<b>transfer</b> students).|$|E

50|$|Intrabasin <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> {{are within}} the {{constraints}} of the interbasin <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> and are normally an order of magnitude smaller. Intrabasin <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> could be relay ramps within en echelon normal faults, or minor fault jogs. The southern margin of the Gulf of Evvia near Atalanti shows the magnitude of difference between interbasin <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> with accommodating distances up to 10 km as well as intrabasin <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> that accommodate approximately 1 km or less.|$|R
50|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>zones</b> such as relay ramps {{can affect}} {{drainage}} within basins which in return can produce thickness trends. Understanding the drainage network in these extensional setting allows geologist to better identify lateral and vertical depositional facies. The Kaiso-Tonya, Butiaba-Wanseko, and the Pakwach <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> in the Albertine graben all contain hydrocarbons. The Kaiso-Tonya {{is a full}} graben style <b>transfer</b> <b>zone</b> much like conjugate convergent collateral types. The Butiaba-Wanseko, and the Pakwach <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> are relay ramp style <b>transfer</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Network {{enumerators}} {{are often}} used by script kiddies for ease of use, {{as well as by}} more experienced hackers in cooperation with other programs/manual lookups. Also, whois queries, <b>zone</b> <b>transfers,</b> ping sweeps, and traceroute can be performed.|$|R
5000|$|Though it is standardized, full-zone {{transfer}} {{being described}} {{as one of}} the possible database replication mechanisms in RFC 1034 and RFC 5936 (incremental <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> described in RFC 1995), <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> is the most limited of those database replication mechanisms. <b>Zone</b> <b>transfer</b> operates in terms of [...] "wire format" [...] resource records, i.e. resource records as they are transferred using the DNS protocol. However, the schema of wire format resource records may not match the database schema used by the back ends of the DNS servers themselves.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> clients {{perform the}} SOA lookup of the {{preamble}} using their system's normal DNS query resolution mechanism. These clients do not open a TCP {{connection to the}} server until they have determined {{that they need to}} perform the actual data transfer. However, since TCP can be used for normal DNS transactions, as well as for <b>zone</b> <b>transfer,</b> other <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> clients perform the SOA lookup preamble over the same TCP connection as they then (may) perform the actual data transfer. These clients open the TCP connection to the server before they even perform the preamble.|$|E
50|$|They are {{typically}} deployed in a 'hidden master' configuration, with the management appliances {{running on a}} separate secure network to the DNSBOX100 series appliances that handle queries. A VPN is then used between the appliances for <b>zone</b> <b>transfers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Servers {{with this}} feature {{are capable of}} {{publishing}} or handling DNS records that refer to IPv6 addresses. In addition to be fully IPv6 capable they must implement IPv6 transport protocol for queries and <b>zone</b> <b>transfers</b> in slave/master relationships and forwarder functions.|$|R
50|$|At {{the north}} end of the Moab valley, there is a fault <b>transfer</b> <b>zone,</b> where the fault steps east. This <b>zone</b> <b>transfers</b> the {{displacement}} along the fault from one segment to another. Within this zone there is very dense faulting. This is revealed in the road cutting for Highway 191 as seen in this picture taken from the nearby Arches National Park visitor centre.|$|R
50|$|A <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> {{uses the}} Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for transport, {{and takes the}} form of a {{client-server}} transaction. The client requesting a <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> may be a slave server or secondary server, requesting data from a master server, sometimes called a primary server. The portion of the database that is replicated is a zone.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to resource records defined in a zone file, the {{domain name system}} also defines several request types that are used only in communication with other DNS nodes (on the wire), such as when performing <b>zone</b> <b>transfers</b> (AXFR/IXFR) or for EDNS (OPT).|$|R
50|$|In djbdns, {{different}} {{features and}} services are split off into separate programs. For example, <b>zone</b> <b>transfers,</b> <b>zone</b> file parsing, caching, and recursive resolving are implemented as separate programs. The result of these design decisions is a reduction in code size {{and complexity of the}} daemon program that provides the core function of answering lookup requests. Bernstein asserts that this is true to the spirit of the Unix operating system, and makes security verification much simpler.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> {{must have}} major normal faults dipping {{in the same}} direction. This {{includes}} relay ramps. Relay ramps have been studied within the East African rift system (Lake Malawi) and the Gulf of Suez rift system. <b>Transfer</b> <b>zone</b> drainage basins consist of any sediments that will eventually travel through the <b>transfer</b> <b>zone</b> and in the half graben. The Gulf of Evvia is an example where a relay ramp {{plays a major role}} in drainage. Footwall drainage is limited in the Gulf of Evvia while <b>transfer</b> <b>zone</b> drainage is more pronounced. Since size of the drainage basin is one of the major controls on sediment flux, both interbasin and intrabasin synthetic relay ramp type <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> must have a major influence on sedimentation into the overall system. While intrabasin <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> are smaller they still act as a conduit for sedimentation.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 a {{court in}} North Dakota, USA, ruled that {{performing}} a <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> as an unauthorized outsider {{to obtain information}} that was not publicly accessible constitutes a violation of North Dakota law.|$|E
50|$|As zone {{information}} {{can be obtained from}} external sources (via a <b>zone</b> <b>transfer)</b> this allows a DNS service to obtain information from an external organisation about domain information and then choose to handle that information in a non-standard manner.|$|E
5000|$|DNS <b>zone</b> <b>transfer,</b> also {{sometimes}} {{known by the}} inducing DNS query type AXFR, {{is a type of}} DNS transaction. It {{is one of the many}} mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to Domain Name Service (DNS) replication. The DNS sys-tem relies heavily on replication (based on <b>zone</b> file <b>transfers)</b> to achieve its reliability goals, but this form of replication typically requires cooperation from other DNS administrators. However, certain failures still occur in practice, and a decoupled, cen-tralized replica of DNS data faces scalability issues if it is based on <b>zone</b> <b>transfers.</b> Our proposed alternative, dubbed passive DNS replication, does not require cooperation from zone administrators and is able to recover from addi-tional failures. It automatically adapts to real-world DNS query patterns, but it does not aim a...|$|R
50|$|Suez rift <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> {{are similar}} to the East African rift <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> in that {{potentially}} any classification type and stage can be seen. However a study has shown that the transfer of deformation in <b>transfer</b> <b>zones</b> can be accomplished in two ways; through faults or accommodation zones between two opposite dipping normal faults in a horst and graben. A few kilometers south of Cairo there are en echelon minor faults between two major faults that produce a relay ramp style <b>transfer</b> <b>zone.</b> In {{the northern part of the}} Suez rift system the Gharandal <b>transfer</b> <b>zone</b> accommodates deformation in a broad anitclinal structure between two listric faults in a collateral horst and graben.|$|R
50|$|Normally DNS {{name servers}} {{are set up}} in clusters. The {{database}} within this clusters is synchronized through zone transfers. The SOA-Record in the zone file contains data to control the <b>zone</b> <b>transfer.</b> This is the serial number and different timespans.|$|E
50|$|SOA means Start of Authority {{and is a}} {{significant}} part of a zone file in the domain name system (DNS). A SOA-Record contains important management information about the zone, especially regarding the <b>zone</b> <b>transfer.</b> The SOA-Record is specified in RFC 1035.|$|E
50|$|Fortunately, {{for this}} and several reasons {{outlined}} later, DNS servers that use such sophisticated database back ends in general rarely use <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> as their database replication mechanism in the first place, and usually instead employ the vastly superior distributed database replication mechanisms that the back ends themselves provide.|$|E
50|$|For {{high volume}} mail sites, it is {{recommended}} to set up local copies of the DNSBLs of your choice and fill them through DNS <b>zone</b> <b>transfers.</b> This reduces the permanent traffic through external DNS lookups. Some DNSBLs also allow only {{a certain amount of}} queries by day for every IP address to keep their expenses on bandwidth low.|$|R
25|$|DNS {{primarily}} {{uses the}} User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 53 to serve requests. DNS queries {{consist of a}} single UDP request from the client followed by a single UDP reply from the server. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used when the response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or for tasks such as <b>zone</b> <b>transfers.</b> Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zone</b> <b>transfers</b> {{and update}} {{notifications}} are supported, and the processes can run unprivileged and chrooted. Various caches are maintained {{to speed up}} query processing. Run-time control is available through the pdns_control command, which allows reloading of separate zones, cache purges, zone notifications and dumps statistics in Multi Router Traffic Grapher / rrdtool format. Realtime information can also be obtained through the optional built-in web server.|$|R
50|$|The DNS Server in CNR 7.1 {{provides}} both authoritative and recursive service, supports incremental <b>zone</b> <b>transfer,</b> notify, {{and dynamic}} update, and can service IPv6 requests {{but does not}} originate IPv6 requests. It supports TSIG authentication of zone transfers and update but {{does not support the}} data origination authentication features of DNSSEC.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft Windows server {{operating}} systems {{can run the}} DNS Server service. This is a monolithic DNS server that provides many types of DNS service, including caching, Dynamic DNS update, <b>zone</b> <b>transfer,</b> and DNS notification. DNS notification implements a push mechanism for notifying a select set of secondary servers for a zone when it is updated.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, the {{paradigm}} of database replication for which the serial number check (and indeed <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> itself) is designed, which involves a single central DNS server holding the master version of the database with all other DNS servers merely holding copies, simply does not match that of many modern DNS server packages. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database back ends such as SQL servers and Active Directory allow administrators to make updates to the database in multiple places (such systems employ Multi-master replication), with the database back end's own replication mechanism handling the replication to all other servers. This paradigm simply does not match that of a single, central, monotonically increasing number to record changes, and thus is incompatible with <b>zone</b> <b>transfer</b> to a large extent. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database back ends often will create a [...] "shim" [...] serial number, simulating {{the existence of a}} single central place where updates are made, but this is at best imperfect.|$|E
