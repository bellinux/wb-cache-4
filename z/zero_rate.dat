40|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>rating,</b> the {{practice}} of not charging data to a mobile broadband subscriber’s contract, is emerging a potent issue in telecom policy. While <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> of mobile subscriptions has been extant {{for almost two decades}} with little to no controversy. <b>Zero</b> <b>rating</b> has become increasingly popular in both developed and developing countries and plays a particularly important role in developing countries, where the costs of mobile data services are higher relative to per capita incomes. About half of all mobile operators employ the strategy in some way. In fact network operators have used the equivalent of such strategies to incentivize both subscribers and content providers to be part of their network for well over a century. In the last two years, however, <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> become a flashpoint in the net neutrality debate. Whether a country allows it has become a litmus test for net neutrality supporters to certify the strength of the rules. At issue is whether operators and their customers should have the freedom to create contracts for mobile broadband service based on their preferences and constraints or whether mobile Internet service must be sold in a so-called “neutral” fashion where the only differentiating parameters are speed and megabytes. As the Internet increasingly transitions to mobile platforms, and the likelihood that the next two third of world who yet to come online will do so via mobile, who and how to provision mobile bandwidth has is an important, complex issue. This paper examines the arguments for and against <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> and the charges that <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> hurts competition and consumers. It formulates 5 assertions based on the alleged harms and attempts to test them with empirical analysis from quantitative and qualitative perspectives. The paper reviews the leading database of financial information of the world’s mobile operators to see whether the impact of <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> may be observed, for example with undue financial benefits earned by operators through the use of <b>zero</b> <b>rating.</b> To understand the issue more closely, the paper reviews <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> in Chile, Netherlands, and Slovenia, countries which have banned some forms of {{the practice}}. The paper then examines whether there is harm to consumers and innovation by reviewing a leading database of mobile application market data. The paper concludes by suggesting reasons why <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> is maligned in telecom policy debates...|$|R

25|$|In Finland, the {{standard}} rate of VAT is 24% as of 1 January 2013 (raised from previous 23%), {{along with all}} other VAT rates, excluding the <b>zero</b> <b>rate.</b> In addition, two reduced rates are in use: 14% (up from previous 13% starting 1 January 2013), which is applied on food and animal feed, and 10%, (increased from 9% 1 January 2013) which is applied on passenger transportation services, cinema performances, physical exercise services, books, pharmaceuticals, entrance fees to commercial cultural and entertainment events and facilities. Supplies of some goods and services are exempt under the conditions defined in the Finnish VAT Act: hospital and medical care; social welfare services; educational, financial and insurance services; lotteries and money games; transactions concerning bank notes and coins used as legal tender; real property including building land; certain transactions carried out by blind persons and interpretation services for deaf persons. The seller of these tax-exempt services or goods {{is not subject to}} VAT and does not pay tax on sales. Such sellers therefore may not deduct VAT included in the purchase prices of his inputs. Åland, an autonomous area, is considered to be outside the EU VAT area, even if its VAT rate is the same as for Finland. Goods brought from Åland to Finland or other EU countries is considered to be export/import. This enables tax free sales onboard passenger ships.|$|E

Supplies subject to the <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> are still [...] "taxable supplies", that is, they count as having VAT charged on them. In the UK, examples include most food, books, medications, and certain kinds of transport. The <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> is not featured in the EU Sixth Directive as it was intended that the minimum VAT rate throughout Europe would be 5%. However, zero-rating remains in some member states, most notably the UK and Ireland, as a legacy of pre-EU legislation. These member states have been granted a derogation to continue existing zero-rating but cannot add new goods or services.An EU Member State may uplift their domestic <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> to a higher rate, for example to 5% or 20%, however, EU VAT rules do not allow a reversal back to the <b>Zero</b> <b>rate</b> once it has been given up. Interestingly, Member States may institute a reduced rate on a previously zero rated item even where EU law does not provide for a reduced rate, however if a Member State makes an increase from a <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> to the prevalent standard rate, they may not then decrease down to a reduced rate unless specifically provided for in EU VAT Law (Annexe III of EU Dir 2006/112 list sets out where a reduced rate is permissible).|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers an}} unsponsored {{examination}} of current disputes whether {{national regulatory authorities}} (2 ̆ 01 cNRAs 2 ̆ 01 d) should permit broadband carriers and content providers, such as Facebook, to subsidize broadband access to a limited, 2 ̆ 01 cwalled garden 2 ̆ 01 d of content. The subsidy {{makes it possible for}} sponsored data access without debiting a monthly data allowance. Wireless subscribers, with service caps typically set at 1 - 5 Gigabytes allowed per month, can quickly exhaust their monthly allotment when streaming video content. Even so-called unlimited data plans in developed countries have monthly data thresholds that, if reached, trigger slower content delivery speeds and possibly degraded screen resolution of delivered video content. The article concludes that even though carriers and content providers serve profit maximizing goals in <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> arrangements, the practice can have positive spillover effects including more access by impoverished users, stimulated interest in diversifying uses of wireless handsets and possible migration to broadband access options that equally support content consumption and creation. While carriers and content providers can migrate tentative, subsidized users into paying ones, <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> also provides first time access opportunities, particularly for individuals least able to afford even extremely low cost access options available in many lesser developed countries. Additionally, <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> can stimulate interest by consumers financially able to afford unsubsidized access, but heretofore uninterested in, or uninformed about the benefits. The article identifies ways for carriers and NRAs to limit subsidies in ways that accrue social benefits without creating an unlimited 2 ̆ 01 cfree rider 2 ̆ 01 d opportunity for all wireless subscribers, regardless of ability to pay for service. The article suggests that carriers should offer <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> opportunities on a conditional and promotional basis thereby making it more difficult for existing subscribers simply to use <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> access as a way to avoid paying surcharges for exceeding data caps.
