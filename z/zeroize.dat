40|$|Abstract. Cryptographic multilinear map is {{a useful}} tool for {{constructing}} numerous secure protocols and Graded Encoding System (GES) is an approximate concept of multilinear map. In multilinear map context, there are several important issues, mainly about security and efficiency. All early stage candidate multilinear maps are recently broken by so-called <b>zeroizing</b> attack, so that it is highly required to develop reliable mechanisms to prevent <b>zeroizing</b> attacks. Moreover, the encoding size in all candidate multilinear maps grows quadratically in terms of multilinearity parameter κ and it makes them less attractive for applications requiring large κ. In this paper, we propose a new integer-based multilinear map that has several advantages over previous schemes. In terms of security, we expect that our construction is resistant to the <b>zeroizing</b> attack. In terms of efficiency, the bit-size of an encoding grows sublinearly with κ, more precisely O((log 2 κ) 2). To this end, we essentially utilize a technique of the multiplication procedure in scale-invariant fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which enables to achieve sublinear complexity in terms of multilin-earity {{and at the same time}} security against the <b>zeroizing</b> attacks (EUROCRYPT 2015, IACR-Eprin...|$|R

The first generation electronic systems were quirky devices with cantankerous punched card readers for loading keys and failure-prone, tricky-to-maintain vacuum tube circuitry. Late 20th century systems are just black boxes, often literally. In fact {{they are called}} blackers in NSA parlance because they convert plaintext classified signals (red) into encrypted unclassified ciphertext signals (black). They typically have electrical connectors for the red signals, the black signals, electrical power, and a port for loading keys. Controls can be limited to selecting between key fill, normal operation, and diagnostic modes and an all important <b>zeroize</b> button that erases classified information including keys and perhaps the encryption algorithms. 21st century systems often contain all the sensitive cryptographic functions on a single, tamper-resistant integrated circuit that supports multiple algorithms and allows over-the-air or network re keying, so that a single hand-held field radio, such as the AN/PRC-148 or AN/PRC-152, can interoperate with most current NSA cryptosystems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{improve the}} <b>zeroizing</b> {{attack on the}} multilinear map of Garg, Gentry and Halevi (GGH). Our {{algorithm}} can solve the Graded Decisional Diffie-Hellman (GDDH) problem on the GGH scheme when the dimension n of the ideal lattice Z[X]/(Xn+ 1) is O(κλ 2) as suggested for the κ-linear GGH scheme. The <b>zeroizing</b> attack is to recover a basis of an ideal generated by a secret element g ∈ Z[X]/(Xn + 1) from the zero testing parameter and several encodings in public. It can solve the DLIN and subgroup decision prob-lems, but not the GDDH problem on the GGH scheme for the suggested dimension n due to the hardness of the smallest basis problem and the shortest vector problem on the ideal lattice. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to find a short vector in the ideal lattice 〈g 〉 by applying a lattice reduction to a sublattice obtained from the Hermit Normal Form of 〈g〉. This attack utilizes that the determinant of the lattice 〈g 〉 is not large. We further show that if g has a large residual degree, one can find a short element of g in polynomial time of n. In order to resist the pro-posed attacks, it is required that n = Ω̃(κ 2 λ 3) and the positive generator of 〈g 〉 ∩ Z is large enough...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Multilinear maps {{have many}} {{cryptographic}} applications. The first candidate construction of multilinear maps was proposed by Garg, Gentry, and Halevi (GGH 13) in 2013, {{and a bit}} later another candidate was suggested by Coron, Lepoint, and Ti-bouchi (CLT 13) over the integers. However, both of them {{turned out to be}} insecure from so-called <b>zeroizing</b> attack (HJ 15, CHL+ 15). As a fix of CLT 13, Coron, Lepoint, and Tibouchi proposed another candidate of new multilinear maps over the integers (CLT 15). In this paper, we describe an attack against CLT 15. Our attack shares the essence of cryptanalysis of CLT 13 and exploits low level encodings of zero as well as other public parameters.

Thanks to Yupu Hu and Jean-Sébastien Coron for pointing {{out to me}} various attacks, these attacks (and their extensions) will be described in separate reports in the coming weeks/months. In this note we provide a more-or-less unified framework {{to talk about the}} functionality and security of graded encoding schemes, describe some variations of recent schemes, and discuss their security. In particular we describe schemes that combine elements from both the GGH 13 scheme of Garg, Gentry and Halevi (EUROCRYPT 2013) and the GGH 15 scheme of Gentry, Gorbunov and Halevi (TCC 2015). On one hand, we show how to use techniques from GGH 13 in the GGH 15 construction to enable encoding of arbitrary plaintext elements (as opposed to only small ones) and to introduce “levels/subsets ” (e. g., as needed to implement straddling sets). On the other hand, we show how to modify the GGH 13 scheme to support graph-induced constraints (either instead of, or in addition to, the levels from GGH 13).

40|$|International audience—Cryptographic {{implementations}} {{are subject}} to physical attacks. Private circuits II is a proven protection against a strong attacker, able {{to read and write}} on a finite number of chosen internal nodes. In practice, side-channel analyses and fault injections are less accurate: typically, classical injection techniques (clock and power glitches, electromagnetic pulses, etc.) can be reproducible, but they do not allow to choose the targeted nodes (the situation is different for software dual-rail with precharge logic, such as [1], [2], where (0, 1) ↔ (1, 0) bitflips are easier to achieve, since the computation is fully sequentialized [3]). So, a priori, private circuits II should be a secure protection against such classical fault injection attacks. In this paper, we provide the first implementation of private circuits II in FPGA, secure against read and/or reset of one internal wire chosen by the attacker. Our implementation is a manually coded netlist which instantiates LUT 6 2 (with dual outputs, as required for private circuits II). Our design is a SIMON block cipher programmed in a Spartan 6 Xilinx FPGA. It features a throughput of 142 Mbit/s. We perform a security analysis, and notice that some exploitable ciphertexts can be outputted despite the countermeasure. Our analysis reveals that correlated faults exist because LUT 6 2 outputs are produced almost simultaneously. In particular, the critical path actually consists in a dual-rail pair, which is consistently faulted together. If this pair is late with respect to the clock rising edge, then the previous value can be latched instead of the new one. Such fault behaves like a toggle ((01) 2 becomes (10) 2 or vice-versa) of licit values. They propagate to the ciphertext which becomes by the same token susceptible to a differential fault attack. Nonetheless, we emphasize that such faults require a steady fault injection setup: otherwise, multiple critical paths are violated, resulting in non-exploitable (fully <b>zeroized)</b> ciphertexts.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} {{on the topic of}} the endogenous supply of money. It describes the basic shapes of the endogenous money theory and analyzes the causes of usual misunderstandings about the nature and behavior of money. We outline the important difference between asset-based and liability-based understanding of money and conclude that although both principles are theoretically applicable, the liability-based approach matches the major volume of real economic transactions. The liability-approach, which we conclude to be more appropriate way of understanding money, leads back to the topic of money endogeneity. We go over {{to the development of the}} ideas of endogenous supply of money as they appear over the second half of the 20 th century and depict the major contributions in this area. We reference also the Czech academic research and comment the most relevant works. In the second part, the thesis {{concentrates on}} two theoretical areas analyzing the impacts of the money endogeneity. We point out at fundamental controversies in the concept of deposit multiplication concluding it to be an unrealistic process in a credit based economy. We conclude that the stock of money is not a directly controllable aggregate, especially not by means of the money base. The other area is the theory of capital and the foundation of the return on capital. We recall the Keynesian topic of the euthanasia of the rentier, develop the microeconomical foundation of the accumulation of capital and conclude that the <b>zeroizing</b> of the interest rate is feasible in a long-run. In the third part we go over to economic history and schools of economic thinking confronting them with the theory of endogenous supply of money. We concentrate on the notorious Smithian criticism of the mercantile doctrine finding the criticism not fully sustainable if we consider the varying nature of money over the medieval period. We analyze the available statistical data of medieval England concluding that the stock of monetary metals had a direct influence on the economic activity of England in the pre-Smithian era thus referencing to a strongly exogenous character of money, while there is no such relation afterwards, when money was becoming more endogenous. We put a next emphasis on the Austrian theory of money, which in many aspects is at variance with the endogenous money theory. We analyze both views on the money circulation and add new comments to the discussion on the foundation of the return on capital. We draw attention to the Mises' idea of Zirkulationskredit (circulation credit) concluding that this concept comes in fact to a common understanding of the money behavior along with the endogenous money approach. We conclude with finding that the theory of endogenous supply of money is a fundamental economical concept with impacts on almost all other branches of economics. This thesis thus contributes to a larger adoption of the endogenous money theory in the economical research on the theoretical as well as on the practical level. Concerning the practical area, the primary interest in adoption of this theory in contemporary macroeconomics is indeed concentrated on the suggestion for economic policy after the 2008 subprime crisis and we extend this thesis also by concluding notes in this issue...|$|R
