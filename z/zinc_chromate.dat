5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was <b>zinc</b> <b>chromate,</b> now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E
25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} to avoid contact, an effective method of material separation is required. If paints or coatings are used for isolation, they should be compatible with both metals. Bituminous or <b>zinc</b> <b>chromate</b> primers can be used between copper and aluminum.

30|$|In {{previous}} publications, {{the authors}} have demonstrated the unique value of the Winsor & Newton (W&N) 19 th century archive database for providing efficient access to records covering the commercial preparation of 19 th century artists’ materials [23, 24]. Following the methodology established {{for the study of}} W&N’s lead chromate yellow pigments [25], this paper investigates the preparation and chemistry of barium, <b>zinc</b> and strontium <b>chromate</b> pigments. During the 19 th century, these pigments were sold by W&N under the trade names Lemon Yellow (barium <b>chromate),</b> Citron Yellow (<b>zinc</b> potassium <b>chromate)</b> and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate). According to Carlyle, who studied the powders and oil colours available in the W&N 19 th century catalogues, the first was listed in c. 1835 while the latter two appeared {{for the first time in}} a catalogue from c. 1861.

30|$|Access to the {{production}} records from W&N’s 19 th century archive database {{made it possible to}} carry out a comprehensive study of their manufacturing processes for yellow chromate pigments based on barium (BaCrO 4), zinc (4 ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O· 3 H 2 O) and strontium (SrCrO 4). One hundred and three production records were found for the manufacture of Lemon Yellow (barium chromate, 69 %), Citron Yellow (<b>zinc</b> potassium <b>chromate,</b> 25 %) and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate, 6 %). The majority covers the period between 1838 and 1871. Analysis of W&N’s production records indicates that one main synthetic pathway was found for each pigment. The pH was a key factor controlled by W&N to achieve precipitation of zinc potassium and strontium chromate pigments. There was no evidence that extenders were added during the synthesis of these pigments, whereas their production records for lead chromates do show the addition of extenders [25]. The lack of extenders for these pigments may infer that for W&N, extenders were primarily present to adjust physical properties, tinting strength or hue, rather than functioning predominantly as a means to reduce the cost of materials. The relative tinting strength (TS) of these pigments is lower than pure lead chromate pigments. It was calculated in comparison to pure lead chromate (PbCrO 4,) which was assigned a TS of 100 %. This resulted in a TS of 92 % for barium, 78 % for strontium and 65 % for <b>zinc</b> potassium <b>chromate</b> pigments.|$|R

40|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} of the magnesium alloys AZ 91 D and AM 60 B {{combined with}} different coatings on steel bolts {{was investigated in}} field corrosion tests carried out by Volvo Car Corporation. Light metals like magnesium and aluminum are prone to localized corrosion. The risk of perforation was of particular interest. Three circular plates of each alloy were mounted with steel bolts for each of four different types of bolt coating. The assemblies were placed in racks on three trucks in regular use {{in the area of}} Gothenburg, Sweden, for two years. Maximum pit depths were measured in eight sectors around the bolts {{at the end of the}} two-year period. A newly developed Extreme Value methodology ([1]) was used to analyze the measurements. For the alloy AZ 91 D there were no systematic differences between the sectors or assemblies with the same treatments. Also for the AM 60 B there did not seem to be systematic differences between sectors. However, for AM 60 B there were statistically significant differences between assemblies with the same treatment for all coatings except for the yellow <b>chromate</b> <b>zinc</b> plating Pairwise comparisons exhibited several differences between the coatings for the alloy AZ 91 D.

50|$|Concentrations of {{polyphosphates}} or phosphonates with <b>zinc</b> and <b>chromates</b> {{or similar}} compounds have been maintained in cooling systems to keep heat exchange surfaces clean so {{a film of}} gamma iron oxide and zinc phosphate may inhibit corrosion by passivating anodic and cathodic reaction points.

Chromates reduce biofouling in addition to effective corrosion inhibition, but residual toxicity in blowdown or OTC water has encouraged reduced chromate concentrations and use of less flexible corrosion inhibitors. Blowdown may also contain chromium leached from cooling towers constructed of wood preserved with chromated copper arsenate.|$|R

40|$|A {{study on}} ‘The Behaviour Of Profiled Steel Sheet Folded Plate Structure With Door Opening’ {{was carried out}} in the Civil Engineering Laboratory. The {{selected}} profiled steel sheets for the testing are namely called ‘Bondek II’ (corrugated steel sheet) and the specimen models was made by BHP Steel Building Products (M) Sdn. Bhd. Shah Alam. The Bondek II steel sheeting is roll-formed from hotdipped, <b>zinc</b> coated, and <b>chromate</b> passivated high-strength grade BHP Zinc Hi- Ten steel strip. Bondek II (corrugated sheet) has sheet thickness t = 1 mm, depth of fold /* = 54 mm, sheet width a = 600 mm and length of models is / = 1000 mm. A compressive test was carried on the Bondek II specimen models. The experimental investigation was on four full-scale models of profiled sheet subjected to in-plane axial compressive loading, P. The model tested included two models without door opening. The size of door opening is 180 mm width and 700 mm height which has been converted from the standard door size of 900 mm width x 2100 mm (3 ft x 7 ft). The results of specimens without opening obtained from the experimental work are used as guide to the specimens with door opening. The parameters measured and determined are lateral deflection, buckling and ultimate load capacity. From the experimental test, the load displacement curve and stress-strain pattern was plotted and identified. From this study, the ultimate load capacity of compressed profiled steel with door opening was identified to be smaller than that without opening. This may be because the opening reduced the carrying capacity of the models. The openings also tend to increase the deflection of the models. The specimen with opening is noticed to buckle much faster than without opening. It was also found that the buckling shape occurred at different location for each specimen. The average ultimate load capacity for the specimens without opening determined from the experimental test carried out is 159. 95 kN and the ultimate load capacity for the specimens with door opening is 109. 15 kN. The average percentage different of ultimate load between specimens without opening and with opening is approximately 32 percent...|$|R
