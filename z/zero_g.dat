Also included are algorithms for the following operations: associating with each square the multiplicity of the unique <b>zero</b> of <b>G</b> contained in the square; determining the number of <b>zeros</b> of <b>G</b> in regions of the complex plane such as circles and rectangles; refining selected individual <b>zeros</b> of <b>G,</b> that is, given G, a square S containing a single <b>zero</b> of <b>G,</b> and a positive rational error bound E, computing a subsquare of S which contains the zero and has width less than E.

Riders then enter the mid-course brake run which is located next to the lift hill. Similar to the first drop, the train drops to the left and enters a 270-degree helix followed by the two Interlocking corkscrews. The corkscrews interlock around a mist which sprays the riders with water. Riders go through a small dip then enter the final brake run before returning to the station. Once returned, the floors go back up and the bars close back up enabling riders to unload and next ones to load. Following the conclusion of the ride, guests can purchase an on-ride photo which was taken between the cobra roll and zero-g roll.|$|E
