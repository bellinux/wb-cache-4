Both peak height (five methods) and peak area (four methods) were explored {{for a range of}} conditions to determine the optimum methodology for quantitation. Variables included dataset size, apodization function, damping constant, and <b>zero</b> <b>filling.</b> Based on the results obtained, recommended procedures for optimal quantitation include: apodization using a function appropriate for the peak height ratios observed in the spectrum (i. e., Hanning for ratios of about 1 : 10, three-term Blackman-Harris for ratios of ∼ 1 : 100, or Kaiser-Bessel for ratios of ∼ 1 : 1000); <b>zero</b> <b>filling</b> until the peaks of interest are represented by 10 – 15 points (generally obtained with one order of zero filling); and use of the polynomial y = (ax 2 + bx + c) n and the three data points of highest intensity of the peak to locate the peak maximum, Ymax = (−b 2 / 4 a + c) n. In this peak fitting procedure, which we have termed the “Comisarow method,” n is 5. 5, 9. 5, and 12. 5 for the Hanning, three-term Blackman-Harris, and Kaiser-Bessel apodization functions, respectively.

Methods Measurements were performed at a 3 T Achieva whole body system with a six channel cardiac coil (Philips Healthcare, Best, NL). For initial validation of the method, spectra were obtained from the hearts of two healthy volunteers. Navigator-gated bSSFP cine images were used for positioning the spectroscopy voxel (9. 2 x 6. 1 x 18. 7 mm 3) in the interventricular septum and establishing the trigger delay.

In addition, a previously implemented 5 inner volume saturation 6 scheme was used to mitigate spectral contamination from outside the VOI.

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Cardiac 1 H MR-spectroscopy (MRS) is a {{promising}} tool for investigating human heart disease 1. Previous MRS measurements localized {{in the human}} skeletal muscle allow a separation of intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) 2 and extramyocellular lipids (EMCL) 2 and it was shown that IMCL levels are related to insulin sensitivity (for a review 3). In contrast, EMCL signal can change dramatically depending on the localization of the voxel e. g. due to inclusion of fascia, which might compromise the reproducibility of the measurement 3. Therefore, for cardiac MRS an independent quantification of IMCL and EMCL would be ideal. However, spectral quality of cardiac MRS can be severely impaired by cardiac and respiratory motion, {{as well as by}} static field inhomogeneities making the separation difficult. This work presents the combination of imagebased B 0 -shimming 4, ECG-triggering and navigator-gating along with retrospective frequency-alignment and phase-correction of metabolite-cycled (MC) 5, non-water-suppressed MRS 6, 7 data, and demonstrates the feasibility for obtaining high quality spectroscopic information from the heart.
