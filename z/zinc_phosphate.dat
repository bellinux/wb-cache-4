5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphate.</b> A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>{{phosphating}}</b> {{results in}} a non-reflective, light- to medium-gray finish. Manganese phosphating produces a medium- to dark-gray or black finish.

The grain size of the <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphating</b> is usually the smallest among the three processes, providing a more appealing cosmetic appearance in many applications. Some parkerized guns, particularly of WWII vintage, have almost OD green color. This was caused by contaminants in the acid solution and not cosmoline as is commonly believed.|$|R

50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{coatings}} {{are frequently}} {{used in conjunction}} with sodium stearate (soap) to form a lubrication layer in cold and hot forging. The sodium stearate reacts with the phosphate crystal which in turn are strongly bonded to the metal surface. The reacted soap layer then forms a base for additional unreacted soap to be deposited on top so that a thick three part coating of <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphate,</b> reacted soap and unreacted soap is built up. The resulting coating remains adhered to the metal surface even under extreme deformation. The <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphate</b> is in fact abrasive and it is the soap which performs the actual lubrication. The soap layer must be thick enough to prevent substantial contact between the metal forming dies and phosphate crystal.|$|E
50|$|Manganese {{phosphating}} (Parkerizing), {{even with}} these process improvements, still required the use of expensive and difficult-to-obtain manganese compounds.

50|$|Somewhat {{analogous}} to the improved manganese phosphating process improvements discovered by Baker and Dingman, a similarly improved method was found for an improved <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphating</b> process as well. This improvement was discovered by Darsey of the Parker Rust Proof Company, who filed a patent in February 1941, which was granted in August 1942, , that improved upon the zinc phosphatizing (Parkerizing) process further. He discovered that adding copper reduced the alkalinity requirement over what had been required, and that also adding a chlorate to the nitrates that were already used would additionally permit running the process {{at a much lower}} temperature in the range of 115 to 130 F, reducing the cost of running the process further. With these process improvements, the end result was that a low-temperature (energy-efficient) <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphating</b> (Parkerizing) process, using strategic materials to which the United States had ready access, became the most common phosphating process used during World War II to protect American war materials such as firearms and planes from rust and corrosion.|$|R
