40|$|Abstract: Large {{vibration}} of {{the sheet}} metal near the air knife {{is one of the}} main factors controlling the accuracy of thickness of the cladding zinc in continuous hot-dip galvanizing line. Lots of vibration tests are carried out on the strip and main equipments in the <b>zinc</b> <b>pot</b> area of a galvanizing line during downtime and operation in order to diagnose causes of the large vibration of the strip near the air knife. Theoretic foundation of adjustment of control parameters to suppress the strip vibration is established. Main mechanisms of large vibration of the strip are found by the theory of the transverse vibration of axially moving continua. The first one is the resonance of forced vibration induced by support movement aroused by passive rollers ’ sloshing in the <b>zinc</b> <b>pot,</b> and the other is the parametrically excited resonance of the strip induced by tension fluctuation enlarged by local structural resonances of the cooling tower...|$|E
40|$|Thermo-mechanical {{modeling}} of snouts deformation H. Saint-Raymond, N. Bontems The snout {{is the last}} element which connects the annealing furnace with the zinc bath on Hot Dip Galvanizing line. The main role of the snout is to prevent oxygen atoms to access and damage the steel surface before entering into the <b>zinc</b> <b>pot.</b> Snout-end deformation is today the main reason of snout end-of-life. It generates air leaks, leading to defects generations as non-coated spots. ArcelorMittal R&D developed 3 D thermo-mechanical models of industrial snout-ends. Models {{take into account the}} industrial snout lifetime, i. e. the successive heating and cooling phases during the snout emersions and immersions in the <b>zinc</b> <b>pot.</b> Boundary conditions were determined thanks to specific measurements at laboratory and on industrial plant. The model shows that the main origin of the snout deformation are the temperature gradients between immersed and non-immersed parts, and the dilatation generated during the snout immersion. The creeping effect appears to be negligible. During heating phase like during the cooling, strong compressive stresses appears in the snout walls leading to cracks occurrence and buckling of the snout walls. In all cases, the level and mode of deformation depend strongly on the snout design and fixation system of the snout lower part. This model has been used to define and to test the actions (snout design and/or operating procedure modifications) which limit and control the snout deformation and to evaluate their impact...|$|E

Mary's image remained persistently in her mind, while the bitter wind without made strange noises in the creaking <b>zinc</b> chimney- <b>pots,</b> and rattled the window and hurled furious handfuls of mingled dust and sleet against the panes.

40|$|Manganese furnace dust {{is formed}} from {{volatiles}} and fines collected during wet scrubbing of the off-gas from manganese alloy smelting furnaces. This dust, {{in the form}} of slurry, contains tar, alkalies, zinc, manganese oxide and other elements. Impediments to the recycling of the manganese furnace dust back to the ferroalloy furnaces are the potential accumulation of zinc and alkalies, which can cause irregularities in furnace operation, and handling. This paper examines the behaviour of <b>zinc</b> during sintering <b>pot</b> tests of manganese ore with addition of manganese furnace dust. Laboratory reduction experiments showed that at temperatures above 800 °C zinc oxide was reduced by carbon in tar to zinc vapour. However, zinc removal in sintering pot tests was below 30 %, which was attributed to reoxidation of the zinc vapour. Zinc removal was the highest from the bottom section of the sintering pot bed...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comChickpea (Cicer arietinum) is an important dryland pulse crop {{in many parts of the}} world. Productivity is often limited by periods of water deficit and in a number of regions zinc deficiency occurs, but the interaction between zinc nutrition and water stress has not been studied extensively. This interaction was examined in two glasshouse experiments. Chickpea was grown under deficient (no applied Zn) or adequate (2. 5 μg Zn/g soil) levels of <b>zinc</b> in <b>pots</b> for either 53 days (Experiment 1) or 40 days (Experiment 2) before being exposed to a single period of water stress that lasted for 12 days (Experiment 1) or 23 days (Experiment 2). In one experiment four genotypes (Tyson, ICC- 4958, T- 1587 and NIFA- 88) differing in their sensitivity to zinc deficiency were compared during a single drying cycle, and in the second experiment a single cultivar (Tyson) was compared under well-watered and water stress conditions. Water stress was induced by allowing the soil to dry gradually and the responses in shoot biomass, water use, plant water relations and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ,‰) were measured. Shoot biomass, water use and water use efficiency were reduced by zinc deficiency. Stomatal conductance was lower in zinc-deficient plants as well. Zinc deficiency reduced Δ by about 1 ‰ and there were significant differences in Δ between genotypes which were independent of the level of zinc nutrition. At an adequate level of zinc there was a significant negative correlation between Δ and shoot biomass and between Δ and water use efficiency among the four chickpea genotypes, but these correlations were not significant under zinc deficiency. Osmotic potential was lower and turgor higher in the leaves of zinc-deficient plants, but the ability to adjust osmotically was reduced by zinc deficiency as stress developed. In conclusion, zinc-deficiency reduced the efficiency with which the water was used for biomass production and compromised the plant’s capacity to respond to water stress by osmotic adjustment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a feasibility study of recycling manganese furnace dust generated in production of ferromanganese and silicomanganese at Tasmanian Electrometallurgical Company, Australia. Dried man-ganese furnace dust contains about 20 wt % of carbon, in average 33. 4 wt % of manganese and 1. 3 wt % of zinc. Manganese in the dust {{is in the form}} of MnO, Mn 3 O 4 and MnCO 3; zinc is mainly in the form of ZnO and ZnSO 4. Analysis of the zinc balance with dust recycling showed that to keep zinc intake at the acceptable level, it should be partly removed from the dust. In the reduction laboratory experiments, zinc oxide was reduced to zinc vapour by tar of the dust. Reduction of zinc oxide started at 800 oC and zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature; removal of zinc was close to completion at 1100 oC. Optimal conditions for removing zinc from the dust include temperature in the range 1000 - 1150 oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust frac-tion in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60 %. In the sintering of manganese ore with addition of manganese dust in the sintering <b>pot,</b> <b>zinc</b> was reoxidised and deposited in the sinter bed. Removal of zinc in the sintering pot tests was in the range 4 - 17 %. Up to 30 % zinc removal was achieved from the bottom layer of the sinter bed. It can be concluded that zinc removal will be low during the processing of manganese fur-nace dust in the sinter plant. The zinc removal rate will be the highest when pelletised manganese furnace dust is added to the bottom layer of the sintering bed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is the {{assessment}} of the efficiency of anti-oxidative system in spinach plants growing in the substratum polluted with zinc. The assessment was conducted on the basis of changes of reduced glutathione (GSH) form concentration in the plant aboveground organs. Spinach plants, ‘Matador’ c. v., were cultivated in soils contaminated with <b>zinc</b> in two <b>pot</b> experiments conducted in 2010 and 2011. The experimental substratum was light, slightly soil with granulometric composition of sandy silt loam. Zinc in the acetate form, was supplied to the soil in four doses corresponded to this metal critical concentrations in soil with 0, I, II and III degrees of pollution with this element according to IUNG classification. Simultaneously, the control with natural Zn content in soil was maintained. Zn concentrations in spinach ranged from 412. 8 to 1722 mg ∙ kg- 1 d. m. and increased with growing degree of substratum pollution with this element. Over the course of the vegetation period the content of Zn in plants was generally greater. GSH content in spinach grown in both years of experiments fluctuated from 31. 70 to 238 µg ∙ g- 1 f. m. The biggest content of this compound in spinach was stated in the initial phase of plants growth. The plants tolerated only the first two Zn doses supplied to the substratum. Spinach growing in the objects where zinc additions to the soil equalled II and III degree of substratum pollution died shortly after germination. The plants from these objects in the initial growth phase contained significantly less GSH than spinach from the objects with two first degrees (0 and I) of substratum pollution with zinc or from the control. The content of reduced glutathione form in spinach is a good biomarker of oxidative stress caused by zinc presence in plants. Synthesis of a bigger amount of GSH conditions spinach plant resistance to over the norm zinc content in soil. The efficiency of anti-oxidative system in spinach is bigger in the initial phase of this plant growth...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de doses de Zn, aplicado como oxissulfato, nas formas granulada e em pó, em duas cultivares de arroz. O experimento foi realizado em casa de vegetação em vasos com 3 dm³ de um Latossolo Vermelho distrófico. Todos os vasos receberam calcário, macronutrientes e micronutrientes, com exceção do zinco. Foram aplicadas as doses de 0, 1, 2, 5 e 10 mg de Zn por dm³ de solo. A dose de 4 mg dm- 3 de Zn aplicado como sulfato foi usada como padrão de referência. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado com quatro repetições. O oxissulfato em pó na cultivar IAC 165 e granular na IAC 202 possibilitaram produções de grãos semelhantes às obtidas com o sulfato de zinco. Houve diferença nos teores de Zn nas folhas e colmos das duas cultivares associados à maior produção de grãos. A cultivar IAC 202 foi mais eficiente na utilização de Zn no crescimento vegetativo e na produção de grãos. Os teores de Zn extraídos por Mehlich 1 e DTPA correlacionaram-se significativamente com as doses de Zn aplicadas e com os níveis de Zn no tecido vegetal. Houve correlação significativa entre os dois extratores em relação às doses de Zn aplicadas no solo. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the effect of doses of Zn oxysulfate in granular and powder forms on two rice cultivars in a Red Latosol (Hapludox). The trial {{was carried out in}} a greenhouse in pots with 3 dm³ of soil. Lime, macronutrients and micronutrients except Zn were applied in all <b>pots.</b> <b>Zinc</b> rates were 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 mg dm- 3 of soil. Four mg Zn dm- 3 were used as a standard source of this nutrient. A completely randomized design with four replicates was used. Powder oxysulfate in the cultivar IAC 165 and the granular one in IAC 202 resulted grain yields similar to those obtained with Zn sulfate used as standard. There were differences in the Zn concentration in leaves and culms of the cultivars as associated to the higher grain production. IAC 202 was more efficient in the use of Zn for vegetative growth and grain yield. Available soil Zn extracted either by Mehlich 1 or DTPA showed significant correlation with the doses of Zn applied and with the Zn tissue content. There was significant correlation between Zn levels as evaluated by both extracting solutions...|$|R
