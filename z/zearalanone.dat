40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{investigate}} {{the potential for}} plant derived estrogens (phytoestrogens) genistein, phloretin, biochanin A and <b>zearalanone</b> to relax rabbit coronary arteries in vitro and to determine the mechanism(s) of such relaxation. BACKGROUNDEpidemiological data suggests {{a reduction in the}} incidence of coronary heart disease in humans who have a high intake of phytoestrogens. METHODSIsolated rabbit coronary artery rings were suspended in individual organ baths, precontracted with potassium chloride (30 mM), and the relaxing effects and mechanisms of relaxation to genistein, phloretin, biochanin A and <b>zearalanone</b> were determined by measurement of isometric tension. RESULTSGenistein, phloretin and biochanin A induced significant gender-independent relaxation in rings with and without endothelium. Inhibition of nitric oxide and prostaglandin synthesis with L-NAME and indomethacin had no effect on genistein-induced relaxation. Relaxation was unaffected by the specific estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780, the ATP-sensitive potassium channel inhibitor glibenclamide and the potassium channel inhibitor, barium chloride. Calcium concentration-dependent contraction curves in high potassium depolarization medium were significantly shifted to the right and downward after incubation with genistein and <b>zearalanone.</b> An inhibitory effect of genistein (2 μM) on L-type calcium current in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes confirmed a calcium antagonist relaxing mechanism of action. In healthy volunteers, plasma genistein levels of approximately 2 μM are achieved after ingestion of a commercially available soy protein drink (Supro) containing 37 mg genistein. CONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrates that phytoestrogens induce endothelium-independent relaxation of coronary arteries; the mechanism involves calcium antagonism. These mechanisms may contribute to the potential long-term cardiovascular protective effect of these substances...|$|E

The immunoaffinity columns were prepared by coupling immunoglobulin G fractions obtained from rabbit antisera with a Sepharose matrix. The immunizing agent was carboxybutylzeranol coupled to bovine serum albumin. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed in the negative-ion chemical ionization mode, after derivatization of the compounds to their pentafluorobenzyl ethers, and allowed detection of analytes with a sensitivity of 0. 01 ppb in spiked urine. The derivatization method and the gas chromatographic determination were also applied to the similar compounds <b>zearalanone,</b> zearalenone and beta-zearalenol.

Analytes were extracted from a 1 g sample by homogenization with acetonitrile/water (75 : 25, v/v, 25 mL final volume). 5 mL of crude extracts was cleaned-up on Carbograph- 4 cartridges. Two fractions were obtained and were analyzed by HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative mode. Recoveries for spiked maize samples were in the range 79 - 106 % and method detection limits (MDLs) were <= 6 ng/g for all compounds, except fusarenon X (12 ng/g). 25 random maize samples were analyzed both by the ELISA-based methods specific for deoxynivalenol and zearalenone and by this method for trichothecenes B and macrocyclic lactones.

HPLC-MS/MS analysis showed signal suppression as well as signal enhancement due to matrix effects. However, for most analytes LOQs in the lower pg/mL range and excellent recovery rate were achieved using matrix-matched calibration.

For the LC-MS/MS method LOD/LOQ values for ZON, alpha-ZOL, beta-ZOL, alpha-ZAL and beta-ZAL were 6 / 20, 5 / 17, 4 / 14, 9 / 30 and 6 / 19 mu g 1 (- 1), respectively. Within-day and between-day precision were less then 11 and 14 %, respectively for the HPLC-FLD method, and both less then 20 % for the LC-MS/MS method. The recovery of ZON and its metabolities ranged between 73 and 89 % for the HPLC-FLD method and between 69 and 112 % for the LC-MS/MS method. The methods were used for the detection of the compounds in in vitro biological samples, obtained with human intestinal Caco- 2 cells culture experiments. The 8 -days post-confluent Caco- 2 cells were treated with ZON or a mixture of ZON and imazalil (IMA). After an incubation time of 24 h the samples were analyzed with the HPLC-FLD method. Neither ZON nor its derivatives were detected in the samples. The disappearance of ZON could possibly point out the formation of phase II metabolities like glucuronide conjugates. There, samples were pretreated with beta-glucuronidase before LC-MS/MS analysis. The LC-MS/MS results showed that ZON, alpha-ZOL and beta-ZOL could only be detected in the beta-glucuronidase pretreated samples. This confirmed the formation of glucuronide conjugates and the hydroxylation of ZON during the incubation with Caco- 2 cells. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Zearalenone (ZEN) is {{converted}} to a nontoxic product by a lactonohydololase encoded by zhd 101. An enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was fused to zhd 101 (i. e., egfp::zhd 101) and expressed in Escherichia coli. Both recombinant ZHD 101 and EGFP::ZHD 101 were purified to homogeneity and characterized. Maximal activity of ZHD 101 toward ZEN was measured at approximately 37 to 45 °C and pH 10. 5 (kcat at 30 °C, 0. 51 s− 1). The enzyme was irreversibly inactivated at pH values below 4. 5 or by treatment with serine protease inhibitors. ZHD 101 was also active against five ZEN cognates, although the efficiencies were generally low; e. g., the kcat was highest with <b>zearalanone</b> (1. 5 s− 1) and lowest with β-zearalenol (0. 075 s− 1). EGFP::ZHD 101 had properties {{similar to those of}} the individual proteins with regard to the EGFP fluorescence and lactonohydrolase activity. Fortuitously, EGFP::ZHD 101 exhibited a good correlation between the fluorescence intensity and reaction velocity under various pH conditions. We therefore used egfp::zhd 101 to visually monitor the lactonohydrolase activity in genetically modified organisms and evaluated the usefulness of zhd 101 for in vivo detoxification of ZEN. While recombinant E. coli and transgenic rice calluses exhibited strong EGFP fluorescence and completely degraded ZEN in liquid media, recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae gave poor fluorescence and did not eliminate all the toxicity of the mycotoxin in the medium; i. e., the rest of ZEN was transformed into an unfavorable substrate, β-zearalenol, by an as-yet-unidentified reductase and remained in the medium. Even so, as much as 75 % of ZEN was detoxified by the yeast transformant, which is better than the detoxification system in which food-grade Lactobacillus strains are used (H. El-Nezami, N. Polychronaki, S. Salminen, and H. Mykkuäne, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 68 : 3545 - 3549, 2002). An appropriate combination of a candidate host microbe and the codon-optimized synthetic gene may contribute significantly to establishing a mycotoxin detoxification system for food and feed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMycotoxin {{analysis}} is mainly {{carried out by}} high performance liquid chromatography after immunoassay cleanup or in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. These methods basically imply determination of single compounds only. In the EU, legislation exists for the aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and patulin in food. For deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the fumonisins, legislation will get into force in 2007. To maintain several legal limits it would be preferable to determine all these mycotoxins by routine analysis in different types of matrices in one single extract. This would also be an advantage for HACCP control purposes. For this reason a multimethod is developed with which momentally 33 mycotoxins in various types of products can be analysed. The mycotoxins are extracted from the samples with an acetonitrile-water mixture, which is diluted with water and then directly injected in a LC-MS/MS system. The mycotoxins are separated by reversed phase HPLC and detected using an electrospray ionisation interface (ESI) and tandem MS, using MRM in the positive ion mode, to increase specificity for necessary quality control. With this method the following mycotoxins can be analysed in a single run within 30 minutes: aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin, a-zearalenol, a-zearalanol, b-zearalanol, sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid, penicillic acid, fumonisins B 1, B 2 and B 3, diacetoxyscirpenol, 3 - and 15 acetyl-deoxynivalenol, <b>zearalanone,</b> ergotamin, ergocornin, ergocristin, a-ergocryptin, citrinin, roquefortin C, fusarenone X, nivalenol, mycophenolic acid, alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether. The limit of quantification for the aflatoxins and ochratoxin A is 1. 0 µg/kg and for deoxynivalenol 50 µg/kg. The quantification limits for the other mycotoxins {{are in the range}} of 10 – 200 µg/kg. The matrix effect and validation data are presented for 13 - 24 mycotoxins in peanut, pistachio, wheat, maize, cornflake, raisin and fig. The method has been compared with the official EU method for the determination of aflatoxins in food and relevant FAPAS rounds. The advantage of the multimycotoxin method has been proven by findings of more than one mycotoxin in i. e. maize, buckwheat, fig and nuts. Examples are given of the application of the LC-MS/MS technique for baby food, which is subject to lower limits for aflatoxin B 1 and ochratoxin A, for ergot alkaloids in naturally contaminated rye and for freeze-dried silage samples...|$|E
40|$|Trenbolone acetate (TBA), {{melengestrol}} acetate (MGA) and zeranol are synthetic growth promoters extensively used in animal husbandry, yet despite occurrence {{in water and}} soil {{little is known about}} their environmental fate. The work provides some of the first details related to the persistence and mobility of these synthetic growth promoters and their metabolites (SGPM) in natural aquatic systems. Here, laboratory experimental studies explore their tendency to undergo phototransformation in surface waters and their interaction with soil via sorption or mineral-promoted reactions. In sunlit surface waters, results suggest that the families of TBA (including 172 ̆ 6 beta-trenbolone, 172 ̆ 6 alpha-trenbolone and trendione) and MGA (including melengestrol) will readily undergo direct photolysis. They exhibit half-lives between 0. 25 - 1 h in both natural and simulated sunlight that were largely insensitive to environmental variables (e. g., temperature, pH and cosolutes). In contrast, zeranol, 2 ̆ 6 beta-zearalanol and <b>zearalanone</b> only degrade via indirect photolysis pathways mediated by dissolved organic matter. Their transformation is attributable primarily to hydroxyl radical and triplet DOM at neutral pH values, whereas the contribution of singlet oxygen becomes greater in more alkaline waters. An observed pH-dependence for rates of indirect photolysis suggests these photooxidants react primarily with the monodeprotonated form of zeranol, as well as its metabolites. Given their high rates of direct phototransformation, close attention was paid to elucidating the photoproducts for the TBA family. Generally, all metabolites of TBA photodegrade primarily to a species hydroxylated at the C 12 position of the steroid ring. While this 12 -hydroxy trenbolone species is photostable, it can hydrolyzes to di- and tri-hydroxy products. Most notably, however, it is also prone to dehydration, which results in the regeneration of the TBA metabolite from which it was derived. This dehydration pathway can be acid- and base-catalyzed, but it also occurs to an appreciable extent at neutral pH. It is also temperature dependent, with greatest rates of parent metabolite regeneration at higher temperature. Consequently, the rapid rate of photolysis for TBA metabolites observed in daylight is followed by photoproduct-to-parent reversion mechanism in the dark. This phenomenon has broad and important implications for the fate of TBA metabolites in surface waters. Generally, they will be far more persistent than currently realized, and their concentration will exhibit, pH, diurnal and seasonal dependencies. In soil systems, all SGPMs exhibit a high affinity for organic rich soil (e. g., peat), consistent with an important role for hydrophobic interactions in governing their uptake. However, the extent and reversibility of sorption in such systems is not predictable from common metrics for compound hydrophobicity (e. g., octanol-water partitioning coefficients), suggesting that specific chemical interactions also influence uptake. In model soils systems with lower organic carbon content (1 - 6...|$|E
