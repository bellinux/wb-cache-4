40|$|A aussi fait l'objet d'une présentation à: Environment Workshop, Toulouse School of Economics; Toulouse - (2014 - 11 - 24 - 2014 - 11 - 24) / WorkshopThe scientific, {{political}} and societal debate {{on how to}} prevent {{the erosion of the}} world biodiversity has largely concentrated on the effects of two alternative types of agricultural production, land sparing (intensive farming leaving more land for natural spaces) and land sharing (<b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> richer in biodiversity). For a given production target, Green et al. (2005) conclude in favor of land sparing if the relation between biodiversity and yield is decreasing and convex. Indeed, with a shift to <b>extensive</b> <b>farming,</b> biodiversity then increases little on already cultivated land, while it decreases strongly on newly cultivated land. According to these authors and to Phalan et al. (2011 a), available empirical data are in favor of a land sparing strategy. We extend the model of Green et al. (2005) by adding the reaction of supply and demand to prices. We show that <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> is more interesting than intensive farming for biodiversity if the relation between biodiversity and yield does not have a very high degree of convexity, if demand reacts to prices and if the profitability <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> is lower. Therefore, we do not obtain the result of Green et al. (2005) when production results from market equilibrium. Besides, <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> is detrimental to consumers when their surplus is evaluated in a restrictive way as increasing in quantities consumed and decreasing in prices. Its effect on agricultural producers is indeterminate. Distinguishing food demand in vegetal and animal products, we show that <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> reduces mostly the size of the animal product market, which demand is more price elastic. Integrating demand for animal products increases the advantage <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> towards biodiversity by increasing the price elasticity of demand. The opposite result is obtained when we consider the introduction of policies for the mandatory incorporation of biofuels in fuel. Indeed, the demand for biofuels varies little with prices, to the detriment <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> as far as biodiversity conservation is concerned. We discuss the implications of this model on the social pressure on protected areas, on the relations between different outlets and on welfare and food security. We also discuss its contribution to the analyses notably of Perfecto and Vandermeer (2010) and Tscharntke et al. (2012) on this topic.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of rangeland resources {{for the provision of}} forage for livestock grazing, as well as for biodiversity conservation, the definition of management strategies for semi-extensive farming systems has both economic and environmental consequences. Maintenance <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> is, in turn, the main tool to preserve the valuable biodiversity of these ecosystems. In fact, grazing has major impacts on species composition and forage feed value, because livestock foraging strategy, disturbance intensity and grazing history strongly influence the competitive relationships among species. Thus, grazing management has major impacts on ecosystem services provided by semi-natural grasslands, such as aesthetic value (mainly determining the level of touristic attraction of pastoral landscapes), soil conservation, carbon storage, cultural heritage, etc. However, from the farmers’ point of view, low-intensity farming often means intensive human labor and small yield. Therefore, current socio-economic changes such as abandonment of farms and {{reduction in the number of}} people working in mountain agriculture are causing severe land use changes, which led to a dramatic decline of biodiversity in grassland area. The farmer’s income is a key question in grassland biodiversity conservation. The sustainability <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> depends on the conservation of forage resources, but also on the ability to promote animal welfare, which, in turn, is influenced by the amount and quality of food, that produces morphological and functional modifications at different levels of the digestive apparatus. In addition, in Mediterranean areas, trends in climate change mainly cause greater aridity during summer and likely lead to the worsening <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> <b>farming</b> sustainability. As a consequence of this, the multi-tasking use of grazing activities is a key tool in supporting the <b>extensive</b> <b>farming.</b> Firstly, it has to be considered that the conservation of these open ecosystems is a key element within the European Agricultural Policies, particularly since the 92 / 43 /EEC Directive stated that the conservation of grasslands is a high priority for European farmers, that are largely helped in this direction by financial supports aimed to aware management actions. To this regards, there is a good example represented by the agro-environmental agreement of Marche Region, devoted to a bottom-up setup of strategies for grassland conservation. Farmers that operate following these guidelines receive a financial compensation in addition to those normally made available by the European Agricultural Policies. Moreover, this new task of mountain farmers could be inserted in a wide range of ecosystem services (carbon storage, conservation of aesthetic values, fire prevention, integration of touristic attractors, etc) that might be recognized for the Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) that is one of the key actions inside the UE policies for nature conservation...|$|R

30|$|The recent {{trend of}} 'organic farming' may offer a viable {{solution}} to the continuity <b>of</b> <b>extensive</b> <b>farms</b> (Nardone et al. 2004). Pastoral farmers can easily adopt this type of livestock farming since few management changes are needed, whereas there is a considerable financial premium derived from making this change, and {{there appears to be}} no risk to the preservation of biodiversity (Hole et al. 2005). However, in relation to current EU organic livestock legislation, particular attention needs to be paid to whether the organic practices are genuine, given the numerous derogations (exemptions allowed by the EC), which affects the public's image of the products (Darnhofer et al. 2010; Zoiopoulos and Drosinos 2010). Other options could be the introduction of additional non-commercial herbivores, managed by the local administrations, to keep a sufficient stocking rate in areas of stronger invasion by shrubs. These 'community serving herds', with no 'direct economic or productive' objective, should be regarded as tools to modulate vegetation dynamics (Bailey et al. 1998). In any case, detailed management plans for the use of grazing resources should be available to local administrations, based on locally derived data.|$|R
