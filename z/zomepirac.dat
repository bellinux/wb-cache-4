40|$|Many nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{which have}} antiproliferative activity in colon cancer cells are carboxylate compounds forming acyl glucuronide metabolites.

This study investigated whether the acyl glucuronides (and isomers) of the carboxylate NSAIDs diflunisal, <b>zomepirac</b> and diclofenac had antiproliferative activity on human adenocarcinoma. HT- 29 cells in culture. Included as controls were the carboxylate NSAIDs themselves, the non-carboxylate NSAID piroxicam, and the carboxylate non-NSAID valproate, {{as well as}} its acyl glucuronide and isomers. The compounds were incubated at 1 - 3000 muM with HT- 29 cells for 24 hr, with [H- 3]-thymidine added for an additional 2 hr incubation. IC 50 values were calculated from the concentration-inhibition response curves for thymidine uptake. The four NSAIDs inhibited thymidine uptake, with IC 50 values about 200 - 500 muM. All of the NSAID acyl glucuronides (and isomers, tested in the case of diflunisal) showed antiproliferative activity broadly comparable to the parent drugs. This activity may stem from direct uptake of intact glucuronide/isomers followed by covalent modification of proteins critical in the cell replication process. However, hydrolysis during incubation and cellular uptake of liberated parent NSAID will play a role. In HT- 29 cells incubated with <b>zomepirac,</b> covalently modified proteins in cytosol were detected by immunoblotting with a <b>zomepirac</b> antibody, suggesting that HT- 29 cells do have the capacity to glucuronidate <b>zomepirac.</b> The anti-epileptic drug valproate had no effect on inhibition of thymidine uptake, though, surprisingly, its acyl glucuronide and isomers were active.

40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} pain and inflammation. However, this group of drugs is associated with serious adverse drug reactions. Previously, we studied the mechanisms underlying toxicity of the NSAID diclofenac using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model system. We identified the involvement of several mitochondrial proteins, a transporter and cytochrome P 450 activity in diclofenac toxicity. In this study, we investigated if these processes are also involved in the toxicity of other NSAIDs. We divided the NSAIDs into three classes based on their toxicity mechanisms. Class I consists of diclofenac, indomethacin and ketoprofen. Mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{play a major role in}} the toxicity of this class. Metabolism by cytochrome P 450 s further increases their toxicity, while ABC-transporters decrease the toxicity. Mitochondria and oxidative metabolism also contribute to toxicity of class II drugs ibuprofen and naproxen, but another cellular target dominates their toxicity.

40|$|Background and Aims: <b>Zomepirac</b> (ZP), a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), {{has been}} reported to cause immune-mediated liver injury. In vivo, ZP is metabolized to a chemically reactive acyl glucuronide conjugate (ZAG) which can undergo covalent adduct formation with proteins. Such acyl glucuronide-derived drug-protein adducts may be important in the development of immune and toxic responses caused by NSAID. We have shown using immunoabsorptions that the 110 kDa CD 26 (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) is one of the hepatic target proteins for covalent modification by ZAG. In the present study, a CD 26 -deficient mouse strain was used to examine protein targets for covalent modification by ZP/metabolites in the liver. Methods and Results: The CD 26 -deficient phenotype was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry analysis, RT-PCR, enzyme assay and immunoblotting. Moreover, by using monoclonal antibody immunoblots, CD 26 was not detected in the livers of ZP-treated CD 26 -deficient mice. Immunoblots using a polyclonal antiserum to ZP on liver from ZP-treated mice showed three major sizes of protein bands, in the 70, 110 and 140 kDa regions. Most, but not all, of the anti-ZP immunoreactivity in the 110 kDa region was absent from ZP-treated CD 26 -deficient mice. Conclusion: These data definitively showed that CD 26 was a component of ZP-modified proteins in vivo. In addition, the data suggested that at least one other protein of approximately 110 kDa was modified by covalent adduct formation with ZAG. (C) 2002 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Aldo-keto reductase 1 C 3 (AKR 1 C 3) catalyses the NADPH {{dependent}} {{reduction of}} carbonyl {{groups in a}} number of important steroid and prostanoid molecules. The enzyme is also over-expressed in prostate and breast cancer and its expression is correlated with the aggressiveness of the disease. The steroid products of AKR 1 C 3 catalysis are important in proliferative signalling of hormone-responsive cells, while the prostanoid products promote prostaglandin-dependent proliferative pathways. In these ways, AKR 1 C 3 contributes to tumour development and maintenance, and suggest that inhibition of AKR 1 C 3 activity is an attractive target for the development of new anti-cancer therapies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one well-known class of compounds that inhibits AKR 1 C 3, yet crystal structures have only been determined for this enzyme with flufenamic acid, indomethacin, and closely related analogues bound. While the flufenamic acid and indomethacin structures have been used to design novel inhibitors, they provide only limited coverage of the NSAIDs that inhibit AKR 1 C 3 and that may be used for the development of new AKR 1 C 3 targeted drugs. To understand how other NSAIDs bind to AKR 1 C 3, we have determined ten crystal structures of AKR 1 C 3 complexes that cover three different classes of NSAID, N-phenylanthranilic acids (meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid), arylpropionic acids (flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen), and indomethacin analogues (indomethacin, sulindac, <b>zomepirac).</b> The N-phenylanthranilic and arylpropionic acids bind to common sites including the enzyme catalytic centre and a constitutive active site pocket, wit...|$|E

The present study examined whether covalent adducts were formed with microtubular protein (MTP, 85 % alpha/beta-tubulin) and whether this influenced {{its ability to}} assemble into microtubules. Bovine brain microtubular protein (MTP) was purified by assembly-disassembly cycles and incubated with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) <b>zomepirac</b> (ZP), its acyl glucuronide (ZAG) and rearrangement isomers (iso-ZAG) at various concentrations for 2 h at room temperature and pH 7. 5. Assembly was monitored by change in turbidity (increase in absorbance at 340 nm). Both ZAG and iso-ZAG caused dose-dependent inhibition of assembly (50 % inhibition at about 1 mM), while ZP caused modest inhibition (< 50 % inhibition at 4 mM). In a slightly different system, incubation of performed microtubules with 4 mM ZAG caused about 35 % inhibition of reassembly ability, while modification of MTP under similar conditions resulted in about 85 % reduction of assembly ability. Immunoblotting with a ZP antiserum showed that ZAG and iso-ZAG covalently modified MTP in a dose-dependent manner, while ZP itself caused no modification.

Groups of intact, bile-exteriorized and bile duct-ligated rats given a 50 mg/kg i. v. dose of ZP were studied for 24 hr. In intact rats, only 1. 4 % of the dose was recovered as the sum of ZP, ZP acyl glucuronide (ZAG) and its rearrangement isomers (iso-ZAG) in urine in 24 hr. In bile-exteriorized animals, 0. 5 % of the dose was recovered in urine in 24 hr, with 31. 6 % of the dose being recovered in bile (2. 7 % as ZP, 20. 0 % as ZAG and 8. 9 % as iso-ZAG). In the bile duct-ligated group, recovery of dose in 24 hr urine totalled 17. 5 % (1. 7 % as ZP, 6. 7 % as ZAG and 9. 1 % as iso-ZAG). ZAG and iso-ZAG were measurable in plasma only in the bile duct-ligated group, and covalent binding of ZP to plasma proteins was much higher (5 - 6 fold) than in intact or bile-exteriorized rats. Total adduct concentrations in liver {{were not significantly different}} among the three groups. Immunoblotting using a polyclonal ZP antiserum confirmed that serum albumin was a major target protein in plasma. The major ZP-modified bands in the livers of intact and bile-exteriorized rats were at about 110, 140 and 200 kDa. However, the bands at 110 and 140 kDa were much lower in the livers of bile duct-ligated rats. The results show that about 30 % of ZP doses are normally excreted as ZAG and its isomers in bile, with only minor excretion in urine. Bile duct ligation shunts the glucuronide into blood land urine), strongly promoting adduct formation with plasma proteins, and alters the pattern but not the total quantity of drug-modified proteins formed in the liver.

40|$|The {{effect on}} {{cytotoxicity}} of combining {{a range of}} clinically important non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{with a variety of}} chemotherapeutic drugs was examined in the human lung cancer cell lines DLKP, A 549, COR L 23 P and COR L 23 R and in a human leukaemia line HL 60 /ADR. A specific group of NSAIDs (indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, acemetacin, <b>zomepirac</b> and mefenamic acid) all at non-toxic levels, significantly increased the cytotoxicity of the anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin and epirubicin), as well as teniposide, VP- 16 and vincristine, but not the other vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vinorelbine. A substantial number of other anticancer drugs, including methotrexate, 5 -fluorouracil, cytarabine, hydroxyurea, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, mitoxantrone, actinomycin D, bleomycin, paclitaxel and camptothecin, were also tested, but displayed no synergy in combination with the NSAIDs. The synergistic effect was concentration dependent. The effect appears to be independent of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory ability of the NSAIDs, as (i) the synergistic combination could not be reversed by the addition of prostaglandins D 2 or E 2; (ii) sulindac sulphone, a metabolite of sulindac that does not inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, was positive in the combination assay: and (iii) many NSAIDs known to be cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, e. g. meclofenamic acid, diclofenac, naproxen, fenoprofen, phenylbutazone, flufenamic acid, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and ketoprofen, were inactive in the combination assay. The enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed in a range of drug sensitive tumour cell lines, but did not occur in P- 170 -overexpressing multidrug resistant cell lines. However, in the HL 60 /ADR and COR L 23 R cell lines, in which multidrug resistance is due to overexpression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP, a significant increase in cytotoxicity was observed {{in the presence of the}} active NSAIDs. Subsequent Western blot analysis of the drug sensitive parental cell lines, DLKP and A 549, revealed that they also expressed MRP and reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that mRNA for MRP was present in both cell lines. It was found that the positive NSAIDs were among the more potent inhibitors of [3 H]-LTC 4 transport into inside-out plasma membrane vesicles prepared from MRP-expressing cells, of doxorubicin efflux from preloaded cells and of glutathione-S-transferase activity. The NSAIDs did not enhance cellular sensitivity to radiation. The combination of specific NSAIDs with anticancer drugs reported here may have potential clinical applications, especially in the circumvention of MRP-mediated multidrug resistance...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fenoprofen is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), {{available in}} several different countries, but not widely used. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of single dose oral fenoprofen in acute postoperative pain, and associated adverse events. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to December 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Single oral dose, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of fenoprofen for relief of established moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were assessed for methodological quality and data extracted by two review authors independently. Summed total pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) over 4 to 6 hours was {{used to calculate the}} number of participants achieving at least 50 % pain relief. These derived results were used to calculate, with 95 % confidence intervals, the relative benefit compared to placebo, and the number needed to treat (NNT) for one participant to experience at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was collected. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies (696 participants) met the inclusion criteria; 24 participants were treated with fenoprofen 12. 5 mg, 23 with fenoprofen 25 mg, 79 with fenoprofen 50 mg, 78 with fenoprofen 100 mg, 146 with fenoprofen 200 mg, 55 with fenoprofen 300 mg, 43 with <b>zomepirac</b> 100 mg, 30 with morphine 8 mg, 77 with codeine 60 mg, and 141 with placebo. Participants had pain following third molar extraction, laparoscopy, minor day surgery and episiotomy. The NNT for at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours with a single dose of fenoprofen 200 mg compared to placebo was 2. 3 (1. 9 to 3. 0). There were insufficient data to analyse other doses or active comparators, time to use of rescue medication, or numbers of participants needing rescue medication. There was no difference in numbers of participants experiencing any adverse events between fenoprofen 200 mg and placebo. No serious adverse events or adverse event withdrawals were reported in these studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Oral fenoprofen 200 mg is effective at treating moderate to severe acute postoperative pain, based on limited data for at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours. Efficacy of other doses, other efficacy outcomes, and safety and tolerability could not be assessed...|$|E
40|$|Carboxylate drugs usually form acyl glucuronide conjugates {{as major}} {{metabolites}}. These electrophilic metabolites are reactive, capable of undergoing hydrolysis, rearrangement, and covalent binding reactions to proteins. The last-mentioned property {{has the potential}} to initiate immune and other toxic responses in vivo. In this study, we compared the extent and pattern of covalent adduct formation in plasma and livers of rats dosed with the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) <b>zomepirac</b> (ZP) and diflunisal (DF), the hypolipidemic agent clofibric acid (CA), and the anti- epileptic agent valproic acid (VPA). These drugs form acyl glucuronides with diverse intrinsic reactivities (apparent first order degradation t(1 / 2) values of 0. 5, 0. 6, 3, and 60 h, respectively). Rats were dosed iv twice daily for 2 days (50 mg/kg for ZP, DF, and CA, 150 mg/kg for VPA). Chemical analysis of tissues obtained 6 h after the last dose revealed adduct concentrations of 0. 31, 0. 44, 0. 28, and 0. 05 μg of drug equivalents/mL of plasma and 2. 21, 2. 31, 0. 96, and 0. 96 μg of drug equivalents/g of liver for ZP, DF, CA and VPA treatments, respectively. For both plasma and liver, the higher concentrations of adducts were found with ZP and DF, which have the more reactive glucuronides. The low concentrations of VPA adducts found in plasma were in keeping with the very low reactivity of its glucuronide. In liver, however, VPA adducts achieved concentrations of the same order of magnitude as the other drugs and were accompanied by adducts of the (E) - 2 -en metabolite of VPA at 0. 38 μg of VPA equivalents/g of liver. The liver data for VPA can be explained by an acyl CoA/β-oxidation pathway of adduct formation in addition to that from acyl glucuronidation. Immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against synthetic drug-protein adducts revealed major bands at 110, 140, and ~ 200 kDa in livers of ZP- and DF- treated rats. A fourth major band at 70 kDa in ZP-treated liver had the same apparent molecular weight as the only major band detected in CA-treated liver. A 140 kDa band was detected in liver tissue from VPA-treated rats, as well as several lower molecular weight bands. In plasma, the antisera specifically detected drug-modified serum albumin in samples from rats treated with ZP, DF, and CA, but not VPA. The results with this small series of carboxylate drugs suggested that (a) adduct concentrations in plasma but not liver could be related to acyl glucuronide reactivity, (b) while some modified proteins detected were common, the pattern of modification varied from drug to drug, and (c) caution should be exercised in attributing adduct formation exclusively to the acyl glucuronidation pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} {{of a specific}} group of chemotherapeutic drugs was demonstrated to be enhanced {{in the presence of}} non-toxic concentrations of a number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This was found to occur in the drug sensitive A 549 human lung adenocarcinoma and D L K P human lung squamous carcinoma cell lines. The chemotherapeutic drugs for which the toxicity enhancement effect was found to occur (adriamycin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, vincristine and VP- 16) share the property of being potential substrates for the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP). The {{toxicity of}} drugs which were not MRP-substrates, was unaffected by NSAID treatment. The toxicity of non-chemotherapeutic drug substrates for MRP, such as the heavy metal sodium arsenate was also found to be enhanced {{in the presence of a}} suitable NSAID. NSAIDs are believed to exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects in vivo as a result of their ability to inhibit the enzyme prostaglandin H 2 synthase (PGHS), which is also known as cyclooxygenase (COX). The only NSAIDs found to possess chemotherapeutic drug toxicity enhancing abilities were: indomethacin, sulindac, sulindac sulfide, sulindac sulfone, tolmetin, acemetacin, mefenamic acid and <b>zomepirac.</b> The mechanism by which these NSAIDs enhanced the toxicity of a suitable chemotherapeutic drug was demonstrated to be independent of any effects of NSAIDs on PGHS. This was conclusively demonstrated by the ability of sulindac sulfone (a metabolite of sulindac which is devoid of inhibitory effects on PGHS) to enhance chemotherapeutic drug toxicity to the same extent as achieved using sulindac sulfide (a metabolite of sulindac with potent inhibitory effects on PGHS). MRP protein was demonstrated by Western blotting to be present in low levels in DLKP plasma membrane-derived inside-out vesicles (10 Vs). The MRP in DLKP IOVs was demonstrated to actively transport the M R P substrate leukotriene C 4 (LtC 4). This transport was shown to be inhibited by NSAIDs with drug toxicity enhancing abilities such as indomethacin, but was unaffected by NSAIDs which were without influence on chemotherapeutic d m g toxicity. These results suggested that NSAID-mediated enhancement of chemotherapeutic drug toxicity was dependent on the ability of an NSAED to interfere with the drug efflux activity of MRP. The presence of M R P protein in 10 Vs facilitated investigation into the cytotoxic drug transporting characteristics of MRP. The LtC 4 transport activity of MRP in IOVs from the MRP-overexpressing cell line H L 6 0 - A D R was found to be significantly inhibited by vincristine (an MRP substrate) but not by Taxol or cisplatin (non-MRP substrates). This inhibition in LtC 4 transport with vincristine was synergistically enhanced in the presence of non-inhibitory concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH). These results suggested that M R P substrate drugs such as vincristine may be actively transported by M R P in the presence of GSH. Demonstration of the presence of active MRP protein in DLKP suggested that M R P may also have been present in resistant variants of DLKP. Active MRP protein was shown to be present in a variety of DLKP-related drug resistant cell lines namely DLKP-A 10, DLKPA 2 B, DLKPA 1 IB, DLKPA 6 B and DLKPA 5 F. Preliminary evidence suggested that MRP may be involved in certain aspects of the cytotoxic drug accumulation characteristics of these drug resistant variants of DLKP...|$|E
