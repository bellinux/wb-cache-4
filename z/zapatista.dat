5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the <b>Zapatista</b> rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very well be the final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time that Villa and Orozco were marching on Ciudad Juárez, the <b>Zapatista</b> revolt {{gathered}} strength and spread to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. On April 14, Madero had Emiliano Zapata officially designated as his representative in the region. However, Zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in Morelos by the time that Madero concluded negotiations with Díaz, the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the autonomy of Morelos would be ignored or sidelined. Zapata's first military action was to take the town of Chinameca where he obtained essential supplies. Subsequently, Zapata, for political and strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of Izúcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla. From there he made a wide circle around Cuautla and captured Yautepec and Jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies, munitions and soldiers. By May, out of all the major urban centers in the region, only Cuautla and the capital of Morelos, Cuernavaca, remained outside of his control.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Zapatistas</b> {{originally}} {{aligned with}} Francisco Madero {{in opposition to}} the regime of president Porfirio Diaz, who was soon after overthrown in 1911. After Madero's regime, too, proved uncommitted to the cause of land reform, the <b>Zapatistas</b> turned against him. Fighting continued against the successive leaders Victoriano Huerta and Venustiano Carranza. In 1914, Zapata met at the head of his army with Pancho Villa and his forces at Mexico City to determine the course of the revolution, but they returned to their respective territories without a connected anti-Constitutionalist coalition. When back in Morelos, the <b>Zapatistas</b> fortified themselves against incursions by the forces eager to reassume control of the liberated territories known as the Morelos Commune. Zapata's assassination in 1919 struck a mortal blow to <b>Zapatistas,</b> and the army slowly disbanded afterwards.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} notion of ‛power’ which {{is central to the}} {{movement}} initiated by the <b>Zapatistas.</b> By analysing the contradictions within the <b>Zapatistas</b> movement, it argues that the EZLN gradually seized the power of the Mexican State. Consequently, this paper considers three elements central to the EZLN: democracy versus anarchy, Zapatistas’ desire to change the world without taking power and finally the notions of autonomy and inclusion. This paper therefore questions {{the notion of}} autonomy within the <b>Zapatistas</b> movement which refers to isolation rather than integration by considering examples from the education and health sector...|$|R

5000|$|A {{significant}} difference between the <b>Zapatistas</b> and the Constitutionalists was cultural, since the <b>Zapatistas</b> fought under the banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe and often had a picture of her or other saints on their big hats [...] "to protect them." [...] Many leftist intellectuals and northern Constitutionalists disdained the <b>Zapatistas</b> as too Indian, too Catholic, the embodiment of traditional Mexico that the liberals sought to transform and modernize. In Morelos, priests were not persecuted, and some actively supported the guerrilla struggle. The priest in Cuautla typed the first copy of the Plan of Ayala; a priest gave Zapata his beautiful horse for the war. In Tepoztlán, the priest translated Nahuatl documents from Zapata’s home community of Anenecuilco. Alvaro Obregón organized urban workers in [...] "Red Battalions" [...] to go to Morelos to fight the <b>Zapatistas</b> as well as the followers of Pancho Villa in the north. The <b>Zapatistas</b> have the distinction of opposing every government from Díaz to Madero to Huerta to Carranza for failing to protect and restore their lands to them. Carranza’s solution to the problem was to arrange Zapata’s assassination in 1919, effectively ending the struggle in Morelos against the central government.|$|R

25|$|These women covered {{topics such}} as their lives before the uprising, what had changed since, and how women {{have participated in the}} EZLN. Also, the <b>Zapatista</b> women talked about the terrible {{conditions}} that women suffered which the Zapatistas sought to fix, including: the mistreatment from working for landowners, violence at home, discrimination faced in their own communities, and lack of access to health care and education. Then, the women went on to discuss how the <b>Zapatista</b> movement changed their lives such as decreasing domestic violence, more freedom in regards to marriage and children, and more rights in general. One way that women achieved these changes is through the women’s collectives which allowed the women to be more independent which led to increased participation in the <b>Zapatista</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|EZLN, {{commonly}} known as the <b>Zapatistas,</b> came to the forefront of Chiapas politics in the mid 1990s. Since then, their bases of support have mostly come from indigenous communities in the settled areas of the Lacandon Jungle and the areas around San Cristobal de las Casas. While migration to the Lacandon had been occurring earlier in the 20th century, it accelerated even more in the 1990s, with the <b>Zapatistas</b> encouraging people to seize “unoccupied jungle.” For this reason, the <b>Zapatistas</b> do not have the support of the Lacandon Mayas, who have also feared for their villages’ and people’s safety when confronted by the EZLN.|$|R
25|$|Various battles {{among the}} factions of the Mexican Revolution had skirmishes {{in the state}} until the war was finally over in 1920. The <b>Zapatistas,</b> {{although}} fragmented, were recognized as a political force in Guerrero with many <b>Zapatistas</b> receiving political and military positions. This included Rodolfo Neri as governor, who initiated the Agrarian Reform in 1921, organized workers’ unions and made education mandatory.|$|R
25|$|In 1911, after Díaz resigned, {{the last}} of his {{supporting}} troops in Guerrero surrendered in Acapulco. Rebels loyal to Francisco I. Madero chose Francisco Figueroa as the governor and established Guerrero’s capital in Acapulco. While Madero was initially popular in Guerrero, he soon lost standing for failure to return lands which were claimed by various indigenous and rural farm groups. From this point, the <b>Zapatistas</b> turned on the Madero government with the next phase of the revolution breaking out in Guerrero and other states. The <b>Zapatistas</b> soon had control of the central valley and strategic positions in the north of the state. When Victoriano Huerta took control of the country, the <b>Zapatistas</b> in Guerrero joined forces with those loyal to Venustiano Carranza, eventually controlling almost all of the state by 1914. During this time lands were redistributed. However, after Huerta resigned and Carranza assumed the presidency, the <b>Zapatistas</b> in Guerrero opposed him as well. Carranza offered the position of governor of Guerrero to Julian Blanco in 1915 but he was killed in an ambush a year later. From this point, there were battles between the <b>Zapatistas</b> and forces loyal to Carranza. This ended in 1919, when Emiliano Zapata died and his movement split.|$|R
25|$|The Ejército <b>Zapatista</b> de Liberación Nacional (EZLN) (<b>Zapatista</b> Army of National Liberation) {{was founded}} in the Lacandon Jungle in 1983, {{initially}} functioning as a self-defense unit dedicated to protecting Chiapas' Mayan people from evictions and encroachment on their land. While not Mayan himself, Marcos emerged as the group's leader, and when the EZLN – {{often referred to as}} Zapatistas – began their rebellion on January 1, 1994, Marcos served as their spokesman.|$|E

This allowed many media outlets in Mexico to step up their criticisms of the government. However, the massacre was not carried out by the government but by civilians, demonstrating how the emergence of the <b>Zapatista</b> movement had divided indigenous groups.|$|E
