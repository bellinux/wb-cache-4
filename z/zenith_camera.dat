Such instruments provide vertical deflection data at an angular accuracy level of 0 ". 1 and better. Recently, DZCS have been employed for the collection of dense sets of astrogeodetic vertical deflection data in several test areas in Germany with high-resolution digital terrain model (DTM) data (10 - 50 m resolution) available. These considerable advancements motivate a new analysis of the method of astronomical-topographic levelling, which uses DTM data for the interpolation between the astrogeodetic stations. We present and analyse a least-squares collocation technique that uses DTM data for the accurate interpolation of vertical deflection data. The combination of both data sets allows a precise determination of the gravity field along profiles, even in regions with a rugged topography. The accuracy of the method is studied with particular attention on the density of astrogeodetic stations. The error propagation rule of astronomical levelling is empirically derived. It accounts for the signal omission that increases with the station spacing. In a test area located in the German Alps, the method was successfully applied to the determination of a quasigeoid profile of 23 km length. For a station spacing from a few 100 m to about 2 km, the accuracy of the quasigeoid was found to be about 1 - 2 mm, which corresponds to a relative accuracy of about 0. 05 - 0. 1 ppm.

Our astrogeodetic vertical deflection data set originates from <b>zenith</b> <b>camera</b> observations performed during 1983 - 2008. This set, which is completely independent from EGM 2008, covers, e. g., Switzerland, Germany, Portugal and Greece, and samples a variety of topography ? level terrain, medium elevated and rugged Alpine areas. We describe how EGM 2008 is used to compute vertical deflections according to Helmert?s (surface) definition. Particular {{attention is paid to}} estimating the EGM 2008 signal omission error from residual terrain model (RTM) data. The RTM data is obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation model and the DTM 2006. 0 high degree spherical harmonic reference surface. The comparisons between the astrogeodetic and EGM 2008 vertical deflections show an agreement of about 3 arc seconds (root mean square, RMS). Adding omission error estimates from RTM to EGM 2008 significantly reduces the discrepancies from the complete European set of astrogeodetic deflections to 1 arc second (RMS). Depending on the region, the RMS errors vary between 0. 4 and 1. 5 arc seconds. These values not only reflect EGM 2008 commission errors, but also short-scale mass-density anomalies not modelled from the RTM data. Given (1) formally stated EGM 2008 commission error estimates of about 0. 6 - 0. 8 arc seconds for vertical deflections, and (2) that short-scale mass-density anomalies may affect vertical deflections by about 1 arc second, the agreement between EGM 2008 and our astrogeodetic deflection data set is very good.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that in mountainous areas {{the use of}} residual terrain model (RTM) data significantly improves the accuracy of vertical deflections obtained from high-degree spherical harmonicsynthesis. The new Earth gravitational model EGM 2008 is used to compute vertical deflections up to a spherical harmonic degree of 2160. RTM data can be constructed as difference between high-resolution SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation data and the terrain model DTM 2006. 0 (a spherical harmonic terrain model that complements EGM 2008) providing the long-wavelength reference surface. Because these RTM elevationsimply most of the gravity field signal beyond spherical harmonic degree of 2160, {{they can be used}} to augment EGM 2008 vertical deflection predictions in the very high spherical harmonic degrees. In two mountainous test areas - the German and the Swiss Alps - the combined use of EGM 2008 and RTM data was successfully tested at 223 stations with high-precision astrogeodetic vertical deflections from recent <b>zenith</b> <b>camera</b> observations (accuracy of about 0. 1 arc seconds) available. The comparison of EGM 2008 vertical deflections with the ground-truth astrogeodetic observations shows RMS values (from differences) of 3. 5 arc seconds for ξ and 3. 2 arc seconds for η, respectively. Using a combination of EGM 2008 and RTM data for the prediction of vertical deflections considerably reduces the RMS values to the level of 0. 8 arc seconds for both vertical deflection components, which is a significant improvement of about 75 percent. Density anomalies of the real topography with respect to the residual model topography are one factorlimiting the accuracy of the approach. The proposed technique for vertical deflection predictions is based on three publicly available data sets: (1) EGM 2008, (2) DTM 2006. 0 and (3) SRTM elevation data.

40|$|One {{of prime}} aspects of {{surveying}} projects is guidance of paths {{of a long}} tunnel from different directions and finally ending all paths in a specific place. This kind of underground surveying, because of particular condition, has some different points {{in relation to the}} ground surveying, including Improper geometry in underground transverse, low precise measurement in direction and length due to condition such as refraction, distinct gravity between underground point and corresponding point on the ground (both value and direction of gravity) and etc. To solve this problems, astro-geodetic that is part of geodesy science, can help surveying engineers. In this article, the role of astronomy is defined in two subjects: 1 - Azimuth determination of directions from entrance and exit nets of tunnel and also calibration of gyro-theodolite to use them in Underground transvers: By astronomical methods, azimuth of directions can be determine with an accuracy of 0. 5 arcsecond, whereas, nowadays, no gyroscope can measure the azimuth in this accuracy; For instance, accuracy of the most precise gyroscope (Gyromat 5000) is 1. 2 cm over a distance of one kilometre (2. 4 arcsecond). Furthermore, the calibration methods that will be mention in this article, have significance effects on underground transverse. 2 - Height relation between entrance point and exit point is problematic and time consuming; For example, in a 3 km long tunnel (in Arak- Khoram Abad freeway), to relate entrance point to exit point, it is necessary to perform levelling about 90 km. Other example of this boring and time consuming levelling is in Kerman tunnel. This tunnel is 36 km length, but to transfer the entrance point height to exit point, 150 km levelling is needed. According to this paper, The solution for this difficulty is application of astro-geodetic and determination of vertical deflection by digital <b>zenith</b> <b>camera</b> system TZK 2 -D.

40|$|Digital <b>zenith</b> <b>camera</b> systems (DZCS) are {{dedicated}} astronomical-geodetic measurement {{systems for the}} observation of {{the direction of the}} plumb line. A DZCS key component is a pair of tilt meters for the determination of the instrumental tilt with respect to the plumb line. Highest accuracy (i. e., 0. 1 [*]arc-seconds or better) is achieved in practice through observation with precision tilt meters in opposite faces (180 ° instrumental rotation), and application of rigorous tilt reduction models. A novel concept proposes the development of a hexapod (Stewart platform) -based DZCS. However, hexapod-based total rotations are limited to about 30 °– 60 ° in azimuth (equivalent to ± 15 ° to ± 30 ° yaw rotation), which raises the question {{of the impact of the}} rotation angle between the two faces on the accuracy of the tilt measurement. The goal of the present study is the investigation of the expected accuracy of tilt measurements to be carried out on future hexapod-based DZCS, with special focus placed on the role of the limited rotation angle. A Monte-Carlo simulation study is carried out in order to derive accuracy estimates for the tilt determination as a function of several input parameters, and the results are validated against analytical error propagation. As the main result of the study, limitation of the instrumental rotation to 60 ° (30 °) deteriorates the tilt accuracy by a factor of about 2 (4) compared to a 180 ° rotation between the faces. Nonetheless, a tilt accuracy at the 0. 1 [*]arc-second level is expected when the rotation is at least 45 °, and 0. 05 arc-second (about 0. 25 microradian) accurate tilt meters are deployed. As such, a hexapod-based DZCS can be expected to allow sufficiently accurate determination of the instrumental tilt. This provides supporting evidence for the feasibility of such a novel instrumentation. The outcomes of our study are not only relevant to the field of DZCS, but also to all other types of instruments where the instrumental tilt must be corrected. Examples include electronic theodolites or total stations, gravity meters, and other hexapod-based telescopes...|$|E
