5|$|The {{interplanetary medium}} {{is home to}} at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light.</b> It was likely formed by {{collisions}} within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets. The second dust cloud extends from about 10AU to about 40AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, {{with a mean}} free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital {{distance}} of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

40|$|WFC 3 IR {{observations}} are often background limited. In {{the vast majority}} of cases, when HST is pointed away from the Earth Limb, the main contribution to this background light is caused by <b>zodiacal</b> infrared <b>light,</b> including the Gegenschein, the diffuse glow in the sky centered upon Earth’s antisolar point. In this ISR, we present direct measurements of the infrared background levels as observed by WFC 3 since its launch and in several broad band filters. We compare our observations to the values currently used in the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) and derive a model of the IR background levels as a function of Ecliptic Latitude and Sun Angle...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{near-infrared}} interline sky background, OH and O 2 emission in 19 h of H-band observations {{with the}} GNOSIS OH-suppression unit and the IRIS 2 spectrograph at the 3. 9 -m Anglo-Australian Telescope. We {{find that the}} long-term behaviour of OH emission is best described by a gradual decrease {{during the first half}} of the night followed by a gradual increase during the second half of the night following the behaviour of the solar elevation angle. We measure the interline background at 1. 520 ?m where the instrumental thermal background is very low and study its variation with zenith distance, time after sunset, ecliptic latitude, lunar zenith distance and lunar distance to determine the presence of non-thermal atmospheric emission, <b>zodiacal</b> scattered <b>light</b> and scattered moonlight. <b>Zodiacal</b> scattered <b>light</b> is too faint to be detected in the summed observations. Scattered moonlight due to Mie scattering by atmospheric aerosols is seen at small lunar distances (p ≲ 11 °), but is otherwise too faint to detect. Except at very small lunar distances the interline background at a resolving power of R ≈ 2400 when using OH-suppression fibres is dominated by a non-thermal atmospheric source with a temporal behaviour that resembles atmospheric OH emission, suggesting that the interline background contains instrumentally scattered OH. However, the interline background dims more rapidly than OH early in the night, suggesting contributions from rapid dimming molecules. The absolute interline background is 560 ± 120 photons s⁻¹ m⁻² μm- 1 arcsec⁻² under dark conditions. This value is similar to previous measurements without OH suppression, suggesting that non-suppressed atmospheric emission is responsible for the interline background level. Future OH-suppression fibre designs may address this by the suppression of more sky lines usingmore accurate sky-linemeasurements taken from high-resolution spectra. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Astronomical {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy is made difficult by {{the extremely}} bright and variable night sky background. The night sky surface brightness {{is more than}} a thousand times brighter at 1. 6 m than at 0. 4 m. Furthermore the brightness of the sky changes by factors of 10 % on time-scales of minutes. Background-subtraction is therefore frustrated by high Poisson noise from the extreme brightness, and by systematic noise from the variability. Between 1. 0 and 1. 8 m almost all of this background results from the rotational and vibrational de-excitiation of hydroxyl molecules located at 90 km in the atmosphere. The hydroxyl emission lines are intrinsically very bright, but very narrow. Between the OH lines the sky should be very dark; it is expected that the interline continuum is dominated by the <b>zodiacal</b> scattered <b>light.</b> Therefore selectively filtering the OH lines would enable deep near-infrared observations. 1 page(s...|$|R
25|$|Apart from {{emitting}} light, the sky also scatters incoming light, {{primarily from}} distant {{stars and the}} Milky Way, but also the <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light,</b> sunlight that is reflected and backscattered from interplanetary dust particles.|$|E
25|$|Circular {{polarization}} of <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light</b> and Milky Way diffuse galactic light was measured at wavelength of 550nm by Wolstencroft and Kemp. They found values of , which {{is higher than}} for ordinary stars, presumably because of multiple scattering from dust grains.|$|E

40|$|The extragalactic {{background}} light (EBL) contains all the radiation emitted by nuclear and accretion processes since the epoch of recombination. Direct {{measurements of the}} EBL in the near-IR to mid-IR waveband are extremely difficult due mainly to the <b>zodiacal</b> foreground <b>light.</b> Instead, gamma-ray astronomy offers the possibility to indirectly set limits on the EBL by studying the effects of gamma-ray absorption in the spectra of detected sources in the very high energy range (VHE: $>$ 100 GeV). These effects can be generally seen in the spectra of VHE blazars as a softening (steepening) of the spectrum and/or abrupt changes in the spectral index or breaks. In this work we use recent VERITAS data {{of a group of}} blazars and apply two methods to derive constraints for the EBL spectral properties. We present preliminary results that will be completed with new observations in the near future to enhance the limits on the EBL. Comment: 3 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|As {{more than}} half of the Fluorescence Detector (FD) of the Auger Observatory is completed, data taking is {{becoming}} a routine job. It is then necessary to follow strict procedures to assure the quality of the data. An overview of the data taking methods is given. The nature of the FD background signal is due to the night sky brightness (stars and planet faint light, moonlight, twilight, airglow, <b>zodiacal</b> and artificial <b>light)</b> and to the electronic background (photomultiplier and electronic noise). The analysis of the fluctuations in the FADC signal (variance analysis), directly proportional to the background mean light level, performed for each night of data taking is used to monitor the FD background signal. The data quality is analysed using different techniques, described in detail. Examples of trigger rates, number of stereo events, dead time due to moonlight, weather or hardware problems are given. The analysis comprises several months of data taking, giving an overview of the FD capabilities, performance and allowing a systematic study of data and their correlation with the environment. 1...|$|R
40|$|Many high {{contrast}} coronagraph designs {{have recently been}} proposed. In this paper, their suitability for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets is reviewed. We also develop a linear-algebra based model of coronagraphy that can both explain the behavior of existing coronagraphs and quantify the coronagraphic performance limit imposed by fundamental physics. We find that the maximum theoretical throughput of a coronagraph is equal to one minus the non-aberrated non-coronagraphic PSF of the telescope. We describe how a coronagraph reaching this fundamental limit may be designed, and how much improvement over the best existing coronagraph design is still possible. Both the analytical model and numerical simulations of existing designs also show that this theoretical limit rapidly degrades as the source size is increased: the ``highest performance'' coronagraphs, those with the highest throughput and smallest Inner Working Angle (IWA), are the most sensitive to stellar angular diameter. This unfortunately rules {{out the possibility of}} using a small IWA (lambda/d) coronagraph for a terrestrial planet imaging mission. Finally, a detailed numerical simulation which accurately accounts for stellar angular size, <b>zodiacal</b> and exozodiacal <b>light</b> is used to quantify the efficiency of coronagraph designs for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets in a possible real observing program. We find that in the photon noise limited regime, a 4 m telescope with a theoretically optimal coronagraph is able to detect Earth-like planets around 50 stars with 1 hr exposure time per target (assuming 25 % throughput and exozodi levels similar to our solar system). We also show that at least 2 existing coronagraph design can approach this level of performance in the ideal monochromatic case considered in this study.

25|$|Skyglow {{brightness}} can {{be measured}} with instruments such as the Sky Quality Meters (SQM), or visually using the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale. The nine-class Bortle Scale rates {{the darkness of the}} night sky and the visibility of its phenomena, such as the Milky Way, gegenschein and the <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light</b> (easily masked by skyglow), providing a detailed description of each level on the scale (with Class 1 being the best).|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} airglow and <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light</b> is quite {{variable}} (depending, amongst {{other things on}} sunspot activity and the Solar cycle) but given optimal conditions the darkest possible sky has a brightness of about 22 magnitude/square arcsecond. If a full moon is present, the sky brightness increases to about 18 magnitude/sq. arcsecond depending on local atmospheric transparency, 40 times brighter than the darkest sky. In densely populated areas a sky brightness of 17 magnitude/sq. arcsecond is not uncommon, or as much as 100 times brighter than is natural.|$|E
25|$|Cosmic dust {{is widely}} present in space, where {{gas and dust}} clouds are primary {{precursors}} for planetary systems. The <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light,</b> as seen in a dark night sky, is produced by sunlight reflected from particles of dust in orbit around the Sun. The tails of comets are produced by emissions of dust and ionized gas {{from the body of}} the comet. Dust also covers solid planetary bodies, and vast dust storms occur on Mars that cover almost the entire planet. Interstellar dust is found between the stars, and high concentrations produce diffuse nebulae and reflection nebulae.|$|E
25|$|Successful in {{all three}} endeavors, Volyova, Khouri, and Thorn begin the lengthy evacuation, while the Inhibitors {{continue}} their mysterious construction project.

It is at this point that a beta-level simulation of Clavain arrives in a laser transmission, and attempts to negotiate the peaceful turn over of the cache weapons to the soon to be arriving <b>Zodiacal</b> <b>Light.</b> Volyova rejects his requests, explaining that she has greater need to the weapons and continues deploying them.|$|E
500|$|The {{combination}} of this fine asteroid dust, {{as well as}} ejected cometary material, produces the <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light.</b> This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending {{from the direction of}} the Sun along the plane of the ecliptic. Asteroid particles that produce the visible <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light</b> average about 40μm in radius. The typical lifetimes of main-belt zodiacal cloud particles are about 700,000years. Thus, to maintain the bands of dust, new particles must be steadily produced within the asteroid belt. It was once thought that collisions of asteroids form a major component of the <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light.</b> [...] However, computer simulations by Nesvorný and colleagues attributed 85 percent of the zodiacal-light dust to fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets, rather than to comets and collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. At most 10 percent of the dust is attributed to the asteroid belt.|$|E
2500|$|To {{create this}} model, the IPD {{had to be}} {{subtracted}} out of the DIRBE data. [...] It was found that this cloud, which as seen from Earth is <b>Zodiacal</b> <b>light,</b> was not centered on the Sun, as previously thought, but on a place in space a few million kilometers away. [...] This {{is due to the}} gravitation influence of Saturn and Jupiter.|$|E
2500|$|Ney's {{studies of}} the corona piqued his curiosity about other sources of dim light within the solar system. [...] Consequently, Ney and Huch {{developed}} reliable cameras whose low F-number enhanced their ability to record dim light, but sacrificed picture sharpness. [...] This compromise proved to be appropriate for the dim and diffuse <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light</b> and airglow. [...] On May 15, 1963, aboard Faith 7, one of Ney's cameras was operated in space by Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper. [...] According to Ney's student John E. Naugle, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, one of its images was: [...] ".... the first photograph of the night airglow taken from above." [...] NASA designated Ney's experiment as [...] "S-1", which means {{that it was the}} first scientific experiment conducted on a manned space flight. [...] Later, aboard Geminis, 5, 9, 10, and 11, astronauts photographed the <b>Zodiacal</b> <b>Light</b> and the gegenschein, which had been obscured in the Mercury missions by nightglow.|$|E
2500|$|Ney {{followed}} up his zodiacal experiments on manned space missions by putting instruments aboard the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO). [...] The observations showed that <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light</b> is highly polarized, {{and that its}} intensity and polarization are nearly constant in time. [...] The OSO instruments also recorded terrestrial lightning and demonstrated the remarkable {{fact that there are}} ten times as many flashes over the land as over the ocean. This difference remains unexplained.|$|E
2500|$|To confirm {{and extend}} these observations, Ney {{organized}} {{an expedition to}} The Forks, Maine and Senneterre, Quebec, where he set up two polarimeters to measure the corona during the eclipse of July 20, 1963. [...] In coordination with these measurements, two balloons were launched {{into the path of}} totality with cameras to record the <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light.</b> [...] Zodiacal cameras were also launched in Australia by V. D. Hopper and J. G. Sparrow, and astronaut Scott Carpenter took photographs of the corona from an aircraft at 40,000 feet over Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Ed Ney at Minnesota had {{a strong}} belief that being at the {{scientific}} forefront meant doing new and difficult things that few others were doing and doing them better. [...] He also felt {{that to be the}} best at what you do and the master of your future, you {{had to be able to}} learn how to create and advance all of the technology in your own house rather than collaborating too closely with outsiders. [...] Ed's eclectic interests led him in a natural progression from the Manhattan Project, to measurements of cosmic rays, to studies of the physics of balloon flight, to atmospheric and solar physics, to research on the solar corona and the <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light,</b> and finally into the world of astronomy.|$|E
2500|$|Light {{from the}} corona comes from three primary sources, {{from the same}} volume of space. The K-corona (Kfor kontinuierlich, [...] "continuous" [...] in German) is created by {{sunlight}} scattering off free electrons; Doppler broadening of the reflected photospheric absorption lines spreads them so greatly as to completely obscure them, giving the spectral appearance of a continuum with no absorption lines. The F-corona (Ffor Fraunhofer) is created by sunlight bouncing off dust particles, and is observable because its light contains the Fraunhofer absorption lines that are seen in raw sunlight; the F-corona extends to very high elongation angles from the Sun, where {{it is called the}} <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light.</b> The E-corona (E for emission) is due to spectral emission lines produced by ions that are present in the coronal plasma; it may be observed in broad or forbidden or hot spectral emission lines and is the main source of information about the corona's composition.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, May re-registered for his PhD at Imperial College and {{submitted}} his thesis in August 2007 (one year earlier than he estimated {{it would take}} to complete). As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by NASA's IRAS satellite. After a viva voce, the revised thesis (entitled A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud) was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced. He was able to submit his thesis only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic during the intervening years and has described the subject as one that became [...] "trendy" [...] again in the 2000s. His PhD investigated radial velocity using absorption spectroscopy and doppler spectroscopy of <b>zodiacal</b> <b>light</b> using a Fabry–Pérot interferometer based at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife. His research was initially supervised by Jim Ring, Ken Reay and in the latter stages by Michael Rowan-Robinson. He graduated at the awards ceremony of Imperial College held in the Royal Albert Hall on 14 May 2008.|$|E
