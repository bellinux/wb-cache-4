5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the <b>zip</b> <b>code</b> had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any <b>zip</b> <b>code</b> in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E
40|$|This {{analysis}} of campaign contribution data presents {{a portrait of}} what segments of New York State have the greatest influence over legislative actions in Albany through campaign contributions. Our {{analysis of}} campaign contributions to Assembly members and Senators from the 2006 and 2008 election cycles from <b>zip</b> <b>codes</b> throughout New York State found enormous disparities in the contributions coming from different <b>zip</b> <b>codes</b> based on geography, race and ethnicity, and economic status. Specifically, in the 2006 to 2008 period, we found that: Four out of five dollars of the $ 72 million flowing into campaign coffers in Albany, or $ 58 million, came from <b>zip</b> <b>codes</b> that are majority white. One third of campaign cash came from wealthy <b>zip</b> <b>codes</b> where {{a large number of}} households earned over $ 200, 000, even though such <b>zip</b> <b>codes</b> are just 12 % of the state's population.

5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a reloadable card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of Easy Cards by credit card without entering a PIN or billing <b>zip</b> <b>code,</b> which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash. Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring <b>zip</b> <b>code</b> verification for all cards.|$|E

Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E

40|$|We {{conduct a}} within-county {{analysis}} using detailed ZIP code-level data to document new findings regarding {{the origins of}} the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. The sharp increase in mortgage defaults in 2007 is significantly amplified in subprime <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes,</b> or <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes</b> with a disproportionately large share of subprime borrowers as of 1996. Prior to the default crisis, these subprime <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes</b> experience an unprecedented relative growth in mortgage credit. The expansion in mortgage credit from 2002 to 2005 to subprime <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes</b> occurs despite sharply declining relative (and in some cases absolute) income growth in these neighborhoods. In fact, 2002 to 2005 is the only period in the past eighteen years in which income and mortgage credit growth are negatively correlated. We show that the expansion in mortgage credit to subprime <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes</b> and its dissociation from income growth is closely correlated with the increase in securitization of subprime mortgages.
