40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the fifth}} common malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Targeted therapies for HCC are being extensively developed with the limited success of sorafinib. In the present study, we investigated the potential antitumor activity of <b>zardaverine,</b> a dual-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 / 4 inhibitor in HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Although all <b>zardaverine,</b> PDE 3 inhibitor trequinsin and PDE 4 inhibitor rolipram increased intracellular cAMP levels through inhibiting PDE activity, only <b>zardaverine</b> significantly and selectively inhibited the proliferation of certain HCC cells, indicating that the antitumor activity of <b>zardaverine</b> is independent of PDE 3 / 4 inhibition and intracellular cAMP levels. Further studies demonstrated that <b>zardaverine</b> induced G 0 /G 1 phase cell cycle arrest of sensitive HCC cells through dysregulating cell cycle-associated proteins, including Cdk 4, Cdk 6, Cdk 2, Cyclin A, Cyclin E, p 21 and Rb. Notably, Rb expression was reversely related to the cell sensitivity to <b>zardaverine.</b> The present findings indicate that <b>zardaverine</b> may have potential as targeted therapies for some HCC, and the likely mechanism of action underlying its selective antitumor activity {{may be related to}} its regulation of Rb or Rb-associated signaling in cell cycles...|$|E

We recently compared the bronchodilating and bronchoprotective potency of <b>zardaverine</b> and the nonselective PDE inhibitor theophylline by measuring typical spontaneous and forced respiratory funcfion parameters in anaesthetized rats using whole-body plethysmography. 60 female Wistar rats (240 g) {{were used in the}} experiment. <b>Zardaverine</b> (3, 10, 30 mymol/kg) and theophylline (30, 100, 300 umol/kg), respectively, were given orally in 4 % Methocel/ 0. 9 % saline solution after more than 15 h starving. 20 min after treatment the measurements were started. One week earlier, to obtain control values, measurements were performed 20 min after feeding the vehicle. When spontaneously breathing, the 30 Amol/kg <b>zardaverine</b> (300 mymol/kg theophylline) treated animals showed a 23 % (14 %, ns) decreased lung resistance and a 43 % (25 %) elevated dynamic compliance. There was no indication of a chan ged lung elasticity based on quasistatic compliance and therefore the increased dynamic compliance as well as the decreased resistance can only be caused by bronchodilation. In the acetylcholine challenge test treatment with only 10 umol/kg <b>zardaverine</b> (but 300 mymol/kg theophylline) revealed a 37 % (28 %) lower resistance and 85 % (44 %) higher compliance.

40|$|AbstractCyclic {{nucleotide}} phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate physiological {{processes by}} degrading intracellular second messengers, adenosine- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic phosphate or guanosine- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic phosphate. The first crystal structure of PDE 4 D catalytic domain and a bound inhibitor, <b>zardaverine,</b> was determined. <b>Zardaverine</b> binds {{to a highly}} conserved pocket that includes the catalytic metal binding site. <b>Zardaverine</b> fills {{only a portion of}} the active site pocket. More selective PDE 4 inhibitors including rolipram, cilomilast and roflumilast have additional functional groups that can utilize the remaining empty space for increased binding energy and selectivity. In the crystal structure, the catalytic domain of PDE 4 D possesses an extensive dimerization interface containing residues that are highly conserved in PDE 1, 3, 4, 8 and 9. Mutations of R 358 D or D 322 R among these interface residues prohibit dimerization of the PDE 4 D catalytic domain in solution...|$|E

40|$|The anti-spasmogenic {{potential}} of SK&F 94120 (PDE 3 -selective), rolipram (PDE 4 -selective), zaprinast (PDE 5 -selective), <b>zardaverine</b> (dual PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor) and theophylline (non-selective) was evaluated in guinea-pig trachealis. SK&F 94120 or rolipram (10 and 100 [*]μM) antagonized histamine-induced tension generation in a concentration-dependent and non-competitive manner whereas ACh-induced contractions were unaffected. Similarly, SK&F 94120 and rolipram in combination were anti-spasmogenic {{with respect to}} both contractile agonists to an extent that was greater than the effect of either drug alone. Identical results were obtained with <b>zardaverine</b> (1, 10 and 100 [*]μM) and theophylline (100 [*]μM and 1 [*]mM). Zaprinast protected guinea-pig trachealis against histamine-, but not ACh-induced contractile responses {{in a manner that}} was indistinguishable from the results obtained with SK&F 94120. However, in contrast to the interaction between SK&F 94120 and rolipram, no further antagonism was seen when zaprinast and rolipram were used in combination. Pre-treatment of tissues with SNP (10 and 100 [*]μM) antagonized histamine-induced tension generation in a concentration-dependent and non-competitive manner. However, no further antagonism was produced when SNP and rolipram were used concurrently. Likewise, the protection afforded by a combination SNP and SK&F 94120 was no greater than that produced by SNP alone. These results demonstrate that an inhibitor of PDE 3 enhances the anti-spasmogenic activity of rolipram but not drugs that elevate cyclic GMP mass. Moreover, the ability of SNP and zaprinast to protect guinea-pig trachealis against histamine-induced contractions apparently is not due to the inhibition of PDE 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{spasmolytic}} and anti-spasmogenic {{activity of}} β-adrenoceptor agonists on airways smooth muscle {{is thought to}} involve activation of the cyclic AMP/cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) cascade. Here we have tested the hypothesis that PKA mediates the anti-spasmogenic activity of isoprenaline and other cyclic AMP-elevating agents in guinea-pig isolated trachea by utilizing a number of cell permeant cyclic AMP analogues that act as competitive ‘antagonists' of PKA. Anion-exchange chromatography of guinea-pig tracheae resolved two peaks of PKA activity that corresponded to the type I (∼ 5 %) and type II (∼ 93 %) isoenzymes. Pre-treatment of tracheae with <b>zardaverine</b> (30 [*]μM), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (1 [*]μM) and the non-selective activator of PKA, Sp- 8 -CPT-cAMPS (10 [*]μM), produced a non-parallel rightwards shift in the concentration-response curves that described acetylcholine (ACh) -induced tension generation. The type II-selective PKA inhibitor, Rp- 8 -CPT-cAMPS (300 [*]μM), abolished this effect. Pre-treatment of tracheae with Sp- 8 -Br-PET-cGMPS (30 [*]μM) produced a non-parallel rightwards shift of the concentration-response curves that described ACh-induced tension generation. The selective cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor, Rp- 8 -pCPT-cGMPS (300 [*]μM), abolished this effect. Pre-treatment of tracheae with isoprenaline (1 [*]μM) produced a 10 fold shift {{to the right of}} the ACh concentration-response curve by a mechanism that was unaffected by Rp- 8 -Br-cAMPS (300 [*]μM, selective inhibitor of type I PKA), Rp- 8 -CPT-cAMPS (300 [*]μM) and Rp- 8 -pCPT-cGMPS (300 [*]μM). We conclude that the anti-spasmogenic activity of Sp- 8 -CPT-cAMPS, <b>zardaverine</b> and VIP in guinea-pig trachea is attributable to activation of the cyclic AMP/PKA cascade whereas isoprenaline suppresses ACh-induced contractions by a mechanism(s) that is independent of PKA and PKG...|$|E
40|$|Non-selective inhibitors of cyclic {{nucleotide}} phosphodiesterase (PDE) block allergen-induced {{contraction of}} passively sensitized human airways in vitro by a dual mechanism involving a direct relaxant effect on smooth muscle and inhibition of histamine and cysteinyl leukotriene (LT) release from airways. We investigated {{the effects of}} non-selective PDE inhibitors and selective inhibitors of PDE 3 and PDE 4 {{in order to determine}} the involvement of PDE isoenzymes in the suppression of allergic bronchoconstriction. Macroscopically normal airways from 76 patients were sensitized with IgE-rich sera (> 250 [*]u[*]ml− 1) containing specific antibodies against allergen (Dermatophagoides farinae). Contractile responses of bronchial rings were assessed using standard organ bath techniques. Passive sensitization caused increased contractile responses to allergen, histamine and LTC 4. Non-selective PDE inhibitors (theophylline, 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine [IBMX]), a PDE 3 -selective inhibitor (motapizone), PDE 4 -selective inhibitors (RP 73401, rolipram, AWD 12 - 281) and a mixed PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor (<b>zardaverine)</b> all significantly relaxed inherent bronchial tone at resting tension and to a similar degree. Theophylline, IBMX, <b>zardaverine</b> and the combination of motapizone and RP 73401 inhibited the contractile responses to allergen and LTC 4. Pre-treatment with motapizone, RP 73401, rolipram or the methylxanthine adenosine receptor antagonist, 8 -phenyltheophylline, did not significantly decrease responses to either allergen or LTC 4. We conclude that combined inhibition of PDE 3 and PDE 4, but not selective inhibition of either isoenzyme or antagonism of adenosine receptors, is effective in suppressing allergen-induced contractions of passively sensitized human airways. The relationship between allergen- and LTC 4 -induced responses suggests that PDE inhibitors with PDE 3 and PDE 4 selectivity are likely to act in part through inhibition of mediator release and not simply through direct relaxant actions on airway smooth muscle...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophil-derived {{hydrogen}} peroxide (H 2 O 2) {{is believed to}} play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular injury and pulmonary edema. H 2 O 2 time- and dose-dependently increased the hydraulic conductivity and decreased the selectivity of an endothelial cell monolayer derived from porcine pulmonary arteries. Effects of H 2 O 2 on endothelial permeability were completely inhibited by adenylate cyclase activation with 10 (- 12) M cholera toxin or 0. 1 microM forskolin. 10 (- 8) M Sp-cAMPS, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A agonist, was similarly effective. The phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors motapizone (10 (- 4) M), rolipram (10 (- 6) M), and <b>zardaverine</b> (10 (- 8) M), which specifically inhibit PDE-isoenzymes III, IV, and III/IV potently blocked H 2 O 2 -induced endothelial permeability when combined with 10 (- 6) M prostaglandin E 1. Overall cellular cAMP content and inhibition of H 2 O 2 effects on endothelial permeability were poorly correlated. H 2 O 2 exposure resulted in a rapid and substantial decrease in endothelial cAMP content. The analysis of the PDE isoenzyme spectrum showed high activities of isoenzymes II, III, and IV in porcine pulmonary endothelial cells. The data suggest that adenylate cyclase activation/PDE inhibition is a powerful approach to block H 2 O 2 -induced increase in endothelial permeability. This concept appears especially valuable when endothelial PDE isoenzyme pattern and PDE inhibitor profile are matched optimally...|$|E
40|$|Background: Magnesium {{deficiency}} is {{a common}} complication of diabetes with an unclear molecular background. Objective: Our aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of the insulin (INS) -signaling pathway (ISP) on the regulation of Mg 2 + efflux (Mg 2 +E) conducted by solute carrier family 41, member A 1 (SLC 41 A 1; activated by protein kinase A) in transgenic human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Methods: HEK 293 cells overexpressing SLC 41 A 1 were loaded with the Mg 2 + fluorescent indicator mag-fura- 2 and Mg 2 +. Measurements of Mg 2 +E were conducted in Mg 2 +-free buffer by using fast-filter fluorescence spectrometry. We examined the effects of INS, inhibitors of ISP or p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK), an activator of adenylate cyclase (ADC), and their combinations on SLC 41 A 1 -attributed Mg 2 +E. Results: The application of 400 mU/mL INS inhibited SLC 41 A 1 -mediated Mg 2 +E by up to 50. 6 % compared with INS-untreated cells (P < 0. 001). Moreover, INS evoked the early onset ofMg 2 + release from intracellular stores. The application of 0. 1 mM wortmannin or 10 mM <b>zardaverine</b> (both ISP inhibitors) restored SLC 41 A 1 Mg 2 +E capacity in the presence of INS to the same levels seen in INS-untreated cells. The simultaneous application of 10 mM forskolin, and ADC activator, and INS resulted in a reduction of Mg 2 +E of up to 59 % compared with untreated cells (P < 0. 001), which was comparable to that seen in cells treated with INS alone. Inhibition of p 38 MAPK with 10 mM SB 202190 (SB) in the absence of INS resulted in...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} implicated an {{inflammatory}} link between obesity and type 2 diabetes. We applied a multidisciplinary approach spanning from in vivo animal physiology to in vitro cell culture and biochemistry {{to address the}} role of obesity-related inflammation in adipose tissue. The inhibitor of κB kinase β (IKKβ) has previously been linked to insulin resistance. High-fat diet dramatically increased protein and kinase activity levels of the two noncanonical IKK family members, IKKε and TBK 1, in adipose tissue. Genetic ablation of IKKε or pharmacologic inhibition of IKKε and TBK 1, using the selective protein kinase inhibitor amlexanox, resulted in many metabolic improvements, including reduced weight gain in mice on a high fat diet. The improvements in IKKε knockout and amlexanox-treated mice on a high fat diet were correlated with increased energy expenditure, core body temperature, adipogenesis, and the proton uncoupling protein, UCP 1 protein levels in adipose tissue. Studies with 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes elucidated the mechanism by which IKKε and TBK 1 regulate cAMP and β-adrenergic signaling in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Expression of IKKε in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes decreased UCP 1 expression in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. The rate of lipolysis, levels of cAMP, and phosphorylation of PKA substrates such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) were also diminished in response to isoproterenol or forskolin by overexpression of IKKε or TBK 1 in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. IKKε and TBK 1 are induced by inflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis α (TNFα) and Poly(I:C), and blockade of these kinases reversed the diminution of β-adrenergic signaling, cAMP, and lipolysis. The reduction of cAMP levels in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes expressing IKKε or TBK 1 was reversed by the phosphodiesterase 3 B inhibitor, <b>zardaverine.</b> IKKε and TBK 1 were found to bind to and phosphorylate PDE 3 B at serine 318, resulting in its activation and 14 - 3 - 3 β binding. These studies suggest that reduced cAMP production through phosphorylation and activation of PDE 3 B by IKKε and TBK 1 is responsible for mediating the effects of IKKε and TBK 1 in adipocytes...|$|E
40|$|Selva, Erica M. Sol-Church, KatiaCostello Syndrome (CS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant disorder which is estimated to affect rough 350 patients worldwide. CS patients are born with failure-tothrive, coarse facial features, short stature, skeletal and skin abnormalities, and a widerange of intellectual disabilities. CS {{is the result of}} heterozygous germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS. These activating germline mutations result in constitutive activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and leads to increased cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and migration. CS patients also have a higher predisposition for developing malignances including neuroblastoma, early onset bladder carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. The most common malignancy seen in CS patients is embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). In our CS cohort 14 of our 141 CS patients have developed ERMS. In this study we were able to analyze eleven ERMS tumors from eight of the fourteen unrelated patients. ERMS is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma and accounts for roughly 4. 5 % of all pediatric cancers (Ries et al., 1999). It is thought to be derived from the skeletal muscle lineage. ERMS has been classically described by LOH at the 11 p 15. 5 (Visser et al., 1997, Kratz et al., 2007; Menke et al., 2015) with or without the presence of a mutation in any of the RAS genes. Very few studies had been conducted to better understand tumorigenesis in the context of syndromic and nonsyndromic ERMS, therefore we aimed {{to take a closer look}} into the cytogenetic, molecular, and functional levels of ERMS in both populations. For the first time, this research showed that ERMS tumors, both syndromic and nonsyndromic, have complete uniparental disomy of chromosome (UPD 11). We showed that ERMS tumors display either UPD 11 or segmental LOH, which includes but is not limited to the 11 p 15. 5 locus as previously thought. Though it has been speculated throughout the literature that lossof- imprinting (LOI) occurs at the 11 p 15. 5 imprinted gene cluster there have been no previous studies with ERMS to show this. However, the work in this dissertation suggests that both CS and sporadic ERMS tumors, may display LOI by misexpression of the maternally expressed genes H 19 and CDKN 1 C from the paternal allele. Though it is extremely tempting to claim our experiments prove LOI at this locus in ERMS, it could prove to be a technology artifact. It was not only beneficial to take a closer look into the cytogenetic, molecular and functional levels to understand ERMS tumorigenesis, but it was also critical to understand important crosstalk between the RAS signaling pathway and other critical pathways involved in ERMS. While there have been some previous ERMS gene expression studies to identify top players involved in tumorigenesis there have been no studies that included a CS ERMS cohort. Therefore in this study, microarray gene expression analysis was used to identify possible differences between the ERMS group consisting of both CS and sporadic ERMS and the control group consisting of CS and control fibroblasts. This study enabled for us to identify genes that were ERMS specific in both syndromic and nonsyndromic ERMS models. The analysis from this study also validated previous studies that reported the RAS/MAPK signaling as a key player in ERMS and enabled the discovery of novel genes that interact with the RAS/MAPK pathways and new ERMS specific genes. In our CS cohort alone, 3 out of the 14 patients have unfortunately succumbed to this disease thus demonstrating the need to identify new therapeutic agents that will help control ERMS cell proliferation and increase the survival rate in CS patients. In this study, high-throughput screening (HTS) was used as a tool to identify cytotoxic compounds in order to study tumor resistance and further determine its mechanism of action. From this study, <b>Zardaverine</b> was identified as a novel compound that specifically inhibited CS ERMS cell proliferation and cell invasion. This dissertation will focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of using a rare disorder such as CS as a syndromic model for ERMS, for further advancement of our current understanding of this type of solid tumors. In addition, this study revealed the importance of using HTS as a tool that may help to develop potential novel therapeutics for CS ERMS. University of Delaware, Department of Biological SciencesPh.
