These {{consisted}} of an assembly of depleted uranium discs clad in <b>zircalloy.</b> The production process involved machining the uranium discs, sealing their <b>zircalloy</b> containers by electron-beam welding, hot isostatic pressing to develop a diffusion bond between the <b>zircalloy</b> and the uranium and then ultrasonic testing to verify {{the integrity of the}} bond before final assembly.|$|E
50|$|In regular operation, most {{hydrogen}} is safely neutralized in the reactor systems; however, {{a fraction of}} 5-20% diffuses into the Zircaloy rods forming zirconium hydrides. This process mechanically weakens the rods because the hydrides have lower hardness and ductility than metal. Only a few percent of hydrogen can dissolve in zirconium. Excess hydrogen forms voids that weaken <b>Zircalloy.</b> Among Zircaloys, Zircaloy-4 is the least susceptible to hydrogen blistering.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the reactor}} {{protection}} {{system is designed}} {{to shut down the}} reactor, ECCS is designed to maintain adequate core cooling. The ECCS is a set of interrelated safety systems that are designed to protect the fuel within the reactor pressure vessel, which {{is referred to as the}} [...] "reactor core", from overheating. The five criteria for ECCS are to prevent peak fuel cladding temperature from exceeding 2200 °F, prevent more than 17% oxidation of the fuel cladding, prevent more than 1% of the maximum theoretical hydrogen generation due the <b>zircalloy</b> metal-water reaction, maintain a coolable geometry, and allow for long-term cooling.|$|E
50|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) of titanium and zirconium diborides {{is another}} method for preparing coatings of UHTCs. These techniques rely on metal halide and boron halide precursors (such as TiCl4 and BCl3) in the gaseous phase and use H2 as a reducing agent. This synthesis route {{can be employed}} at low temperatures and produces thin films for coating on metal (and other material) surfaces. Mojima et al. have used CVD to prepare coatings of ZrB2 on Cu at 700-900 °C (Figure 2). Plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) has also been used to prepare UHTC diborides. After plasma of the reacting gases is created (by radio frequency or direct current discharge between two electrodes) the reaction takes place, followed by deposition. The deposition takes place at lower temperatures compared to traditional CVD because only the plasma needs to be heated to provide sufficient energy for the reaction. ZrB2 has been prepared via PECVD at temperatures lower than 600 °C as a coating on <b>zircalloy.</b> Zirconium borohydride {{can also be used}} as a precursor in PECVD. Thermal decomposition of Zr(BH)4 to ZrB2 can occur at temperatures in the range of 150-400 °C in order to prepare amorphous, conductive films.|$|E
5000|$|The Fort St. Vrain HTGR was {{substantially}} {{more efficient than}} modern light water reactors, reaching a thermal efficiency of 39-40%, excellent for a steam-cycle power plant. Operation of the HTGR design could be readily attenuated to follow the electrical power demand load, rather than be required to generate its nameplate power all the time. The reactor was also comparatively fuel efficient, with a maximum burnup of 90,000 MW days thermal (compared to Light Water Reactors with burnups of 10,000 - 40,000 MW days thermal). The basis of this improved run time is that the core design [...] "fertilizes" [...] the thorium pellets within the fuel with neutrons, and then burns the bred fissiles through normal neutronic processes without requiring removal from the core. Like all HTGRs, the Fort St. Vrain precluded the possibility of major core damage or radioactive releases in such a quantity that could seriously threaten public safety, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission allowed operation with much smaller safety zones compared to LWR designs. It was also notable that plant personnel received negligible exposure to ionizing flux {{during the course of}} operations. Further, the PCRV reflected an innovative RPV that had the potential to be substantially less costly than the metallic RPVs then in service, which were made of expensive nickel-manganese superalloys (e.g. Inconel, Hastelloy, and Monel) in the case of PWRs or surgical grade stainless steel 316L in the case of BWRs. The fuel, by omitting <b>Zircalloy</b> sheathing (allowed due to the inert, non-aqueous core) was made far less expensive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One {{very often}} observes that the texture {{inheritance}} in BCC to HCP phase transformation shows variant selections, {{even though no}} external stress field is applied. These variant selections {{are related to the}} metallurgical state, the microstructure and the texture of the parent phase. From our own investigations, we {{came to the conclusion that}} the variant selections we observed in some phase transformations of various materials were influenced at different degrees by the elastic behaviour of the parent phase. Considering the transformation strain of each variant and the elastic anisotropy of the parent, we have build variant selection models based on energy minimum of elastic strain and assuming different types of interactions. The simulation results of texture transformation of a <b>zircalloy</b> sample show that the elastic characteristics of the parent phases are key parameters involved in the variant selection...|$|E

First, {{to build on the}} {{successful}} initial experiments on proton irradiation of pressure vessel steel to expand the irradiations to study dose rate and temperature effects, radiation effects on commercial alloys and to better characterize the precipitates. Second, we will begin irradiation and characterization of the Zircaloy alloys. Finally, we will continue low temperature irradiations and begin irradiation of chromium pre-enriched samples and cold-worked samples to assess the role of microstructure in IASCC of austenitic stainless steels. In quarter 1 of year 2, the project goal was to complete irradiation of model alloys of RPV steels for a range of doses and an initial sample characterization. We also planned to begin characterization of <b>Zircalloy</b> alloy samples and to make a set of cold-worked samples of 304 SS that would have a fixed hardness following subsequent irradiation to different doses...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, two size-effect laws for the {{friction}} coefficient of rough surfaces are proposed and compared. The former {{is based on}} purely dimensional analysis arguments and {{is related to the}} fractality of the contact domains. This scaling law applies from the macro to the planetary scales, where contact is almost elastic. The latter, holding at the micro and nanoscales, is based on the adhesion theory of friction and assumes that the friction resistance is governed by the strong adhesive bonds at the asperities, caused by elasto-plastic deformations. Whereas the fractal scaling law suggests a friction coefficient decreasing with the size of the nominal contact area, the opposite trend is predicted by the adhesion theory. The application of these two scaling laws to <b>Zircalloy</b> (Zr- 4), Stainless Steel (SS 304) and Nickel (Ni 200) permits to determine the scale range of validity of each scaling law and to show that they may coexist. Finally, it is found that the length scale which marks the transition between the two regimes {{is a function of the}} plasticity index proposed by Mikic...|$|E
40|$|Dissolution of spent fuels in the THORP {{reprocessing}} plant results in large batches of spent fuel cladding {{which must be}} comprehensively monitored prior to its export from the plant. The Hulls Monitor has operated successfully since THORP went on stream in 1994, providing vital data for process control, criticality safety, nuclear material accountancy/safeguards, and inventory determination prior to ultimate disposal. The system utilizes a combination of three measurement techniques: active neutron Differential Die-Away, passive neutron counting and high resolution gamma spectrometry. The Differential Die-Away measurement on fuel residues in an industrial environment demands a commercially available, robust, pulsed high output neutron source. The original D-T generator delivered a detection limit of 2 g 235 U equivalent in 600 kg of <b>zircalloy</b> cladding. However current operational issues and future trends in the fuel to be reprocessed have provided the stimulus to develop alternatives. This paper describes the incorporation of a compact AccSys DL- 1 linear accelerator neutron source in the Hulls Monitor and its successful commissioning and operation in THORP. The next generation of Hulls Monitor systems under development is also described. This will address the measurement challenges posed by the reprocessing of mixed plutonium / uranium-oxide fuels and very high burnup uranium oxide fuels...|$|E
40|$|The {{last step}} {{of nuclear power}} plants’ life is the {{decommissioning}} phase. Many strategies have been developed in the last decades; the main options consists in: immediate dismantling, safe storage and entombment. In Italy, due to the premature shutdown of nuclear power plants (NPP) {{as a consequence of}} the 1986 referendum following the Chernobyl accident, all the NPPs were shut down. Therefore, currently decommissioning activities are under way. In this work specifically the dismantling procedures of the “Enrico Fermi” NPP reactor pressure vessel (RPV) are dealt with. The attention is so focused on the optimization of number, position and length of the Internals cuts, optimization of volume and number of waste containers, and of the dose rates, according to the imposed site and the transport requirements. The systematic approach developed to identify the optimum dismantling solution is presented and discussed. To the intent three solutions have been identified as more advantageous. In addition, the evaluation of dose rate outside the container has been performed by means of VISIPLAN software, in order to guarantee the respect of the limits imposed by National and International regulations. The obtained results suggest that the cutting of <b>Zircalloy</b> elements in correspondence of the gap between two non-consecutive central stumps, with the possibility to re-arrange the element, led to a significant reduction of the number of containers, with consequent decrease of the stowed RWs volume and overall supplying costs of the activity...|$|E
40|$|CIVINSShadow {{corrosion}} of {{zirconium alloy}} fuel cladding in BWR environments, the phenomenon in which accelerated corrosion is experienced when the cladding surface is {{in close proximity}} to other metals, has become a potential life-limiting issue for BWR fuel. Recent results from experimentation at MIT, Halden and Studvik suggest that a galvanic coupling drives the phenomenon between the cladding and the adjacent material. However, the actual processes involved are not understood. One key parameter that would help in the understanding of the phenonenon would be a measurement of the actual corrosion current between fuel cladding and adjacent materials in the actual in-reactor environment. The limitations placed on the burn-up of uranium oxide fuel corelates to the amount of corrosion seen through a directly measurable oxide thickness on the waterside of the zirconium alloy cladding. This oxide corrosion product directly correlates to distance from structure components, leading the effect commonly referred to as shadow corrosion. In recent experiments, Studvik determined that there are large ECP differences associated with Inconel and zirconium alloys that correlate to increased galvanic current density when the materials are coupled. In this thesis research, four electrode pairs wre used to measure galvanic cirrent densities in the irradiation environment:Pt-Pt, <b>Zircalloy</b> (Zr- 2), Inconel (X- 750) -Pt, and Zr- 2 -X- 750. To determine the changes in the coolant water conductivity dus to the presence of radiolysis products, electrochemical potential mesurements of Pt-Pt coupled electrodes were analyzed. Finally, attempts to characterize the observed oxide behavior using measurement from Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), also known as Alternating Current Impedance, were conducted. Through the measurements taken, analysis of the mechanisms potentially causing the shadow corrosion phenomenon was conducted. The results of the observations included: Measurement of increased conductivity of coolant water correlating to increases in reactor power, measurement of increased galvanic current measurements correlating to increases in reactor power.

40|$|The boiling {{of water}} {{droplets}} on hot metal surfaces is studied experimentally and mathematically {{in order to}} establish the conditions necessary for droplets to enter a film boiling mode. The subsurface temperature history within a plate undergoing droplet boiling on the surface is measured. A numerical model of the heat transfer in the plate is then used to deduce from these data the following characteristics of droplet boiling: (1) the effective heat transfer coefficient between water droplet and plate during the initial transient forming the spherical droplet, (2) the apparent time period needed to establish the droplet in the film boiling mode, and (3) the minimum plate surface temperature reached during the initial formation of the boiling droplet. The effective heat transfer coefficient, formation time, and minimum surface temperature are sufficient to develop a calculation method which predicts the minimum initial plate temperature necessary for a water droplet to enter film boiling. This numerical conduction model accounts for the influence of plate material, plate thickness, oxidation of the plate surface, the boundary condition on the plate lower surface, {{and the size of the}} droplet. The prediction method is successfully used to estimate the minimum film boiling temperature for brass, graphite, Pyrex, copper, aluminum, stainless steel, and <b>Zircalloy</b> II. The findings of the experiments and numerical studies are applied to the rewetting phase of a loss-of-coolant-accident in a light water reactor. This application, in turn, provides explanations for some of the phenomena observed in studies of the prequench heat transfer within rod bundles including the effect of multiple droplet impacts, and suggests possible reasons for some of the difficulties experienced in attempts to establish the effective rewetting temperature on reactor fuel rod surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of this project, {{we have a number of}} accomplishments. The {{following}} list is presented as a summary statement for the project. Specific details from previous Quarterly Reports are given. (1) We established that it is possible to use EXAFS to study the interface layer between a material and the liquid Pb overlayer. We have discovered that molybdenum grows a selflimiting oxide layer which does not spall even at the highest temperatures studied. There have been 2 publications resulting from these studies. (2) We have fabricated a high temperature environmental chamber capable of extending the Pb overlayer studies by varying the incident x-ray beam angle to perform depth profiling of the Pb layer. This chamber will continue to be available to nuclear materials program researchers who wish to use the MRCAT beam line. (3) We have developed a collaboration with researchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute to study corrosion layers on <b>zircalloy.</b> One publication has resulted from this collaboration and another is in progress. (4) We have developed a collaboration with Prof. G. R. Odette of UCSB in which we studied the local structure of Ti and Y in nanoclusters found in oxygen dispersion strengthened steels. There are two publications in progress form this collaboration and we have extended the project to anomalous small angle x-ray scattering as well as EXAFS. (5) We have promoted the use of EXAFS for the study of nuclear materials to the community over the past 4 years and we have begun to see an increase in demand for EXAFS from the community at the MRCAT beam line. (6) This grant was instrumental in nucleating interest in establishing a new Collaborative Access Team at the Advanced Photon Source, the Nuclear and Radiological Research CAT (NRR-CAT). The co-PI (Jeff Terry) is the lead investigator on this project and it has been approved by the APS Scientific Advisory Committee for further planning. The status of the NRR-CAT project is being discussed in a series of workshops in 2009 - 2010 and has received exploratory funding from INL. This funding is being used to provide beam time and support at MRCAT for NRR-CAT related experiments. This will continue through 2010 as the development of a full NRR-CAT proposal develops. We believe that this has been a very successful project whose impact will continue to be felt for a number of years. Not only will there be additional publications coming from the work supported directly by this grant but the establishment of NRR-CAT will have a significant impact on the field of nuclear materials research for decades to come...|$|E
