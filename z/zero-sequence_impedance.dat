3000|$|Although Approach 1 can {{successfully}} validate the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of three-terminal transmission lines, {{voltage and current}} waveforms from all the three terminals {{may not always be}} available. For this reason, this subsection develops a methodology that can use data from only two terminals to estimate the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of three-terminal lines. To illustrate the approach, consider the scenario shown in Fig.  1. Suppose that the measurements captured by digital relays at terminals G and H are available while measurements from terminal T are missing. The procedure to estimate the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of Line 1 and Line 2 in such a scenario is described below: [...]...|$|E
30|$|The {{steps to}} {{validate}} the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of Line 1 and Line 2 are outlined below.|$|E
30|$|Single line-to-ground or double line-to-ground fault {{events can}} be used to {{validate}} the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of the transmission line as shown in Case study 1.|$|E
3000|$|Assumptions made by Approach 1 when {{estimating}} the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedances</b> of Line 1 and Line 2 are summarized below: [...]...|$|R
30|$|The <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> of Line 2 is {{estimated}} from terminal H measurements using any <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> estimation algorithm for two-terminal line which uses measurements from one terminal only [5, 11]. The algorithm {{to estimate the}} <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> of a two-terminal line using data from only one terminal assumes that the fault resistance is zero and the fault location is known.|$|R
30|$|From Table  6, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the estimated <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> matched well with that computed using Carson’s equations at an earth resistivity value of 100 Ωm. This helps in verifying the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> setting of the relay as they {{play an important role in}} distance and directional protection.|$|R
30|$|Transmission line {{parameter}} estimation using different methods {{and a variety}} of data has been a topic of interest for researchers [4, 5]. The <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of an overhead line must be specified by protection engineers in relay settings and {{plays a key role in}} distance and directional protection [6, 7], and fault location calculations. The <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of a line depends on earth resistivity. A commonly used practice to determine the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> is by using Carson’s equation and using a typical value of 100 Ω-m as earth resistivity [6, 8]. As the earth resistivity depends on various factors such as soil type, temperature and moisture content in the soil [9] and is difficult to measure accurately, the zero-sequence line impedance is subject to much uncertainty. As a result, to avoid relay mis-operations and incorrect fault location, efforts must be made to validate the zero-sequence line impedance using fault event data.|$|E
30|$|In [5], the {{transmission}} line, whose zero-sequence estimation was performed, was a two-terminal line whereas three-terminal transmission lines are analyzed in this paper. In a three-terminal transmission line, there is short-circuit current contribution {{from all three}} terminals unlike two-terminal transmission line where there is current contribution from only two terminals. Hence, the circuit explored, system equations and method of analysis are different compared to the algorithms presented in [5]. The data availability for a three-terminal line is also {{different from that of}} a two-terminal line. Moreover, {{there is a need to}} synchronize measurements from different terminals of the line based on data availability before estimating the zero-sequence line impedance. Furthermore, careful system analysis is required to calculate the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of both Line 1 and Line 2 as seen in the two approaches discussed above unlike having to estimate the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of only one line as in [5]. In addition to estimating the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of the lines, this paper also presents a method for estimating the Thevenin impedance of {{the transmission}} network upstream from the monition location using the same set of waveform data.|$|E
30|$|In this way, Approach 1 is {{successful}} in validating the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of Line 1 and Line 2. If the actual fault location is not available, then an additional step (Step 0) must be performed {{to track down}} the exact fault location before applying the steps described above.|$|E
3000|$|Assumptions made by Approach 2 when {{estimating}} the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> are summarized below: [...]...|$|R

The positive- and zero-sequence source impedances[*]at terminal H are ZH 1 = 12 ∠ 80 ° Ω and ZH 0 = 36 ∠ 80 ° Ω,[*]respectively.[*]The positive- and <b>zero-sequence</b> source <b>impedances</b> at terminal T are ZT 1 = 5 ∠ 83 ° Ω and ZT 0 = 12 ∠ 83 ° Ω, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Three-terminal lines do pose a {{significant}} {{challenge to the}} task of validating the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance.</b> The third terminal contributes to the total fault current and changes the impedance equations which are commonly used for two-terminal lines. Furthermore, with the introduction of a third terminal, there are now two lines whose <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedances</b> have to be validated from a single fault event. Based on this aforementioned background, this section presents two approaches for calculating the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> of three-terminal lines. The proposed algorithm uses fault current and voltage phasors from the line terminals for its analysis. The proposed technique should therefore be applied on the steady state portion of fault waveforms to obtain accurate results. Hence, it is suitable for application in ground fault scenarios which contain steady state fault waveforms. Approach 1 requires the availability of voltage and current waveforms from all the three terminals while Approach 2 uses waveforms captured at two terminals only.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{aforementioned}} background, {{the primary objective}} {{of this paper is}} to estimate the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of three-terminal line from waveform data captured by intelligent electronic devices during a ground fault. The contribution lies in developing algorithms which either use unsynchronized data from all the three terminals or use unsynchronized data from only two terminals. The second objective {{of this paper is to}} estimate the Thevenin impedance of the transmission network upstream from the monitoring location using the same set of fault waveform data. The authors had developed algorithms for estimating zero-sequence line impedance for two-terminal lines [5] but this paper explores algorithms for estimating <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of three-terminal lines which has barely been studied previously. This paper serves as a further extension and as a sequel to {{the aforementioned}} paper.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to bring to light more facts {{regarding}} the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> in single-phase induction motors. It had been observed in the laboratory that while a three- phase induction motor (wye-connected and neutral available) is running at certain speed, if we change the connections such that power is applied between one line terminal and the neutral as shown in Fig. 1, the motor continues to run at one-third the previous speed. This is the customary method of measuring the zero-sequence quantities and forms {{the basis of this}} project. In the following pages {{it has been shown that}} the zero- sequence impedance definitely exists in the stator circuit, as well as in the rotor circuit of a single phase induction motor. « The value of the. winding pitch is found to affect to certain extent the actual value of the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance.</b> Z 2 R 0 - 8 BQBBNCE IMPEDABGB IB SlMGLE-PHASE IBDUCTIOB'MOTOR b...|$|E
30|$|Several {{authors in}} the past have {{researched}} on validating zero-sequence line impedance but only for two-terminal lines [6, 11]. Very little work, if any, has been conducted on validating the zero-sequence line impedance of three-terminal transmission lines. The event reports from IEDs at different ends of the line may detect the fault at slightly different time instants and have different sampling rates. Furthermore, they can be unsynchronized. Therefore, it is necessary to devise a methodology that can use unsynchronized measurements to confirm the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of three-terminal transmission lines.|$|E

The influence of the trans- former tank walls as a distributed-parameter hysteretic element is reproduced by solving a diffusion equation that describes the penetration of the plane electromagnetic wave into the depth of the wall. The reliability of the model is validated by comparing its <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedances</b> to those measured on a 25 -MVA transformer, in the presence and absence of a tertiary stabilizing winding.

30|$|This section {{demonstrates}} {{the efficacy of}} Approach 1 and Approach 2 in estimating the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> of a three-terminal line during a single line-to-ground fault. The system parameters used for the study are described below.|$|R
30|$|Though {{the process}} of {{estimating}} the fault resistance can be automated, it is not commonly implemented in a digital relay. It requires {{the attention of a}} protection engineer (PE) to estimate the fault resistance and interpret it. Similarly, {{the process of}} estimating the Thevenin <b>impedance,</b> <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> and other short-circuit model parameters requires a PE to be able to study the system, validate the calculated values and make use of them. Likewise, detecting incorrect installation of power system equipment also requires the skills of a PE.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{methods for}} both estimating the zero-sequence line impedance {{as well as}} estimating Thevenin impedance from fault waveforms are validated using a test case. The approach which estimates zero-sequence line impedance using data from three terminals requires lesser assumptions than the method which uses data from only two terminals. Both the methods produced accurate <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> estimates and the magnitude error percentage was less than 1 %. Similarly, results indicate the success of Thevenin impedance estimation algorithm as the magnitude error was less than 1 % in the test case.|$|E

Owing to availability of transformers with earthed neutrals at each substation of a 110 - 400 kV network which are the source of a zero-sequence current, the possibility exists of wide use of zero-sequence cutoffs and stepped zero-sequence protections practically on all lines of medium and large length.

30|$|Several {{authors in}} the past have {{attempted}} to glean additional information from fault records [6 – 10]. Using event reports, authors in [11, 12] have estimated the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> of a two-terminal line. Similarly, the authors of [8] have calculated the Thevenin impedance of the system upstream from the measured location using event reports. The authors of [13] have further explored in detail about deriving <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> using data from both the terminals of a two-terminal line as well as using data from only one end of the line. These highlight the presence of plethora of information in an event report and the need for comprehensive analysis of event reports.|$|R
30|$|The {{assumptions}} that the transmission network is homogeneous {{and the absence}} of zero-sequence mutual coupling are same as that of Approach 1. Since Approach 2 has lesser data availability than Approach 1, further assumptions must be made to obtain the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> of the lines.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods to}} estimate the zero-sequence line impedance of all the sections in a three-terminal transmission line using fault data from all three terminals as well as using data from only two terminals. When data from only two terminals are available, the algorithm requires source impedance data from the third terminal, assumes that the fault location is known and the fault resistance is zero. These assumptions are not required when data from all three terminals are available. The accuracy of the proposed methods are demonstrated using a test case. Both approaches produced accurate zero-sequence line impedance estimates when the assumptions were satisfied and the magnitude error percentage was less than 1 %. Additionally, the paper also presented a technique for estimating Thevenin equivalent impedance of the transmission network upstream from the monitoring location. The efficacy of this method was demonstrated using a test case. The magnitude error percentage in estimating the Thevenin impedance was less than 1 % in the test case. Hence, {{it can be concluded}} that the presented methods provide a reliable estimation of the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of the line and Thevenin impedance of the upstream network which can be used to verify relay settings.|$|E
30|$|Current and voltage {{waveforms}} {{recorded by}} {{intelligent electronic devices}} (IEDs) are more useful than just performing post-fault analysis. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present techniques to estimate the zero-sequence line impedance of all sections of a three-terminal line and the Thevenin equivalent impedance of the transmission network upstream from the monitoring location using protective relay data collected during short-circuit ground fault events. Protective relaying data from all three terminals may not be always available. Furthermore, the data from each terminal may be unsynchronized and collected at different sampling rates with dissimilar fault time instants. Hence, this paper presents approaches which use unsynchronized measurement data from all the terminals as well as data from only two terminals to estimate the zero-sequence line impedance of all the sections of a three-terminal line. An algorithm to calculate positive-, negative- and zero-sequence Thevenin impedance of the upstream transmission network has also been presented in this paper. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated using a test case. The magnitude error percentage in determining the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> was less than 1 % in the test case presented.|$|E
30|$|For {{the test}} scenarios, the {{fundamental}} frequency magnitude and phase angle of the fault current and voltages were extracted using Fast Fourier Transform. To avoid inaccuracies due to transients and DC offset, a cycle with stable fault current is used. For this purpose, the third cycle after fault inception was chosen in the simulation results to estimate the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance.</b> Fast Fourier Transform is a commonly used method to extract fundamental frequency components and filter out decaying DC offset [8, 19]. If the DC offset remains significant after the third cycle, more advanced filters [20, 21] can be used or appropriate fault cycle can be chosen to obtain accurate current and voltage measurements from fault records. This ensures that the error in determining the current and voltage phasors is minimized and hence the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> estimation will not be affected by it.|$|R
30|$|Although Approach 2 uses {{data from}} only two {{terminals}} {{to estimate the}} <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> of all the sections of the three-terminal line, it requires the knowledge of source impedance parameters of the third terminal. For this purpose, the next section provides approaches to calculate the source impedance or the Thevenin impedance of the transmission network upstream from the monitoring location.|$|R
30|$|In utility/industry practice, {{the process}} of {{estimating}} the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> is an offline post fault analysis process using event reports recorded by the relay. The electric power utility performs a thorough investigation of the fault event {{as soon as the}} fault has occurred. As a result, it is expected that the utility identifies the fault location and hence, it is a reasonable assumption that the fault location is known while implementing the proposed algorithm.|$|R
40|$|The {{equation}} for the <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of a three-phase {{transmission line}} with ground return and the equation for the electric intensity {{in the earth}} were derived following the method of Carson. The equation for the impedance was identical with the equations of Carson, however, the electric intensity equation derived included more terms than the equation of Carson. The additional terms were due to the two additional conductors in the three-phase line;A solution of the equation for the electric intensity {{could not be found}} and numerical solutions for three particular transmission line configurations were made. The results of these calculations are shown in Figures 2 [...] 12 inclusive;Numerical integrations were made of the power losses and the flux linkages established by the current flow in the earth. From these quantities the impedance was calculated for one of the line configurations. Comparison of this impedance with values obtained from Clark and Westinghouse are as follows: NumericalIntegration ClarkeWestinghouse 0. 272 +j 2. 000. 272 +j 2. 04 0. 272 +j 2. 04.

40|$|The dq {{transformation}} {{is widely used}} in the analysis and control of three-phase symmetrical and balanced systems. The {{transformation is}} the real counterpart of the complex transformations derived from the symmetrical component theory. The widespread distributed generation and dynamically connected unbalanced loads in a three-phase system inherently create unbalanced voltages {{to the point of}} common coupling. The unbalanced voltages will always be transformed as coupled positive-sequence and negative-sequence components with double-frequency ripples that can be removed by some filtering algorithms in the dq frame. However, a technique for modeling unbalanced three-phase impedance between voltages and currents of same sequences or of opposite sequences is still missing. We propose an effective method for modeling unbalanced three-phase impedance using a decoupled <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> and two interacting positive-sequence and negative-sequence balanced impedances in the dq frame. The proposed method can decompose a system with unbalanced resistance, inductance, or capacitance into a combination of independent reciprocal bases (IRB). Each IRB basis belongs to one of the positive-sequence, negative-sequence, or zero-sequence system components to facilitate further analysis. The effectiveness of this approach is verified with a case study of an unbalanced load and another case study of an unbalanced voltage compensator in a microgrid application.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} Distributed Generation (DG) {{in the distribution}} grid that is nowadays taking place challenges the Network Operators to maintain the reliability indexes achieved in prior years. The contribution of the DG-units to the short-circuit currents can cause the mal-operation of devices that are not designed to operate under bi-directional current flows. However, in the isolated-neutral grounding system, in use {{in countries such as}} Spain, Finland, China or Japan, the bi-directional fault currents do not affect the performance of fault detection devices in case of phase-to-ground faults, the most common fault type. This is due to the high values of the capacitive, <b>zero-sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> with respect to the other sequence impedances. For this fault type, this earthing system is known as highly reliable because (i) the line-voltages remain unchanged during the fault and (ii) the fault currents are low (difficult to detect), with a high probability of becoming self-extinguishing faults. Because of this, the fault location is mostly based on a trial-and-error switching sequence, until the fault is isolated. This procedure is very time-consuming if performed with manually-operated switches and sectionalizers. Towards reducing the outage time, grid investment is required. One of the options is installing directional Fault Passage Indicators (FPI). This device is already 70 years old, and the technology has already proven to be a cost-effective solution to improve reliability in other grounding systems. Because of the particular features of the isolated-neutral system, directionality is required in any case, with or without DG. Implementing directionality in the conventional way requires installing voltage sensors and the devices are still susceptible to non-detection of high fault impedance faults. The main contributions of the thesis are three different methods to detect the direction in phase-to-ground faults in isolated-neutral grids. The first two methods are voltage sensor-less, whereas the third method is designed for small current fault detection, using zero-sequence voltage and current measurements. status: publishe...|$|E

In addition, the event report was used to validate the <b>zero-sequence</b> line <b>impedance</b> setting in the relay. Furthermore, the fault record was used to estimate the fault resistance and Thevenin impedance which helped to gain further knowledge about the fault as well as assist in short circuit model verification. Calculating the fault location and simulating fault scenarios similar to those in the event reports verified that there were no errors in settings of the instrument transformers, the input contacts were working fine and the circuit model is representative of the actual transmission network. The reason why several methods have been presented to verify various relay settings and relay operation is because it may not be possible to implement all of the above verification steps in every fault scenario.|$|R
