2500|$|So {{knowing the}} {{propagation}} direction (+z in this case) and η, one can {{just as well}} specify the wave in terms of just ex and ey describing the electric field. The vector containing ex and ey (but without the <b>z</b> <b>component</b> which is necessarily zero for a transverse wave) {{is known as a}} Jones vector. In addition to specifying the polarization state of the wave, a general Jones vector also specifies the overall magnitude and phase of that wave. Specifically, the intensity of the light wave is proportional to the sum of the squared magnitudes of the two electric field components: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jahn–Teller {{effect is}} most often {{encountered}} in octahedral complexes of the transition metals. [...] The phenomenon is very common in six-coordinate copper(II) complexes. The d9 electronic configuration of this ion gives three electrons in the two degenerate eg orbitals, leading to a doubly degenerate electronic ground state. Such complexes distort along one of the molecular fourfold axes (always labelled the z axis), which {{has the effect of}} removing the orbital and electronic degeneracies and lowering the overall energy. The distortion normally takes the form of elongating the bonds to the ligands lying along the z axis, but occasionally occurs as a shortening of these bonds instead (the Jahn–Teller theorem does not predict the direction of the distortion, only the presence of an unstable geometry). When such an elongation occurs, the effect is to lower the electrostatic repulsion between the electron-pair on the Lewis basic ligand and any electrons in orbitals with a <b>z</b> <b>component,</b> thus lowering the energy of the complex. Inversion centre is preserved after the distortion.|$|E

This model postulates a large-scale flow having phi and <b>z</b> <b>components</b> with radial dependences (helical flow). Shear in the radial field, because of a near-flux-freezing condition, causes amplification of the phi component of the magnetic field. The radial and axial components grow due to the presence of turbulent diffusion.
