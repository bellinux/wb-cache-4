40|$|Background: <b>Zollinger–Ellison</b> (ZE) <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by gastric acid hypersecretion and ulcer disease from autologous gastrin secretion by a gastrinoma. Patient and methods: A 43 year old man underwent upper endoscopy for a 6 week history of recurrent nausea, vomiting, heartburn, weight loss, and watery diarrhea. Results: Endoscopic findings included severe reflux esophagitis with multiple linear esophageal ulcerations, thickened gastric folds with mosaic pattern mucosa, distinctive gastric corpus and antrum junction, numerous antral erosions with traces of coffee ground substance, bulbar erosions and ulcerations, and post-bulbar erosions and ulcerations. Based on these symptoms and endoscopic findings, a gastrinoma work-up was instituted and the diagnosis was confirmed. Conclusions: Endoscopists {{need to be aware}} of the classical symptoms and clinical findings associated with ZE syndrome in order to appropriately diagnose and manage affected patients...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} provocation tests in the diagnosis of the <b>Zollinger-Ellison</b> (ZE) <b>syndrome</b> stimulation tests with calcium, 15 mg/kg. 3 h, and secretin GIH, 1 U/kg. 30 s, were performed in 15 patients with histologically proven or suspected ZE syndrome. Nine of these 15 patients were without previous gastric surgery and in them meal stimulated serum gastrin levels were measured as well. These tests were also performed in normal subjects and in patients with duodenal ulcer, antrectomy, total gastrectomy, and achlorhydria. All tests {{were considered to be}} positive if a more than 50 % increase in serum gastrin was found. The results indicate that secretin stimulation is the provocation test of first choice in the diagnosis of this syndrome. This test is most valuable for the following reasons: (1) there were few (two out of 15) false-negative test results in ZE patients; (2) there were no false-positive tests in 69 patients without gastrinoma; (3) it was easy and quick to perform; and (4) there were no adverse reactions. The two ZE patients with negative secretin stimulation tests had negative calcium provocation tests as well, in spite of histologically proven gastrinoma. In 11 patients with suspected or proven ZE syndrome and basal serum gastrin levels of less than 1000 pg/ml a rather good correlation (r = 0 - 841; P less than 0 - 01) was found between the percental increase in serum gastrin after stimulation by calcium and secretin. Meal stimulated serum gastrin levels are helpful only in patients without previous gastric surgery...|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} the clinicopathologic {{profile of a}} series of recently diagnosed sporadic duodenal gastrin-cell (G-cell) tumors. All cases were discovered incidentally and had a unique clinicopathologic profile: all 18 cases were gastrin-positive tumors located in the duodenal bulb, were small in size (mean size 5. 4 mm), demonstrated an insular architectural pattern, and were localized to the lamina propria and submucosa. None of the patients had <b>Zollinger-Ellison</b> or carcinoid <b>syndrome.</b> The behavior was indolent and {{there was no evidence of}} metastasis at diagnosis or during follow-up. In our sampled population, the presence of Helicobacter pylori gastritis and the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were significantly associated with the presence of G-cell tumors. Both the presence of H. pylori gastritis and use of PPI remained significant in a logistic regression model adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sex with P values of 0. 0016 (odds ratio= 3 D 10. 1, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 3 to 42. 4) and 0. 008 (odds ratio= 3 D 8. 9, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 76 to 45. 4), respectively. Most patients with tumors showed G-cell hyperplasia in the nontumorous regions of the duodenum. The high incidence of sporadic duodenal G-cell tumors in patients with H. pylori gastritis and long-term PPI use suggests an association that needs to be further explored. Presence of G-cell hyperplasia in the nontumorous duodenal mucosa suggests that these may originate from a proliferative phase, similar to the hyperplasia-dysplasia-neoplasia sequence seen in other endocrine tumors...|$|R

500|$|Regarding the {{recognition}} of PanNETs, the possibility of cancer of the islet cells was initially suggested in 1888. The first case of hyperinsulinism due to a tumor of this type was reported in 1927. Recognition of a non-insulin-secreting type of PanNET is generally ascribed to the American surgeons, [...] R.M. Zollinger and E.H. Ellison, who gave their names to <b>Zollinger–Ellison</b> <b>syndrome,</b> after postulating {{the existence of a}} gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumor in a report of two cases of unusually severe peptic ulcers published in 1955. In 2010, the WHO recommended that PanNETs be referred to as [...] "neuroendocrine" [...] rather than [...] "endocrine" [...] tumors.|$|E
