50|$|Section and Chapter titles {{describe}} {{broad categories}} of goods, while headings and subheadings describe products in more detail. Generally, HS sections and chapters {{are arranged in}} order of a productâ€™s degree of manufacture or {{in terms of its}} technological complexity. Natural commodities, such as live animals and vegetables, for example, are described the early sections of the HS, whereas more evolved goods such as machinery and precision instruments are described in later sections. Chapters within the individual sections are also usually organized in order of complexity or degree of manufacture. For example, within Section X (Pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material; Recovered (waste and scrap) paper or paperboard; Paper <b>and</b> paperboard <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> <b>thereof),</b> Chapter 47 provides for pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic materials, whereas Chapter 49 covers printed books, newspapers, and other printed matter. Finally, the headings within individual Chapters follow a similar order. For example, the first heading in Chapter 50 (Silk) provides for silk worm cocoons while articles made of silk are covered by the chapter's later headings.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{comparative}} advantage of Indonesian commodities in order to enter the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). This study uses the export data during the period of 2003 - 2013 among five ASEAN countries participating in the AEC, including Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. All data obtained from the UN Comtrade database following the Harmonized System (HS) at the two-digit classification level. This study applies dynamic revealed comparative advantage (DRCA) index developed by Edwards and Schoer (2001) which is the development of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index by Balassa (1965). The results show that Indonesia is ready to enter the AEC. From this research, there are several Indonesian main commodities which have comparative advantage in ASEAN, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ones (HS- 03), edible fruit, nuts, peel of citrus fruit, melons (HS- 08), oil seed, oleagic fruits, grain, seed, fruit, etc, nes (HS- 12), lac, gums, resins, vegetable saps and extracts nes (HS- 13), rubber <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> <b>thereof</b> (HS- 40), paper & paperboard, articles of pulp, paper and board (HS- 48), special woven or tufted fabric, lace, tapestry etc (HS- 58), articles apparel, accessories, not knit or crochet (HS- 62), and vehicles other than railway, tramway (HS- 87). Those commodities are in line with Indonesian government export's strategy direction which mainly focuses on several sectors, including fishery, vegetable products, rubber, wood and wood products, textiles, and transportation. Therefore, Indonesian government should focus to improve those commodities in AEC.

Especially toxic is lead, increased content of which {{in the body of}} a pregnant determines the development of pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum period complications and is potentiated by deficiency of essential trace elements - <b>zinc</b> <b>and</b> copper. <b>Article</b> presents the results of impact of solutions of lead acetate and citrate in experimental models. Solutions of metals were injected into the stomach through a tube once a day during 19 days of pregnancy in the dose of 0, 05 mg/kg in the form of inorganic compound - lead acetate and in organic form â€“ lead citrate. The content of trace elements - lead, cadmium, copper <b>and</b> <b>zinc</b> were determined by stripping voltamperometry. In addition, indices of placental and fetal accumulation, as well as index of transplacental migration were calculated. Effect of lead during pregnancy in all biosubstrates is increased by 1, 3 - 1, 9 times as compared with the control group. This causes imbalance of essential trace elements due to significant reduction in zinc content in all the studied biological substrates. Prolonged contact with lead during pregnancy leads to disruption of placenta, inability of the placenta to fully protect the fetus from excessive intranatal influence of xenobiotics...|$|R

40|$|Illegal Logging {{is one of}} {{the major}} global causes for {{deforestation}} and the degradation of forests. The further manufacturing of illegally logged wood and products made thereof as well as the associated trade has also negative social and economic effects on both sides of the wood markets, the producer and consumer countries. One of the key measures of the European Union (EU) to combat illegal logging is the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR). The EUTR came into effect on March 1, 2013 and it prohibits the placing of wood and wood products made of illegally logged wood on the EU internal market. This placement can either be done by selling removals from European forests or by importing wood and wood-based products into the EU. But for what kind of products does the regulation apply exactly? The EUTR refers to its An-nex where a list is provided with respective commodities. The products are structured ac-cording to the trade classification of the Combined Nomenclature (CN). The main focus is laid on wood <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> of wood (chapter 44 of the CN), on pulp of wood (chapter 47) and on paper <b>and</b> paperboard <b>and</b> <b>articles</b> made <b>thereof</b> (chapter 48). Additionally commodity codes for furniture and one code for prefabricated buildings are listed. However, as certain wood-based products are not included in the EUTR, the question arises, how many wood-based products are not covered by the EUTR. What is the coverage ratio of the EUTR if we are looking at all wood-based products? [ [...] . ...|$|R
