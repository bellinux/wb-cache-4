40|$|This work {{presents}} zinc determination {{in certain}} medicines that contain zinc oxide and <b>zinc</b> <b>undecylenate.</b> The technique {{consists of a}} spectrophotometric micro-scale titration, where EDTA is used as titrant, and xylenol orange as an indicator, in a medium adjusted to pH = 6 with acetic acid and sodium acetate. After each added portion of EDTA, the absorbance value is measured at a selected wavelength, in order to detect the end-point of the spectrophotometric titration. The results already obtained are satisfactory and promote student's interest. An additional contribution intends to propose the use of micro-scale techniques...|$|E
