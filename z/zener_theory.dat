40|$|A new result enables direct {{calculation}} of thermoelastic damping in vibrating elastic solids. The mechanism for energy loss is thermal diffusion caused by inhomogeneous deformation, flexure in thin plates. The general result {{is combined with}} the Kirchhoff assumption to obtain a new equation for the flexural vibration of thin plates incorporating thermoelastic loss as a damping term. The thermal relaxation loss is inhomogeneous and depends upon the local state of vibrating flexure, specifically, the principal curvatures at a given point on the plate. Thermal loss is zero at points where the principal curvatures are equal and opposite, that is, saddle shaped or pure anticlastic deformation. Conversely, loss is maximum at points where the curvatures are equal, that is, synclastic or spherical flexure. The influence of modal curvature on the thermoelastic damping is described through a modal participation factor. The effect of transverse thermal diffusion on plane wave propagation is also examined. It is shown that transverse diffusion effects are always small provided the plate thickness is far greater than the thermal phonon mean free path, a requirement for {{the validity of the}} classical theory of heat transport. These results generalize <b>Zener’s</b> <b>theory</b> of thermoelastic loss in beams and are useful in predicting mode widths in MEMS and NEMS oscillators. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a unique experimental facility {{designed to measure}} damping of materials at cryogenic temperatures for the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The test facility removes other sources of damping in the measurement by avoiding frictional interfaces, decoupling the test specimen from the support system, and by using a non-contacting measurement device. Damping data reported herein are obtained for materials (Aluminum, Aluminum/Terbium/Dysprosium, Titanium, Composites) vibrating in free-free bending modes with low strain levels (< 10 (exp - 6) ppm). The fundamental frequencies of material samples are ranged from 14 to 202 Hz. To provide the most beneficial data relevant to TPF-like precision optical space missions, the damping data are collected from room temperatures (around 293 K) to cryogenic temperatures (below 40 K) at unevenly-spaced intervals. More data points are collected over any region of interest. The test data shows {{a significant decrease in}} viscous damping at cryogenic temperatures. The cryogenic damping can be as low as 10 (exp - 4) %, but the amount of the damping decrease is a function of frequency and material. However, Titanium 15 - 3 - 3 - 3 shows a remarkable increase in damping at cryogenic temperatures. It demonstrates over one order of magnitude increase in damping in comparison to Aluminum 6061 -T 6. Given its other properties (e. g., good stiffness and low conductivity) this may prove itself to be a good candidate for the application on TPF. At room temperatures, the test data are correlated well with the damping predicted by the <b>Zener</b> <b>theory.</b> However, large discrepancies at cryogenic temperatures between the <b>Zener</b> <b>theory</b> and the test data are observed...|$|E

40|$|This paper gives {{a method}} to {{determine}} the dynamic displacement magnification factor which is according to C. <b>Zener's</b> <b>theory</b> of anelasticity [1] and some microscopic mechanism of anelastic phenomenon (internal friction, elastic creep, stress relaxation and variation of dynamic modulus with frequency of measurements or temperature) which are contrary {{to the theory of}} elasticity but are shown by real solids. In the discussion of physical interpretation of anelasticity presented in this paper we are concerned primarily with the physical origin of the anelastic effects. All such effects are different manifestation of the lack of uniqueness of the relation between stress and strain. C. Zener derived the relation between internal friction (tan and stress function f(t) from the assumption that the true relation between stress and strain are linear and apply the Boltzmann's supperposition principle to the mechanical model of a standard linear solid. From the relation between internal friction and logarithmic decrement which is the indirect method of measuring internal friction in the case of small tan - the natural logarithm of the ratio of successive amplitudes- the author derived {{a method to}} calculate the disspated coefficient B and the anelastic damping factor g.

40|$|The magnetocrystalline anisotroples of gadolinium, terbium, {{dysprosium}} and holmium {{have been}} investigated using a torque method. Measurements were made on single crystal oblate spheroids, the major planes of which contained either the hexagonal axis or the basal plane of the crystals. The torque magnetometer used automatically balanced the torque produced in the specimen by applying a current through a small coil suspended in a galvanometer magnet, the servoraechanism being provided by a light beam and photo cell amplifier system. Fourier analysis of the torque curves by computer provided values for the appropriate anisotropy constants. Torque measurements {{were made in the}} temperature range from 55 K to room temperature, and in applied magnetic field strengths up to 12. 5 k 0 e. Because of the comparatively small field strengths available {{it was not possible to}} obtain any appreciable movement of the magnetisation from the basal plane in the cases of ferromagnetic Tb, Dy and Ho, and therefore no values could be assigned to the anisotropy constants. In the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic temperature ranges the torque curves were described completely by one anisotropy constant K(_ 11), although the presence of strain In the specimen could greatly distort the curve. The anisotropy constant in the basal plane, K(_ 4), was measured for Gd, Tb and Dy. The easy directions in the basal plane were the a-axls for Gd, and the o-axls for Tb and Dy, although changes of easy direction were observed in Dy at temperatures where the anlsotropy was small. A torque measurement made in the basal plane of holmium just above the critical field showed twelvefold symmetry in the anisotropy energy, but the main energy minimum occurred at the b-axis. Comparison of the temperature variation of K(_ 4) with the prediction of <b>Zener's</b> <b>theory</b> was satisfactory only in the case of Gd.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in thermoelasticity of vibrating structures {{is motivated by}} the unavoidable fact that ther-moelastic damping remains after all other sources of dissipation are removed, e. g. mounting losses, or crystal imperfection. Thus, carefully controlled experiments on silicon MEMS oscillators [1] have demon-strated that the dominant loss mechanism is thermoelastic (TE). Further reduction in TE damping of MEMS resonators, with applications to next generation RF devices, requires understanding this limiting effect. The talk reviews recent theoretical developments starting from a general procedure for calculating thermoelastic damping in structures [2]. The main idea is {{to take advantage of}} the fact that coupling between elastic and thermal fields is weak, and consequently TE damping can be found the purely elastic lossless solution by regular perturbation. The talk emphasizes new results for TE damping in flexural vibration of thin structures. The procedure generalizes the original <b>Zener</b> [3] <b>theory</b> for beams, though for thin plate situation is more interesting by virtue of the two dimensional nature which introduces the possibility of flexure in two directions, coupling the kinematics and the thermal diffusion. The latter is due to the alternating compression and extension on opposite faces of the thin structure, causing the instantaneous or isentropic bending stiffness of the plate to relax to its isothermal value. It can be shown that the lateral (in-plane) diffusion of heat is negligible. The net effect for thin plates in flexure is to modify the equation relating bending moment M and curvature κ to M = D(0) κ−∆Dg ∗ κ, where D(0) is the instantaneous or adiabatic bending stiffness, ∆D =...|$|R

In this work experiments have been performed to assess the effects of the various different precipitates upon the grain growth behavior in two powder metallurgy (P/M) Ni-base superalloys, IN 100 and a related 2 ̆ 2 Matrix 2 ̆ 2 alloy. Extensive microstructural characterization has been performed on the γ phase, γ 2 ̆ 7 precipitates and inert precipitates in these alloys. The interactions between the precipitates and the γ grain boundaries have been investigated in detail. The investigation has been performed on alloys heat-treated at temperatures around the primary γ 2 ̆ 7 solvus, because the grain structures of the alloys underwent the most significant changes in this range. Extensive grain size and size distribution data have been acquired from both alloys. ^ For the Matrix alloy, the grain size data indicate that normal grain growth (NGG) occurs and that this stagnates at a limiting grain size. These data have been related to the characteristics of the precipitates (such as chemistry, size, volume fraction and spatial distribution) on the basis of <b>Zener</b> pinning <b>theory.</b> The two main approaches for modeling NGG were applied independently to the alloy, and both were found to be able to model the grain size variation well. The relationship between these apparently different approaches has been established successfully. For IN 100, the grain growth behavior is more complex. Either NGG or abnormal grain growth (AGG) may occur, depending on the heat-treatment conditions. The occurrence of AGG leads to remarkably larger grain sizes and inhomogeneous grain structures, which could have important consequences for the properties of P/M alloys processed under such conditions. A new model has been developed to explain the origins of this abnormal grain growth phenomenon. ...|$|R
40|$|Nanocrystalline copper-fullerene {{thin films}} were {{simultaneously}} co-deposited by copper evaporation and fullerene sublimation, and annealed over a range from 200 to 800 ∘C for 8 hours in flowing argon. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron probe micro analysis, x-ray diffraction and extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis {{were used to}} characterize the films before and after annealing. These analyses show that fullerenes were dispersed at a microscopic level in the uniform thin films by the co-deposition technique. The fullerenes were observed to segregate at the copper grains boundaries. The copper grains were refined with the nanosize fullerene particles during the co-deposition. Comparing to the pure copper thin films, grain growth in the fullerene-copper thin films was significantly suppressed by the dispersed fullerenes when the annealing temperature was lower than 400 ∘C. Grain growth occurred when the films annealed above 400 ∘C where the fullerenes were separated from the copper matrix. Furthermore, {{a model for a}} Cu-C 60 system was proposed to provide {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between copper atoms and fullerene molecules. This model suggests that fullerene segregation and its concentrations at the copper grain boundaries are the two major factors in determining the microstructures of the copper-fullerene thin films during co-deposition and annealing. The <b>Zener</b> pinning <b>theory</b> was used to explain the copper grain size stabilization with the fullerene dispersion.
