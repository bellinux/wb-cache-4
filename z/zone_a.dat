A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.)

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized {{loss of life}} along the coast.

Several hours later, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition, with convection persisting {{mainly in the}} northwestern portion of the storm and cold, dry air entering into the southwestern portion. At 1200UTC, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Juaning as it moved out of their area of responsibility. The JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 20W (Faxai) had become extratropical around this time as it merged with a baroclinic <b>zone.</b> <b>A</b> cold front developed along the southern portion of Faxai, a feature of extratropical cyclones.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 14, which {{is believed to have been}} the impetus to Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day. Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence <b>Zone,</b> <b>a</b> broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center, and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined. It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC on May 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very light wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E
