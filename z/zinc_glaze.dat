40|$|Abstract. A willemite brown {{inorganic}} pigment was synthesized by subsyituting MnO for ZnO. The composition of MnxZn 2 -xSiO 4 (X= 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 7 and 0. 9 mole) was synthesized at 1200 ~ 1300 ℃ by solid state method. The characteristics of synthesized pigment {{were analyzed by}} X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and SEM. The UV- vis spectroscopy and CIE L*a*b * measurement were employed to analyzed color. Willemite single crystal phase was synthesized with compositions of Mn 0. 3 Zn 1. 5 SiO 2 and Mn 0. 5 Zn 1. 5 SiO 2 from 1300 ℃/ 3 h. The synthesized pigment of Mn 0. 5 Zn 1. 5 SiO 2 at 1300 ℃/ 3 h was applicated to lime barium glaze and lime <b>zinc</b> <b>glaze</b> and the CIE L*a*b * values were 30. 32, 7. 17, 3. 14 and 32. 04, 8. 18, 3. 49, respectively. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Zinc</b> Crystal <b>Glaze</b> has {{its limits}} in {{practical}} use of commercial glaze due to the sensitive firing schedule. In order to overcome these limits, and to improve the practical usage, this study is aimed to develop a stable <b>zinc</b> crystalline <b>glaze.</b> This study altered the quantity of nuclear formation of <b>zinc</b> crystal <b>glaze</b> {{in order to control}} the willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4) formation in the glaze. The addition of ZrO 2 to <b>zinc</b> crystal <b>glaze</b> influences the quantity of nuclear formation and its preservation; thus ZrO 2 was used to control the optimal firing temperature {{and the size of the}} crystal formation in the glaze to find a <b>zinc</b> crystal <b>glaze</b> capable of withstanding various ranges of temperatures...|$|R
40|$|When {{metal oxides}} are added into {{crystalline}} glaze, colors of glaze and crystals are similar as colorants generally. But {{the case of}} NiO in <b>zinc</b> crystalline <b>glaze</b> is different from general color development. When NiO is added to <b>zinc</b> crystalline <b>glaze</b> it can develop two or three colors. The active use of color development mechanism by adding NiO to the <b>zinc</b> crystalline <b>glaze</b> to control color of the base glaze and crystal with stability is investigated. This report is expected {{to contribute to the}} ceramic industry in improving application of <b>zinc</b> crystalline <b>glaze.</b> For the experiment of NiO, the quantity of NiO additives is changed to the base glaze for the most adequate formation of willemite crystal from previous research and firing condition: temperature increasing speed 5 o C/ min, holding 1 h at 127...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microwave {{processing}} {{has been}} emerging as an innovative sintering method for many traditional ceramics, advanced ceramics, specialty ceramics and ceramic composites {{as well as}} polymer and polymer composites. Development of functionally gradient materials, joining, melting, fibre drawing, reaction synthesis of ceramics, synthesis of ceramic powder, phosphor materials, whiskers, microtubes and nanotubes, sintering of <b>zinc</b> oxide varistors, <b>glazing</b> of coating surface and coating development have been performed using micro-wave heating. In addition, microwave energy is being explored for the sintering of metal powders also. Ceramic and metal nanopowders have been sintered in microwave. Furthermore, initiatives {{have been taken to}} process the amorphous materials (e. g. glass) by microwave heating. Besides this, an attempt has been made to study the heating behaviour of materials in the electric and magnetic fields at microwave frequencies. The research is now focused on the use of microwave processing for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{extraction}} {{experiments were}} carried out on glazed tile specimens with 4 and 10 % (v/v) acetic acid, 1 % (w/v) citric acid, and 1 % (v/v) lactic acid solution in three temperature conditions (20, 40, and 60 °C) to investigate the effect of temperature and pH value on extraction of lead, cobalt, nickel, and zinc from ceramic food packaging materials and to study the extraction kinetics of toxic metals. Results showed that except at 60 °C the amount of extraction of lead, cobalt, nickel, and zinc had linear dependence on time at longer times and removal of these toxic metals under other conditions increased linearly with the square root of the time, indicating a diffusion-controlled process. The amount of these toxic metals leached out from ceramic food packaging materials into the leachate, and the leaching rate increased with temperature and decreased with pH value of the food simulants. In addition, among these four toxic metals lead was the least leachable element, and nickel was the most leachable one. Disagreement between the ratios of the oxide of lead, cobalt, nickel, and <b>zinc</b> in the <b>glaze</b> and their release in the leachate suggested that extraction of these toxic metals was an incongruent dissolution process...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, the lime-barium and lime-zinc glazes used in Southern and Eastern Africa Mineral Center (SEAMIC) {{ceramic unit}} in Tanzania were {{investigated}} {{for the production}} of high temperature raw glazes in Cameroon. The base Seger formula used was 0. 3 KNaO, 0. 3 CaO, 0. 4 ZnO or BaO; xAl 2 O 3 and ySiO 2 . Different Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 formula ratios for glossy and matt glazes were tested with raw materials from Cameroon and Tanzania. In the Cameroonian glazes, a local pegmatite (quartz, microcline, albite) with low coloured oxides replaced an albitic feldspar in the Tanzanian glazes. The other materials were kaolin, limestone, silica and barium carbonate or <b>zinc</b> oxide. The <b>glazes</b> were tested at Seger Cone 7 (1240 ℃) on stoneware slabs (made up of the same feldspathic glaze material: 18 %, silica sand or quartz 27 %, ball clay 40 % and kaolin 15 %) from both Tanzania and Cameroon materials. From results obtained, zinc oxide acted as a more vigorous flux than barium carbonate at cone 7, which is obvious in the glazes with pegmatite (with high quartz content). At a Seger formula of Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 1 : 10, transparent glazes were obtained. In these glazes the alumina content was lower and when increased to higher Seger ratios 1 : 4. 7 - 8. 7, the gloss was lowered to matt-luster due to fine crystal formation...|$|R
