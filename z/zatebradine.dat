40|$|The {{importance}} of heart rate for left ventricular remodeling and prognosis after myocardial infarction is not known. We examined {{the contribution of}} heart rate reduction by <b>zatebradine,</b> a direct sinus node inhibitor without negative inotropic effects on left ventricular function and dilatation, on mortality, energy metabolism, and neurohormonal changes in rats with experimental myocardial infarction (MI).

40|$|Background. <b>Zatebradine</b> (UL-FS 49) {{is a drug}} with a {{specific}} bradycardiac electrophysiological profile. It reduces heart rate by lengthening the duration of diastolic depolarization in the sinoatrial (SA) node. The ionic basis of this action, however, is not clarified. Methods and Results. We used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to {{study the effects of}} <b>zatebradine</b> on ionic currents underlying diastolic depolarization of isolated rabbit SA node cells. Low concentrations of <b>zatebradine</b> simultaneously reduced diastolic depolarization rate and the pacemaker current If. The drug blocked the pacemaker current, If, in a use-dependent manner without causing a shift of its activation curve. At hyperpolarized potentials, unblock of If occurred. Clinically relevant concentrations of the drug have little effect on the L-type calcium current or delayed rectifier potassium current. Conclsmions.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of <b>zatebradine</b> on heart rate, {{contractility}} and relaxation with those of its structural analog verapamil. We used isoproterenol, a potent beta-agonist, to see how these effects were modulated by sympathetic activation. We also compared the effects of <b>zatebradine</b> and verapamil on coronary blood flow and coronary blood flow reserve. Background. <b>Zatebradine,</b> previously called UL-FS 49, is a new bradycardic agent believed to act selectively at the sinoatrial node. Methods. Isolated isovolumetric pig hearts were prepared and left ventricular pressure, its first derivative (dP/dt), tau and heart rate were measured both before and after administration of either 0. 975 mg of <b>zatebradine</b> (Group I, n = 8) or 125 μg of verapamil (Group II, n = 8). After the effects of each drug reached a plateau, a continuous infusion of isoproterenol was started and measurements were obtained again and compared with a third group of measurements from control hearts infused with isoproterenol after receiving only saline solution (n = 8). We also assessed the effects of <b>zatebradine</b> and verapamil on coronary vascular tone by measuring flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery in intact anesthetized open chest pigs both before and after the Intracoronary administration of these drugs (n = 8 for each). All preparations were atrially paced to negate any bradycardic effects of the drugs. Results. In the group that received <b>zatebradine,</b> mean (±SE) heart rate decreased from 143 ± 8 to 99 ± 4 beats/min (p < 0. 01) and there was no significant change in either peak left veatricular systolic pressure, dP/dt or tau. In contrast, verapamil produced a lesser decrease in heart rate (136 ± 7 to 120 ± 7 beats/min, p < 0. 05) but produced substantial decreases in peak left ventricular pressure (100 ± 3 to 45 ± 4 mm Hg, p < 0. 01) and dP/dt (68 % decrease, p < 0. 01) and an increase in tau (+ 26 %, p < 0. 05). Isoproterenol restored these variables toward normal values in the hearts treated with verapamil, although left vestricular systolic pressure and dP/dt were restored to control values only at the highest isoproterenol concentrations. In the hearts treated with <b>zatebradine,</b> isoproterenol sagnificantly increased left ventricular pressure and contractility and decreased tau; however, beast rate remained unchanged at peak effect. <b>Zatebradine</b> had no effect on coronary blood flow and there was a 100 % increase in flow with reactive heyperemia, Conversely, verapamil increased coromry flow by 100 %, with no subsequent further increase by reactive hyperemia compared with control values. Conclusions. Although structurally similar to verapamil, <b>zatebradine</b> is a nighty specific bradycardic agent. It has little direct effect on left ventricular developed pressare, contractility, relaxation and coronary vascular tone. Furthermore, the bradycardic effect of <b>zatebradine</b> unlike that of verapamil, is not overcome by doses of isoproterenol that increase developed pressure and contractility and improve relaxation. Because of its highly specific bradycardic effect, this drug may potentially be useful in treating patients with ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure...|$|E

40|$|Sinus node inhibitors {{reduce the}} heart rate presumably by {{blocking}} the pacemaker current If in the cardiac conduction system. This pacemaker current is carried by four hyperpolar-ization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) chan-nels. We tested the potential subtype-specificity of the sinus node inhibitors cilobradine, ivabradine, and <b>zatebradine</b> using cloned HCN channels. All three substances blocked the slow inward current through human HCN 1, HCN 2, HCN 3, and HCN 4 channels. There was no subtype-specificity for the steady-state block, with mean IC 50 values of 0. 99, 2. 25, and 1. 96 M for cilobradine, ivabradine, and <b>zatebradine,</b> respectively. Native If, recorded from mouse sinoatrial node cells, was slightly more efficiently blocked by cilobradine (IC 50 value of 0. 62 M) than were the HCN currents. The block of If in sinoatrial node cells resulted in slower and dysrhythmic spontaneous action poten-tials. The in vivo action of these blockers was analyzed using telemetric ECG recordings in mice. Each compound reduced {{the heart rate}} dose-dependently from 600 to 200 bpm with ED 50 values of 1. 2, 4. 7, and 1. 8 mg/kg for cilobradine, ivabra-dine, and <b>zatebradine,</b> respectively. -Adrenergic stimulation or forced physical activity only partly reversed this bradycardia. In addition to bradycardia, all three drugs induced increasing arrhythmia at concentrations greater than 5 mg/kg for cilobra-dine, greater than 10 mg/kg for <b>zatebradine,</b> or greater than 15 mg/kg for ivabradine. This dysrhythmic heart rate is character-ized by periodic fluctuations of the duration between the T and P wave, resembling a form of sick sinus syndrome in humans.

This {{investigation}} determined whether attenuation of the tachycardia {{produced by}} dobutamine administration would improve perfusion and function distal to a severe coronary artery stenosis. Background. Tachycardia adversely affects perfusion and function distal to a coronary artery stenosis. It {{is not known}} whether a specific bradycardic agent can improve blood flow and function in an ischemic zone during administration of dobutamine. Methods. The effects of dobutamine (2, 5 and 10 μg/kg body weight per min) alone and in combination with <b>zatebradine</b> (0. 5 mg/kg), a specific bradycardic agent, on hemodynamic status, segment shortening (ultrasound length transducers) and myocardial perfusion (microspheres) were studied in anesthetized dogs with severe left circumflex coronary artery stenosis. Results. A 50 % reduction in left circumflex coronary artery blood flow (58 ± 4 to 29 ± 2 ml/min [mean value ± SEM]) produced a decrease in systolic shortening in the ischemic zone. Only a dose of dobutamine that did not elevate heart rate (2 μg/kg per min) produced an increase in segment shortening in the ischemic zone. High doses of dobutamine (10 μ/kg per min) caused an increase in heart rate without improvement in function {{and a reduction in}} the subendocardial/subepicardial flow ratio (0. 74 ± 0. 06 to 0. 48 ± 0. 05). <b>Zatebradine</b> administered in the presence of dobutamine caused a decrease in heart rate, an increase in subendocardial/subepicardial blood flow ratio (0. 48 ± 0. 05 to 0. 78 ± 0. 09) and allowed an increase in ischemic zone segment shortening. When normalized for changes in heart rate, ischemic zone subendocardial flow increased by 123 ± 41 % (0. 39 ± 0. 09 to 0. 71 ± 0. 12 ml/ 100 g per beat).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to apply a {{behavioural}} stress paradigm for studying the neural mechanisms underlying stress-induced arrhythmias, and to test whether such arrhythmias could be suppressed by systemic administration of 8 -OH-DPAT, a 5 -HT 1 A agonist possessing central sympatholytic properties. The study was conducted on adult male rats instrumented for telemetric recordings of ECG, body temperature and locomotor activity. In the first experiment, rats were subjected to social defeat after either 8 -OH-DPAT (100 µg/kg s. c.) or vehicle injection. In the second experiment, prior to vehicle/ 8 -OH-DPAT administration, animals were pre-treated with <b>zatebradine,</b> a blocker of the pacemaker current. 8 -OH-DPAT caused prolongation of basal RR interval, increase in locomotion and hypothermia. Subjecting vehicle-treated animals to social defeat caused shortening in RR interval, increase in locomotor activity and hyperthermia, and provoked the occurrence of premature ventricular and supraventricular beats; all these effects were substantially attenuated by 8 -OH-DPAT. <b>Zatebradine</b> caused prolongation of RR interval. In zatebradine/vehicle-treated rats, the incidence of ventricular and supraventricular premature beats during defeat increased 2. 5 -fold and 3. 5 -fold, respectively. 8 -OH-DPAT administered after <b>zatebradine</b> significantly reduced these stress-induced arrhythmias. We conclude that: i) pharmacologically induced prolongation of RR interval may contribute to an increased susceptibility to stress-induced cardiac arrhythmias, possibly due to the prolongation of the ventricular diastolic period with restored excitability; and ii) systemic administration of 8 -OH-DPAT abolishes these arrhythmic events, likely by suppressing stress-induced cardiac sympathetic outflow...|$|E

Among these currents, the hyperpolarization-activated current (termed I(f), cardiac pacemaker "funny" current, and I(h) in neurons) is the major component contributing to the initiation of cardiac and neuronal excitability and to the modulation of this excitability by neurotransmitters and hormones. I(f) is an inward current activated by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and by intracellular cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP. The identification {{at the end of}} the 1990 s of a family of mammalian genes that encode for four Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated channels, HCN 1 - 4, has made analysis of the location of these channels and the study of their biophysical properties an obtainable goal. As a result, specific agents have been developed for their ability to selectively reduce heart rate by lowering cardiac pacemaker activity where f-channels are their main natural target. These drugs include alinidine, <b>zatebradine,</b> cilobradine, ZD- 7288 and ivabradine. Recent data indicate that pharmacological tools such as W 7 and genistein, which have been used to identify some intracellular pathways involved in ionic channel modulation, also have the ability to inhibit I(f) directly. This opens new perspectives for the future development of other specific rhythm-lowering agents...|$|E
40|$|Summary This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test whether the selective bradycardic effects of <b>zatebradine</b> (UL-FS 49) were altered in the setting of chronic mild left ventricular dysfunction secondary to a myocardial infarction. We therefore administered four doses of UL-FS 49 at 15 -min intervals (cumulative doses of 10, 30, 100, and 300 μg/kg) to eight normal conscious pigs and to seven pigs in which the left circumflex coronary artery was occluded 3 weeks previously. Left ventricular dysfunction in this second group of animals was manifested by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP 11 ± 2 mmHg vs. 7 ± 1 mmHg, respectively; p< 0. 05) and a decrease in LVdP/dtmax (3020 ± 210 mmHg vs. 3720 ± 210 mmHg, respectively; p< 0. 05). The results showed that UL-FS 49 was equally effective in reducing heart rate in both groups of animals [from 126 ± 4 to 95 ± 2 beats/min and from 140 ± 5 to 98 ± 6 beats/min for the normal animals and for the animals with a chronic myocardial infarction (MI), respectively]. The duration of left ventricular systole was not affected, but the duration of diastole was prolonged from 290 ± 10 msec to 420 ± 20 msec in the normal animals and from 250 ± 10 msec to 430 ± 30 msec in the animals with MI (both p< 0. 05). Up to 100 μg/kg UL-FS 49 did not affect arterial blood pressure, whereas LVdP/dtmax and cardiac output decreased by less than 10...|$|E
40|$|Intrinsic {{regulation}} of the teleost heart is greatly dependent on central venous pressure, which exerts a modulatory role on stroke volume according to the well-known Frank–Starling mechanism. This mechanism is well characterized in situ (Farrell et al., 1982; Farrell, 1991) and results from perfused heart studies have been extrapolated to cardiac function in the intact animal. Heart perfusion studies, however, operate at rates well above the in vivo range of resting heart rate (Altimiras and Larsen, 2000) because the inhibitory cholinergic influence on the heart is abolished. At the lower in vivo heart rates, the loading conditions of the heart will differ due to a longer filling time (Farrell and Jones, 1992), {{which in turn is}} expected to increase venous pressure. This prediction has not been demonstrated experimentally due to technical limitations in recording pressure in the sinus venosus (PSV) in teleosts. Such a study, however, could shed light on two separate aspects of the cardiac physiology of teleosts. First, it could explain the shift from vis-à-fronte atrial filling to vis-à-tergo filling (Farrell, 1991). The unique vis-à-fronte filling mechanism observed in some fish species relies on the generation of negative intrapericardiac pressures associated with the elastic recoil of the ventricle during diastole. This mechanism differs from vis-à-tergo filling, which depends on the build-up of pressure in the central veins. Second, it could explain the role of venous pressure in modulating cardiac output through the interdependence between heart rate and stroke volume. The aim {{of the study was to}} validate a new technique for measuring PSV, and to study PSV in trout at varying heart rates. Since truly resting heart rates were unattainable, a novel pharmacological approach to manipulate heart rate using the bradycardic agent <b>zatebradine</b> was developed and validated.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{knowledge}} exists regarding neural control of myocardial function in the rat. Most of the studies addressing this issue were conducted either under general anaesthesia or in isolated hearts in vitro. Our principal aim {{was to provide a}} detailed quantitative description of mechanisms controlling cardiac contractility in the rat, in an anaesthetic-free preparation with a preserved functional brainstem. Furthermore, while vagally mediated negative inotropy is a well-known phenomenon, at present there is no direct evidence for its presence in the rat; we searched for such evidence. To this end, in the arterially perfused working heart–brainstem preparation of the rat, we measured left ventricular pressure (LVP) and computed its first derivative (LVdP/dt). We made the following new observations. (i) <b>Zatebradine</b> (cardiac sodium pacemaker current blocker) caused a bradycardia associated with increases in LVP and LVdP/dt; the latter effect was via a frequency-dependent mechanism. (ii) We confirmed that in the rat, the force–frequency relationship (dependence of contractility on heart rate) is positive over a low range of heart rates, and negative and linear at physiological levels of heart rate, and provided its quantitative description. (iii) The increase in systemic pressure caused a rise in contractility, and vagal blockade or destruction of the central nervous system did not alter this inotropic effect, suggesting that it was mediated by intrinsic cardiac mechanisms. (iv) Vagal stimulation caused complex polyphasic changes in LVdP/dt and LVP in unpaced preparations; during pacing, it caused slowly developing falls in LVdP/dt that could be prevented by atropine. We conclude that control of ventricular contractility in the rat heart differs from that in other mammals not only by its negative frequency dependence, but also in the potent influence of aortic pressure on LVdP/dt. At the level of autonomic neural control, our newly found, vagally mediated negative inotropic effect adds to the accumulating body of data regarding both the presence and the functional importance of parasympathetic innervation of the ventricular myocardium...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{pancreatic}} β-cell to secrete insulin in response to changes in glucose concentration {{is the cornerstone of}} glucose homeostasis. The β-cell couples glucose metabolism to electrical activity via the modulation of ion channel activity. Defects in β-cell ion channels can result in the dysregulation of insulin secretion and, consequently, in glucose homeostasis. Congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI) is an inherited disorder of inappropriate insulin secretion often caused by gene defects in the subunits of KATP channels (ABCC 8, KCNJ 11). In 50 % of CHI patients, no genetic basis has yet been discovered. I aimed to characterise the expression, and function, of two novel ion channel families in the healthy human pancreas and the hyperinsulinaemic pancreas. Hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN channels) are selective for K+ /Na+ under physiological conditions and are responsible for the rhythmic electrical behaviour (pacemaker behaviour) in the heart and brain. Two-pore potassium channels (K 2 P channels) are potassium-selective channels whose activity contributes to, and maintains, the resting membrane potential of living cells. HCN and K 2 P gene and protein expression was investigated by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. HCN 1, 2, 3, and 4 mRNA and mRNA from six K 2 P channels was detected in isolated mouse islets. Immunofluorescence revealed the presence of HCN 1, HCN 2 and HCN 4 in mouse β-cells. The role of HCN channels in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was assessed in isolated mouse islets. The HCN channel agonist lamotrigine had no effect on GSIS (n= 3), but GSIS was significantly inhibited by the HCN channel blocker <b>zatebradine</b> (n= 3) thereby confirming that HCN channels {{may play a role in}} glucose homeostasis. Tissue was isolated from adult control human pancreas and from six patients following pancreatectomy for CHI. HCN and K 2 P channel expression was also assessed in pancreatic tissue from ABCC 8 -knockout mice. HCN 1 - 4 mRNA and the mRNA of four K 2 P channels were detected in islets isolated from adult control and CHI patient pancreatic tissue. Co-expression of HCN channel isoforms with insulin confirmed that HCN 1, - 2 and - 4 were β-cell-specific in control human islets. By contrast, in all patient tissues expression of HCN channels was altered, and in 5 out of 6 cases, HCN channels were not expressed in β-cells. The K 2 P channel TWIK- 1 was found to be expressed predominantly in the healthy human exocrine pancreas. In contrast, its expression was consistently detected in the β-cells of CHI patients. We found similar data for both HCN channels and TWIK- 1 in islets of ABCC 8 -knockout mice, but not their litter-mate controls (n= 3). These studies provide the first data on the expression of HCN and K 2 P channels in the human pancreas and reveal that CHI is associated with an altered expression profile of both ion channel families. Significantly, we found that HCN and K 2 P expression in β-cells is altered in CHI patients and we speculate that this is as a consequence of physiological remodelling.
