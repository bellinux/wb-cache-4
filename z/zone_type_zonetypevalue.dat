We perform numerical, meter-scale shear experiments in which we vary the temperature and {{the ratio of the}} two mineral phases. Three micromechanical deformation fields are identified according to the mechanical behavior of the minerals at play (brittle or ductile when both phases are in the brittle or ductile regime, respectively, and semibrittle when one phase is in the brittle and the other in the ductile regime). Besides these micromechanical deformation fields, we identify three deformation types characterizing the degree of localization (type I: localized shear <b>zone,</b> <b>type</b> II: localized anastomosing shear <b>zone,</b> and <b>type</b> III: delocalized shear <b>zone).</b> <b>Type</b> I is expected in the brittle deformation field. In the semibrittle field, all deformation types can be observed depending on the amount of weak phase present. In the ductile field, deformation is dependent on the strength ratio between the two phases. For a low strength ratio, deformation of type III is always observed.

Preface The climate of Japan is subject to humid temperate climate and the seasonal change is clear. The large quantity of precipitation falls in spring, summer and autumn in the Pacific Seaboard of Japan, and falls in winter on the coast of the Japan Sea.

40|$|Protected areas {{often need}} to provide {{recreational}} opportunities whilst conserving biodiversity. Recreation brings important benefits to human well-being, and allowing people to experience nature in protected areas can also provide revenue and support for conservation objectives. However, not all recreational activities are compatible with environmental management goals. Here, we show how a coastal protected area can be zoned to satisfy both recreational and conservation objectives. We collected empirical data {{on the effect of}} recreational disturbance to foraging shorebirds in Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland, Australia, and calculated the benefit of alternative protected area <b>zone</b> <b>types</b> on shorebird representation using a zero-inflated negative binomial model. The predictions from this model were used to optimize a zoning plan in a linear programming framework that balances recreational use with shorebird conservation. Costs reflect foregone recreational opportunity, thereby facilitating solutions that minimize restrictions on recreational use of the coastline. We discover a consistent negative effect of recreational use of the foreshore on shorebird occupancy and abundance and show that, despite this, zoning can be used to achieve shorebird representation targets with only a small cost to recreational opportunity. When dog recreation is permitted at all sites, a 91 % shorebird representation target can be met, indicating that de facto patterns of recreation were rather well segregated from areas used by shorebirds. By restricting dog recreation to five sites and allowing people to access all other foreshore sites, shorebird representation increased to 97 %. Synthesis and applications. Our approach of calculating the contribution of each <b>zone</b> <b>type</b> towards conservation objectives results in zoning plans with robust estimates of conservation benefit that can be readily implemented by managers. Specifically, we estimated the effects of removing people and domestic dog recreation within each intertidal site on shorebird abundance to inform coastal zoning plans. Incorporating cost as foregone recreational opportunity results in zoning plans that minimize the number of people required to make a behavioural change. Compliance to <b>zone</b> <b>types</b> is often ultimately voluntary so integrating the current intensity of recreational use is more likely to generate workable zoning plans...|$|R

40|$|Background: Aim of {{the study}} was to compare the quality of loop {{excision}} using a colposcope with results using the VITOM system. Results compared included cervical volume removed, intra- and postoperative complications, and positive resection margins. Methods: A total of 200 patients with histologically confirmed high-grade cervical premalignant lesions, persistent atypical cytological results and/or suspicious colposcopic findings, and cytological and histological discrepancies were included in the study. In transformation <b>zone</b> <b>type</b> 1 (T 1) only a superficial cone biopsy was done, in <b>zones</b> <b>type</b> 2 and 3 (T 2 and T 3) a superficial outside cone biopsy or a deeper inside cone biopsy were done respectively, followed by endocervical curettage. Volume of removed tissue, complications, and positive resection margins were compared for the colposcopy and the VITOM groups. Findings: Demographic and reproductive features were similar between groups. In the VITOM group 49 % of patients had zone T 1, 30 % had zone T 2, and 21 % had zone T 3. In the group of patients managed by colposcopy, 48, 45, and 7 % of patients had zone T 1, T 2 and T 3 zone, respectively (p 0. 05). There were no significant differences in the type of procedure or the mean volume of removed tissue. Results were similar for both groups with respect to positive resection margins and complications. Conclusion: VITOM is a safe and reliable system. Results using the VITOM system are comparable to those obtained with conventional colposcopy. The potential advantage of VITOM is the broader availability of endoscopic systems in the operating theatre. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm for {{the determination of}} <b>zone</b> content <b>type</b> of a given zone within a document image. We take a statistical based approach and represent each zone with 25 dimensional feature vectors. An optimized decision tree classifier is used to classify each zone into one of nine zone content classes. A performance evaluation protocol is proposed. The training and testing datasets include a total of 24, 177 zones from the University of Washington English Document Image database III. The algorithm accuracy is 98. 45 % with a mean false alarm rate of 0. 50 %. Summary A document {{can be divided into}} zones {{on the basis of its}} content. For example, a zone can be either text or non-text. Given the segmented document zones, correctly determining the <b>zone</b> content <b>type</b> is very important for the subsequent processes within any document image understanding system.

In our zone content classification algorithm, zones are represented as 25 dimensional feature vectors. The feature vector includes our new signature-like background analysis structure which is good to study statistical characteristic of a given zone. A decision tree classifier is used to classify each zone into one of nine classes on the basis of its feature vector. The protocol by which the decision tree classifier is optimized eliminates the data over-fitting problem. To enrich our probabilistic model, we incorporate context constraints for certain zones within their neighboring zones.

Methods: Seventy-two osteoarthritic cartilage/bone samples were obtained form 29 patients with primary OA undergoing surgery for a total knee replacement. Normal cartilage was collected from five human knees {{at the time of}} autopsy. Type VI collagen protein was localized using a polyclonal anti human type VI collagen antibody, the corresponding mRNA was detected with an 310 base antisense probe, specific for the α 2 (VI) collagen chain. Results: In normal cartilage, type VI collagen protein is concentrated pericellularly around the chondrocytes of all cartilage zones. In the middle and deep <b>zones,</b> <b>type</b> VI collagen was also found in the interterritorial matrix. Type VI collagen mRNA expression was detected in chondrocytes of all cartilage zones. In moderately affected osteoarthritic cartilage, type VI collagen expression was increased. An intensive immunohistological interterritorial staining for type VI collagen was observed in the middle and deep cartilage zones. Specific mRNA signals were also increased especially in the middle and deep cartilage zone. In the superficial zone and calcified cartilage of these samples, type VI collagen mRNA expression was restricted to focal areas. In severe osteoarthritic cartilage, an intensive staining for type VI collagen mRNA was found in clusters of proliferating chondrocytes and in the deep cartilage <b>zone.</b> <b>Type</b> VI collagen was localized pericellularly and in the matrix of chondrocyte clusters. Furthermore, chondrocytes from the deep zone showed a territorial distribution of type VI collagen. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage, type VI collagen is expressed in a zone specific pattern.
