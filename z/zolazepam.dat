40|$|The {{anatomy and}} {{physiology}} of reptiles and mammals are in many ways different, and will therefore possibly complicate anesthetic administration. Lizards are ectothermic and one {{should keep in mind}} that a decrease in the lizard’s environmental temperature may result in reductions in anesthetic metabolism. Respiratory depression is a profound problem because lizards lack a diaphragm, making inhalation and expiration completely active processes. This, in combination with cardiac shunting and breath holding makes the effects of anesthesia unpredictable. Since lizards have a renal-portal-system, anesthetics injected in the caudal half of the body may be eliminated at a different speed than if injected elsewhere. Premedication may be used to facilitate handling, injection and to reduce stress and high usage of anesthetics. Inhalant anesthetics are safe to use and provides easily controlled depth and duration. Isoflurane is commonly used and has a rapid induction and recovery period but may cause decreased blood pressure and suppress spontaneous ventilation. Sevoflurane gives an even faster induction than isoflurane. Inhalant anesthetics in general have short duration, does not give adequate analgesia or depth, and require constant maintenance. Injectable anesthetics often have long duration and thus give longer recovery in comparison to inhalant anesthetics. Most commonly used are ketamine, propofol and tiletamine together with <b>zolazepam.</b> Ketamine in lower doses are tranquillizing, while higher doses achieve surgical anesthesia. However it provides no analgesia, depth of anesthesia is difficult to evaluate and high doses often cause prolonged recovery. Tiletamine and <b>zolazepam</b> together gives anesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation. The duration is longer than with ketamine and entail longer recovery, nevertheless tiletamine with <b>zolazepam</b> is recommended when treating larger animals since smaller volumes are required in comparison to ketamine. Propofol can be used to provide induction or maintenance of anesthesia. Recovery is fast and organ toxicity is minimal. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Chemical {{immobilization}} of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) {{has previously}} been, {{for the most}} part, problematic {{and this has been}} mainly attributed to the type of immobilizing agent used. In addition to individual sensitivity, physiological status may play an important role. We investigated the use of the intravenous administration of a 1 : 1 mixture of tiletamine and <b>zolazepam</b> (Telazol ®) to immobilize adult females at different points during a physiologically demanding 5 – 6 week lactation period. We also compared performance between IV and IM injection of the same mixture. Results The tiletamine:zolazepam mixture administered intravenously was an effective method for immobilization with no fatalities or pronounced apnoeas in 106 procedures; however, there was a 25 % (one animal in four) mortality rate with intramuscular administration. Induction time was slightly longer for females at the end of lactation (54. 9 ± 2. 3 seconds) than at post-parturition (48. 2 ± 2. 9 seconds). In addition, the number of previous captures had a positive effect on induction time. There was no evidence for effects due to age, condition (total body lipid), stage of lactation or number of captures on recovery time. Conclusion We suggest that intravenous administration of tiletamine and <b>zolazepam</b> is an effective and safe immobilizing agent for female Weddell seals. Although individual traits could not explain variation in recovery time, we suggest careful monitoring of recovery times during longitudinal studies (> 2 captures). We show that physiological pressures do not substantially affect response to chemical immobilization with this mixture; however, consideration must be taken for differences that may exist for immobilization of adult males and juveniles.

40|$|There {{were used}} 20 mixed breed cats, {{both male and}} female, with body mass between 2 and 4 kilograms, that {{received}} anesthesia with tiletamine and <b>zolazepam</b> (6, 0 mg/kg). The femoral artery was assepticale cannulated and a manometer connected to an air column {{was connected to the}} catheter.

The flow of the external ophthalmic artery was measured through the ultrasond equipment, with an echo-doppler and a sectorial transducer of 6. 0 MHz, directly applied to the cornea. Each eye had the artery flow surveyed by the equipment's own device, 3 samples being taken. The vascular resistance index was calculated based on the mean values of systolic and diastolic flow of each vasses. An average value for the MAP of 144. 9 ± 26. 68 mmHg and a flow of 14. 28 ± 41. 3 cm/sec for the external ophthalmic artery in the right eye in systole, 23. 95 ± 11. 46 cm/sec in diastole and 42. 75 ± 12. 64 cm/sec in the left eye in systole, 25. 45 ± 9. 61 cm/sec in diastole, were verified, there being no significant difference between the eyes. The calculated index of vascular resistance was of 0. 4175 ± 0. 0774 for the external ophthalmic artery in the right eye and 0, 4015 ± 0. 0719 for the left eye, without any significant difference between the eyes.

40|$|Abstract In {{previous}} studies, repeated 5 -s exposures of anesthetized pigs to {{an electronic}} control device (TASER International’s Advanced TASER X 26 device) resulted in acidosis {{and increases in}} blood electrolytes. In the current study, experiments were performed to investigate the effects of longer continuous exposures to a different electronic-control-device waveform. After intramuscular injection of tiletamine HCl and <b>zolazepam</b> HCl, anesthesia was main-tained with propofol infusion. Ten pigs were exposed to either 30 - or 60 -s applications of an electronic waveform similar to the TASER-X 26 device. Transient increases in potassium, and sodium were consistent with previous reports in the literature dealing with studies of muscle stimulation or exercise. Blood pH was significantly decreased after exposure, but subsequently returned to baseline levels. Lactate was highly elevated and remained somewhat increased even after three hrs. Serum myoglobin was increased after exposure and remained elevated for the 3 -h follow-up period. Acidosis {{would appear to be}} one of the major concerns with long-duration (e. g., several min) exposures over a short period of time. Even with the extre-mely low pH immediately after exposure, all animals survived. On the basis of these results, further development of useful continuous-exposure electronic control devices is at least feasible, with the caveat that some medical moni-toring of subjects may be required...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se com este estudo caracterizar a anatomia do sistema porta renal e verificar sua influência sobre o protocolo anestésico xilazina, tiletamina e <b>zolazepam</b> na contenção de avestruzes, por comparação da administração dos fármacos nos músculos da perna ou da asa. Em cinco animais foi injetado látex nas veias femorais no sentido de drenagem e, posteriormente, as aves foram fixadas em formol a 10 %, por 72 horas. Em uma ave, procedeu-se à localização, colheita e fixação das valvas portais renais em formol a 10 %. O sistema porta renal apresentou-se constituído por duas veias portais renais craniais, duas veias portais renais caudais e seis valvas portais renais. Na contenção química, seis avestruzes foram pré-tratados com xilazina (1 mg kg- 1) e, decorridos 10 minutos, receberam tiletamina/zolazepam (6 mg kg- 1). Os animais foram manipulados em duas ocasiões diferentes, sendo que na primeira anestesia o protocolo foi administrado nos músculos da base das asas (GI) e, após 15 dias, os mesmos animais receberam o protocolo nos músculos das pernas (GII). Os períodos de latência, hábil e de recuperação não foram diferentes entre os grupos (P> 0, 05). A freqüência cardíaca permaneceu abaixo dos valores basais durante a anestesia (P This {{study was}} aimed at characterizing the anatomy of the renal portal system, and {{determining}} its influence on the anesthetic protocol xylazine, tiletamine and <b>zolazepam,</b> in the restraint of ostriches, compared with the administration of drugs into the leg or wing muscles. Latex was injected into the femoral veins of five animals, for drainage purposes, and the birds were then fixed in 10 % formaldehyde, for 72 hours. In one bird, the renal portal valves were located, collected and fixed in 10 % formaldehyde. The renal portal system consisted of two cranial renal portal veins, two caudal renal portal veins, and six renal portal valves. In the chemical restraint, six ostriches were anesthetized with xylazine (1 mg kg- 1) and after 10 minutes, tiletamine/zolazepam (6 mg kg- 1). The animals were handled on two different occasions: in the first anesthesia, the protocol was administered into the muscles {{at the base of}} the wings (GI) and after 15 days, the same animals received the protocol in the leg muscles (GII). The periods for the onset and duration of the anesthesia, and recovery, showed no difference between the groups (P> 0. 05). The heart rate remained below the basal values during the anesthesia (P< 0. 05), in both groups. The cloacal temperature increased in both groups, particularly in GII, leading to an increased respiratory rate to facilitate heat loss. Since the chemical restraint was adapted for procedures of short duration in the field in the ostriches of both groups, it was not possible to demonstrate the influence of the renal portal system...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{mechanisms to}} circannual changes in body mass of bears {{have yet to}} be elucidated. We hypothesized that the Japanese black bear (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) has a metabolic mechanism that efficiently converts carbohydrates into body fat by altering insulin sensitivity during the hyperphagic stage before hibernation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the changes in blood biochemical values and glucose and insulin responses to intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) during the active season (August, early and late November). Four, adult, female bears (5 - 17 years old) were anesthetized with 6 mg/kg TZ (tiletamine HCl and <b>zolazepam</b> HCl) in combination with 0. 1 mg/kg acepromazine maleate. The bears were injected intravenously with glucose (0. 5 g/kg of body mass), and blood samples were obtained before, at, and intermittently after glucose injection. The basal triglycerides concentration decreased significantly with increase in body mass from August to November. Basal levels of plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations were not significantly different among groups. The results of IVGTT demonstrated the increased peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in early November. In contrast, peripheral insulin resistance was indicated by the exaggerated insulin response in late November. Our findings suggest that bears shift their glucose and lipid metabolism from the stage of normal activity to the hyperphagic stage in which they show lipogenicpredominant metabolism and accelerate glucose uptake by increasing the peripheral insulin sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The anesthetics can {{differently}} {{affect the}} structure and biological function of tissues and systems. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of three injectable anesthetics generally used in experiments with animals on the degree of haemolysis and glycogenolysis after deep anesthesia. 20 Wistar male rats (330 - 440 g) were used. The animals were divided into three groups: Cloral Hydrate (CH), Ketamine + Xylazine (KX), Zoletil 50 ® (<b>zolazepam</b> and tiletamina) + Xylazine (ZTX). After deep anesthesia the total blood was collected. Immediately the liver, the white and red gastrocnemius muscles were also withdrawn. The degree of serum haemolysis was quantified by the hemoglobin concentration (g/dL) and the hepatic and muscular glycogen concentration through spectrophotometer analyses. The CH and KX groups presented serum haemolysis (0. 49 ± 0. 06 g/dL and 0. 18 ± 0. 06 g/dL, respectively). ZTX group presented no detectable values. The average value of the hepatic and muscular glycogen concentrations exhibited no significant difference between CH and ZTX groups. The data were similar to other studies in the literature. However, the KX induced accentuated glycogenolysis in all tissues. Our data suggest that the anesthetic ZTX seems to be the most appropriate for studies that need simultaneously to quantify the concentration of glycogen and blood markers without interferences. It neither causes glycogenolysis nor haemolysis. ZTX possesses accessible cost, is easily found at veterinary markets, quickly induces deep anesthesia and presents low mortality rate...|$|E
40|$|Nine wild Bornean leopard cats were anesthetized using a {{combination}} of tiletamine and <b>zolazepam</b> (Zoletil©) after being captured in humanely-designed live traps in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, for the purpose of fitting radio-collars. For five leopard cats (group 1) a single dose of 6. 92 ± 1. 06 mg/kg of Zoletil © was administered. The mean induction time from the initial Zoletil © dose was 7. 9 ± 1. 77 minutes, and the mean anesthesia time was 47. 2 ± 25. 1. For 4 leopard cats (group 2) after an initial mean dose of 6. 92 ± 1. 06 mg/kg of Zoletil©, it was necessary to administer a second dose (or booster) of Zoletil © (mean dose 2. 6 ± 0. 33 mg/kg) or ketamine (mean dose 3. 5 ± 0. 05 mg / kg) to achieve complete immobilization. There were differences between the periods of anesthesia resulting from these boosters, which were 43. 5 ± 2. 1 minutes for ketamine and 89. 5 ± 6. 36 minutes for Zoletil©. We conclude that an initial dose of Zoletil © of 6. 92 mg/kg can produce an adequate plane of anaesthesia without needing additional or booster injections of anaesthetic; if a booster is required, the use of ketamine in preference to Zoletil © has the benefit of shorter release times (245 minutes for ketamine booster compared to 350 minutes for Zoletil © booster) whilst providing adequat...|$|E
40|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the {{anaesthetic}} agents tiletamine and <b>zolazepam</b> have antioxidant or pro-oxidant effects. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the effects of tiletamine-zolazepam anaesthesia on oxidant/antioxidant status in blood plasma and on haematological parameters in 10 healthy Awassi ewes. The tiletamine-zolazepam combination was administrated in a dose of 7. 5 mg/kg intramuscularly. The animals were spontaneously breathing air during the procedure. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture before induction and at 30, 60, 120 min, 24 h and 3 days after anaesthesia. Malondialdehyde concentration, an index of lipid peroxidation, was higher at 30, 60, 120 min and 24 h (P < 0. 05) than the baseline value in the plasma. The level of glutathione decreased (P < 0. 05) at 30, 60 and 120 min, then returned to the baseline level. Beta-carotene concentration was lower (P < 0. 05) than the baseline value during anaesthesia with the exception of its level at 120 min. Glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities decreased (P < 0. 05) at the onset of anaesthesia, then returned to baseline values. There was no significant change in vitamin A level. Red blood cell count, haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) only at 30 min and thereafter they gradually returned to the baseline values. Based on the results tiletamine-zolazepam anaesthesia seems to accelerate lipid peroxidation and to impair the enzymatic antixoidant defence in the blood plasma...|$|E
40|$|Background: Establishment of {{haematological}} and biochemical reference intervals {{is important}} to assess health of animals on individual and population level. Reference intervals for 13 haematological and 34 biochemical variables were established based on 88 apparently healthy free-ranging brown bears (39 males and 49 females) in Sweden. The animals were chemically immobilised by darting from a helicopter {{with a combination of}} medetomidine, tiletamine and <b>zolazepam</b> in April and May 2006 – 2012 in the county of Dalarna, Sweden. Venous blood samples were collected during anaesthesia for radio collaring and marking for ecological studies. For each of the variables, the reference interval was described based on the 95 % confidence interval, and differences due to host characteristics sex and age were included if detected. To our knowledge, this is the first report of reference intervals for free-ranging brown bears in Sweden. Results: The following variables were not affected by host characteristics: red blood cell, white blood cell, monocyte and platelet count, alanine transaminase, amylase, bilirubin, free fatty acids, glucose, calcium, chloride, potassium, and cortisol. Age differences were seen {{for the majority of the}} haematological variables, whereas sex influenced only mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, aspartate aminotransferase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase, β -globulin, bile acids, triglycerides and sodium. Conclusions: The biochemical and haematological reference intervals provided and the differences due to host factors age and gender can be useful for evaluation of health status in free-ranging European brown bear...|$|E
