5|$|Eight {{different}} receivers {{caught at}} least one pass, with Dexton Fields leading all receivers in the game with sevencatches for 101yards. Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able to <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E

25|$|Omnioculars are a pair {{of magical}} brass {{binoculars}} used by Harry, Ron and Hermione in the fourth book during the Quidditch World Cup. Omnioculars, besides having the magnification capabilities of binoculars, have many other useful features. For example, {{they have the ability}} to slow down or replay something seen through the lenses, although a side effect is that the view in the lenses is not current and can lead to confusion as to the state of the match. They also have a play-by-play feature, where the names of moves performed by Quidditch players is shown in bright purple letters across the Omnioculars' lenses.

25|$|The 100 Confederate cannons {{lining the}} top of the ridge {{initially}} hit few of their enemies during the Union rush, but once the Union soldiers stopped at the rifle pits, they began to <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> them. The Confederate riflemen also poured in their fire causing several Union casualties. After several minutes, some Union unit commanders moved their men forward {{to get out of the}} worst fire. Willich's skirmishers started advancing up the ridge without orders. Deciding that following them was preferable to being massacred in the rifle pits, Willich gave orders to advance, although several of his units were already doing so. Seeing this, Hazen and Beatty also ordered their first lines up. When Wood reached the rifle pits, the men in the second line begged him to order them up as well. Wood sent them forward.|$|E
2500|$|Mitrailleuses {{were used}} {{in many of the}} major engagements of the war, but their small numbers greatly {{restricted}} their effectiveness. Their flawed usage was a serious problem on the battlefield. While the mitrailleuses were inherently accurate, in a ballistic sense, they were often unable to <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> targets quickly enough at great distances. Individual 25 round salvos were also too tightly grouped and lacked lateral dispersion. To make matters worse, the complex firing mechanism was vulnerable to damage at the hands of inexperienced crews. [...] Fouling of the mechanism by black powder combustion residues and thus difficulties in closing the breech were reported as a problem after prolonged firings.|$|E
