2500|$|The croconate anion forms {{hydrated}} crystalline coordination compounds with divalent cations {{of transition}} metals, with general formula M(C5O5)·3H2O; where M stands for copper (yielding a brown solid), iron (dark purple), <b>zinc</b> (<b>yellow),</b> nickel (green), manganese (dark green), or cobalt (purple). [...] These complexes {{all have the}} same orthorombic crystal structure, consisting of chains of alternating croconate and metal ions. [...] Each croconate is bound to the preceding metal by one oxygen atom, and to the next metal through its two opposite oxygens, leaving two oxygens unbound. [...] Each metal is bound to three croconate oxygens and to one water molecule. [...] Calcium also forms a compound with the same formula (yellow) but the structure appears to be different.|$|E

50|$|Seurat's palette {{consisted}} of the usual pigments of his time such as cobalt blue, emerald green and vermilion. Additionally, Seurat used then new pigment <b>zinc</b> <b>yellow</b> (zinc chromate), predominantly for yellow highlights in the sunlit grass {{in the middle of}} the painting but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments. In the century and more since the painting's completion, the <b>zinc</b> <b>yellow</b> has darkened to brown—a color degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat's lifetime. The discoloration of the originally bright yellow <b>zinc</b> <b>yellow</b> (zinc chromate) to brownish color is due to the chemical reaction of the chromate ions to orange-colored dichromate ions.In the third stage during 1888-89 Seurat added the colored borders to his composition.|$|E
50|$|When {{used as a}} pigment, it {{is known}} as <b>Zinc</b> <b>Yellow,</b> Buttercup Yellow or Yellow 36. It is rarely used in art because the pigment degenerates into a brown color. This effect {{can be seen in}} Georges Seurat's famous {{painting}} A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. The degradation of <b>zinc</b> <b>yellow</b> in Surat's painting was thoroughly investigated and these findings were subsequently employed in a digital rejuvenation of the painting.|$|E

50|$|For his oil {{paintings}} on canvas, Aimé Morot had {{a preference for}} a colour palette consisting of silver white, <b>zinc</b> white, <b>yellow</b> ochre, red ochre, cadmium yellow, cadmium red, raw sienna, burnt sienna, cobalt blue, emerald green, rose madder, carmine lake and ivory black. His painting medium consisted of oil mixed with some turpentine or sometimes with copal. He would start his painting by making a rough outline of the entire subject on a well-dried oiled canvas using a brush or charcoal, then applied the paint. When the completed painting had dried for a long time, he finally applied light varnish.|$|R
40|$|Two <b>zinc</b> violets, the <b>yellow</b> {{form of the}} Aachen–Liège {{area and}} the blue morph of Blankenrode in western Westphalia, have very {{restricted}} occurrence on heavy metal waste heaps. Their taxonomic affinities have not been finally resolved. The flower micromorphological analysis presented here indicates that both zinc violets {{are closely related to}} the alpine Viola lutea, in line with our earlier published molecular data, but not with the conclusions of other authors. The zinc violets are classed at the rank of subspecies as V. lutea: ssp. calaminaria for the <b>yellow</b> <b>zinc</b> violet and ssp. westfalica for its blue counterpart. Although the violets examined (V. lutea, V. lutea ssp. calaminaria, V. lutea ssp. westfalica) are closely related, {{there is no evidence that}} V. lutea ssp. westfalica is a descendent of V. tricolor.

50|$|Zinc {{compound}}s, {{like those}} of main group elements, are mostly colourless. Exceptions occur when the compound contains a coloured anion or ligand. However, zinc selenide and zinc telluride are both coloured due to charge-transfer processes. <b>Zinc</b> oxide turns <b>yellow</b> when heated due {{to the loss of}} some oxygen atoms and formation of a defect structure. Compounds containing zinc are typically diamagnetic, except in cases where the ligand is a radical.|$|R
50|$|However, these testing {{standards}} neither provide information of testing periods for the coatings to be evaluated, nor {{the appearance of}} corrosion products in form of salts. Requirements are agreed between customer and manufacturer. In the automotive industry requirements are specified under material specifications. Different coatings have different behavior in salt spray test and consequently, test duration will differ from one type of coating to another. For example, a typical electroplated <b>zinc</b> and <b>yellow</b> passivated steel part lasts 96 hours in salt spray test without white rust. Electroplated zinc-nickel steel parts can last more than 720 hours in NSS test without red rust (or 48 hours in CASS test without red rust) Requirements are established in test duration (hours) and coatings shall comply with minimum testing periods.|$|R
30|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} measurements led to {{the identification}} of chrome yellow {{in each of the}} five investigated yellow spots. Nevertheless, the MA-XRF results showed that the composition of the yellow earrings and the yellow fabric behind Suzanne Bambridge, notably differs from the ones found in the pale yellow features in the dress (suggesting floral elements). In the first case, the yellow colour primarily consists of a cadmium <b>zinc</b> sulphide/chrome <b>yellow</b> mixture, while the yellow features painted over the dress are made of lead white and barium sulphate, admixed with only very low amounts of chrome yellow, and no cadmium yellow. Prussian blue and barite mixed with casein were identified by ATR-FTIR in the sample taken from the greyish layer partially covering the rounded pale yellow item, painted over the dress on the left side (Sample 14 in Additional file 1 : Table S 1).|$|R

5000|$|The Mitchell was an {{exceptionally}} sturdy aircraft that could withstand tremendous punishment. One B-25C of the 321st Bomb Group was nicknamed [...] "Patches" [...] because its crew chief painted all the aircraft's flak hole patches with the bright <b>yellow</b> <b>zinc</b> chromate primer. By {{the end of}} the war, this aircraft had completed over 300 missions, had been belly-landed six times and had over 400 patched holes. The airframe of [...] "Patches" [...] was so distorted from battle damage that straight-and-level flight required 8° of left aileron trim and 6° of right rudder, causing the aircraft to [...] "crab" [...] sideways across the sky.|$|R
5000|$|More complex was {{a system}} {{built into the}} CH displays, {{implemented}} in order to remove spurious signals from unsynchronized jamming pulses. It consisted of two layers of phosphor in the CRT screen, a quick-reacting layer of zinc sulphide below, and a slower [...] "afterglow" [...] layer of zinc cadmium sulphide on top. During normal operation the bright blue signal from the zinc sulphide was visible, and its signal would activate the <b>yellow</b> <b>zinc</b> cadmium sulphide layer, causing an [...] "averaged" [...] signal to be displayed in yellow. To filter out jamming pulses, a yellow plastic sheet was {{placed in front of}} the display, rendering the blue display invisible and revealing the dimmer yellow averaged signal. This is the reason many radars from the War through to the 1960s have yellow displays.|$|R
30|$|In {{previous}} publications, {{the authors}} have demonstrated the unique value of the Winsor & Newton (W&N) 19 th century archive database for providing efficient access to records covering the commercial preparation of 19 th century artists’ materials [23, 24]. Following the methodology established {{for the study of}} W&N’s lead chromate yellow pigments [25], this paper investigates the preparation and chemistry of barium, zinc and strontium chromate pigments. During the 19 th century, these pigments were sold by W&N under the trade names Lemon Yellow (barium chromate), Citron <b>Yellow</b> (<b>zinc</b> potassium chromate) and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate). According to Carlyle, who studied the powders and oil colours available in the W&N 19 th century catalogues, the first was listed in c. 1835 while the latter two appeared {{for the first time in}} a catalogue from c. 1861. Strontian Yellow last appeared in a catalogue from c. 1896 [5].|$|R

2500|$|Tropic Green system: Through 1942 the Camouflage Section {{had issued}} no {{instructions}} for landing craft, PT boats, Tank Landing Ships (LSTs) and other vessels expected to operate close inshore in Pacific jungle conditions, so individual commands resorted to overall green, or ad-hoc camouflage patterns in whatever green or brown paints could be obtained. In early 1943 BuShips began the development a green series {{parallel to the}} blue-gray series, but the process was slow and therefore the South Pacific Command as an expedient ordered its amphibious vessels to be repainted in Dark Tropic Green with [...] "tiger stripes" [...] in Light Tropic Green, both {{of which could be}} created by mixing standard 5-TMa blue tinting medium with <b>yellow</b> <b>zinc</b> chromate primer. According to a contemporary report, [...] "The color of the foliage [...] was surprisingly high in key, a brilliance that would have been unbelievable except for the very same observations made on first arrival in the Solomons group." ...|$|R
30|$|Access to the {{production}} records from W&N’s 19 th century archive database {{made it possible to}} carry out a comprehensive study of their manufacturing processes for yellow chromate pigments based on barium (BaCrO 4), zinc (4 ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O· 3 H 2 O) and strontium (SrCrO 4). One hundred and three production records were found for the manufacture of Lemon Yellow (barium chromate, 69 %), Citron <b>Yellow</b> (<b>zinc</b> potassium chromate, 25 %) and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate, 6 %). The majority covers the period between 1838 and 1871. Analysis of W&N’s production records indicates that one main synthetic pathway was found for each pigment. The pH was a key factor controlled by W&N to achieve precipitation of zinc potassium and strontium chromate pigments. There was no evidence that extenders were added during the synthesis of these pigments, whereas their production records for lead chromates do show the addition of extenders [25]. The lack of extenders for these pigments may infer that for W&N, extenders were primarily present to adjust physical properties, tinting strength or hue, rather than functioning predominantly as a means to reduce the cost of materials. The relative tinting strength (TS) of these pigments is lower than pure lead chromate pigments. It was calculated in comparison to pure lead chromate (PbCrO 4,) which was assigned a TS of 100 %. This resulted in a TS of 92 % for barium, 78 % for strontium and 65 % for zinc potassium chromate pigments.|$|R
