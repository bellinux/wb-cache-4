The spindle air pressure direction was changed in both Z and S directions on the <b>Z</b> <b>twist</b> yarn of Ne 40 s Polyester/Cotton vortex yarn (50 : 50 polyester: cotton) and these yarns were then tested for their properties such as tensile, unevenness, and hairiness.

We point out that {{in some of the}} models with non-zero B-field there are extra tensor multiplets in the <b>Z</b> 2 <b>twisted</b> closed string sector, and we explain their origin in a simple example.
