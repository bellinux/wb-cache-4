Polymers used were poly(methy) methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(hydroxyethy) methacrylate) (PHEMA) and copolymers of MMA or HEMA with either 15 % methacrylic acid (MAA) or 15 % trimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-HCl salt (TMAEMA-CI). Bacterial and polymer surfaces were characterized by means of water contact angles and <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials.</b> Both the sessile drop contact angles and the <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> of the bacterial surfaces were significantly different. No significant differences in the sessile drop contact angles of the polymer surfaces were observed. Using the Wilhelmy plate technique large contact angle hysteresis was observed for the different polymer surfaces. Surfaces of copolymers with MAA had more negative <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> than those of the corresponding homopolymers. Surfaces of copolymers with TMAEMA-CI had positive <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials.</b> The highest numbers of adherent bacteria were found on materials with positive <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials,</b> irrespective of the bacterial strain used.

40|$|Runoff from {{beef cattle}} feedlots is {{one source of}} {{potential}} water pollution. Two alternatives are available to prevent feedlot runoff from polluting streams; the water can be spread on agricultural land as irrigation water, {{or it can be}} treated before it is released to the streams. <b>Zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> on colloidal solids in feedlot water samples were investigated as one method of treatment control. To study the problem in the laboratory, samples of the feedlot surface material were obtained. The samples were mixed and frozen until used. All determinations were made using commercially available equipment in a temperature controlled room held at 70 ˚ F ± 1 ˚ F. A statistical model was developed to define quadratic equations for three variables. Multiple regression analyses resulted in three quadratic equations to define three separate relationships. <b>Zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> were found to average - 29. 5 millivolts on untreated samples. The potentials varied with pH and solids concentration according to theory. Two different chemical treatments were tested to control the <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> on the colloids. Alum effectively reduced the <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials.</b> The dosage required was high, and depended on solids concentration. As the solids concentration was reduced, lower dosages could be used to obtain similar charge reductions. One organic polyelectrolyte was tested. It was more effective than alum in reducing the charges. The dosage of polyelectrolyte required depended on solids concentration as alum did. The more important conclusions deduced from this study of suspended solids from a beef cattle feedlot surface were: 1) The <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> of the solids were negative and varied with pH and sample dilutions. 2) Particle <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> could be controlled by chemical treatments. 3) High chemical dosages were required to reduce the <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> to near the isoelectric point. 4) Quadratic equations could be written to accurately define the relationships between <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials,</b> solids concentrations, and pH; and <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials,</b> chemical dosages, and solids concentrations.

50|$|The <b>zeta</b> <b>potential</b> {{is a key}} {{indicator}} of the stability of colloidal dispersions. The magnitude of the <b>zeta</b> <b>potential</b> indicates the degree of electrostatic repulsion between adjacent, similarly charged particles in a dispersion. For molecules and particles that are small enough, a high <b>zeta</b> <b>potential</b> will confer stability, i.e., the solution or dispersion will resist aggregation. When the potential is small, attractive forces may exceed this repulsion and the dispersion may break and flocculate. So, colloids with high <b>zeta</b> <b>potential</b> (negative or positive) are electrically stabilized while colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate as outlined in the table.|$|E

30|$|The {{variations}} of the Dhs and <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> of the empty micelles and DOX-loaded micelles were investigated from the facile pH adjusting. As shown in Figure  6, when decreasing pH from 10 to 2, the Dhs and <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> increased gradually followed by abrupt descend because the micelles underwent shrinking-swelling-dissociating conformational transition. The Dhs of the micelles showed slightly increase owing to incorporation of DOX molecules {{in the core of}} micelles compared to the empty micelles. At higher pH above 8, both micelles were in a compact, collapsed form with the Dhs remained almost constant because the PDEA segments were deprotonated. And the <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> at higher pH (like pH  10) were negative with increasing OH− in the solution. As the pH values were ranging from 8 to 4, both micelles exhibited the gradually stretched conformation with significant increase of Dhs and <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> due to gradual protonation of DEA block and the increasing hydrophilicity of PDEA. At pH[*]<[*] 4, the Dhs and <b>zeta</b> <b>potentials</b> of both micelle solutions showed sharp decrease, indicating that the PDEA segments were fully protonated with imparting a hydrophilic characteristic and the extremely strong electrostatic repulsion between polymer chains, which might cause the decrease of the aggregation number of the polymers or even slight dissociation of the micelle structures [29].|$|R

As microbial adhesion is a complicated interplay of long-range van der Waals and electrostatic forces and various short-range interactions, the above statement only holds when the MATH lest is carried out under conditions where the interacting surfaces are uncharged.
