40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} compress irregularly sampled height-fields based on a multi-resolution framework. Unlike many other height-field compression techniques, no resampling is required so the original height-field data is recovered (less quantization error). The method decomposes the compression task into two complementary phases: an in-plane compression scheme for (x, y) coordinate positions, and a separate multi-resolution <b>z</b> <b>compression</b> step. This decoupling allows subsequent improvements in either phase to be seamlessly integrated and also allows for independent control of bit-rates in the decoupled dimensions, should this be desired. Results are presented {{for a number of}} height-field sample sets quantized to 12 bits for each of x and y, and 10 bits for z. Total lossless encoded data sizes range from 11 to 24 bits per point, with z bit-rates lying in the range 2. 9 to 8. 1 bits per z coordinate. Lossy z bit-rates (we do not lossily encode x and y) lie in the range 0. 7 to 5. 9 bits per z coordinate, with a worst-case root-mean-squared (RMS) error of less than 1. 7 % of the z range. Even with aggressive lossy encoding, at least 40 % of the point samples are perfectly reconstructed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The five {{pneumatic}} compression devices (PCDs) {{that are}} marketed provide mechanical protection from {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT). They differ with respect to patterns of compression {{and the length of}} the sleeve. Evidence linking differences to clinical outcomes is lacking. Our purpose was twofold: to evaluate each of the marketed PCDs with respect to effectiveness, compliance, and patient and nursing satisfaction and to determine whether there is a clinical basis for the selection of one device over another. Methods: Each of the marketed devices was used exclusively for a 4 -week period. Patients participated in an evaluation including venous duplex ultrasound scan, DVT risk assessment, and device evaluation. Vascular laboratory records were used to document DVT. Compliance was measured by meters installed on all pumps. A ranking matrix was stratified by compression pattern: rapid graduated sequential compression, graduated compression, and intermittent compression, and each device was rated by patients and nurses. Results: The PCDs were used in 1350 cases with a DVT rate of 3. 5 % ranging from 2 % to 9. 8 % depending on the method of compression. Patients with DVT were older (58 vs 54 years), had better compliance (67 % vs 50 %), and had more compression days (11 vs 7. 2). When thigh-length sleeves were used, a greater proportion of DVT occurred in the proximal segments (71 %) as compared with the number of proximal DVT when the calf-length devices were used (52 %; P =. 21). Devices W, X, and Y had comparable rates of DVT, which were lower than those for V and <b>Z.</b> <b>Compression</b> device Y, with calf and thigh sleeves, achieved the best overall ranking largely because of high scores for patient and nurse satisfaction. Conclusion: Our data appear at odds with commonly held beliefs. We were unable to show a difference in DVT incidence based on the length of the device or the method of compression. Randomized studies are needed to confirm our findings and evaluate hypotheses derived from this study. (J Vasc Surg 2001; 34 : 459 - 64. ...|$|E

The Hilbert compression exponent of G is the supremum over all $\alpha\ge 0 $ such that there exists a Lipschitz mapping $f:G\to L_ 2 $ and a constant $c> 0 $ such that for all $x,y\in G$ we have $\|f(x) -f(y) \|_ 2 \ge cd(x,y) ^\alpha. $ In \cite{AGS 06 } it was shown that the Hilbert compression exponent of the wreath product $\Z\bwr \Z $ is at most $\frac 34 $, and in \cite{NP 07 } was proved that this exponent is at least $\frac 23 $.

40|$|The linear exp 6 {{isotherm}} {{is presented}} as an approach to the thermodynamic properies of liquid alkali metals over the whole liquid range including metal-nonmetal transition. The exp 6 pair interaction potential is applied to approach the underlying interplay between the characteristic soft repulsive intercation in dense, large attractive interaction in the expanded liquid alkali metal and the observed thermodynamic properties. PVT of dense liquid alkali metals obey the linear exp 6 isotherm (Z- 1) V 2 =A+Br- 7 / 3 exp{a(1 -Cr- 1 / 3 /rm) } over {{the whole range of}} liquid densities, where <b>Z</b> is the <b>compression</b> factor, r= 1 /V is the density, rm is the position of potential minimum, a is a parameter, and C is constant. The intercept A and the slope B significantly are related to attraction and repulsion, repectively, and both depend on temperature. At the level of theory presented in this work, the thermodynamic effects caused by the polarization of atoms in expanded liquid alkali metals can be accounted for by exp 6 potential function to demonestrat their thermodynamic properties as normal liquids. This incluids the metal-nonmetal tarnsition in which case the nature of forces are changed {{in such a way that}} the thermodynamic properties would be different from those of the high-density region. In particular the equation state for molten cesium is analytical over the whole range of liquid densities. The linear exp 6 isotherm is used to estimate the binding energy (0. 0733 eV) and the position of potential minimum (0. 5336 A) of liquid cesium st freezing temparature.

(some col.) A conventional accumulator stores energy for hydraulic systems by compressing an enclosed mass of air, but this air takes {{up too much}} volume at low pressure to be practical in applications such as a hydraulic hybrid passenger vehicle. An open accumulator compresses air from the atmosphere to store energy, eliminating the need to store low-pressure air but creating large temperature swings if the heat transfer during compression and expansion is poor. This thesis investigates thermodynamic and heat transfer aspects of an open accumulator to assist in its design. A thermodynamic model was created to determine the efficiency and required heat transfer for open accumulator designs with a volume 1 / 5 th that of a comparable conventional, or “closed,” accumulator. A heat transfer parameter, Z = hA/V, describes how easy {{it would be to}} implement the required heat transfer, with low required values of Z being desirable. A design with only one stage of compression and high wall temperature had a lower required value for Z than the high pressure stages in multi-stage designs. For an open accumulator that provides 20 kW of power in expansion and 840 kJ of energy storage at a pressure of 350 times atmospheric conditions, the volume target was 15. 7 ℓ and the required <b>Z</b> values for <b>compression</b> and expansion were approximately 6. 2 × 104 W/m 3 K. A computational fluid dynamics model using the program FLUENT was created to investigate whether the required Z could be achieved in a more practical, three-stage open accumulator design. The expansion case of the lowest-pressure stage was simulated, with a required Z value from the thermodynamic model of 3. 83 × 104 W/m 3 K. The iv computational domain was a symmetrical, 3 -D, diaphragm-bounded chamber of approximately 0. 5 ℓ displaced volume, and a realizable k-ε model was used to model the effects of turbulence. The flow pattern generated during the air intake period dominated the flow during expansion, and peak local heat fluxes occurred where the intake flow patterns drew cold fluid next to the walls. The peak heat transfer for the simulation was 386 W. The mean Z value calculated was 9. 79 × 103 W/m 3 K, around 1 / 4 th of the required value...|$|R
40|$|Validation of {{material}} models {{in a variety}} of scientific and technological applications requires accurate data regarding the high-pressure thermodynamic and mechanical properties. Traditional laboratory techniques for striking these measurements involve light gas guns to generate the required thermodynamic states, and the use of high-resolution time-resolved diagnostics to measure the desired material properties. EOS and constitutive material properties of importance to modeling needs include high-pressure Hugoniot curves and off-Hugoniot properties, such as. material strength and isentropic compression and decompression [1]. Conventional light gas guns are limited to impact pressures of about 7 Mbar in high-impedance materials. Pulsed radiation sources, such as high-intensity lasers, and pulsed power techniques significantly extend the accessible pressures and are becoming accepted methods for meeting the needs {{of material}} models in regimes inaccessible by gas guns. A present limitation of these new approaches is that samples must necessarily be small, typically a few tens of microns in thickness, which severely limits the accuracy of EOS measurements that can be made and also the ability to perform a variety of off-Hugoniot measurements. However, recent advances in z-pinch techniques for high-pressure material response studies provide potential opportunities for achieving accuracies comparable with gas guns because of the significantly larger samples that can be studied. Sample thicknesses approaching 1 mm may be possible with advances presently being made. These sample dimensions are comparable with gas gun sample dimensions so that accuracies should be comparable. The Sandia Z accelerator [2] is a recently developed facility that generates x-ray energies of about 2 MJ over time scales of 5 - 10 ns with resulting temperatures of 100 - 150 eV in containment fixtures, referred to as hohlraums, that are a few cubic centimeters in volume. This intense radiation source can be used to ablatively drive shock waves to about pressures of about 10 Mbar {{in a variety of}} materials. Because of the large source. In this paper, we discuss recent developments {{in the use of the}} Sandia Z accelerator for Hugoniot and off-Hugoniot measurements. Preliminary data on high-pressure dynamic response include Hugoniot EOS data on aluminum to about 5 Mbar using the z-pinch technique and isentropic compression data on iron and copper to about 300 and 130 kbar, respectively, using the direct current mode on <b>Z.</b> The isentropic <b>compression</b> experiments are performed on sample thicknesses to 0. 8 mm and allow determination of the cx-s phase transition and the kinetic properties of this transition. Specifically, isentropic compression data on iron have been analyzed with a two-phase rate dependent model of the bcc-hcp phase transition, which shows that the relatively slow rates of pressure application achieved with this technique result in observable kinetic effects that can be easily analyzed. Other work in progress with the Z Accelerator includes EOS studies of liquid deutenum and the development of uniform, constant pressure drives that will provide higher accuracy in EOS measurements...|$|R
