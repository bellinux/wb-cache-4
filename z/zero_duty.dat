40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an optimum switching pattern {{for the space}} vector modulation (SVM) of matrix converters based on a genetic algorithm. The possibility of choosing the sequence of active duty cycles, {{and the ability to}} allocate the duration of the inactive duty cycle to each one of the <b>zero</b> <b>duty</b> cycles in a matrix converter SVM, provide some degrees of freedom in designing of the switching pattern. This leads to an optimization problem. Therefore, a suitable genetic algorithm for solving the switching pattern optimization problem is adopted, and an objective function to minimize the weighted total harmonic distortion (WTHD) and the low-order harmonics of the output voltage is proposed. Simulations in Matlab/Simulink confirm the validity of analytical achievements. Keywords- Matrix converter; space vector modulation (SVM); switching pattern; gentic algorithms (GA) I...|$|E

The 22 experiments were performed as the following values with six replicates of centre point: flow rate (0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 L/min), duty cycle (0, 20, and 40), amplitude (2, 6, and 10), and treatment time (10, 35, and 60 min). The FFD was employed as preliminary screening in shake flask cultivation to choose the significant factors (P< 0. 05) for further optimisation process. In this study, <b>zero</b> <b>duty</b> cycle signified non-sonication of amplitude and no treatment time effect to the E. coli culture.

40|$|Objectives: The Hong Kong Government {{removed the}} duties on wine and beer in 2008, {{so as to}} make the city as {{international}} wine trading hub. This article looks into the public health implication of <b>zero</b> <b>duty</b> policy. This article reviewed the relevant papers narratively and made critical appraisal accordingly. Background: On the Budget Day of 27 February 2008, the Financial Secretary announced the removal of duties on wine and beer, and made it immediately effective through an executive order under the Public Revenue Protection Ordinance. The wine duty had been decreased from 40 % to 0 %, and beer duty, as well as, duty on any liquors with alcoholic content less than 30 %, had been decreased from 20 % to 0 %. Stimulated by the drop in alcohol price, the consequences of expected increase in alcohol consumption were worrying. According to a U. K. study, alcohol was ranked the most harmful drugs due to its easy accessibility. [7] Study conducted by Department of Health of Hong Kong [31] pointed out that several public health and social problems arisen in recent years. For instance, the number of alcohol-related admissions to hospitals under Hospital Authority had increased since 2007 and the number of sexually assaulted victims under the influence of drug or alcohol had recorded a drastic rise since 2005. The policy did bring economic interests, but the resulting public health problems should be worth attending to when public health advocacy was not strong. Methods: Narrative review and critical appraisal were done on several papers related to the alcoholic tax describing both Hong Kong situation and foreign countries. The keywords to sort out the papers were “Tax” and “Alcohol”; “Tax” or “Alcohol”; “Taxation” and “Alcohol” and “Taxation” or “Alcohol”. Nine studies were selected and used for this study. Formats of the nine studies ranged from cross-sectional studies to time-series intervention analysis. The nine studies had complementary explanations and associations of each other. This study attempted to synthesize the findings of the nine studies and give relevant review and criticism {{in the context of the}} Hong Kong society. Conclusions: Globalization and regional economic integration, say the establishment of European Union (EU), and other economic interests, such as, the protectionism of wine-grape farmers, had huge influence on the alcohol control policy. The same case was found in Hong Kong. On a contrary to the public health concern, high taxation, which was proven to the most cost-effective measures on alcohol control, was surrendered to economic interests. To combat the influential industry lobby, it was necessary to implement a range of alcohol control interventions including those which were regarded as less cost-effective, say, education and promotion. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

40|$|A revised draft Cancun ministerial {{text was}} {{circulated}} on 24 August by the Chair of the WTO General Council, Carlos Pérez del Castillo. Based {{to a large}} extent on the US- EC paper circulated on 13 August (see below), the revised text provides the WTO countries with a framework for establishing modalities in agriculture with respect to the three pillars (market access, domestic support and export competition). For each pillar, the revised text incorporates a number of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions that were absent in the first draft. In terms of domestic support, the document (viz. Annex A, sections 1. 6 and 1. 7) proposes S&D provisions including: applying lower reductions of trade-distorting domestic support and longer implementation periods (cf. Article 6. 2. of the Agriculture Agreement); exempting developing countries from the requirement to reduce their de minimis levels. As far as the market access pillar is concerned, the Chair recognises that 'developing countries shall have additional flexibility [!;] to designate Special Products' with smaller tariff reductions and no new commitments on Tariff Rates Quotas (cf. section 2. 6). For developing countries, the tariffs reduction would be based either on a three-band Uruguay Round approach or a blend of the Uruguay Round and Swiss formulas, without a <b>zero</b> <b>duty</b> category. The draft text proposes that these Special Products should be determined under certain conditions but these are not elaborated. With regard to the agricultural safeguard mechanism for developing countries, the Chair also says that it would be 'subject to conditions and for products to be determined'. The Chair emphasizes that members would also 'take account of the importance of preferential access for developing countries'. With respect to export competition, the Chair takes up the US-EC proposal to remove export subsidies on some products 'of particular interest for developing countries'. In terms of S&D provisions, developing countries would have the right to exempt certain transport and marketing subsidies from export subsidy reduction (Article 9. 4 of the Agriculture Agreement) until all export subsidies have been phased out by all Members. Furthermore, the text mentions that appropriate provision in favour of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Net Importing Developing Countries (NFIDCs). Other substantial issues are also mentioned in this draft text: recognition of the importance of trade preferences; the sectoral initiative on cotton; the issue of long-term decline and sharp fluctuations in the price of commodities. The Chair also indicates a list of 'issues of interest but not agreed' as introduced by the US-EC proposal including the Green Box criteria, the safeguard measure for developed countries, the implementation periods, the peace clause and non-trade concerns. Comment: In terms of reactions to the draft text, some developing countries (except the Cairns Group) recognise that some progress has been made even if additional S&D provisions are still needed. The EC along with Japan criticise the text saying it goes too far and does not adequately recognise non-trade concerns and the diversity of agriculture. Critics from the Cairns group emphasise that the text does not include the definite elimination of export subsidies or reductions on domestic support by product. Last but not least, the US along with the EC are claiming that less generous level of S&D provisions should apply for advanced developing countries, especially the major net food exporters (including Thailand and India). Even if the revised Cancun ministerial text goes further than the framework given in the US-EC proposal - especially putting the emphasis on the importance of S&D for developing countries - there are still blanks to fill in especially regarding the level of future undertakings (including schedules and figures).

The objective of this research is to determine if a combined system of a positive rate of stamp duty and an annual property tax would better achieve the objective of broadening the tax base with an equal degree of fairness and efficiency A search of the literature was carried out. Interviews with commission members, experts in the area of stamp duty, local taxes and labour mobility were undertaken The research established that stamp duty is an efficient tax but is not sufficiently broadly based leading to unfairness. The annual property tax recommended by the Commission on Taxation is well constructed and in terms of fairness and efficiency compares favourably with similar taxes used in EU peer countries. The recommendation is that stamp duty on principal private residence should remain at a positive rate but that the base should be broadened by the removal of exemptions. The rate for principal private residences should be a reduced rate. The annual property tax as recommended should be introduced with some adjustments to the rate to reflect current economic circumstances.

40|$|Tariffs {{and other}} policy distortions {{typically}} lower real national income relative {{to what it}} {{otherwise would have been}} for any given rate of factor accumulation. Even while lowering real income, however, policy distortions may raise an economy''s real measured growth rate and so, somewhat deceivingly, give the impression that national welfare has benefited from things like tariff protection. This would be an incorrect conclusion. This paper discusses the issue of how protection can affect the rate of growth for a small, open economy. As shown by Johnson (1970), in the presence of exogenously given factor accumulation, tariffs either raise or lower an economy''s growth rate (measured by the change in the value of output at world prices), relative to the no-distortion growth rate. We also discuss the relevance of this result for tariff uniformity, "tariff jumping" foreign direct investment, and the empirical literature on trade and growth. Finally we use a numerical simulation model of Egypt to assess whether the costs of its tax distortions have increased or declined over time.

40|$|This {{discussion}} paper analyses the value chain for sorghum beer in Kenya, from growing Gadam sorghum {{to the production}} and retailing of Senator Keg. The business model developed by Smart Logistics Solutions Ltd. was used to analyze social inclusion in the value chain. A stratified random sample of 300 members and non-members of Smart Logistics groups in eastern Kenya was sampled in the main growing season for sorghum in 2012 - 2013. Based on interviews with major actors, the Value Links methodology was used to map the value chain and quantify value addition {{at different stages of}} the value chain. Analysis of value addition showed that growers received 4 % of the retail price of sorghum beer, Smart Logistics 1 %, EABL 81 %, Senator keg distributors 5 % and Senator keg retailers 9 %. No information was available on intermediate costs or value added for sorghum brewing. Profitability for Smart Logistics depended on volume while, following the imposition of excise duty in 2013, profitability for retailers was negative. The average member of a Smart Logistics group planted 1. 71 acres to sorghum and harvested 483 kg per household of which 305 kg (63 %) was sold. Shortage of land, shortage of labour, and low profitability were reported as the most important constraints on sorghum production. Bird-scaring and threshing were the two most important labour constraints. Ninety percent of group members sold their sorghum to Smart Logistics. The main complaint by members was the time spent waiting for payment. The average time waiting for payment was 4. 5 weeks. Only 5 % of growers were paid within the 1 -week target set by Smart Logistics. On average, members selling to a Smart Logistics collection centre in 2012 sold 342 kg of sorghum at a price of 25 KES/kg, earning KES 8, 550 from sorghum sales. Most income from sorghum was invested in children’s education. Members of Smart Logistics groups spent an average of KES 32, 000 on education per year, of which KES 18, 000 went on university education. Income from sorghum (KES 8, 550) was equivalent to one quarter of annual investment in education. A significantly higher share (83 %) of the members of Smart Logistics groups reported an improvement in their economic position since 2009 compared to non-members (70 %). Members of Smart Logistics groups {{were significantly more likely to}} be headed by women, have high dependency ratios, and own less land per adult family member. Membership was not significantly related to income per head. The main reason given by non-members for not joining a Smart Logistics group was that they did not have time to attend group meetings and meetings at demonstration plots. The price of sorghum beer depends on the level of excise duty. From 2004 Senator Keg enjoyed <b>zero</b> excise <b>duty,</b> making it competitive with illegal brews. As a result, Senator Keg became EABL’s best-selling beer by volume. However, a sharp rise in public expenditure and domestic debt has increased the need for government to raise tax revenues. Following imposition of a 50 % excise duty in 2013, sales of Senator keg have fallen by an estimated 80 %. In the long-term, the future of sorghum beer in Kenya depends on growth in income per head. In the short term, it depends on lower excise duty to make it more affordable for low-income consumers...|$|R
