40|$|International audiencePrevious {{studies show}} that {{pulverized}} rocks observed along large faults can be created by single high-strain rate loadings in the laboratory, provided that the strain rate is higher than a certain pulverization threshold. Such loadings are analogous to large seismic events. In reality, pulverized rocks {{have been subject to}} numerous seismic events rather than one single event. Therefore, the effect of successive " milder " high-strain rate loadings on the pulverization threshold is investigated by applying loading conditions below the initial pulverization threshold. Single and successive loading experiments were performed on quartz-monzonite using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus. Damage-dependent petrophysical properties and elastic moduli were monitored by applying incremental strains. Furthermore, it is shown that the pulverization threshold can be reduced by successive "milder" dynamic loadings from strain rates of ~ 180 s- 1 to ~ 90 s - 1. To do so, it is imperative that the <b>rock</b> experiences dynamic <b>fracturing</b> during the successive loadings prior to pulverization. Combined with loading conditions during an earthquake rupture event, the following generalized fault damage zone structure perpendicular to the fault will develop: furthest from the fault plane, there is a stationary outer boundary that bounds a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> dynamically <b>fractured</b> <b>rocks.</b> Closer to the fault, a pulverization boundary delimits a band <b>of</b> pulverized <b>rock.</b> Consecutive seismic events will cause progressive broadening of the band <b>of</b> pulverized <b>rocks,</b> eventually creating a wider damage zone observed in mature faults...|$|R

Core samples and wireline logs indicate that rock mass properties and in situ fluid properties vary from one unit to another, but that properties are relatively uniform for each unit {{within a particular}} borehole. Variability is superimposed upon the bulk rock mass properties, however, where faults or <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> intersect a borehole. Furthermore, lateral variability within a particular unit may be expected between boreholes and throughout the rock volume. The primary objectives of the work were: to establish a means of determining the spatial heterogeneity and distribution <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass and fluid properties using measurements made on core samples and derived from wireline logs; to determine the spatial heterogeneity and distribution <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass properties away from boreholes and in three-dimensions, by extrapolating the detailed understanding gained from boreholes into the seismic survey volume; {{and to develop a}} visualization model <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass properties in three-dimensions.

40|$|Previously {{formulated}} {{scaling laws}} relating acoustic waveforms in boreholes to frequency, tool size and borehole diameter were investigated by repeated logging {{of the same}} test interval with different frequencies, and by logging adjacent boreholes of different diameters with the same logging system. Acoustic source frequency bands were centered on approximately 15, 20 and 34 kilohertz. Borehole diameters were Band 17 centimeters for test intervals located at depths ranging from 100 to 400 meters in granite. Test intervals included <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> homogeneous <b>rock</b> and <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> that were independently characterized with acoustic televiewer logs and core from the B centimeter borehole. The high frequency transducer produced waveforms dominated by the tube wave mode in the B centimeter borehole, but by a complicated interference pattern produced by the superposition of three normal modes in the 17 centimeter borehole. The two lower frequency transducers produced waveforms in the 17 centimeter diameter borehole with power spectra dominated by the first normal mode. Various methods for picking shear arrivals produced shear velocities {{in close agreement with}} known values for all cases except for the data obtained with the high frequency transducer in the 17 centimeter diameter borehole. This result was attributed to the effects of mode superposition and enhanced attenuation of higher frequencies. Tube wave amplitudes constructed from the data obtained with the higher frequency transducer in the B centimeter borehole provided the most unambiguous indication of open fractures. The superior quality of these amplitude logs was attributed to the strong excitation of tube waves, as opposed to the primary excitation of the first normal mode by the two lower frequency transducers in the 17 centimeter borehole...|$|R
40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological Sciences. During middle Miocene {{extension}} in {{a region}} now occupied by the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California, the Fish Creek Mountains detached from the Vallecito Mountains creating an extensional basin between the two ranges. The detachment surface, now high {{on the slopes of}} the Vallecito Mountains, was a large <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock.</b> With the onset of Gulf of California rifting in latest Miocene time a large earthquake may have initiated the fall <b>of</b> some <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> thus creating the Split Mountain sturzstrom (SMS). The timing of the SMS, in latest Miocene, represents a significant change in the regional paleogeography. Shortly after its deposition the entire region became covered with seawater due to Gulf of California rifting. This resulted in the precipitation of the Fish Creek Gypsum which lies conformably on the SMS. Quaternary uplift has now exposed the SMS displaying features that may be unique to sturzstrom deposits. Visible in several canyons that dissect the proximal and distal SMS are powder injection pipes, sigmoidal rock flows, decapitated stones, and grooved boulders. The SMS occurred approximately 5. 7 million years ago along the northeast margin of the Fish Creek-Vallecito Basin. Paleo-transport indicators show the SMS traveled to the east-southeast indicating a source area to the west. Petrographic analyses <b>of</b> the powdered <b>rock</b> matrix and clasts give a duomictic composition dominated by a foliated biotite tonalite and granodiorite. These match petrographically with rocks collected from the Vallecito Mountain front suggesting the eastern mountain front was the source area. The SMS has an average thickness of 50 meters in the proximal and medial regions and thickens to 75 meters at the toe. Although much of the SMS is missing or covered by overlying sedimentary rocks the exposed area gives an approximate volume of 330 million cubic meters. In some basal exposures in the proximal and distal portions of the SMS there are thin, sinuous, and discontinuous layers of biotite. In the distal SMS this biotite-rich basal zone has small cobbles and gravel-size clasts that have a thin rind of biotite adhering to their outer surfaces. Exposed in the upper surface in distal portion of the SMS are sigmoidal rock flows that display a more coherent sinuous pattern. These structures may be the preserved remnants of vibrational waves that propagated through the SMS during transport. These vibrational waves may have lowered the coefficient of friction aiding the high velocity and extraordinarily long horizontal runout of 11. 7 kilometers. Paleogeographic data show the SMS traveled down entrenched alluvial fan stream channels into Fish Creek Basin where it flowed up a braided stream channel controlled by the east-southeast trend of a plutonic ridge. Paleocurrent indicators in underlying Miocene sandstone in the distal 96 portion indicate that the SMS was traveling uphill as it approached the Fish Creek Mountains. Traveling at a high speed the SMS deflected off the Fish Creek mountains to the northeast coming to a halt in a small basin separating the plutonic ridge and the Fish Creek Mountains...|$|R

OH- 1 was permanently modified by cementing an NQ tubing string in place below a depth of 947 ft. The LCSH- 1 a hole was drilled in Quaternary blue clay {{to a depth of}} 1727 ft and reached a temperature of 193 oF at a depth of 1649 ft. This hole failed to find evidence of a shallow geothermal system east of the Mud Volcano but the conductive temperature profile indicates temperatures near 325 oF could be present below depth of 4000 ft. The LCSH- 5 hole was drilled to a depth of 4727 ft and encountered a significant shallow permeability between depths of 1443 and 1923 ft and below 3955 ft. LCSH- 5 drilled impermeable Quaternary fanglomerate to a depth of 1270 ft. Below 1270 ft the <b>rocks</b> consist primarily <b>of</b> Tertiary sedimentary <b>rocks.</b> The most significant formation deep in LCSH- 5 appears to be a series of poikoilitic mafic lava flows below a depth of 4244 ft that host the major deep permeable fracture encountered. The maximum static temperature deep in LCSH- 5 is 323 oF and the maximum flowing temperature is 329 oF. This hole extended the known length of the geothermal system by ¾ of a mile toward the north and is located over ½ mile north of the northernmost hot spring. The OH- 1 hole was briefly flow tested prior to cementing the NQ rods in place. This flow test confirmed the zone at 947 ft is the dominant permeability in the hole. The waters produced during testing of OH- 1 and LCSH- 5 are generally intermediate in character between the deep geothermal water produced by the Phipps # 2 well and the thermal springs. Geothermometers applied to deeper fluids tend to predict higher subsurface temperatures with the maximum being 382 oF from the Phipps # 2 well. The Lake City geothermal system can be viewed as having shallow (elevation > 4000 ft and temperatures of 270 to 310 oF), intermediate (elevation 2800 to 3700 ft and temperatures 270 to 320 oF) and deep (elevations < 1000 ft and temperatures 323 to 337 oF) components.

40|$|AbstractFracture {{systems have}} strong {{influence}} on the overall mechanical behavior <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> masses due to their relatively lower stiffness and shear strength than those <b>of</b> the <b>rock</b> matrix. Understanding the effects of fracture geometrical distribution, such as length, spacing, persistence and orientation, is important for quantifying the mechanical behavior <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> masses. The relation between fracture geometry and the mechanical characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> mass is complicated {{due to the fact}} that the fracture geometry and mechanical behaviors <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> mass are strongly dependent on the length scale. In this paper, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the effects of fracture distribution on the equivalent continuum elastic compliance <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> masses over a wide range of fracture lengths. To account for the stochastic nature of fracture distributions, three different simulation techniques involving Oda's elastic compliance tensor, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and suitable probability density functions (PDFs) were employed to represent the elastic compliance <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> masses. To yield geologically realistic results, parameters for defining fracture distributions were obtained from different geological fields. The influence of the key fracture parameters and their relations to the overall elastic behavior <b>of</b> the <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> mass were studied and discussed. A detailed study was also carried out to investigate the validity of the use of a representative element volume (REV) in the equivalent continuum representation <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock</b> masses. A criterion was also proposed to determine the appropriate REV given the <b>fracture</b> distribution <b>of</b> the <b>rock</b> mass...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{volumetric}} expansion of freezing pore water is widely {{assumed to be}} a major cause <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>fracture</b> in cold humid regions. Data from experiments simulating natural freezing regimes indicate that bedrock fracture results instead from ice segregation. Fracture depth and timing are also numerically simulated by coupling heat and mass transfer with a fracture model. The depth and geometry of fractures match those in Arctic permafrost and ice-age weathering profiles. This agreement supports a conceptual model in which ice segregation in near-surface permafrost leads progressively to <b>rock</b> <b>fracture</b> and heave, whereas permafrost degradation leads episodically to melt of segregated ice and rock settlemen...|$|R
40|$|Earthquake {{ruptures}} along tectonically active faults nucleate predominantly at {{depths of}} 5 to 12 km in the crust, so the portions of faults that slip in these events cannot be directly observed. The geometry {{and composition of}} seismogenic faults controls the nucleation, propagation and termination of the earthquake rupture process. This study aims to place constraints on the geometry and composition of seismogenic faults by examining ancient faults exhumed from the depths at which earthquakes are observed to nucleate. Faults exposed in the Sierra Nevada, California, show that the internal architecture of earthquake faults is heterogeneous {{at a variety of}} scales. Field and microstructural observations are used to describe in detail the architecture of two pseudotachylyte-bearing fault systems in the Granite Pass region of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park; the Granite Pass fault (GPF) and associated faults, and the Glacier Lakes fault (GLF) and faults that splay from the GLF. The GPF and sub-parallel faults are 1 to 6. 7 km long with left-lateral strike-slip displacements up to 80 m. The GPF and GPF-parallel faults have architectures that are heterogeneous along strike. They are composed of one to four fault core strands containing cataclasites and ultracataclasites that cross-cut early localized crystal-plastic deformation. Slip surfaces developed at the edges of, within and between fault cores are defined by pseudotachylytes and cataclasites with thicknesses of ~ 0. 01 to 20 mm. Fault-related subsidiary structures are developed on either side of fault cores, and comprise damage zones with widths orthogonal to the fault of up to 30 m. The GLF and splay faults have architectures that are more homogeneous along strike. These faults are composed of a tabular volume of heavily fractured and altered host rock between approximately planar fault core strands. The fault cores are centimetres wide and contain cataclasites and foliated cataclasites that are cross-cut by pseudotachylytes. Fault-related damage is limited in extent to several metres beyond the bounding fault cores. The GLF contains additional cataclasites, ultracataclasites and pseudotachylytes in a fault core strand within the tabular <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> <b>rock.</b> Thermochronologic analyses <b>of</b> the host <b>rock</b> granodiorite, combined with previously published palaeogeobarometry and apatite fission track data, define the temperature and pressure changes associated with cooling and exhumation of the pluton. The P-T conditions prevalent during the deformation history of the GPF fault system are evaluated by relating recrystallisation mechanisms in quartz to temperature, showing that the early stages of deformation occurred at temperatures of 450 to 600 ºC. Dating of pseudotachylytes by the K-Ar isotopic method suggests subsequent brittle deformation took place at temperatures < 350 ºC and pressures ≤ 150 MPa. A model for the architecture of the GPF architecture therefore has well constrained environmental controls, and should be transferrable to faults with comparable deformation histories. Small faults (cumulative displacements < 1 m) in the Mount Abbot Quadrangle, 55 km north of Granite Pass, have been examined to illustrate the processes associated with the earliest stages of slip in the Sierra Nevada faults. The faults have branched or straight fault traces. Pseudotachylytes in branching faults show that these faults accumulated displacement in high velocity slip events, rather than by quasi-static fault growth. Branching faults without pseudotachylytes contain chlorite breccias interpreted to have formed in response to slip along faults with elevated pore fluid pressure. Straight faults also likely underwent slip events, but contain cataclased chlorite and epidote, suggesting low fluid pressures during slip. The small faults show that fluid-rock interactions are critical to fault geometry, and that lateral structural heterogeneity is established after small finite displacements. Field and thin section observations of exhumed seismogenic faults show that fault architecture and fault rock assemblage are critical to the earthquake rupture process. The heterogeneous composition of slip surfaces in the GPF faults imply that melt lubrication cannot account for all of the dynamic slip weakening as there are no continuous pseudotachylyte generation surfaces through the fault zones. Multiple slip weakening mechanisms must have been active during single rupture events. Slip weakening mechanisms also change at a given point on the fault in response to continued deformation. Splay faults at the GLF termination suggest that structural complexity observed at the terminations of fault surface traces can also be expected at depth. The off-fault damage at the termination of the GLF will change the bulk elastic properties <b>of</b> the host <b>rock</b> and must be accounted for in models of rupture propagation beyond fault terminations, or across geometrical discontinuities. Additionally, aftershock distributions and focal mechanisms may be controlled by the geometry of structures present at fault terminations.
