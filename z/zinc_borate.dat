Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy techniques were employed to investigate the infrared spectra and energy band gap of different composition of <b>Zinc</b> Lithium <b>Borate</b> glasses. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to confirm the amorphous nature of the glass samples. Glass forming ability and stability of the glass was checked using Differential thermal analysis (DTA). Density, molar volume, refractive index parameters have been analyzed in the light of different concentration of the modifier. The active vibrational modes of 1200 – 1600 cm− 1 for B-O stretching of BO 3 units, 800 – 1200 cm− 1 for B-O stretching of BO 4 units and 400 – 800 cm− 1 for bending vibration of various borate segments were detected. Addition of ZnO to lithium borate shows its influence in converting the dominant BO 3 group to BO 4 group.

40|$|Borate-modified {{oriented}} strandboard (OSB) was manufactured using <b>zinc</b> {{and calcium}} <b>borate</b> to provide resistance to Formosan Subterranean Termites (FSTs). Mechanical, physical, and biological {{properties of the}} product were evaluated. It was shown that static bending properties of the OSB were affected little at the room condition by the added borate. The internal bond strength was, however, generally smaller at the higher borate loading levels. Thickness swelling (TS) under the 24 -hour water soaking increased with increased borate content, especially for calcium borate. Part of the borate leached out under the water soaking condition due to the glueline washing and decomposition of the borate to form less water-soluble boric acid. The use of borate with a smaller particle size helped reduce TS and leaching rate significantly. Laboratory no-choice termite tests indicated that both <b>zinc</b> and calcium <b>borate</b> modified OSB resisted FSTs well. Thus, termite resistant OSB with required mechanical and physical performance could be successfully developed using southern wood species.

An unusual change in color and the absorption spectrum of the glass upon composite formation with C(60) indicated that the incorporated C(60) underwent some sort of interaction with the glass. Such fullerene molecules bonded to relatively smaller units of bismuth-boron network, were extracted out by eluting a powdered sample with toluene.

40|$|Creep {{performance}} of zinc and calcium borate-modified OSB was assessed under both constant and varying moisture conditions. The influence of initial borate content, wood species, and stress level on the creep deformation was studied.

The creep data were fitted well with a spring-dashpot model. Predicted fractional creep validated the current adjustment factor up to a 30 -year duration under a constant moisture content level.
