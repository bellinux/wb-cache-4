30|$|The whitish {{appearance}} of the green paint is thus not caused by the emerald green. Large whitish, transparent masses were observed in layer 4 during polishing. A remnant of these masses is visible on the left edge of layer 4 (white arrow, Fig.  3 b). This area is rich in zinc (Fig.  3 h), {{while the rest of}} layer 4 has a low zinc intensity except for a few zinc hotspots that correlate with the spots that have the characteristic UV fluorescence of zinc oxide visible in the UV light image. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that zinc oxide has reacted away to form <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> aggregates. <b>Zinc</b> <b>soap</b> aggregates are suspected of causing the lightened {{appearance of}} the green paint and this phenomenon will be further investigated.|$|E

Thirty two Garut Sheep (initial body weight 22. 38 ± 3. 56 kg) were assigned into a randomized block design with eight treatments. Body weight was used as a block (4 blocks). Eight rations evaluated in this trial were FO: basal diet + fish oil, CO: basal diet + corn oil, CaFO: basal diet + calcium soap of fish oil, CaCO: basal diet + calcium soap of corn oil, ZnFO: basal diet + <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> of fish oil, ZnCO: basal diet + <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> of corn oil, RS: basal diet + roasted soybeans, MM: basal diet + mineral mix. The experimental diets were fed for 8 weeks.

Dry matter intake of sheep fed CO (903 g/d), CaCO (947 g/d), RS (933 g/d) diets were higher (P < 0. 01) than those fed FO (820 g/d), CaFO (856 g/d), ZnFO (847 g/d), ZnCO (785 g/d), and MM (805 g/d) diets. Dry matter digestibility of CO (70 %) and CaFO diet (76 %) were higher (P < 0. 01) than other diets.

The driving force was the need to know the extent of use of titanium white in relation to its risk of photocatalytic degradation [16 – 18]. The timing of titanium white becoming popular amongst artists is important, as it possibly relates to the quality of those pigments. Similarly, knowing how much zinc white has been used may help us understand and estimate the extent of the <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> degradation risks of modern collections [19].|$|E

These compounds have a layer structure with the alkyl chains arranged as tilted bilayers and with all methylene chains adopting a planar, all-trans conformation at room temperature. The {{saturated fatty acid}} <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> exhibit a single reversible melting transition with the associated enthalpy change varying linearly with alkyl chain length, but surprisingly, the melting temperature remaining constant. Melting is associated with changes in the conformation of the alkyl chains and {{in the nature of}} coordination of the fatty acid to zinc. By monitoring features in the infrared spectra that are characteristic of the global conformation of the alkyl chains, a quantitative relation between conformational disorder and melting is established. It is found that, irrespective of the alkyl chain length, melting occurs when 30 % of the chains in the soap are disordered. These results highlight the universal nature of the melting of saturated fatty acid <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> and provide a simple explanation for the observed phenomena...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{conformation}} and phase-transitions in anchored alkyl chain bilayer assemblies in organic-inorganic hybrids. The alkyl chain bilayers in organic-inorganic hybrids bear a striking resemblances to the lipid bilayers that {{are an integral part}} of biomembranes. However, unlike the lipid bilayer where individual lipid molecules can undergo the total absence of translational mobility. The anchored bilayer are, therefore, the simplest model system for understanding the structure, organization and thermal behaviour of alkyl-chain assemblies. The anchored bilayer in the organic-inorganic hybrids also offer the advantage that unlike the lipid bilayers that are essentially fluid like, these are solids and therefore, amenable to study by a variety of solid-state spectroscopic techniques. The objective of the present works was to determine the organization, conformation and thermal behaviour of alkyl chains in these class of materials- the alkyl ammonium layered pervoskites and in <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The preparation, conformation and orientation of alkyl chains assemblies in the layered(CH 3 CH 2) nNH 3) 2 PbI 4 is described in chapter 2 and the phase-transitions and associated changes in conformation in presented in chapter 3. In chapter 4 the preparation, structure, conformation and phase-transitions of alkyl chains in the m = 2 member of the layered (CH 3 NH 3) m- 1 (CH 3 CH 2) nNH 3) 2 PbmI 3 m+ 1 Ruddleson-Popper series is discussed. The thermal behavior of <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> of saturated fatty acids is discussed in chapter 5 and formation and phase-transitions in solid solution between saturated <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> of differing chain lengths, zinc stearate and zinc myristate is presented in chapter 6.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of supplementation with mineral soap, organic mineral and roasted soyabean on ration fermentability in the rumen of sheep. Thirty two Garut Sheep (initial weight 22. 38 ± 3. 56 kg) were assigned into a randomized complete block design with 8 treatments. Body weight was used as blocks (4 blocks). The treatments were FO: basal diet + fish oil, CO: basal diet + corn oil, CaFO: basal diet + calcium soap of fish oil, CaCO: basal diet + calcium soap of corn oil, ZnFO: basal diet + <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> of fish oil, ZnCO: basal diet + <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> of corn oil, RSB: basal diet + roasted soya bean, MM: basal diet + mineral mix (Zn, Cu, Cr, and Se-organic). The experimental diets were offered for 8 weeks. The results showed that ammonia concentrations of sheep fed CO, CaFO, CaCO, and MM were higher than those of sheep fed FO, ZnFO, ZnCO, RSB diets (9. 28 v 6. 75 mM). Vollatile fatty acid production was not affected by treatments (110. 6 ± 7. 69 mM). The levels of amonia and VFA in this experiment were suitable for microbial growth. Rumen bacterial population of sheep fed FO was the lowest (P < 0. 05). Rumen protozoa population of sheep fed CO, CaFO, ZnFO, ZnCO, and MM were lower (P < 0. 05) than those of sheep fed FO, CaCO, and RSB. It is concluded that supplemention of Ca-soap, organic minerals, and roasted soyabeans to sheep ration increased ration fermentability in the rumen.

40|$|The {{formation}} of metal soaps {{is a major}} problem for oil paintings conservators. The complexes of either lead or zinc and fatty acids are the product of reactions between common pigments and the oil binder, and they are associated with many types of degradation that affect the appearance and stability of oil paint layers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) reveals that a paint sample from The Woodcutter (after Millet) by Vincent van Gogh contains two distinct zinc carboxylate species, one similar to crystalline zinc palmitate and one that is characterized by a broadened asymmetric stretch COO- band shifted to 15701590 cm(- 1). This observation has been made in many paintings. Although several hypotheses exist to explain the shifted broad carboxylate band, these were not supported by experimental evidence. In this paper, experiments were carried out to characterize the second zinc carboxylate type. It is shown that neither variations in the composition of <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> (i. e. <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> containing mixtures of fatty acids or metals) nor fatty acids adsorbed on pigment surfaces are responsible for the second zinc carboxylate species. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR analysis indicate that the broad COO- band represents amorphous zinc carboxylates. These species can be interpreted as either non-crystalline <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> or <b>zinc</b> ions bound to carboxylate moieties on the polymerized oil network, a system similar to ionomers. These findings uncover an intermediate stage of metal soap-related degradation of oil paintings, and lead the way to improved methods for the prevention and treatment of oil paint degradation...|$|R
40|$|The {{painting}} Couple with Clouds {{in their}} Heads by Salvador Dalí (1936) from the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam was seriously disfigured by ring formations {{on the edges}} of the painting and a matt, white-looking semi-transparent material on the surface. Paint samples, taken from affected and unaffected paint areas, investigated with light, scanning electron and ATR-FTIR microscopy and X-ray diffraction showed that the zinc white-containing oil paint was converted into <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps,</b> <b>zinc</b> formate dihydrate, zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc sulfide. The conversion of the zinc white started at the surface of the painting. <b>Zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> are formed by a reaction of zinc white and fatty acids from the oil. Formate and acetate, most likely emitted from the wooden frame, reacted with the zinc white pigment. Finally, the zinc sulfide is suggested to derive from zinc white reacting with hydrogen sulfide. The high degree of degradation of the zinc white-containing paint and the ring formation is postulated to be triggered by the exposures of the panels to high temperatures which occurred during a 1 -day photo shoot in 1936 shortly after completion of the paintings by Dali. Furthermore, {{it seems likely that the}} glazed frame created a (semi-) closed system and subsequently acid gasses diffused into the system via "leakages" due to a poor match between the frame and the panel, and may have initiated a reaction with the surface of the painting. As the glazed and framed panels were a non-ventilated system, the acid gasses did not distribute evenly over the surface, but rather were most intense at the edges of the painting. The ring formation caused by the gasses is compared with the phenomena of Liesegang rings, a reaction-diffusion process...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of thermal}} degradation of poly(vinyl chloride), (PVC) {{in the presence}} of lead, cadmium, barium, calcium and zinc soaps of Ximenia americana seed oil (XSO) was investigated under nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range, 170 - 190 oC. The stabilizing effects of the metal soaps were assessed by measurements of the time for degradation to attain 1 % conversion, tDH and of the corresponding rate of degradation, RDH. PVC was stabilized by the metal soaps with exception of the zinc derivative, and showed a relative order of stabilization of PbXSO>BaXSO>CaXSO>CdXSO. The latter was corroborated by measurements of intrinsic viscosity of degraded PVC samples and thermogravimetric analysis. The <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> accentuated the degradation of PVC at a rate 5 -fold higher than the value in the absence of additive at 190 oC. The calculated activation energies for the degradation process are in the range 79. 76 – 85. 3 kJmol- 1 for PVC alone and PVC/Ba-XSO composition. Binary mixtures of Ca/Zn and Ba/Cd carboxylates both at 9 : 1 ratio exhibited synergistic effect on PVC stabilization...|$|E
30|$|White {{pigments}} were abundantly used in 20 th century paintings, {{and relate}} to several degradation risks such as titanium white mediated photocatalytic binder degradation or <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> formation. Knowledge {{about the white}} pigments that were used is essential for risk assessments of 20 th century collections. In this study, a representative set of 179 paintings in Dutch modern art collections were analyzed by portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Subsequent explorative data analysis was performed, supported by qualitative findings from 140 home-made reference samples. Micro-samples were further investigated by X-ray diffraction and {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} to gain information about crystal structure and surface coating. This study reveals that Dutch 20 th century artists were hesitant to use titanium white. In the Netherlands, the use of this pigment is observed convincingly from the 1970 s onward and initially mostly in non-oil binders. Additionally, lead white was used until late in the 20 th century for paints and grounds but rarely mixed with titanium white in paints. The study also indicated that many CoBrA artists used zinc white, underlining the risk of degradation due to soap formation. Furthermore, this study highlights the different production processes of titanium white. Through the association of titanium with niobium, an impurity only present for sulfate processed pigments, the production process can be identified. The absence of niobium indicates the presence of rutile and is thus a sign of paint stability, as well as a ‘post 1959 ’ dating. This explorative study illustrates the value of a combination of data analysis approaches, which includes assessment of spectra as well as descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analysis, for medium-sized datasets gathered at similar conditions.|$|E
40|$|Objects where {{brass and}} leather are {{combined}} {{with each other}} often lead to the brass corroding heavily and turning green. This type of corrosion product is called copper soap and can occur even when the object is stored at low relative humidity (RH) of 30 %. What happens is that the hydrogen ions in carboxylic acids (fatty acids) associated with the leather are replaced by copper ions from the brass. It takes contact between the two materials for this to occur, why the question was asked if the brass in some way could be isolated from the leather. An experimental study {{was made of the}} insulation capability of the polyester material Melinex. Eight leather samples were prepared with brass rings around the leather treated with three different fats: lanolin, olive oil and the commercial product Ekol oil. In three of the samples the brass was isolated from the leather by placing a film of the Melinex between the two materials. The rings were examined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), which showed that they were brass. The leather was investigated with ferritest and vanillin test, which found out that it, was tanned with hydrolysable vegetable tanning agents. Copper soap was simulated in a climate chamber with near 100 % RH and at room temperature for four weeks. The samples without Melinex showed green corrosion while those with Melinex did not. Raman spectroscopy, however, did not prove that it was specifically copper soap. A study using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) showed that it was both copper and <b>zinc</b> <b>soap</b> that had formed. SEM-EDX analysis showed that no copper ions penetrated the leather structure when Melinex were used as insulation.

ATR-FTIR microspectroscopic imaging on a cross-section confirmed they are present in the form of zinc sulphate, the spectra showing a characteristic infrared absorption band at around 1070  cm− 1.

30|$|The pigment {{alteration}} phenomena {{observed in}} the paintings of Ferdinand Hodler and Filippo Franzoni {{can be described as}} the formation of copper and <b>zinc</b> <b>soaps</b> at the surface of the brass pigment powder {{as a result of the}} reaction of the lipidic binding medium with the copper and zinc (or their oxidation products) brass components. The formation of blueish-green zinc and copper carboxylates in composite brass artefacts when the metal is in contact with lipid sources is known to artefact conservators [11, 12]. Interestingly the conference Chemistry for Cultural Heritage that took place in 2014 in Vienna witness the report of the first two studies of metal brass use and degradation in paintings. The first study focused on an  18 th century painting by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675 – 1741). In this painting the background was originally guilded with brass leaf and had been extensively overpainted. Studies of samples in cross section showed visible copper and zinc orgametallic masses surrounding the leaf [13]. The second example, reported here, addresses the unusual use and degradation of powdered brass pigment in late 19 th century oil paintings on canvas.|$|R

Double decomposition reactions permit the synthesis of metallic soaps, which are long-chain carboxylates of metal ions, from alkaline ones such as sodium, potassium or ammonium soaps.

Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy has been applied to follow modifications in the luminescent zinc white pigment when mixed with binder. Significant changes in trap state photoluminescence emissions have been detected: the enhancement of a blue emission combined with a change of the decay kinetic of the well-known green emission. Complementary data from molecular analysis of paints using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of zinc carboxylates and corroborates the mechanism for zinc complexes formation. We support the hypothesis that zinc ions migrate into binder creating novel vacancies, affecting the photoluminescence intensity and lifetime properties of zinc oxide. Here, we further demonstrate the advantages of a time-resolved photoluminescence approach for studying defects in semiconductor pigments...|$|R
