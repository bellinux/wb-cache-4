40|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} trace metal involved in diverse cellular processes. Cellular zinc levels are controlled by three families of proteins, including <b>ZIP</b> channels, which facilitate zinc influx into the cytosol. Aberrant function of many <b>ZIP</b> channels {{has been associated with}} human diseases. However, their cellular mechanisms are relatively unclear. Importantly, our group have reported that <b>ZIP</b> 7 function is triggered by CK 2 −mediated phosphorylation on residues S 275 and S 276, and have created a pZIP 7 antibody that recognises this phosphorylated form of <b>ZIP</b> 7. This project therefore aimed to decipher post−translational mechanisms of three <b>ZIP</b> channels: <b>ZIP</b> 7, <b>ZIP</b> 6, and <b>ZIP</b> 10. Computational analysis of <b>ZIP</b> sequences revealed salient characteristics of <b>ZIP</b> channels, especially those belonging to the LIV− 1 subfamily, and detected multiple potential phosphorylation sites in the cytosolic loop between TM 3 and TM 4 of <b>ZIP</b> 3, <b>ZIP</b> 4, <b>ZIP</b> 6, <b>ZIP</b> 7 and <b>ZIP</b> 10. Characterisation of the pZIP 7 antibody revealed that it specifically recognised <b>ZIP</b> 7 when phosphorylated on S 275 and S 276 and accurately indicated increased or impaired function of the protein. Employing different antibody arrays, phosphorylation of multiple kinases by <b>ZIP</b> 7 overexpression or zinc was demonstrated, introducing multiple signalling pathways as downstream cascades of <b>ZIP</b> 7 −mediated zinc release from intracellular stores. An investigation on <b>ZIP</b> 6 detected that it was phosphorylated by CK 2, CK 1, GSK− 3, and PLK 1 exclusively in mitotic cells. This led to a deeper discovery of the cellular mechanism of <b>ZIP</b> 6 in mitosis involving its heteromer formation with <b>ZIP</b> 10 and its binding to pS 727 STAT 3, which also bound to pStathmin, a protein required for microtubule reorganisation. Importantly, <b>ZIP</b> 6 and <b>ZIP</b> 10 antibody treatment successfully inhibited mitosis in multiple breast cancer cell lines, either nocodazole−induced or endogenous. Collectively, this project has provided a deeper insight into <b>ZIP</b> 7, <b>ZIP</b> 6 and <b>ZIP</b> 10 cellular mechanisms, introduced pZIP 7 antibody as a potential biomarker, and proposed <b>ZIP</b> 6 and <b>ZIP</b> 10 antibodies as promising mitosis−blocking agents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{normal human}} {{prostate}} glandular epithelium has the unique function of accumulating {{high levels of}} zinc. In prostate cancer this capability is lost as an early event {{in the development of}} the malignant cells. The mechanism and factors responsible for the ability of the normal epithelial cells to accumulate zinc and the loss of this capability in the malignant cells need to be identified. We previously reported that <b>Zip</b> 1 is an important zinc uptake transporter in prostate cells and is down regulated in the malignant cells in situ along with the depletion of zinc levels. In this report we investigated the expression of two other <b>Zip</b> family zinc transporters, <b>Zip</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3 in malignant versus nonmalignant (normal and BPH) glands. <b>Zip</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3 relative protein levels were determined by immunohistochemistry analysis of human prostate tissue sections. Results Normal and BPH glandular epithelium consistently exhibited the strong presence of both <b>Zip</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3; whereas both transporters consistently were essentially non-detectable in the malignant glands. This represents the first report of the expression of <b>Zip</b> 3 in human prostate tissue; and more importantly, reveals that <b>ZiP</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3 are down regulated in malignant cells in situ as we also had demonstrated for <b>Zip</b> 1. <b>Zip</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3 transporter proteins were localized predominantly at the apical cell membrane, which is in contrast to the <b>Zip</b> 1 localization at the basolateral membrane. <b>Zip</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3 seemingly are associated with the re-uptake of zinc from prostatic fluid. Conclusion These results coupled with previous reports implicate <b>Zip</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3 along with <b>Zip</b> 1 as important zinc uptake transporters involved in the unique ability of prostate cells to accumulate high cellular zinc levels. <b>Zip</b> 1 is important for the extraction of zinc from circulation as the primary source of cellular zinc. <b>Zip</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3 appear to be important for retention of the zinc in the cellular compartment. The down regulation of all three transporters in the malignant cells is consistent with the loss of zinc accumulation in these cells. Since zinc imposes tumor suppressor effects, the silencing of the gene expression for these transporters is a required event for the manifestation of the malignant activities of the neoplastic cells. This now provides new insights into the genetic/molecular events associated with the development of prostate cancer; and supports our concept of <b>Zip</b> 1, and now <b>Zip</b> 2 and <b>Zip</b> 3, as tumor suppressor genes and zinc as a tumor suppressor agent. </p...|$|R

Extragenic suppressor analysis identified <b>Zip</b> 1, a bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factor, as a target for Pof 1. We show <b>Zip</b> 1 is stabilized in pof 1 mutants, Pof 1 binds only phosphorylated forms of <b>Zip</b> 1, and <b>Zip</b> 1 is ubiquitylated in vivo, indicating that <b>Zip</b> 1 is a substrate of SCFPof 1. Genome-wide DNA microarray assay shows that many cadmium-induced genes are {{under the control of}} <b>Zip</b> 1, suggesting <b>Zip</b> 1 plays a role in cadmium response. Consistently, <b>zip</b> 1 mutants are hypersensitive to cadmium and unlike wild type, lose cell viability under this stress. Intriguingly, cadmium exposure results in upregulation of <b>Zip</b> 1 levels and leads wild-type cells to growth arrest with reduced cell size, reminiscent of pof 1 phenotypes. Our results indicate that <b>Zip</b> 1 mediates growth arrest in cadmium response, which is essential to maintain viability. Normally growing cells prevent this response through constitutive ubiquitylation and degradation of <b>Zip</b> 1 via SCFPof 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>ZIP</b> Code data is an {{integral}} part of dealer/store locator software on many web sites, especially brick-and-click websites. This software processes a user-input <b>ZIP</b> Code and returns a list of store or business locations, usually in order of increasing distance from the center of the input <b>ZIP</b> Code. As the <b>ZIP</b> system is confined to the U.S. Postal network, websites that require <b>ZIP</b> Codes cannot register customers outside the U.S. Many sites will either purchase postal code data of other countries, or make allowances in cases where the <b>ZIP</b> Code is not recognized.|$|R
