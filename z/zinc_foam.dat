40|$|The {{influence}} of oxides on the stabilisation of <b>zinc</b> <b>foam</b> made by foaming compacted powder mixtures {{has been investigated}} by varying the oxide content in the zinc powder used by oxidation and reduction. Optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy as well as energy dispersive X ray mapping {{were used to determine}} the oxide distribution, morphology and structure in the foams. The study revealed that with increase in the oxide content of the foam, the maximum expansion and expansion rate increased. Small amount of nano sized oxide particles and their cluster, which are randomly distributed, were observed within the bulk of foam. But the major fraction of oxides is observed on the surface of pores in form of clusters. These clusters are distributed uniformly all over the surface. Effect of these oxides on the stability of foam is discussed. The formation of satellite pores, which is characteristic signature of zinc foams, and their stability, is investigate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is very {{possible}} for the foam zinc materials {{to take the place}} of zinc powder and become a new ideal material of electrode for zinc-air battery, because of its excellent three dimensional reticulated structure, high porosity, high specific surface area and uniform quality, and was widely used in many other fields. A novel method for preparing very porous <b>zinc</b> <b>foam</b> was proposed, in which the polyurethane foam as substrate was processed by degreasing process, roughening process, activation, electroless plating and zinc electrodeposition. Then, experiments were carried out to explore the effects of the solution composition（concentration of ZnSO 4 ）and the operation conditions （such as the interelectrode distance; current density, temperature, pH value of electroplating solution and so on) on the morphology of the foam zinc and the current efficiency. The optimum experimental conditions were determined by optimizing the factors. On these conditions the foam zinc presents a three-dimensional reticular structure with high porosity, and uniformity, and the outward appearance of the coating is bright. Zinc-air batteries employ oxygen from the air to their cathode, using an anode primarily composed of zinc and an alkaline electrolyte. The advantages of zinc-air batteries consist of include flat discharg...|$|E
40|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>foams</b> were {{prepared}} {{by applying the}} powder compaction method which comprises mixing zinc powder with {{a small fraction of}} a blowing agent, compacting this mix and creating a foam by heat treatment above the melting temperature of the metal. The foaming process which normally leads to a volume expansion of some 500 % was artificially stopped in very early stages by quenching. The resulting samples with porosities below 20 % were then characterised by microscopy and ultra small-angle neutron scattering (USANS). Foam microstructures, pore morphologies, the locations of the blowing agent particles, pore and particle size distributions and total pore volume fractions were determined. Two mechanisms for pore formation could be identified by microscopy. The pore growth behaviour for different size regimes could be obtained from the USANS distribution curves, thus giving insight into the early stages of metal foam formation...|$|R

Three strategies are evaluated {{use of an}} intrinsic blowing agent, foaming under high pressure and foam control by mechanical pressure manipulation.

40|$|CHARACTERIZATION OF METAL FOAMS WITH SYNCHROTRON TOMOGRAPHY AND 3 D IMAGE ANALYSIS A. Rack, A. Haibel, A. Bütow, B. Matijasevic, J. Banhart Introducing metal foams to mass {{production}} requires in depth {{knowledge of the}} processing parameters and foaming materials influence on the resulting foam structure. Tomographic synchrotron images contain 3 D information of the investigated sample with high spatial as well as high material specific resolutions and, therefore, are the suitable, non destructive testing method. We analyze these data sets by means of 3 D image analysis, mainly using algorithms which originate from stochastic geometry. The information within one image which belongs to different morphological objects pores, particles etc. is separated, delivering so called Boolean images. Plain voxel counting then delivers size distributions, more complex algorithms like Euclidean distance transformation in combination with erosion, dilatation and the Euler number give a detailed view of the correlations and other characteristics. Therefore, we can investigate {{the influence of the}} blowing agent s particle size distribution on the pore size distribution, draw conclusions if a correlation between pores and particles exists and are able to distinguish which physical effect determines the cell wall thickness. First we focused on <b>zinc</b> <b>foams</b> as the interest in this foaming material is growing but scientific activities have been low so far. In opposite to aluminium foams a bimodal pore size distribution is found while the critical cell wall thickness stays the same, pointing towards hydrogen solubility playing an important role during the foaming process. Aluminium foam is already in use for industrial applications but there the foaming process is still not completely controlled. Samples in comparable foaming stages are prepared, varying only the particle size distribution in order to investigate a possible coherence. Finally, we had a look at possible correlations between the pore structure and particles...|$|R
40|$|Pilonidal disease (PD) is {{a chronic}} and {{debilitating}} condition. The overall {{aim of the}} scoping review is to map and summarize {{a wide range of}} evidence to examine which topical agent or dressing is effective in promoting pilonidal wound healing by secondary intention. Review of this cumulative body of evidence will inform care and guide dressing selection for PD related wounds and delineate future research priorities based on identified knowledge gaps and clinical practice issues. Overall, there is some evidence to suggest that topical applications of hydrogel, silver, honey, <b>zinc,</b> selected <b>foam</b> materials, negative pressure wound therapy, platelet rich plasma, and plant extracts may promote wound healing. Topical treatment using polyhexamethylene biguanide and silver may be beneficial in reducing bacterial burden. Finally, silver, honey, and hydrocolloid dressings may help alleviate wound related pain. However, evidence remains insufficient in light of methodological limitations and biases of the studies.

40|$|Ultra small angle neutron {{scattering}} USANS experiments {{were carried out}} with the double crystal diffractometer DCD to obtain pore size distributions in early stages of metal <b>foam</b> formation. <b>Zinc</b> specimens <b>foamed</b> with zirconium hydride have already been investigated, but these results suffered from a pronounced difference of the measured total fraction of pores and blowing agent particles compared to traditional density measurements which yielded a higher volume fraction. The {{reason for this is}} that USANS measurements were limited to pore diameters below 25 m when using a neutron wavelength of 0. 443 nm. Operating the DCD at a neutron wavelength of 0. 232 nm allows us to detect pores up to about 50 m and to reduce these deviations. On the other limit, for pores less than 300 nm in size the scattering power of the investigated samples is very low, irrespective of wavelength, thus limiting the use of the DCD to above this size. For this reason additional SANS measurements were carried out using an instrument with the traditional pinhole configuration suitable for the detection of smaller features. The results were combined with the USANS data at the two wavelengths allowing us to obtain size distributions over the extremely wide range from 1 nm to 50 m. Using these methods, an analysis of the {{neutron scattering}} curves yields volume fraction of pores in the sample in agreement with buoyancy measurement...|$|R
40|$|Microporous {{syntactic}} metal foams {{based on}} compounds of metal matrices and integrated micro glass bubbles present {{a group of}} materials with interesting properties. They demonstrate outstanding specific compression strengths, very high specific compression energy absorption capability, are tight against infiltration by fluids even at higher pressures and can be coated using techniques which are more common for compact materials like anodizing, copper- and chromium-plating. Corrosion properties of aluminium and <b>zinc</b> syntactic <b>foams</b> were tested by electrochemical potential measurements, immersion tests and long-time out-door exposure and determined {{to be close to}} those of compact alloys. Several approaches have been performed by IFAM for the production of these materials, e. g. by infiltration of sintered glass bubbles preforms with aluminium and zinc alloys using squeeze casting or gas-pressure infiltration of sintered preforms with aluminium. However, for alloys with higher melting temperatures liquid infiltration is not always possible. Therefore, tests have recently been carried out to examine the feasibility of the production of glass bubble syntactic foams with steel matrices by metal powder injection moulding (MIM). Blends of 58 vol% Fe 50 Ni 50 powder mixed in polymers and waxes (binder) and 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% 3 M-S 38 glass bubbles were produced and injection moulded into test specimens. After moulding the binder was removed out of the samples and the metallic material was densified around the glass bubbles in a sintering step. Though the sintering process was carried out at temperatures of 1 OOO deg C, exceeding by far the softening temperatures of the glass, it was possible to obtain good foam structures with densities of 6. 8 g/cm(exp 3), 6. 2 g/cm(exp 3) and 5. 7 g/cm(exp 3) for syntactic foams with 2, 3 and 5 wt% glass bubbles respectively (density of compact material: 8. 4 g/cm) ...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) Zn/Cu foam {{electrodes}} are fabricated by pulse electro-deposition of <b>zinc</b> on copper <b>foam</b> and investigated {{as negative}} electrode materials for zinc-based alkaline batteries. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that epitaxially layered zinc crystals distribute uniformly on the 3 D copper foam-like skeleton. A peak power density of 286 mW cm(- 2) and utilization of 92 % (754 mA h g(- 1) at 200 mA cm(- 2)) are obtained when the Zn/Cu foam electrodes {{are used in}} primary zinc/oxygen batteries and reveal high rate capability and material utilization of the 3 D electrodes. To probe the rechargeability of the Zn/Cu foam electrodes, zinc/zinc quasi-symmetric cells are cycled under severe conditions, i. e., a discharge-charge current density of as high as 250 mA cm(- 2), 100 % depth of discharge and without dendrite-suppressing additives that would otherwise suppress dendrite growth, yet the 3 D Zn/Cu foam electrodes remain dendrite-free experienced 10 000 discharge-charge cycles. The specific capacity of the 3 D Zn/Cu foam electrodes reaches up to 620 mA h g(- 1) after at least 9000 discharge-charge cycles in a prototype Zn/Ni battery, exhibiting the superior cycling stability of the 3 D Zn/Cu foam electrodes...|$|R
40|$|Generation of {{acid mist}} {{is a major}} concern in zinc {{electrowinning}} (EW) due to its detrimental effects on worker's health, the environment and plant infrastructure. One of the effective methods for acid mist control is to form a foam layer above the electrolyte surface by using surfactants. In this work, two saponin-rich products (Mistop® and QLZinc®) and a commercial Licorice product were evaluated and compared as acid mist suppressants in <b>zinc</b> EW. <b>Foam</b> properties, acid mist suppression, phase separation in solvent extraction, cathodic current efficiency (CE) and cathode quality were correlated to the addition of these surfactants. Foam properties studied included minimum soluble solids dosage for 100 % foam coverage, time required to achieve 100 % foam coverage and foam persistence time. The two saponin-rich products were found to be more effective foaming agents than Licorice. Based on foam property tests, the recommended soluble solids dosage was 1. 8, 3. 8 and 21. 6 ppm for Mistop®, QLZinc® and Licorice, respectively. At these dosages, acid mist suppression was 99 % for both Quillaja products and 94 % for Licorice. Foam coverage of 100 % was achieved with 1. 0 ppm of saponins when Mistop® was added, compared with 0. 5 ppm of saponins when QLZinc® was added, suggesting that QLZinc® contains other Quillaja solids which are surface active and positively contribute {{to improve the quality of}} foam produced. For all three acid mist suppressants tested, no significant changes in phase disengagement time and interfacial tension were detected when an organic solution was separately contacted with the zinc electrolytes containing the three agents. The CE for the solutions containing 1. 8, 3. 8 and 21. 6 ppm soluble solids of Mistop®, QLZinc® and Licorice were 91. 4 %, 92. 5 % and 92. 6 %, respectively. These values were slightly lower than for the blank solution (92. 8 %). Zinc deposit quality was also affected slightly by all three agents tested. Overall, it is concluded that under the current testing conditions, Quillaja products, at much lower soluble solids dosage, performed very well and better than Licorice...|$|R
