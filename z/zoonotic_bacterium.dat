40|$|This {{systematic}} review considers {{the relationship between}} arthropods commonly found on and around livestock premises, and <b>zoonotic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The principal focus is upon insects and arachnids on poultry units, where houses, litter and manure provide good conditions for the growth, multiplication and protection of flies, beetles and mites, and where zoonotic pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter are prevalent. Other members of the Enterobacteriaceae and the taxa Clostridium, Helicobacter, Erysipelas and Chlamydiaceae are also discussed. Salmonella is widely distributed in the flies of affected livestock units, and is detectable {{to a lesser degree}} in beetles and mites. Persistent carriage appears to be common and there is some field and experimental evidence to support arthropod-mediated transmission between poultry flocks, particularly carry-over from one flock to the next. Campylobacter may readily be isolated from arthropods in contact with affected poultry flocks, although carriage is short-lived. There appears to be a role for flies, at least, in the breaching of biosecurity around Campylobacter-negative flocks.

40|$|Background: The <b>zoonotic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Campylobacter jejuni has a broad {{host range}} but is {{especially}} associated with birds, {{both domestic and}} wild. Earlier studies have indicated thrushes of the genus Turdus in Europe to be frequently colonized with C. jejuni, and predominately with host-associated specific genotypes. The European Blackbird Turdus merula has a large distribution in Europe, including some oceanic islands, and was also introduced to Australia by European immigrants in the 1850 s. Methods: The host specificity and temporal stability of European Blackbird C. jejuni was investigated with multilocus sequence typing {{in a set of}} isolates collected from Sweden, Australia, and The Azores. Results: Remarkably, we found that the Swedish, Australian, and Azorean isolates were genetically highly similar, despite extensive spatial and temporal isolation. This indicates adaptation, exquisite specificity, and stability in time for European Blackbirds, which is in sharp contrast with the high levels of recombination and mutation found in poultry-related C. jejuni genotypes.

Bovine brucellosis, caused {{mainly by}} Brucella abortus, a <b>zoonotic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> has been {{reported}} from {{many areas of the}} world, including Central and South America, and the Caribbean island state of Trinidad and Tobago. Although brucellosis has been eradicated from domestic cattle in Canada it still exists in one or two herds in the United States. Serological tests are important in estimating prevalence of Brucella exposure in order to target eradication programmes. In this study, serum samples from 150 cattle were tested using a commercial competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (SVANOVIR®Brucella-Ab C-ELISA) which detects antibodies to both B. abortus and Brucella melitensis. All cattle tested were greater than 6 months old and were unvaccinated. Sampled cattle were from 35 herds representing animals from all 6 parishes of Grenada. Nine of the 150 animals (6 %) were positive for antibodies to B. abortus and/or melitensis by the C-ELISA. Of the 35 herds, 7 (20 %) had C-ELISA-positive animals. Three of the 6 parishes contained positive herds.

40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} accelerates bacterial adaptation to novel environments, allowing selection {{to act on}} genes that have evolved in multiple genetic backgrounds. This can lead to ecological specialization. However, {{little is known about}} how zoonotic bacteria maintain the ability to colonize multiple hosts whilst competing with specialists in the same niche.

Using a modelling approach we show that increasing levels of homologous recombination enhance the efficiency with which selection can fix combinations of beneficial alleles, speeding adaptation. We then show how these predictions change in a multi-host system, with low levels of recombination, consistent with real r/m estimates, increasing the standing variation in the population, allowing a more effective response to changes in the selective landscape. Our analysis explains how observed gradients of host specialism and generalism can evolve in a multihost system through the transfer of ecologically important loci among coexisting strains...|$|E

Trapping sites were selected around sheep farms (study 1, 2000 to 2002) and recreational parks (study 2, 2003 to 2005). The majority of the studied mammals (162) were wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), but six other different species were also analyzed: yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), shrews (Crocidura russula and Sorex coronatus), bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), domestic mice (Mus domesticus), and moles (Talpa europaea). The results showed an infection rate ranging from 10. 7 % to 68. 8 %, depending on the small mammal species. One C. russula shrew and one A. sylvaticus mouse gave positive reactions for A. phagocytophilum, and C. burnetii was detected in two domestic mice and one A. sylvaticus mouse in a farm.
