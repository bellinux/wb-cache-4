5|$|About an {{hour after}} Saratoga {{launched}} her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine <b>Zeros</b> while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six <b>Zeros.</b> Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of Shōkakus <b>Zeros</b> stayed behind {{to deal with the}} Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the <b>Zeros,</b> but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine <b>Zeros.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 08:40, the {{opposing}} aircraft strike formations passed {{within sight of}} each other. Nine <b>Zeros</b> from Zuihō surprised and attacked the Enterprise group, attacking the climbing aircraft {{from out of the}} sun. In the resulting engagement, four <b>Zeros,</b> three Wildcats, and two TBFs were shot down, with another two TBFs and a Wildcat forced by heavy damage to return to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|At 13:00, Kondo's Advanced {{force and}} Abe's Vanguard force {{warships}} together headed directly towards the last reported {{position of the}} U.S. carrier task forces and increased speed to try to intercept them for a warship gunfire battle. The damaged carriers Zuihō and Shōkaku, with Nagumo still on board, retreated from the battle area, leaving Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta {{in charge of the}} Zuikaku and Junyō aircraft forces. At 13:06, Junyō launched her second strike of seven torpedo planes and eight <b>Zeros,</b> and Zuikaku launched her third strike of seven torpedo planes, two dive bombers, and five <b>Zeros.</b> At 15:35, Junyō launched the last Japanese strike force of the day, consisting of four bombers and six <b>Zeros.</b>|$|E

5|$|In January 1942, {{together}} {{with the rest of}} the First and Fifth Carrier Divisions, Akagi supported the invasion of Rabaul in the Bismarck Archipelago, as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. She provided 20 B5Ns and 9 <b>Zeros</b> for the initial airstrike on Rabaul on 20 January 1942. The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby Kavieng the following day, of which Akagi contributed 9 A6M <b>Zeros</b> and 18 D3As. On the 22nd, Akagis D3As and <b>Zeros</b> again attacked Rabaul before returning to Truk on 27 January. The Second Carrier Division, with Sōryū and Hiryū, had been detached to support the invasion of Wake Island on 23 December 1941 and did not reunite {{with the rest of the}} carrier mobile striking force until February 1942.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} 14 Devastators from VT-6 {{from the}} carrier , led by Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's aircraft tried to sandwich Kaga, but the CAP, reinforced by an additional eight <b>Zeros</b> launched by Akagi at 09:33 and 09:40, shot down all but {{four of the}} Devastators, and Kaga dodged the torpedoes. Defensive fire from the Devastators shot down one of Akagis <b>Zeros.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, 14 Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6) from Enterprise, led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's {{aircraft}} {{tried to}} sandwich Kaga, but the CAP, reinforced by 4 additional <b>Zeros</b> launched by Hiryū at 09:37, shot down all but 4 of the Devastators, and Kaga dodged the torpedoes. Hiryū launched another trio of CAP <b>Zeros</b> at 10:13 after Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3) from Yorktown was spotted. Two of her <b>Zeros</b> {{were shot down}} by Wildcats escorting VT-3 and another was forced to ditch.|$|E

5|$|The carrier {{also contributed}} 3 <b>Zeros</b> {{to the total}} of 11 {{assigned}} to the initial CAP over the four carriers. By 07:05, the carrier had 6 fighters with the CAP which helped to defend the Kido Butai from the first US attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. At this time, Nagumo's carriers were attacked by 6 US Navy Grumman TBF Avengers from Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) and 4 USAAC Martin B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after Hiryū while the Marauders attacked Akagi. The 30 CAP <b>Zeros</b> {{in the air at}} this time, including the 6 from Hiryū, immediately attacked the American airplanes, shooting down 5 of the Avengers and 2 of the B-26s. The Avengers shot down 1 of Hiryūs <b>Zeros.</b> The surviving aircraft dropped their torpedoes, but all missed.|$|E
5|$|While {{returning}} to Japan, Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, {{commander of the}} First Air Fleet, ordered that Sōryū and Hiryū be detached on 16 December to attack the defenders of Wake Island who had already defeated the first Japanese attack on the island. The two carriers reached {{the vicinity of the}} island on 21 December and launched twenty-nine D3As and two B5Ns, escorted by eighteen <b>Zeros,</b> to attack ground targets. They encountered no aerial opposition and launched thirty-five B5Ns and six A6M <b>Zeros</b> the following day. They were intercepted by the two surviving Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters of Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-211. The Wildcats shot down two B5Ns before they were shot down themselves by the <b>Zeros.</b> The garrison surrendered the next day after Japanese troops were landed.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 3 June, she {{launched}} nine B5Ns, escorted by six <b>Zeros,</b> to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. One B5N crashed on takeoff and only {{six of the}} B5Ns {{and all of the}} <b>Zeros</b> were able {{to make it through the}} bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the oil storage tanks and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from Ryūjō from the second strike was damaged by a Curtiss P-40 and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the Akutan Zero, remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test-flown. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 <b>Zeros,</b> 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by <b>Zeros,</b> and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E

5|$|Hiryū {{reinforced}} the CAP with launches of 3 more <b>Zeros</b> at 08:25. These fresh <b>Zeros</b> helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna starting around 08:30. Haruna escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, {{they kept the}} Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.|$|E
5|$|Kagas four {{remaining}} CAP {{fighters were}} in the process of landing when 16 Marine SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from Midway, led by Lofton R.

Five <b>Zeros</b> were launched at 08:15 and three intercepted a dozen Midway-based United States Army B-17 Flying Fortresses attempting to bomb the three other carriers from , but only limited damage was inflicted on the heavy bombers, although their attacks all missed. Five D3As also joined the CAP around this time. Another trio of <b>Zeros</b> were launched at 08:30. Kaga began landing her returning Midway strike force aboard around 08:35 and was finished by 08:50; one Zero pilot died after crash-landing his aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1942, Sōryū set {{out with}} the Combined Fleet's carrier {{striking}} force {{in the company of}} Kaga, Akagi, and Hiryū, which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 May, both sides spotted each other {{about the same time}} and began {{launching}} their aircraft about 09:00. The Japanese carriers launched a total of 18 <b>Zeros,</b> 33 D3As and 18 B5Ns. Yorktown was the first American carrier to launch her aircraft and Lexington began launching hers seven minutes later. These totaled 9 Wildcats, 15 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators. Yorktowns dive bombers disabled Shōkakus flight deck with two hits and Lexingtons aircraft were only able to further damage her with another bomb hit. None of the torpedo bombers from either carrier hit anything. The Japanese CAP was effective and shot down 3 Wildcats and 2 Dauntlesses for the loss of 2 <b>Zeros.</b>|$|E

At this time, Nagumo's carriers were attacked by six US Navy Grumman TBF Avengers from Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) that had been temporarily detached from the Hornet to Midway, and four United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) Martin B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after Hiryū while the Marauders attacked Akagi. The thirty CAP <b>Zeros</b> {{in the air at}} this time, including the six from Sōryū, immediately attacked the American airplanes, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s.

5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet, together with , under the command of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta. She was tasked to support Operation AL, an attack planned to seize several Aleutian Islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while {{the main body of the}} American fleet was occupied defending Midway. Jun'yō carried 18 A6M2 <b>Zeros</b> and 18 D3As for this operation. At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 <b>Zeros</b> and a dozen D3As to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. They had to turn back due to bad weather, although an American PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by a Zero. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 <b>Zeros,</b> 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. As the aircraft from Jun'yō were regrouping after the attack, they were attacked by 8 Curtiss P-40 fighters that shot down 2 <b>Zeros</b> and a pair of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and failed to make it back to the carrier. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by <b>Zeros,</b> and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E
5|$|At 08:50, {{the lead}} U.S. attack {{formation}} from Hornet spotted four ships from Abe's Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers {{and prepared to}} attack. Three <b>Zeros</b> from Zuihō attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing {{them away from the}} bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty <b>Zeros</b> from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on Shōkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking her flight deck and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of Shōkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.|$|E
