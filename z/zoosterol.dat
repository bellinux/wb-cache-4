The presence of this compound in human skin enables humans to manufacture vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) from ultraviolet rays in the sun light, via an intermediate isomer pre-vitamin D3. It {{is also found in}} the milk of several mammalian species. In insects it is a precursor for the hormone ecdysone, required for reaching adulthood. It was discovered by Nobel-laureate organic chemist Adolf Windaus.|$|E
50|$|Sterols {{of plants}} are called {{phytosterols}} and sterols of animals are called zoosterols. The most important <b>zoosterol</b> is cholesterol; notable phytosterols include campesterol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol. Ergosterol is a sterol {{present in the}} cell membrane of fungi, where it serves a role similar to cholesterol in animal cells.|$|E

40|$|This article {{surveys the}} present {{knowledge}} of the sterol metabolism of insects. It is emphasized that {{a high degree of}} purity of the dietary sterols and the climination of the influence of symbionts are essential to present ambiguity in interpreting results. It is pointed out that a sharp distinction between <b>zoosterols,</b> mycosterols and phytosterols can no longer be made. A remarkable fact is the occurrence of insect hormones and their derivatives in plants. Knowledge of the sterol metabolism may help in developing selectiue insecticides. Finally, this paper gives results on the conversion of C 28 - and C 29 -sterols into Cnτ-sterols by insects; these results haue not been published preuiously...|$|R
40|$|Functionalized PHB {{granules}} {{provide the}} basis for the efficient side-chain cleavage of cholesterol and analogs in recombinant Bacillus megaterium Adrian Gerber 1, Michael Kleser 1, Rebekka Biedendieck 2, Rita Bernhardt 1 and Frank Hannemann 1 * Background: Cholesterol, the precursor of all steroid hormones, is the most abundant steroid in vertebrates and exhibits highly hydrophobic properties, rendering it a difficult substrate for aqueous microbial biotransformations. In the present study, we developed a Bacillus megaterium based whole-cell system that allows the side-chain cleavage of this sterol and investigated the underlying physiological basis of the biocatalysis. Results: CYP 11 A 1, the side-chain cleaving cytochrome P 450, was recombinantly expressed in the Gram-positive soil bacterium B. megaterium combined with the required electron transfer proteins. By applying a mixture of 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and Quillaja saponin as solubilizing agents, the <b>zoosterols</b> cholesterol and 7 -dehy-drocholesterol, {{as well as the}} phytosterol β-sitosterol could be efficiently converted to pregnenolone or 7 -dehydro-pregnenolone. Fluorescence-microscopic analysis revealed that cholesterol accumulates in the carbon and energ...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} microbial sterol {{side chain}} cleavage {{is an attractive}} way of converting cheap and abundantly available sterols inlo AD and ADD. These two compounds are excellent intermediates of high added value in the synthesis of nearly all steroid hormone drugs. Sterols of choice are the <b>zoosterol</b> cholesterol and phytosterols such as B-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol. However, the microbial side chain cleavage is characterized by some fundamental problems. Zie: Summary and conclusions...|$|E
