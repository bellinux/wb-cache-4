5|$|Soil {{cover in}} the city region is {{predominantly}} sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants {{dating back to the}} late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Seismic <b>Zone</b> <b>III</b> region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.|$|E

5|$|The {{two major}} rivers {{draining}} Tiruchirappalli are the Kaveri and its tributary the Kollidam, {{but the city}} is also drained by the Uyyakondan Channel, Koraiyar and Kudamuritti river channels. The land immediately surrounding the Kaveri River—which crosses Tiruchirappalli from west to east—consists of deposits of fertile alluvial soil on which crops such as finger millet and maize are cultivated. Further south, the surface is covered by poor-quality black soil. A belt of Cretaceous rock known as the Trichinopoly Group runs to the north-east of the city, and to the south-east there are layers of archaean rocks, granite and gneiss covered by a thin bed of conglomeratic laterite. The region falls under Seismic <b>Zone</b> <b>III,</b> which is moderately vulnerable to earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Australia's growing {{involvement}} in Vietnam reflected the American build-up. In 1963, the Australian government had committed a small advisory team, {{known as the}} Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV), to help train the South Vietnamese forces. However, in June 1965 the decision to commit ground troops was made, and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment—originally commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan 'Lou' Brumfield—was dispatched. Supporting 1 RAR was the 1 Troop, A Squadron, 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse equipped with M113 armored personnel carriers, artillery from the 105th Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery and 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery, and 161st Reconnaissance Flight operating Cessna 180s and Bell H-13 Sioux light observation helicopters; in total 1,400 personnel. The Australian units and New Zealand artillery were attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Ellis W. Williamson in Bien Hoa and operated throughout the III Corps Tactical <b>Zone</b> (<b>III</b> CTZ) to help establish the Bien Hoa–Vung Tau enclave. Although logistics and resupply were primarily provided by the Americans, a small logistic unit—1st Australian Logistics Company—was situated at Bien Hoa airbase. Unlike later Australian units that served in Vietnam, which included conscripts, 1 RAR was manned by regular personnel only.|$|E
25|$|The soil {{characteristics}} are influenced {{to a limited}} extent by the topography, vegetation and parent rock. The variation in soil profile characteristics are much more pronounced because of the regional climatic differences. Punjab {{is divided into three}} distinct regions on the basis of soil types: southwestern, central, and eastern. Punjab falls under seismic zones II, III, and IV.

25|$|Chennai is {{classified}} as being in Seismic <b>Zone</b> <b>III,</b> indicating a moderate risk of damage from earthquakes. Owing to the geotectonic zone the city falls in, the city is considered a potential geothermal energy site. The crust has granite rocks indicating volcanic activities in the past. It is expected that temperatures of around 200 to 300C° will be available if the ground were drilled 4 to 5km deep. The region has the oldest rocks in the country dating back to nearly a billion years.|$|E
25|$|Situated on a coast that {{constitutes}} chiefly of sandy shelving breaker-swept beaches, the region surrounding the port falls under Seismic <b>Zone</b> <b>III</b> indicating a moderate risk of earthquake. The port was developed {{into the sea}} by reclaiming land {{as there is no}} sheltered harbour. The depth of the draft is up to 17m, and the soil in the entrance channel is predominantly sandy and silt. The port is bordered by the Cooum delta in the south and Royapuram fishing harbour in the north. Visibility in the harbour region is good throughout the year and low visibility is commonly associated with heavy rains during the northeast monsoon.|$|E

25|$|Born in Karachi, Aamir, a left-handed batsman and left-arm {{orthodox}} spinner, played underage matches {{for several}} Karachi-based sides. Although he was 20 {{years old at}} the time, he played a single match for the Karachi Greens under-19s side in Pakistan's Grade-II Under-19 Tournament in September 2002. The following year, Aamir, now 21, played under-19 district matches for Karachi's Zone IV. He captained the side in one match, against <b>Zone</b> <b>III,</b> and scored 101 not out from a team total of 213, coming in third in the batting order. His Zone IV teammates in later matches included two future Pakistan Test players, Khurram Manzoor and Fawad Alam. Aamir played no senior-level matches in Pakistani domestic competitions, with his last under-19 match in the country coming in July 2003.|$|E
25|$|In May 1943, {{there were}} about 30 regular militia battalions of varying strength. At the time, 12 were {{deployed}} in the Italian zones of occupation, primarily in <b>Zone</b> <b>III,</b> while the remainder were working with the Home Guard light infantry and mountain brigades and the German-Croatian SS police. This pattern of deployment applied until the amalgamation of the Home Guard and militia in December 1944. In June 1943, the Ustaša Surveillance Service was abolished, and its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Interior. However, the Ustaša Defence Brigades under Luburić continued to operate independently. By September 1943, shortly after the Italian surrender, the Ustaše militia included 25 battalions (22,500 men) of the regular militia, plus Pavelić's personal guard of about 6,000 men, and the gendarmerie of about 18,000 men {{as well as many}} other smaller armed groups.|$|E

25|$|The main {{administrative}} {{authority of the}} city is the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation (IMC) with some help from Capital Development Authority (CDA), which oversees the planning, development, construction, and administration of the city. Islamabad Capital Territory is divided into eight zones: Administrative Zone, Commercial District, Educational Sector, Industrial Sector, Diplomatic Enclave, Residential Areas, Rural Areas and Green Area. Islamabad city is divided into five major zones: Zone I, Zone II, <b>Zone</b> <b>III,</b> Zone IV, and Zone V. Out of these, Zone IV is the largest in area. Zone I consists mainly of all the developed residential sectors while Zone II consists of the under-developed residential sectors. Each residential sector is identified by a letter of the alphabet and a number, and covers an area of approximately 2km× 2km (mi× mi). The sectors are lettered from A to I, and each sector is divided into four numbered sub-sectors.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1965, Australia's {{involvement}} in the war increased as the government committed a full infantry battalion, the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Early the following year, this was expanded as the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) was established, operating in its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy province, {{which was in the}} III Corps Tactical <b>Zone</b> (<b>III</b> CTZ). But despite the concentration of Australian forces, the AATTV members remained dispersed, often serving with only one other advisor, either Australian or American. Unlike 1 ATF, the majority of team members were deployed in I CTZ and the Central Highlands, where the fighting was often of a higher tempo and more protracted. Thus, due to its small size and widespread area of operations, it was rare for the entire AATTV {{to be in the same}} place at the same time; this usually occurred only on ANZAC Day– the only other occasion the whole unit paraded together was when it received the Meritorious Unit Commendation from the Commander of the US Forces in Vietnam on 30 September 1970. From October 1970 a small group of New Zealanders, consisting of one officer and four SNCOs, were attached the AATTV.|$|E
