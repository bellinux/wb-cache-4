25|$|Proper {{nutrition}} {{is important}} for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea. It is especially important to young children {{who do not have}} a fully developed immune system. <b>Zinc</b> <b>deficiency,</b> a condition often found in children in developing countries can, even in mild cases, {{have a significant impact on}} the development and proper functioning of the human immune system. Indeed, this relationship between <b>zinc</b> <b>deficiency</b> and reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes. However, there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency. Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.|$|E

40|$|Background: Older {{subjects}} have a {{high risk}} of developing <b>zinc</b> and copper <b>deficiencies.</b> Aim: To determine the prevalence of copper and <b>zinc</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in adults aged over 60 years, living in Metropolitan Santiago. Subjects and Methods: Analyses were performed using anonymous serum samplesfrom older subjects living in Santiago, Chile, who participated in the multicenter project SABE. Of the studied subjects, 49. 3 % had enough left over serum to measure serum zinc and copper concentrations by atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: A total of 444 men and 198 women were studied. A positive correlation between serum zinc and copper was found in both women (r = 0. 44, p < 0. 001) and men (r = 0. 48, p < 0. 001). There were no differences in serum zinc concentration by sex and age. The prevalence of subnormal serum zinc valúes was 66. 9 % in women and 66. 7 % in men. Women had a significantly higher serum copper valúes than men (p < 0. 02) and there were no differences by age. Prevalence of subnormal serum copper valúes was higher in women than in men (32. 9 and 23. 7 % respectively, p < 0. 05). Women had significantly higher copper I zinc serum ratio than men (p < 0. 001).

25|$|Secondary vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and chronic alcoholism. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin and depends on micellar solubilization for dispersion into the small intestine, which results in poor use of vitamin A from low-fat diets. <b>Zinc</b> <b>deficiency</b> can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because {{it is essential for}} the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of retinol to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of vitamin A deficiency and lead physiological signs and symptoms of deficiency. A study in Burkina Faso showed major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children.|$|E
25|$|Dysgeusia, {{also known}} as parageusia, is a {{distortion}} {{of the sense of}} taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with ageusia, which is the complete lack of taste, and hypogeusia, which is a decrease in taste sensitivity. An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary symptom. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and diagnosis is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other sensory systems. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and <b>zinc</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.|$|E
25|$|Approximately {{one half}} of drug-related taste distortions are caused by a <b>zinc</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Many {{medications}} are known to chelate, or bind, zinc, preventing the element from functioning properly. Due to the causal relationship of insufficient zinc levels to taste disorders, {{research has been conducted}} to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation as a possible treatment for dysgeusia. In a randomized clinical trial, fifty patients suffering from idiopathic dysgeusia were given either zinc or a lactose placebo. The patients prescribed the zinc reported experiencing improved taste function and less severe symptoms compared to the control group, suggesting that zinc may be a beneficial treatment. The efficacy of zinc, however, has been ambiguous in the past. In a second study, 94% of patients who were provided with zinc supplementation did not experience any improvement in their condition. This ambiguity is most likely due to small sample sizes and the wide range of causes of dysgeusia. A recommended daily oral dose of 25–100mg appears to be an effective treatment for taste dysfunction provided that there are low levels of zinc in the blood serum. There is not a sufficient amount of evidence {{to determine whether or not}} zinc supplementation is able to treat dysgeusia when low zinc concentrations are not detected in the blood.|$|E

500|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{appears to}} be the most common {{micronutrient}} deficiency in crop plants; it is particularly common in high-pH soils.

[...] Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Mexico, as {{in other}} {{developing}} countries, micronutrient deficiencies are common in infants between 6 and 24 months of age and are an important public health problem. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of anemia and of iron, folic acid, and <b>zinc</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in Mexican children under 2 years of age who use the health care services provided by the Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS). Methods A nationwide survey was conducted with a representative sample of children younger than 2 years of age, beneficiaries, and users of health care services provided by IMSS through its regular regimen (located in urban populations) and its Oportunidades program (services offered in rural areas). A subsample of 4, 955 clinically healthy children was studied to determine their micronutrient status. A venous blood sample was drawn to determine hemoglobin, serum ferritin, percent of transferrin saturation, zinc, and folic acid. Descriptive statistics include point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals for the sample and projections for the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Results Twenty percent of children younger than 2 years of age had anemia, and 27. 8 % (rural) to 32. 6 % (urban) had iron deficiency; more than 50 % of anemia was not associated with low ferritin concentrations. Iron stores were more depleted as age increased. Low serum zinc and folic acid deficiencies were 28 % and 10 %, respectively, in the urban areas, and 13 % and 8 %, respectively, in rural areas. The prevalence of simultaneous iron and <b>zinc</b> <b>deficiencies</b> was 9. 2 % and 2. 7 % in urban and rural areas. Children with anemia have higher percentages of folic acid deficiency than children with normal iron status. Conclusion Iron and <b>zinc</b> <b>deficiencies</b> constitute the principal micronutrient deficiencies in Mexican children younger than 2 years old who use the health care services provided by IMSS. Anemia not associated with low ferritin values was more prevalent than iron-deficiency anemia. The presence of micronutrient deficiencies at this early age calls for effective preventive public nutrition programs to address them. </p...|$|R

50|$|Phytic acid has {{a strong}} binding {{affinity}} to important minerals, such as calcium, iron, and zinc, although the binding of calcium with phytic acid is pH-dependent. The binding of phytic acid with iron is more complex, although there certainly is a strong binding affinity, molecules like phenols and tannins also influence the binding. When iron and zinc bind to phytic acid they form insoluble precipitates and are far less absorbable in the intestines.
