50|$|Plenum {{supply air}} {{temperature}} rise is the increase of the conditioned air due to convective heat gain as it travels through the underfloor supply plenum from the plenum inlet to the floor diffusers. This phenomenon is also named thermal decay. Plenum air temperature rise is caused by cool supply air coming into contact with warmer than air concrete slab and raised floor. According to a modeling study, air temperature rise can be quite significant (as much as 5 °C or 9 °F) and subsequently, compared to an idealized simulated UFAD case with no air temperature rise, elevated diffuser air temperatures can lead to higher supply airflow rate and increased fan and chiller energy consumption. The same study found that air temperature rise in summer is higher than in winter and it also depends on the climate. The ground floor with a slab on grade has less temperature rise compared to middle and top floors, and an increase of the {{supply air temperature}} causes {{a decrease in the}} temperature rise. The temperature rise is not significantly affected by the perimeter <b>zone</b> <b>orientation,</b> the internal heat gain and the window-to-wall ratio. Supply plenum air temperature rise, thus, has implications on the energy saving potential of UFAD systems and their ability to meet cooling requirements with supply temperatures above those of conventional overhead systems. Current research suggests that both energy and thermal performance can be improved in UFAD systems by ducting air to perimeter zones where loads tend to be the greatest. Critics suggest however that such underfloor ducting reduces the benefit of having a low-pressure plenum space, as well as adding design and installation complications when fitting ducts between floor tile pedestals.|$|E

40|$|Spray {{polyurethane}} foams (SPFs) have {{advantages over}} alternative insulation methods {{because they provide}} air sealing in complex assemblies, particularly roofs. Spray foam can provide the thermal, air, and vapor control layers in both new and retrofit construction. Unvented roof strategies with open cell and closed cell SPF insulation sprayed to the underside of roof sheathing have been used since the mid- 1990 s to provide durable and efficient building enclosures. However, there have been isolated incidents of failures (either sheathing rot or SPF delamination) that raise some general concerns about the hygrothermal performance and durability of these systems. The primary risks for roof systems are rainwater leaks, condensation from diffusion and air leakage, and built-in construction moisture.

40|$|The roll of melt in {{deformation}} of the mantle {{is important for}} understanding mantle processes and evolution. The Beni Bousera Ultramafic Massif, northern Morocco, shows petrologic evidence that melt was {{an important part of}} its history. The massif, dominantly composed of spinel lherzolite with harzburgitic sections, has 10 to 100 meter scale zones which contain abundant pyroxenite dykes, dunite, harzburgite, and secondary lherzolite. These zones are interpreted as areas of focused melt percolation. Lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine crystals from a sample transect across one of these zones was analyzed in comparison with LPO from the surrounding host lherzolite and harzburgite. The LPO from peridotites within the zone was slightly different from those outside the zone, and the LPO from the dunite analyzed was significantly different from the peridotites. Within the melt percolation <b>zone,</b> <b>orientation</b> of the olivine a-axis with respect to the mineral foliation indicates that strain increases towards the center of the zone and that shear sense changes across the zone. This suggests that focused melt flow can induce deformation in its host peridotite. by Jessica R. Stanley. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{installation}} of a raised floor system can change the thermal behaviour of the building by reducing {{the interaction between the}} heat gains and the thermally massive concrete slab. In this study, the influence of the raised floor on the summer design day zone cooling load profile is evaluated for an office building located in San Francisco by using the whole-building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus. The zone cooling load profiles and the thermal performance with and without the raised floor are compared and analyzed. The effects of structure type, windowto- wall ratio and the presence of carpet on the thermal behaviour of the raised floor are also investigated. The results show that the mere presence of the raised floor largely affects the zone cooling load profile and the peak cooling load over the range of - 7 % to + 40 %. The most significant parameters are the <b>zone</b> <b>orientation,</b> i. e. the exposure to direct solar radiation, and the presence of floor carpeting. If carpeting is present, commonly used in U. S. office buildings, the overall impact on zone peak cooling load is reduced, ranging from 0 to 5 % greater for the raised floor than without it. Without carpet the peak cooling load is 4 % greater with raised floor than without it in the north zone, 22 % in the east and west zones, and 12 % in the south zone...|$|E

30|$|Otherwise, {{the angle}} between {{fracture}} zone directions and the plate motion are different {{for the two}} subduction zones and amount to about 120 ° and 0 ° for the Ryukyu and Sunda subduction zones, respectively (Figures  1 and 2). Based {{on the distribution of}} the principle stress axes, the occurrence of earthquakes seems to be mostly controlled by the regional stress regime, i.e., the relative plate motion and the slab-pull mechanism that are caused by the plate collision and subduction processes (Chamot-Rooke et al. 1993; Lin et al. 2013; Yue et al. 2012). It means that even the presence of fracture zones in a subduction system could result in slab coupling in the fore-arc area; their orientation seems to have a relatively small influence on the tectonic stress regime, which greatly affects the seismogenic characteristics of a subduction system. In addition, Müller and Landgrebe (2012) show that the dimension of topographic highs of the oceanic subducting plate is the main factor controlling the megathrust seismogenic potential of a subduction system. What this means is that the fracture zones characterized by laterally continuous ridges and high degrees of structural integrity could cause a strong coupling effect; small volcanic chains present a relatively fragile internal structure, which results in a weak coupling. However, the impact induced by the fracture <b>zone</b> <b>orientation</b> appears to have been neglected. Therefore, we suggest that the difference of fracture zone directions with respect to the two subduction systems may not influence the subduction processes as well as change the seismogenic characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Underfloor air {{distribution}} (UFAD) is a mechanical ventilation strategy {{in which the}} conditioned air is primarily delivered to the zone from a pressurized plenum through floor mounted diffusers. Compared to conventional overhead (OH) mixing systems, UFAD has several potential advantages, such as improved thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ), layout flexibility, reduced life cycle costs and improved energy efficiency in suitable climates. In ducted OH systems designers have reasonably accurate control of the diffuser supply temperature, while in UFAD this temperature is difficult to predict due to the heat gain of the conditioned air in the supply plenum. The increase in temperature between the air entering the plenum and air leaving through a diffuser is known as thermal decay. In this study, the detailed whole-building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus, was used to explain the fundamentals of thermal decay, to investigate its influence on energy consumption and to study the parameters that affect thermal decay. It {{turns out that the}} temperature rise is considerable (annual median= 3. 7 K, with 50 % of the values between 2. 4 and 4. 7 K based on annual simulations). Compared to an idealized simulated UFAD case with no thermal decay, elevated diffuser air temperatures can lead to higher supply airflow rate and increased fan and chiller energy consumption. The thermal decay in summer is higher than in winter and it also depends on the climate. The ground floor with a slab on grade has less temperature rise compared to middle and top floors. An increase of the supply air temperature causes a decrease in thermal decay. The temperature rise is not significantly affected by the perimeter <b>zone</b> <b>orientation,</b> the internal heat gain and the window-to-wall ratio...|$|E
40|$|As a tool in discriminating basic rocks from {{different}} tectonic settings, {{a type of}} diagram was developed that employs three ratios of trace elements. The diagram separates basic rocks formed in mid-ocean ridge, intra-plate, and volcanic arc settings. It {{can be used to}} differentiate basalts from marginal basin, forearc, and arc rift zone settings. A second application of this type of diagram, employing major elements, distinguishes tholeiitic, calcalkaline, and boninitic series volcanic rocks. The southern part of the Foothills terrane, western Sierra Nevada, California, is composed chiefly of Jurassic-Triassic(?) metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of lower greenschist grade. Major tectonism affecting the terrane, associated with the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Nevadan orogeny, was sinistral transpression with shearing along the Bear Mountains and Melones fault zones. The line of slip in high shear strain regions is approximated by the modal stretching lineation, which is at a rake of approximately 45 ° SE to the general shear <b>zone</b> <b>orientation,</b> suggesting sub-equal components of strike slip and dip slip. The sense of shear from kinematic indicators is consistently east side to the northwest. The terrane hosts three types of syngenetic massive sulfide deposits: Cyprus-type Cu deposits, Kuroko-type Zn-Cu-Pb deposits, and Besshi-type Cu-Zn deposits. The Cyprus-type deposits lie {{at the top of a}} Triassic(?) tholeiitic - basalt sequence in the lower Penon Blanco Formation. The deposits are part of an ophiolitic sequence that appears to have formed in an open-ocean spreading center environment. Felsic lava facies host the Kuroko-type deposits at the top of the Middle to Late Jurassic upper Gopher Ridge Formation, a dominantly bimodal sequence of meta-rhyolitic lavas and tuffs and meta-basaltic lavas. The tectonic setting appears to have been an arc-rift zone that formed during the transition from arc volcanism forming the lower Gopher Ridge Formation to younger basinal sedimentation forming the Mariposa Formation. The Besshi-type deposits are sediment-hosted in the Late Jurassic Mariposa Formation. They appear to have formed in the median part of a long linear basin between rifted arc segments. The inferred tectonic setting of the sulfide deposits was an early back-arc or interarc basin, which may have been related to transtensional tectonics...|$|E

To test {{whether or not the}} bend was a result of a change in direction of the Pacific Plate, scientists analyzed the lava samples' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon. Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago. Tarduno and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral magnetite. While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools, tiny grains within the magnetite align with the Earth's magnetic field, and lock in place once the rock solidifies. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains' orientation within the magnetite. Paleomagnetists concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history, and that, 47 million years ago, the hotspot's southward motion greatly slowed, perhaps even stopping entirely.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} building shape, <b>zones,</b> <b>orientation</b> and window to wall ratio (WWR) on the lighting energy requirement and the thermal comfort in the naturally ventilated houses in tropical climate. The lighting electricity and the adaptive thermal discomfort hours (ASHRAE 55 80 % acceptability) of 300 different models of two-storey houses were obtained using Design Builder simulation software. The models were developed for three building shapes (square, rectangle and L-shaped) and the orientation of each model was changed for 24 orientations and four window to wall ratios. Results indicate that the rectangular shape with staircase positioned {{in the middle of}} the house will provide higher thermal comfort for WWR of 20 and for other WWRs the L-shaped models provide higher thermal comfort when the staircase is positioned at the short corner or middle. The square-shaped houses with staircase at the middle have the highest lighting electricity and the L shape has the lowest lighting electricity. Further, WWR changes the thermal comfort by 20 – 55 % and the percentage change in lighting electricity due to WWR is only 1.5 – 9.5 %. Therefore, thermal comfort should receive more attention in deciding the WWR. Moreover, the results show an effect when the zone sizes and location change.|$|R
40|$|A {{full suite}} of {{geophysical}} logs, including nuclear, electric, acoustic transit-time, acoustic waveform, and acoustic televiewer logs, and high-resolution flowmeter measurements {{have been used}} to investigate the lithologic and hydrologic properties of three igneous plutons located on the southern margin of the Canadian shield. Geophysical logs were used to identify lithologic boundaries, determine the properties of unfractured granitic or gabbroic rocks, interpret and calibrate the results of surface geophysical surveys, and characterize permeable fracture zones that could serve as conduits for fluid migration. Nuclear and acoustic transit-time logs provided good quantitative correlation with changes in lithology. Electric logs yielded consistent qualitative correlations, with lower resistivities associated with more mafic lithologies. Lithologic contacts indentified on logs generally confirmed the results of surface electromagnetic, seismic, and gravity surveys. All major fracture zones intersected by boreholes were clearly indicated by the geophysical logs. Electric, epithermal-neutron, and acoustic transit-time logs gave the most consistent indications of fracturing, but the lithologic responses associated with some thin mafic intrusions were difficult to distinguish from possible fractures, and some steeply-dipping fractures were not indicated by conventional acoustic transit-time logs. Electric and neutron log response is attributed to the effect of clay minearl alteration products in the vicinity of fractures. This alteration may be indirectly related to permebaility, but no direct relationship between resistivity or neutron attenuation and permeability appears to exist. Tube-wave attenuation determined from acoustic waveform logs was related to the transmissivity of equivalent infinite, plane fractures; these results agree qualitatively, and possibly quantitatively with packer isolation and injection tests if the combined effects of differing scales of investigation and borehole enlargements in fracture zones are taken into account. Tube-wave attenuation in waveform logs also compares well with the permeability distributions determined from tube-wave generation in vertical seismic profiles. Comparison of conventional geophysical logs, acoustic televiewer images of the borehole wall, and fracture frequency distributions measured on core samples indicates that many fractures are completely sealed and have no effect on log response, whereas many more apparently sealed fractures have been slightly opened during drilling, and do provide some log response. High resolution flowmeter meaurements of natural flow in boreholes and comparison of packer isolation tests with log data indicate that a relatively few individual fractures often provide a large proportion of fracture zone transmissivity in the immediate vicinity of the borehole, and that the orientation of these fractures may not coincide with fracture <b>zone</b> <b>orientation.</b> These results indicate that the scale problem in relating borehole logs to regional configuration of fracture flow systems {{may be the most important}} consideration in the appplication of geophysical well logging to the characterization of ground water flow in crystalline rock bodies...|$|E
40|$|Night setback is {{a common}} {{strategy}} used to reduce energy use in buildings. It involves increasing the cooling setpoint and decreasing the heating setpoint in a zone during unoccupied periods. To ensure occupant comfort and maximize energy savings, the zone temperature must {{be returned to the}} range defined by the occupied cooling and heating setpoints at occupancy, but not before. The time required to cool down or warm up a zone from a night setback condition {{is referred to as the}} return time and algorithms for predicting return time are commonly referred to as optimal start algorithms. Optimal start algorithms generally employ a model for predicting return time. This study describes the selection of separate return time models for cooling (i. e., a model for predicting the return time when cooling is required) and heating from 57 candidates. The following model forms were considered: Ï„ = f (Tf - Ti), Ï„ = f ((Tf - Ti), u), Ï„ = f ((Tf - Ti), Tout), and Ï„ = f ((Tf - Ti), u,Â Tout) where Ï„ is the return time, Tf is the zone temperature at the end of the optimal start period, Ti is the zone temperature at the beginning of the optimal start period, u is exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of the zone cooling or heating demand at the beginning of the optimal start period, and Tout is the outdoor air temperature at the beginning of the optimal start period. Computer simulations were used to generate year-long data sets relating return time to the model inputs. The simulations considered the influence of climate, building mass, controller tuning, <b>zone</b> <b>orientation,</b> and the unoccupied control strategy on the return time. In all, 140 cooling data sets and 104 heating data sets were generated. For each data set, least squares regression was performed to determine the parameters for each of the 57 models considered. The performance of each model was quantified using the average root mean square prediction error across all simulations. The study revealed that the best models for predicting return time use the zone temperature change and the EWMA of the zone cooling or heating demand as inputs. The EWMA of the zone cooling or heating demand provides an indication of the recent history of the cooling or heating load on a zone and can account for intermittent cooling or heating that is required to keep the zone temperature within the bounds of the unoccupied setpoints. Notably, outdoor air temperature, a common input in optimal start algorithms, is not used. Â To the best of the authors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge,Â zone cooling and heating demand have not been previously used as an input in an optimal start algorithm.

40|$|Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS) is a {{recognized}} low-energy HVAC system. Sizing {{of these systems}} is complex due to their slow thermal response. Limited cooling capacity of these systems and inadequacy of conventional sizing method, that assumes high factor of safety, is preventing early adoption of these systems. TABS, however, is proven to be energy-efficient and capable of preserving comfort in several commercial buildings of Europe. There is, however no comprehensive case study report on comfort performance of TABS in the US. With this being the background, my dissertation aims to identify and recommend a design method for TABS that balances between accuracy of multivariable complex design models, high computational cost of models requiring an iterative approach and computational ease of simple single to bivariate linear design models. The dissertation work involved: 1) a systematic qualitative review of seven TABS design models from the literature, and 2) a simulation based quantitative comfort performance assessment of three shortlisted design models. I reviewed seven design and control models and characterized them systematically with an aim to investigate their applicability in various design scenarios and at different design stages. All of these models size water supply temperature (WST) as this parameter {{will be used for}} selection and sizing of the cooling plant or the condenser unit. The design scenarios include variable internal heat gain, different building thermal mass, varying pump operating hours and varying solar gain due to orientation. Other parameters affecting cooling load and thermal performance of TABS that were held constant in this study included window-to-wall area ratio, zone volume, construction insulation, supply air temperature and volume flow rate of the ventilation system, external shading, location, TABS mass flow rate, pipe layout, active surface configuration and TABS thermal properties. I considered three design stages: feasibility study, early design decisions, and detailed design sizing and the selection criteria are reliability and ease of implementation. Results of the qualitative analysis indicated that based on the above-mentioned criteria, a hybrid model recommended by ISO 11855 is the best candidate for detailed design and sizing of the cooling plant. An outdoor temperature (Toa) compensated model, a zone operative temperature (OT) feedback based model and the hybrid model from ISO 11855 were isolated for transient simulation based quantitative evaluation in terms of a novel comfort exceedance metric. This metric accounts for both duration and severity of discomfort and is weighted by instantaneous occupancy. For comfort analysis in terms of zone OT, zone RH was maintained using humidistats. TABS was the only cooling system in the building. Twelve simulations were carried out in a standard 5 zone small office building for CZ 03 in EnergyPlus v 7. 0 under 2 different heat gains and 2 construction types.  Results of the simulation study indicated that both the Toa compensated model and zone operative temperature feedback based model provided equally good comfort in 14 out of 20 design scenarios including <b>zone</b> <b>orientation.</b> However, the zone OT feedback model responded better to the heat gain and thermal mass conditions as expected, and is therefore recommended as a more robust model for early and detailed design phase implementation.  The hybrid model recommended by ISO 11855 resulted in comfort exceedance of 10 % to 48 %, while the recommended threshold exceedance for this study was 3 - 5 %. This model also resulted in significantly reduced discomfort using 24 hours hydronic cooling energy of TABS instead of the design day 24 hours cooling energy of convective system...|$|E

40|$|International audienceText zone {{classification}} {{is a vital}} step in the dig-itization process, {{without which}} OCR systems perform poorly. Prior methods to document zone classification have relied on largesets of hand-crafted features for training zone classifiers. Suchfeatures are usually database-dependent, and their computationis time consuming. In this work we propose a novel method fortext zone classification that relies on the approach of unsupervisedfeature learning. Within our method, feature vectors of documentzones are automatically learned by patches extraction, encodingand pooling, where feature encoding {{is based on a}} codebookof visual words. The training phase of the text classifier takesinto consideration the unbalance between text zones and non-text zones of all types. The proposed method has been tested onpublicly available standard databases, and achieved competitiveor better results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Theresults show that our approach matches well the task of textclassification, and is robust to <b>zone</b> shapes, <b>orientations</b> and size...|$|R
30|$|Due to beam precession, (usually {{applied at}} 1 ° semi-angle) {{reflection}} intensities are integrated over diffraction {{conditions that are}} far from perfect <b>zone</b> axis <b>orientation,</b> therefore dynamical effects in PED patterns are highly reduced. Using PED reflections in combination with ADT- 3 D tomography is important as symmetry related PED reflections are easily revealed and this enables symmetry (Space Group) determination. Therefore, PED intensity comparison between possibly symmetry related ED intensities enables to distinguish between crystals having similar unit cell (e.g. as close as 1 – 2 %) but different crystal symmetries. In addition, during crystal tilt in ADT (−  60 ° to +  60 °), the use of PED (at 1 ° semi-angle) helps to recover more reliable “quasi-kinematical” ED reflections intensities within reciprocal space sections taken every 1 ° tilt step. On the other hand, orientation imaging ASTAR technique also uses PED reflection in comparison with ED theoretical templates as use of PED improves a lot resulting phase and orientation maps [2].|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the Italian and Spanish {{national}} regulations {{related to the}} transposition of Directive 2002 / 91 /EC on energy efficiency in buildings are compared. Three typical buildings were selected for the comparison: a semidetached house, an independent house and an apartment. These buildings were located in different climatic zones of each country and simulated with different orientations. The energy standards in Italy, Decree 192 / 05, valid for years 2006, 2008 and 2010, and in Spain, the Co´ digo Te´ cnico de Edificacio´ n, were also compared with the German standard called Passivhaus. The contribution to total energy demand of winter and summer energy demands was evaluated, along with a statistical distribution of the consumptions for the various climatic <b>zones</b> and <b>orientations.</b> The increase in the energy consumption limitations in Italy over the years was also analysed. The {{results show that the}} least restrictive Italian regulation, i. e. the one valid for the year 2006, is more restrictive than the Spanish regulation...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{analysis}} of the Palaeoproterozoic volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) hosting Kristineberg area, Sweden, constrained by existing magnetotelluric (MT) and seismic reflection data, reveals that the complex geometry characterized by non-cylindrical antiformal structures is due to transpression along the termination of a major high-strain <b>zone.</b> Similar <b>orientations</b> of the host rock deformation fabrics and the VMS ore lenses indicate that the present-day geometry of the complex VMS deposits in the Kristineberg area {{may be attributed to}} tectonic transposition. The tectonic transposition was dominantly controlled by reverse shearing and related upright to overturned folding, with increasing contribution of strike-slip shearing and sub-horizontal flow towards greater crustal depths. Furthermore, the northerly dip of the previously recognized subsurface crustal reflector within the Kristineberg area is attributed to formation of crustal compartments with opposite polarities within the scale of the whole Skellefte district. The resulting structural framework of the main geological units is visualized in a 3 D model which is available as a 3 -D PDF document through the publication website...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that energy-filtered {{transmission electron microscope}} imaging of a planar interface between two crystals can be optimized by orienting a sample so that the interface {{is parallel to the}} electron beam, but not directly on a <b>zone</b> axis. This <b>orientation</b> reduces diffraction contrast in the unfiltered (and zero-loss) image, which in turn, reduces residual diffraction contrast in raw energy-filtered images (EFI), jump-ratio images and elemental maps. This tilting procedure produces EFI which are more directly interpretable and, in many cases, possess superior spatial resolution and compositional contrast compared to EFI acquired directly on a zone axis...|$|R
40|$|Supported cobalt Fischer–Tropsch {{catalysts}} are characteristically nanoparticulate and {{the reduced}} SiC supported catalyst {{was found to}} contain both HCP and FCC polymorphs. This {{is reflected in the}} powder XRD patterns and generally there is a poor fit between the experimental and calculated diffractograms. This was ascribed to small crystallite sizes and the occurrence of disorder, manifested as peak broadening and peak shifts. Selected area electron diffraction data of suitably oriented cobalt catalyst grains on silicon carbide supports show non-periodic disorder in the <b>zone</b> axis <b>orientations</b> that contain the common (001) (HCP) and (111) (FCC) reciprocal lattice planes. Both FCC and HCP polymorphs are present in the same grains and these show disorder mainly in the HCP component. The disorder is further examined using high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy at atomic resolution and the stacking sequences elucidated. Random sequences of mainly FCC are interrupted by HCP sequences and twin surfaces with reverse stacking sequences are also present. This study highlights the presence of significant disorder in cobalt catalyst grains confirmed by HAADF microscopy. We acknowledge Sasol for funding. [URL]...|$|R
