5000|$|Zinc nitrate [...] (used as {{oxidizing}} agent), zinc chlorate , {{zinc sulfate}} [...] (known as [...] "white vitriol"), zinc phosphate [...] (used as primer pigment), zinc molybdate [...] (used as white pigment), zinc chromate [...] (one {{of the few}} colored zinc compounds), zinc arsenite <b>Zn(AsO2)2</b> (colorless powder) and zinc arsenate octahydrate [...] (white powder, {{also referred to as}} koettigite) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. The latter two compounds are both used in insecticides and wood preservatives. One of the simplest examples of an organic compound of zinc is zinc acetate , which has several medicinal applications. Zinc salts are usually fully dissociated in aqueous solution. Exceptions occur when the anion can form a complex, such {{as in the case of}} zinc sulfate, where the complex Zn(H2O)n(SO4 may be formed, (log K = ca. 2.5).|$|E
