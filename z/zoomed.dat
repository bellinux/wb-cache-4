5|$|Reviews for the 3DS version were positive, with {{a rating}} of 85/100 on Metacritic. The game was praised for its large and diverse {{character}} roster, its improvements to game mechanics, and its variety of multiplayer options. Some criticisms include a lack of single player modes and issues concerning the 3DS hardware, such as the size of characters on the smaller screen when <b>zoomed</b> out and latency issues during both local and online multiplayer. There were also reports of players damaging their 3DS Circle Pads while playing the game excessively. The 3DS version sold over a million copies in its first weekend on sale in Japan, and had sold more than 3.22 million copies worldwide {{by the end of}} October 2014.|$|E
5|$|Sega AM2's {{first attempt}} in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown {{with the release}} of Virtua Fighter for the same {{platform}} the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that <b>zoomed</b> and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, it was easier to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio.|$|E
5|$|Soma Bringer is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where players {{take control of}} members of a military unit dubbed Pharzuph Division 7. The three-dimensional environments are explored from a top-down perspective, and the overhead camera can be <b>zoomed</b> in and out on the playable character. Seven characters {{are available at the}} start of the game, with an eighth being unlocked later on. The game uses two modes of play. In single-player, the player controls the party leader while the two assigned companions are controlled using the game's artificial intelligence. In addition to the single-player mode, the game features cooperative (co-op) multiplayer. Activated through wireless connection, up to three players can freely explore environments and team up for dungeons.|$|E

The terms among camera manufacturers are “Smart Zoom” (Sony), “Safe Zoom” (Canon) and “Intelligent Zoom” (Panasonic and others). There is also camera with digital <b>zoom</b> 7.2x and smartzoom with approximately 30x total <b>zoom</b> (optical <b>zoom</b> 20x and digital <b>zoom</b> 1.5x) for 7MP from 16MP total resolution and also 144x total <b>zoom</b> (optical <b>zoom</b> 20x and digital <b>zoom</b> 7.2x) for VGA 640x480.|$|R

25|$|Electronic paper {{technologies}} {{have a very}} low refresh rate compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCD. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard mobile devices. An example of this limit is that a document cannot be smoothly <b>zoomed</b> without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.|$|E
25|$|The game {{incorporates}} a player-controlled camera {{system that can}} be rotated and <b>zoomed</b> at will; this allows the player to view the world from above, from the ground, or anywhere in between. Combat units (both ground units and aircraft) have inertia incorporated into their physics programming, although it lacks polygon-level collision detection for every object. The player can make their units to move anywhere in the map, given that Fire and Darkness is not designed using a grid-like system like other contemporary games such as Warcraft II.|$|E
25|$|All-you-can-eat seats have {{successfully}} boosted attendance in ballparks experiencing low turnouts, {{as well as}} increased occupancy of stadium sections that were previously under-used. At Dodger Stadium, for example, before 2007 the right-field bleachers were opened only when the left-field bleachers sold out, or for group sales. Following {{the conversion of the}} right-field bleachers into an AYCE section of 3,300 seats, occupancy <b>zoomed</b> to 85%. The Arizona Diamondbacks boosted ticket sales by 70% when it created a left-field AYCE section in 2009, while the Houston Astros averaged 95% capacity in its AYCE section.|$|E

This shape formed from a circle, with the diagonal lines moving out and joining the circle and the horizontal and vertical lines being drawn last, with the name added last.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, {{the detainees}} {{were taken to}} the {{headquarters}} of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in Matamoros for an informal press conference. More than 250 international journalists arrived at the scene to take pictures and ask them questions. The four suspects were paraded from the building's balcony and were allowed to answer questions from reporters. Elio stated that he was an ordained executioner under Constanzo and that Kilroy was murdered by Constanzo. As the cameras <b>zoomed</b> in on the suspects, Elio showed his membership scars on his shoulders, back, arms, and chest. These were arrow-like cuts made with a hot blade. The marks were given to selected cult members with the authority to perform human sacrifice.|$|E
50|$|The DX series {{cameras were}} the first EasyShare models released. It was {{originally}} a very basic point and shoot camera series, compatible with the original EasyShare Camera Dock. The CX series eventually replaced the lower-end DX models, and the newer DX-Series models had more advanced features and higher megapixel resolution and <b>zoom</b> features. The DX series is now discontinued; the higher-end DX Series models eventually became the Z-Series. Models in the DX series were the last Kodak consumer digital cameras to use CompactFlash external memory cards. Models include the DX3215, DX3500(2.2 mp, 38 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX3600 (2.2 mp, 35-70mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX3900 (3.3 mp, 35-70 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX4330 (3.1 mp, 38-114 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), Kodak EasyShare DX4530(5.2 mp, 38-114mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX4900 (4.1 mp, 35-70mm <b>zoom</b> lens), Kodak EasyShare DX6440 (4.23 mp, 33-132 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), Kodak EasyShare DX6490 (4.23 mp, 38-380 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX7440 (4.0 mp, 33-132 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), Kodak <b>Zoom</b> Digital Camera DX7590 (5.0 mp, 38-380 mm <b>zoom</b> lens) and the DX7630 (6.2 mp, 39-117 mm <b>zoom</b> lens).|$|R

25|$|Windows Explorer also {{contains}} modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the Details pane, which displays metadata and {{information relating to}} the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane {{as well as in}} large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be <b>zoomed</b> on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).|$|E

500|$|As a {{tactical}} first-person shooter, Terra Nova focuses on combat and takes place from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The protagonist wears powered battle armor (PBA) that features lock-on targeting, jumpjets for limited flight, infrared and <b>zoomed</b> vision, and a rechargeable energy shield that protects against attacks. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to aim weapons and manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface.

The shot {{was supposed to}} be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly <b>zoomed</b> into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio. Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between Gorman and Fresno, California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix. Footage of her driving into Bakersfield to trade her car is also shown. They also provided the location shots for the scene in which she is discovered sleeping in her car by the highway patrolman. In one street scene shot in downtown Phoenix, Christmas decorations were discovered to be visible; rather than re-shoot the footage, Hitchcock chose to add a graphic to the opening scene marking the date as [...] "Friday, December the Eleventh".|$|E
