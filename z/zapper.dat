25|$|When {{playing the}} Wii {{version of the}} game, instead of using a normal controller, {{such as the ones}} used by the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, an {{optional}} gun-like expansion controller known as the Wii <b>Zapper</b> can be used. The <b>Zapper,</b> or Wii Remote and Nunchuk, can be used to aim at targets to fire at them and simulate marksmanship.|$|E
25|$|A bug <b>zapper</b> is {{a device}} that attracts and kills insects that are {{attracted}} by light. A light source attracts insects to an electrical grid, where they are electrocuted by touching two wires with a high voltage between them. The earliest bug zappers {{appear as early as}} 1911. However, the first bug <b>zapper</b> patented was by Harrison L. Chapin and William F. Folmer who filed on September 23, 1931 and received U.S. patent #1,962,439 on June 12, 1934.|$|E
25|$|The Resident Evil Shot Blaster is a {{replacement}} to the Wii <b>Zapper.</b> The gun {{comes with a}} detachable Nunchuk holster. The holster also rotates downward to allow easy reloading for in the game. When the nunchuk holster is removed the gun becomes something like a pistol. The package also includes a decal that you can put on your Wii Remote which has a picture of characters from the game on it, and a Nunchuk joystick grip which has the logo of the Umbrella Corporation on it.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Zappers</b> are, {{according}} to media scholar Henry Jenkins, {{people who have}} a casual relationship with their televisions. <b>Zappers</b> do not remain on one channel for long, but continually skip from show to show, stopping for only a few minutes at a time on a particular channel.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{legislation}} {{aimed at}} suppressing <b>zappers</b> {{is in effect}} since 1 January 2014. A first offence {{will lead to a}} $5,000 fine, and subsequent infractions to a $50,000 fine. Persons in possession of <b>zappers</b> could be fined up to $50,000, and developers or sellers up to $100,000.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} special {{controllers}} {{designed for use}} with specific games were released for the system, though very few such devices proved particularly popular. Such devices included, but were not limited to, the <b>Zapper</b> (a light gun), the R.O.B., and the Power Pad. The original Famicom featured a deepened DA-15 expansion port {{on the front of}} the unit, which was used to connect most auxiliary devices. On the NES, these special controllers were generally connected to one of the two control ports {{on the front of the}} console.|$|E
25|$|After the crash, many American {{retailers}} considered {{video games}} a passing fad, and greatly reduced sales of such products, or stopped them entirely. To avoid {{the stigma of}} video game consoles, Nintendo marketed the AVS as a full home computer, with an included keyboard, cassette data recorder, and a BASIC interpreter software cartridge. The BASIC interpreter would later be sold together with a keyboard as the Family BASIC package, and the cassette deck for data storage would later be released as the Famicom Data Recorder. The AVS also included a variety of computer-style input devices: gamepads, a handheld joystick, a musical keyboard, and the <b>Zapper</b> light gun. The AVS <b>Zapper</b> is hinged, allowing it to straighten out into a wand form, or bend into a gun form. The AVS uses a wireless infrared interface for all its components, including keyboard, cassette deck, and controllers. Most of the peripherals for the Advanced Video System are {{on display at the}} Nintendo World Store. The toy-like white-and-red color scheme of the Famicom was replaced with a clean and futuristic grey monochrome design, with the top and bottom portions in different shades, a stripe with black and ribbing along the top, and minor red accents. The AVS also features a boxier design than the Famicom: flat on top, and a bottom half that tapered down to a smaller footprint. The front of the main unit features a compartment for storing the wireless controllers out of sight. Its software carries the Nintendo Seal of Quality to communicate the company's approval.|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote, {{also known}} colloquially as the Wiimote, {{is the primary}} {{controller}} for Nintendo's Wii console. A main feature of the Wii Remote is its motion sensing capability, which allows the user to interact with and manipulate items on screen via gesture recognition and pointing {{through the use of}} accelerometer and optical sensor technology. Another feature is its expandability through the use of attachments. The attachment bundled with the Wii console is the Nunchuk, which complements the Wii Remote by providing functions similar to those in gamepad controllers. Some other attachments include the Classic Controller, Wii <b>Zapper,</b> and the Wii Wheel, originally used for the Mario Kart Wii racing video game.|$|E

The group has performed all over North America and has also toured internationally. They perform to popular music like [...] "Escapade" [...] by Janet Jackson or [...] "Imma Be" [...] by The Black Eyed Peas. The Wild <b>Zappers</b> also occasionally tour and dance with the National Deaf Dance Theatre. Videos of Wild <b>Zappers</b> performing can be watched on YouTube.|$|R

25|$|Nintendo {{initiated}} a limited test launch process prior to nationwide release. The first test launch saw the NES and its initial library of eighteen games released in New York City on October 18, 1985, {{with an initial}} shipment of 100,000 systems. Each set included a console, two gamepads, a R.O.B., a <b>Zapper,</b> and the Game Paks Gyromite and Duck Hunt. The library of eighteen launch titles are 10-Yard Fight, Baseball, Clu Clu Land, Duck Hunt, Excitebike, Golf, Gyromite, Hogan's Alley, Ice Climber, Kung Fu, Pinball, Stack-Up, Tennis, Wild Gunman, and Wrecking Crew. Lucas M. Thomas wrote for IGN that he considered the Baseball title to be a prominent key of success at the test launch event.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of its life, a number of {{peripherals}} were released which added to the functionality of the SNES. Many of these devices were modeled after earlier add-ons for the NES: the Super Scope is a light gun functionally similar to the NES <b>Zapper</b> (though the Super Scope features wireless capabilities) and the Super Advantage is an arcade-style joystick with adjustable turbo settings akin to the NES Advantage. Nintendo also released the SNES Mouse in conjunction with its Mario Paint title. Hudson Soft, under license from Nintendo, released the Super Multitap, a multiplayer adapter for use with its popular series of Bomberman games. Some of the more unusual controllers include the BatterUP baseball bat, the Life Fitness Entertainment System (an exercise bike controller with built-in monitoring software), and the TeeV Golf golf club.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Chicago Tribune on the 1992 Consumer Electronics Show, Dennis Lynch saw the Super Scope and Menacer as a {{continuation}} of a Nintendo–Sega arms race and wrote that the peripheral's [...] "Uzi attachment" [...] was [...] "just what every kid needs". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Andy Pargh said the Menacer was [...] "definitely a winner" [...] {{in comparison to the}} Super Scope. Toronto Star William Burrill wrote that the [...] "Great <b>Zapper</b> War" [...] would be decided by the strength of the light guns' supporting games. Multiple reviewers ultimately recommended that players wait for more games to be released before purchasing the Menacer. William Burrill of the Toronto Star said not to bother unless the player [...] "absolutely love target shooter games". Mean Machines called the Menacer [...] "an expensive novelty" [...] until it had more games. The Herald Sun wrote in August 1993 that the Menacer looked to be [...] "an expensive, limited-use fad".|$|E

500|$|Game {{director}} Mark Pacini {{stated that}} the biggest concern Retro had during production was the controls, which had [...] "too many functions {{for the amount of}} buttons". Pacini also said the Wii <b>Zapper,</b> a gun shell peripheral, was never considered because it was announced when the game's development was almost done. Retro president Michael Kelbaugh said that the delays for the game's release gave them more time to tune the controller, which took a year. He also stated that while Retro did [...] "a great job on the multiplayer in Metroid Prime 2", focus was centered on the single player portion of the game, which was considered to be [...] "the core strength of the franchise". Art director Todd Keller declared the graphics to be focused in both texture detail and variety, with every single texture being hand-made and trying to [...] "make every room its own custom stage". During development, the Nintendo EAD team involved with Corruption suggested Retro to turn Hypermode into the core of the game, saying it would enhance the tension as it made players powerful but if used excessively would lead to a game over. Retro initially disagreed, saying {{it would be difficult to}} implement the feature without dampening the entertainment value, but after discussion decided to turn Hyper Mode into a regular functionality of the game.|$|E

2500|$|The Wii <b>Zapper</b> is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote. As {{shown in}} the image, the shell receives both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote's B button; all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell. The name is {{a reference to the}} NES <b>Zapper</b> light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a <b>Zapper</b> is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding your arm out like that can get your arm somewhat tired." [...] The <b>Zapper</b> is useful for most games primarily involving gun-style weapons, such as light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters.|$|E

2500|$|Using another {{approach}} {{to market the}} system to North American retailers as an [...] "entertainment system", {{as opposed to a}} video game console, Nintendo positioned the NES more squarely as a toy, emphasizing accessories such as the <b>Zapper</b> light gun, and more significantly, R.O.B.
