25|$|When using a {{comparator}} as a null detector, {{there are}} limits as {{to the accuracy of}} the zero value measurable. <b>Zero</b> <b>output</b> is given when the magnitude of the difference in the voltages multiplied by the gain of the amplifier is less than the voltage limits. For example, if the gain of the amplifier is 106, and the voltage limits are ±6V, then no output will be given if the difference in the voltages is less than 6μV. One could refer to this as a sort of uncertainty in the measurement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve on the poor {{harmonic}} performance of the two-level converter, some HVDC systems have been built with three level converters. [...] Three-level converters can synthesize three (instead of only two) discrete voltage levels at the AC terminal of each phase: [...] +½ Ud, 0 and -½ Ud. [...] A common type of three-level converter is the diode-clamped (or neutral-point-clamped) converter, where each phase contains four IGBT valves, each rated at half of the DC line to line voltage, along with two clamping diode valves. The DC capacitor is split into two series-connected branches, with the clamping diode valves connected between the capacitor midpoint and the one-quarter and three-quarter points on each phase. To obtain a positive output voltage (+½ Ud) the top two IGBT valves are turned on, to obtain a negative output voltage (-½ Ud) the bottom two IGBT valves are turned on and to obtain <b>zero</b> <b>output</b> voltage the middle two IGBT valves are turned on. In this latter state, the two clamping diode valves complete the current path through the phase.|$|E
2500|$|When the Boeing 757-200 entered {{service in}} 1983, it was {{equipped}} with the first suitable ring laser gyroscope. This gyroscope took many years to develop, and the experimental models went through many changes before it was deemed ready for production by the engineers and managers of Honeywell and Boeing. It was an outcome of the competition with mechanical gyroscopes, which kept improving. The reason Honeywell, of all companies, chose to develop the laser gyro {{was that they were}} the only one that didn't have a successful line of mechanical gyroscopes, so they wouldn't be competing against themselves. The first problem they had to solve was that with laser gyros rotations below a certain minimum could not be detected at all, due to a problem called [...] "lock-in", whereby the two beams act like coupled oscillators and pull each other's frequencies toward convergence and therefore <b>zero</b> <b>output.</b> The solution was to shake the gyro rapidly so that it never settled into lock-in. Paradoxically, too regular of a dithering motion produced an accumulation of short periods of lock-in when the device was at rest at the extremities of its shaking motion. This was cured by applying a random white noise to the vibration. The material of the block was also changed from quartz to a new glass ceramic Cer-Vit, made by Owens Corning, because of helium leaks.|$|E

40|$|Pooling diversified and {{specialized}} firm data to analyze multiproduct cost technologies raises two issues in applied research: (1) a functional form must be specified that accommodates <b>zero</b> <b>outputs,</b> and (2) assumptions {{must be made}} regarding {{the structure of the}} multiproduct technology when some outputs are not produced. This article introduces a methodology to estimate the translog multiproduct cost function in the presence of <b>zero</b> <b>outputs.</b> The method adds flexibility to allow for and test competing structural assumptions. The added flexibility can improve measurement of the global properties of multiproduct cost structures. An application to a cross section of U. S. railway firms demonstrates this key advantage.

2500|$|The viral {{particle}} binds to cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are characterized for each serotype of picornaviruses. For example, poliovirus receptor is glycoprotein CD155 which is special receptor for human {{and some other}} primate species. For this reason, poliovirus couldn’t be made in many laboratories until transgenic mice having a CD155 receptor on their cell surface were developed in the 1990s. These animals can be infected and used for studies of replication and pathogenesis. Binding causes a conformational change in the viral capsid proteins, and myristic acid are released. These acids form a pore in the cell membrane through which RNA is injected [...] Once inside the cell, the RNA un-coats and the (+) strand RNA genome is replicated through a double-stranded RNA intermediate that is formed using viral RDRP (RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase). Translation by host cell ribosomes is not initiated by a 5' G cap as usual, but rather is initiated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site). The viral lifecycle is very rapid with {{the whole process of}} replication being completed on average within 8 hours. However, as little as 30 minutes after initial infection, cell protein synthesis declines to almost <b>zero</b> <b>output</b> – essentially the macromolecular synthesis of cell proteins is shut off. Over the next 1–2 hours there is a loss of margination of chromatin and [...] in the nucleus, before the viral proteins start to be synthesized and a vacuole appears in the cytoplasm close to the nucleus that gradually starts to spread as the time after infection reaches around 3 hours. After this time the cell plasma membrane becomes permeable, at 4–6 hours the virus particles assemble, and can sometimes be seen in the cytoplasm. At around 8 hours the cell is effectively dead and lyses to release the {{viral particle}}s.|$|E

The combination of the fixed ratio of the epicyclic gear with a specific matching ratio in the CVT side results in <b>zero</b> <b>output.</b> For instance, consider a transmission with an epicyclic gear set to 1:−1 gear ratio; a 1:1 reverse gear. When the CVT side is set to 1:1 the two ratios add up to <b>zero</b> <b>output.</b> The IVT is always engaged, even during its <b>zero</b> <b>output.</b> When the CVT is set to higher values it operates conventionally, with increasing forward ratios.|$|E

While ray scale economies are observed for trust businesses, product-specific scale economies are not. Further, cost complementarities are not observed in almost all the pairwise combinations of the products.

Most of previous methods {{are based on}} the extraction of the pitch frequencies. But the extraction of the pitches is di cult since the musical sound has many harmonic components and these components are changed complicatedly depending on the tones and musical instruments. The principle of our method is the elimination of the pitch and its harmonic frequencies. This is performed simply by a comb lter (H(z) = 10 z 0 n). We can estimate the pitches by detecting the <b>zero</b> <b>outputs</b> of the cascaded comb lters independent of instruments. Then, we separate polyphonic music into each monophonic one using comb lters and we can estimate musical instruments based on instrument power spectra...|$|R

50|$|Many IVTs {{result from}} the {{combination}} of a CVT with a planetary gear system which enforces an IVT output shaft rotation speed which is equal to the difference between two other speeds within the IVT. This IVT configuration uses its CVT as a continuously variable regulator (CVR) of the rotation speed of any one of the three rotators of the planetary gear system (PGS). If two of the PGS rotator speeds are the input and output of the CVR, there is a setting of the CVR that results in the IVT output speed of zero.
