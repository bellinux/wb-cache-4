40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} the genetic defect {{leading to the}} congenital nuclear cataract affecting a large five-generation Swiss family. METHODS: Family history and clinical data were recorded. The phenotype was documented by both slit lamp and Scheimpflug photography. One cortical lens was evaluated by electron microscopy after cataract extraction. Lenticular phenotyping and genotyping were performed independently with short tandem repeat polymorphism. Linkage analysis was performed, and candidate genes were PCR amplified and screened for mutations on both strands using direct sequencing. RESULTS: Affected individuals had a congenital nuclear lactescent cataract in both eyes. Linkage was observed on chromosome 17 for DNA marker D 17 S 1857 (lod score: 3. 44 at theta = 0). Direct sequencing of CRYBA 3 /A 1, which maps to the vicinity, revealed an in-frame 3 -bp deletion in exon 4 (279 delGAG). This mutation involved a deletion of glycine- 91, cosegregated in all affected individuals, and was not observed in unaffected individuals or in 250 normal control subjects from the same ethnic background. Electron microscopy showed that cortical lens fiber morphology was normal. CONCLUSIONS: The DeltaG 91 mutation in CRYBA 3 /A 1 is associated with an autosomal dominant congenital nuclear lactescent cataract. A splice mutation (IVS 3 + 1 G/A) in this gene {{has been reported in}} a <b>zonular</b> <b>cataract</b> with sutural opacities.

40|$|During an ethylnitrosourea {{mutagenesis}} screen, Aey 5, a new mouse mutation exhibiting an {{autosomal dominant}} congenital cataract was isolated. The cataractous phenotype is visible at the eye opening and progresses to a nuclear and <b>zonular</b> <b>cataract</b> at 2 {{months of age}} with no difference in onset or severity between heterozygous and homozygous mutants. Histological analysis revealed that fiber cell differentiation continues at the lens bow region, but the cell nuclei do not degrade normally and remain in the deeper cortex. Further, the lens nucleus has clefts of various sizes while {{the remainder of the}} eye was morphologically normal. The mutation was mapped to chromosome 3 between the markers D 3 Mit 101 and D 3 Mit 77 near the connexin encoding genes Gja 5 and Gja 8. Sequence analysis revealed no differences in the Gja 5 gene, but identified a T [...] >C mutation at position 191 in the Gja 8 gene, which was confirmed by an additional Mva 12691 restriction site in the genomic DNA of homozygous mutants. This mutation results in Val [...] >Ala substitution at codon 64 of connexin 50 (Cx 50) also known as lens membrane protein 70 (MP 70). Aey 5 represents the second dominant mouse cataract mutant affecting Cx 50, a membrane protein preferentially expressed in the lens. Since both mutations affect similar regions in the first extracellular domain this region appears to be critically important for its function in lens transparency...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: During an ethylnitrosourea (ENU) {{mutagenesis}} screening, mice {{were tested}} for the occurrence of dominant cataracts. The {{purpose of the study}} was morphologic description, mapping of the mutant gene, and characterization of the underlying molecular lesion in a particular mutant, Aey 7. METHODS: Isolated lenses were photographed and histologic sections of the eye were analyzed according to standard procedures. Linkage analysis was performed with a set of microsatellite markers covering all autosomal chromosomes. cDNA was amplified after reverse transcription of lens mRNA. For PCR, cDNA or genomic DNA was used as a template. RESULTS: Nuclear opacity and posterior suture anomaly were visible at eye opening and progressed to a nuclear and <b>zonular</b> <b>cataract</b> at 2 months of age. The opacity as well as the microphthalmia was more pronounced in the homozygotes than in the heterozygotes. The mutation was mapped to chromosome 17 between the markers D 17 Mit 133 and D 17 Mit 180. This position made the alphaA-crystallin-encoding gene (Cryaa) an excellent candidate gene. Sequence analysis revealed a mutation of a T to an A at position 371 in the Cryaa cDNA. The mutation was confirmed by an additional MnlI restriction site in the genomic DNA of homozygous mutants leading to replacement of Val with Glu at codon 124 affecting the C-terminal region of the alphaA-crystallin. CONCLUSIONS: The Aey 7 mutant represents the first dominant mouse cataract mutation affecting the Cryaa gene. The mutation leads to progressive opacification of the lens. Compared with the beta- and gamma-crystallin-encoding genes, mutations in the alpha-crystallin-encoding genes are rare...|$|E
40|$|In the ocular lens, gap {{junctional}} {{communication is}} {{a key component of}} homeostatic mechanisms preventing cataract formation. Gap junctions in rodent lens fibers contain two known intercellular channel-forming proteins, connexin 50 (Cx 50) and Cx 46. Since targeted ablation of Cx 46 has been shown to cause senile-type nuclear opacities, it appears that Cx 50 alone cannot meet homeostatic requirements. To determine if lens pathology arises from a reduction in levels of communication or the loss of a connexin-specific function, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of the Cx 50 gene. Cx 50 -null mice exhibited microphthalmia and nuclear cataracts. At postnatal day 14 (P 14), Cx 50 -knockout eyes weighed 32 % less than controls, whereas lens mass was reduced by 46 %. Cx 50 -knockout lenses also developed <b>zonular</b> pulverulent <b>cataracts,</b> and lens abnormalities were detected by P 7. Deletion of Cx 50 did not alter the amounts or distributions of Cx 46 or Cx 43, a component of lens epithelial junctions. In addition, intercellular passage of tracers revealed the persistence of communication between all cell types in the Cx 50 -knockout lens. These results demonstrate that Cx 50 is required not only for maintenance of lens transparency but also for normal eye growth. Furthermore, these data indicate that unique functional properties of both Cx 46 and Cx 50 are required for proper lens development...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Many {{forms of}} {{congenital}} hereditary cataract {{are associated with}} mutations in the crystallin genes. The authors focus attention on congenital lamellar cataract, which {{is associated with the}} R 168 W mutation in γ C-crystallin, and congenital <b>zonular</b> pulverulent <b>cataract,</b> which is associated with a 5 -bp insertion in the γ C-crystallin gene. METHODS. To understand the molecular phenotypes-i. e., the functional defects that have occurred in the mutant γ C-crystallin molecule in two cases described-the authors cloned, expressed, isolated, and compared the solution state structural features of these mutants with those of normal (wild-type) γ C-crystallin. Structural models of the wild-type and mutant have been generated using comparative modeling. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic methods were used to determine the conformation of the proteins, and temperature dependent self-aggregation was used to observe the quaternary structural features. The structural stability of the proteins was monitored with the use of chemical and thermal denaturation. RESULTS. The authors found that the 5 -bp insertion led to a loss of secondary and tertiary structures of the molecule and to an enhanced tendency of self- aggregation into light-scattering particles, offering a possible factor in lens opacification. The R 168 W mutant, on the other hand, was remarkably similar to the wild-type molecule in its conformation and structural stability, but it differed in its ability to aggregate and scatter light. CONCLUSIONS. These results support the idea that unfolding or structural destabilization is not always necessary for crystallin-associated cataractogenesis...|$|R
40|$|A seven-generation {{family with}} 30 members {{affected}} by highly variable autosomal dominant <b>zonular</b> pulverulent <b>cataracts</b> {{has been previously}} described. We have localized the cataracts to a 19 -cM interval on chromosome 2 q 33 -q 35 including the γ-crystallin gene cluster. Maximum lod scores are 4. 56 (θ= 0. 02) with D 2 S 157, 3. 66 (θ= 0. 12) with D 2 S 72, and 3. 57 (θ= 0. 052) with CRYG. Sequencing and allele-specific oligonucleotide analysis of the pseudo γE-crystallin promoter region from individuals in the pedigree suggest that activation of the γE-crystallin pseudo gene is unlikely to cause the cataracts in the family. In addition, base changes in the TATA box but not the Sp 1 -binding site {{have been found in}} unaffected controls and can be excluded as a sole cause of cataracts. In order to investigate the underlying genetic mechanism of cataracts in this family further, exons of the highly expressed γC- and γD-crystallin genes have been sequenced. The γD-crystallin gene shows no abnormalities, but a 5 -bp duplication within exon  2 of the γC-crystallin gene has been found in one allele of each affected family member and is absent from both unaffected family members and unaffected controls. This mutation disrupts the reading frame of the γC-crystallin coding sequence and is predicted to result in the synthesis of an unstable γC-crystallin with 38 amino acids of the first "Greek key" motif followed by 52 random amino acids. This finding suggests that the appropriate association of mutant βγ-crystallins into oligomers is not necessary to cause cataracts and may give us new insights into the genetic mechanism of cataract formation...|$|R
40|$|During {{the mouse}} ENU {{mutagenesis}} screen, mice were {{tested for the}} occurrence of dominant cataracts. One particular mutant was discovered as a progressive opacity (Po). Heterozygotes show opacification of a superficial layer of the fetal nucleus, which progresses and finally forms a nuclear opacity. Since the homozygotes have already developed the total cataract at eye opening, the mode of inheritance is semidominant. Linkage analysis was performed using a set of genome-wide microsatellite markers. The mutation was mapped to chromosome 11 distal of the marker D 11 Mit 242 (9. 3 +/- 4. 4 cM) and proximal to D 11 Mit 36 (2. 3 +/- 2. 3 cM). This position makes the betaA 3 /A 1 -crystallin encoding gene Cryba 1 an excellent candidate gene. Mouse Cryba 1 was amplified from lens mRNA. Sequence analysis revealed a mutation of a T to an A at the second base of exon 6, leading to an exchange of Trp by Arg. Computer analysis predicts that the fourth Greek key motif of the affected betaA 3 /A 1 -crystallin will not be formed. Moreover, the mutation leads also to an additional splicing signal, to the skipping of the first 3 bp of exon 6, and finally to the deletion of the Trp residue. Both types of mRNA {{are present in the}} homozygous mutant lenses. The mutation will be referred to as Cryba 1 (po 1). This particular mouse mutation provides an excellent animal model for a human congenital <b>zonular</b> <b>cataract</b> with suture opacities, which is caused by a mutation in the homologous gene...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Cataract is {{the leading}} cause of {{blindness}} in children in east Africa. The results of surgery are poor, partly because of inadequate correction of aphakia.  METHODS—A retrospective survey of 118  eyes in 71  children with bilateral cataract. All eyes had implantation of an IOL at the time of cataract surgery. The average age at surgery was 3. 5  years. 28  patients(39 %) were less than 2  years old at the time of surgery on their first eye.  RESULTS—Preoperatively, 75. 4 % of eyes and 76. 1 % of patients were blind. A follow up of at least 3  months was available in 91  (77. 1 %) eyes. In these eyes, 44 % had a latest corrected vision of 6 / 18 or better and 91. 2 % had a latest corrected vision of 6 / 60 or better. Eyes with <b>zonular</b> <b>cataract,</b> and eyes operated after the age of 2  years were more likely to obtain a vision of 6 / 18 or better. 3. 3 % of eyes and 1. 8 % of patients had an acuity of less than 3 / 60. Nystagmus was present in 42. 3 % of patients before surgery. In those patients followed up for a minimum of 6  months, 10. 2 % still had nystagmus. The most frequent complication was severe fibrinous uveitis, which occurred in 36  (30. 5 %) eyes. 62  (52. 5 %) eyes had a posterior capsulotomy at the time of cataract extraction. Of the remaining 56  eyes, 20  (35. 7 %) had so far required a posterior capsulotomy. The leading cause of poor visual outcome was amblyopia. Two patients developed severe complications related to the intraocular lens.  CONCLUSIONS—Insertion of a lens implant at the time of cataract extraction appears to be well tolerated in the short term, and may offer significant advantages in an African setting. ...|$|E
40|$|Aniridia is a {{congenital}} pan-ocular, bilateral disorder. The term aniridia is a misleading misnomer, {{since at}} least a rudimentary iris is always present. Varied forms range from almost total absence to only mild hypoplasia of the iris. It is inherent {{in a number of}} syndromes, including Wilms tumor Aniridia-Genital anomalies-retardation (WAGR). Aniridia {{has been shown to be}} associated with mutations in the PAX 6 gene, located on chromosome 11 p 13, telomeric to the Wilms’ tumor predisposition gene (WT 1). The pair box gene 6 (PAX 6) situated at 11 p 13 has been confirmed to be the leading gene associated with aniridia. The PAX 6 mutation is present in individuals worldwide and has been studied in Indian, Malaysian, Chinese and Mexican families. Several categories of PAX 6 mutations include: nonsense mutations, splicing mutations, frameshift mutations (deletion or insertion), in-frame insertion or deletion, missense mutations and run-on mutations. A novel de novo frameshift mutation in PAX 6 most possibly occurred in the paternal gamete. Mutation in PAX 6 brings about amino acid substitution for instance proline to glutamine. Deletion of 11 p 13 involves the PAX 6 (aniridia) locus and the adjacent WT 1 (Wilms tumor) locus. Haploinsufficiency at the PAX 6 locus brings on aniridia, a pan-ocular eye condition characterized by iris hypoplasia and various other anterior and posterior eye defects, subtle hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and borderline Growth Hormone (GH) deficiency. Aniridia may also be affiliated with retinal tears and detachments. Electroretinograms (ERGs) done in aniridia illustrate definite retinal dysfunction. Other clinical aspects related to aniridia are ptosis with reduced levator function and anterior polar cataracts. The PAX 6 gene mutation was also associated with early-onset diabetes mellitus and aniridia. Aniridia combined with <b>zonular</b> <b>cataract</b> and polydactyly was also described in a patient with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Aniridia with sensorineural deafness (cochlear) and aplasia of the patella was also reported; an autosomal-dominant inheritance with 100 % penetrance. The WAGR syndrome is associated with obesity. Because of all the associations with other diseases as mentioned above, ophthalmologists should pay more attention to aniridia as a sign of a systematic disease. As aniridia is a global disease and has been reported in all five continents and several countries with different ethnic groups, herein we reviewed this important disorder...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} by linkage analysis the chromosomal locus responsible for autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC) in a four-generation Welsh pedigree. Methods The family pedigree was traced through {{two members of}} the family attending the hospital for treatment of their cataracts. Twenty-five members of the family were examined ophthalmologically and blood was collected with consent for genetic linkage analysis. Results Fifteen members of this family were known to have bilateral congenital cataracts, of whom 11 had a cataract extraction prior to examination. The youngest member of the pedigree was 5 years old and the oldest was 78 years old. Four children, unoperated {{at the time of this}} study, had a phenotypically identical morphology of their <b>zonular</b> pulverulent congenital <b>cataracts.</b> The known loci for congenital cataract were excluded.

40|$|Congenital cataract, {{defined as}} any opacity {{of the lens}} present within {{the first year of}} life, is {{responsible}} for approximately one-tenth of childhood blindness worldwide [1]. Depending on regional socioeconomic development, prevalence varies from one to six cases per 10, 000 live births in industrialized countries [2, 3] to five to 15 per 10, 000 in the poorest areas of the world [1, 4]. In the poorest areas, the major reason for isolated congenital cataracts is virus infec-tion, including rubella and influenza. In these cases, hygiene standards and vaccination must be improved to prevent congenital cataract [5]. Congenital cataract can occur in an isolated fashion or as one component of a syndrome affecting multiple tissues. Between 8. 3 % and 25 % of congenital cata-racts are believed to be inherited [6]. Although autosomal recessive and X-linked forms of inheritance exist, autosomal dominance is the major form of inheritance of congenital cataracts [7]. Up to now, at least 35 independent loci, including more than 20 genes on different chromosomes, have been associ-ated with isolated autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC) [8]. Of the cataract mutations reported to date, about half have mutations in the crystallin genes and a quarter in connexin genes, with the remainder divided among genes that encode heat shock transcription factor- 4 (HSF 4), aquaporin- 0 (AQP 0, MIP), v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma onco-gene homolog (MAF), paired-like homeodomain 3 (PITX 3), beaded filament structural protein- 2 (BFSP 2), chromatin modifying protein (CHMP 4 B), lens intrinsic membrane protein 2 (LIM 2), and other genes [9, 10]. The crystallin and connexin genes appear to be the most commonly associated with congenital cataract. Therefore, it is suitable to consider these genes the top candidates for developing congenital cataract screening strategies. In this study, we investigated a four-generation family with congenital nuclear and <b>zonular</b> pulverulent <b>cataracts</b> and detected a novel missense mutation in the connexin 50 gap junction protein, alpha 8 (GJA 8) gene that cosegregated with the disease in the family...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Patients with <b>zonular</b> weakness, {{undergoing}} <b>cataract</b> surgery, have a {{very high}} risk of the Intraocular Lens (IOL) dislocation during this operation. Strengthening the capsular bag is undeniably important in these patients. In this article, we suggest a novel surgical technique as a prospective treatment for zonular weakness in such patients. Methods: A triangular capsular flap is cut from the anterior capsule with the base directed towards the zonular break area. Basal peripheral iridotomy (PI) is performed in the same zone through corneal paracentesis. The tip of the capsular flap is caught with capsular forcept which is guided through both PI and corneal paracentesis. The tip of the flap is fixed in corneal stroma with a full thickness 10 /O suture. After the lens implantation, the triangular anterior capsular flap is sutured in PIat iris edges and residues of flap in the anterior chamber are cut along the iris plane. Sutures from cornea along with the cut part of the flap are removed. This technique may be more practical in ECCE but {{it is very difficult to}} perform in Phacoemulsification. In this condition, a very tiny iris clip can be used instead of suturing to grasp the capsular flap in PI site and suspend it from the iris. Results: This flap prevents dislocation of bag contents into vitreous and the possibility of vitreous loss through zonular defect and is a reliable support for PC/IOL. We can perform zonuloplasty in one quadrant zonal defect or 2 - 4 quadrants in the cases like Marfan Syndrome. Conclusion: Zonuloplasty is an innovative surgical procedure in cases with zonular instability more than 1 / 4 quadrant when CTR is ineffective...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare {{results and}} {{complications}} of implantation of hydrophobic acrylic foldable intraocular lenses {{in children with}} those of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) intraocular lenses. Methods: In a retrospective study, we analyzed results of cataract surgery with posterior chamber lens implantation in 30 eyes of 30 patients aged 1 - 16 years. In 10 eyes, acrylic (Alcon AcrySof) intraocular lenses, and in 20 eyes, single-piece PMMA posterior chamber lenses were implanted. Indications for cataract surgery (blunt or penetrating trauma, <b>zonular</b> <b>cataract,</b> cataracta polaris posterior, posterior lenticonus) and mean age at implantation were comparable in the two groups. Mean patient age at surgery was 8. 6 ± 4. 6 years (range 3 - 16 years) for the acrylic vs 6. 3 ± 4. 3 years (range 1 - 16 years) for the PMMA group. Mean follow-up was 1. 0 ± 0. 7 years (range 0. 1 - 2. 2 years) in the acrylic group and 1. 8 ± 1. 5 years (range 0. 1 - 5. 7 years) in the PMMA group. Primary anterior vitrectomy was performed in 7 eyes in the PMMA group and in 3 eyes in the acrylic group. In addition, one additional posterior capsulorhexis without anterior vitrectomy was performed in each group. Primary outcome measure was the occurrence of postoperative "complications" (fibrin, synechiae, posterior capsular opacification). For statistical evaluation, the Fisher exact test was used. Results: When evaluating all complications together (at least one complication vs no complication), there were significantly less complications in the acrylic group (2 of 10 vs 15 of 20; p= 0. 007. For early complications (postoperative fibrin, synechiae) the difference was also significant (1 of 10 in the acrylic vs 11 of 20 in the PMMA group; p= 0. 02). The rate of posterior capsular opacification necessitating YAG capsulotomy was lower in the acrylic group (1 of 10 eyes) than in the PMMA group (7 of 20 eyes), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 67). The postoperative time point of YAG capsulotomy was 21 months in the acrylic group and 19 ± 10 months (range 6 - 33 months) in the PMMA group. IOL dislocation was not observed {{in any of the}} patients. Postoperative visual acuity was comparable in the two groups: 0. 57 ± 0. 35 (0. 03 - 1. 0) in the acrylic vs 0. 39 ± 0. 34 (0. 001 - 0. 9) in the PMMA group (p= 0. 83). Conclusions: Implantation of hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lenses in the capsular bag in children may be associated with less postoperative complications compared with implantation of PMMA lenses. This appears also to be true in children under age 6 years. The visual results seem comparable and correspond mainly to the underlying ocular pathology...|$|E
