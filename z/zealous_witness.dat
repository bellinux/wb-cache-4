5000|$|According to Hoople, [...] "For {{several years}} after I {{was a member of}} a praying band". In the early 1890s Hoople began {{attending}} the noonday prayer meeting at the John Street Methodist Church at 44 John Street, Manhattan. There he met Charles H. BeVier (born September 5, 1858; died about 1905), [...] "a <b>zealous</b> <b>witness</b> to holiness and choir leader at the largest Methodist church in Brooklyn." [...] According to Nazarene historian Timothy L. Smith, [...] "Hoople thought BeVier's [...] "fanaticism" [...] a pity, and set out to argue his new friend into rejecting sanctification. Instead, Hoople wound up finding the blessing himself" [...] in his own shop in 1893. Hoople began attending some holiness meetings held in private homes in Brooklyn, [...] "where they could worship God in the freedom of the Spirit." [...] In July 1893 Hoople underwrote the expenses for the first ever camp meeting to be held in the small hamlet of Nanuet, New York, near his country home. At that time Hoople was a still a member of Central Congregational Church, which was pastored by Dr. Adolphus J.F. Behrends (born 1839 in the Netherlands; died c.1899 in New York). However, by October 1893 Hoople had left the Congregational church and was attending the Methodist church at Windsor Terrace, Flatbush. In 1895 Hoople indicated that because he became an adherent of “Methodist doctrine”, he was [...] "unwelcome in the Calvinistic church that nurtured his early faith in Christ".|$|E

[...] "I take it on my damnation," [...] said this <b>zealous</b> Protestant <b>witness,</b> [...] "that I will discover the marks of the beast on {{every one of them}} betwixt sixteen and seventy, as plainly as if they had crossed themselves with ink, instead of holy water. Since we have a King willing to do justice, and a House of Commons to uphold prosecutions, why, damn me, the cause must not stand still for lack of evidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{cause of}} the tumult was as follows:--The Mayor was a <b>zealous</b> Presbyterian, and <b>witnessed</b> the {{intrusion}} of the soldier with great indignation from the very beginning, though he hesitated to interfere with an armed man while on his legs and capable of resistance. But no sooner did he behold the champion of independency sprawling on his back, with the divine's Geneva cloak fluttering in his hands, than the magistrate rushed forward, exclaiming that such insolence {{was not to be}} endured, and ordered his constables to seize the prostrate champion, proclaiming, in the magnanimity of wrath, [...] "I will commit every red-coat of them all--I will commit him were he Noll Cromwell himself!" ...|$|R
