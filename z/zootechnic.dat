40|$|The {{effects of}} of {{lighting}} {{programs on the}} <b>zootechnic</b> performance and egg quality of semi-heavy laying hens were evaluated. Three light programs were tested: continuous lighting of 15 h (artificial+natural), intermittent lighting (two photophases of 15 s between the natural light) and natural increased lighting. 192 birds were used, accommodated in a shed divided into three environments {{in such a way}} that the lighting of any given one did not interfere with the others. The experimental period lasted 112 days, during which the <b>zootechnic</b> performance was evaluated through the egg production, feed intake, weight and mass of eggs. The quality of the eggs was valued through their specific gravity, weight and shell thickness, and Haugh unit measurement. The design was entirely randomized, with eight repetitions, and the averages of the treatments were compared by the SNK test (5 %). In the results of performance, the feed intake and egg weight were similar (P 0. 05) under the natural light program. The quality of the eggs was not altered (P< 0. 05) by any of the programs. It was concluded that the intermittent lighting program could be use in open sheds, maintaining the <b>zootechnic</b> performance of semi-heavy laying hens and without altering the quality of their eggs.

They are Bogorejo, Blora, and Banjarejo district. Bogorejo represents the highest population, Blora district represents the medium and banjarejo represent the lowest population of beef cattle respectlively. The random sampling was used to determine 3 village in each sub-district and 10 farmer for in each village. Based on the multiple linier regression show that informal education, formal education, farming experience, field procession, cattle procession, duration of family working and <b>zootechnic</b> simultaneously significsnt to beef cattle development (p< 0, 01).
