40|$|We {{present a}} {{microscopic}} model on radiation-induced <b>zero</b> resistance <b>states</b> {{according to a}} novel approach: Franck-Condon physics and blockade. <b>Zero</b> resistance <b>states</b> rise up from radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations when the light intensity is strong enough. The theory starts off with the radiation-driven electron orbit model that proposes an interplay of the swinging nature of the radiation-driven Landau states {{and the presence of}} charged impurity scattering. When the intensity of radiation is high enough {{it turns out that the}} driven-Landau states (vibrational states) involved in the scattering process are spatially far from each other and the corresponding electron wave functions do not longer overlap. As a result, it takes place a drastic suppression of the scattering probability and then current and magnetoresistance exponentially drop. Finally <b>zero</b> resistance <b>states</b> rise up. This is an application to magnetotransport in two dimensional electron systems of the Franck-Condon blockade, based on the Franck-Condon physics which in turn stems from molecular vibrational spectroscopy.
