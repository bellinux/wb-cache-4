The particle properties {{were analyzed by}} XRD, BET, and HR-TEM. The sensing films were produced by mixing the particles into an organic paste composed of terpineol and ethyl cellulose as a vehicle binder and were fabricated by doctor-blade technique with various thicknesses (5, 10, 15 µm). The morphology of the sensing films was analyzed by SEM and EDS analyses. The gas sensing characteristics to ethanol (25 - 250 ppm) were evaluated {{as a function of}} film thickness at 400 °C in dry air. The relationship between thickness and ethanol sensing characteristics of ZnO thick film on Al 2 O 3 substrate interdigitated with Au electrodes were investigated. The effects of film thickness, as well as the cracking phenomenon, though, many cracks were observed for thicker sensing films. Crack widths increased with increasing film thickness. The film thickness, cracking and ethanol concentration have significant effect on the sensing characteristics. The sensing characteristics with various thicknesses were compared, showing the tendency of the sensitivity to ethanol decreased with increasing film thickness and response time. The relationship between gas sensing properties and film thickness was discussed on the basis of diffusively and reactivity of the gases inside the oxide films. The thinnest sensing film (5 µm) showed the highest sensitivity and the fastest response time (within seconds) ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Over-the-counter (OTC) wood {{preservatives}} can provide wood {{with both a}} moisture barrier and fungicidal protection against biodeterioration, yet there is little comparative data {{on the performance of}} these preservatives. In this study, the potential of various low-toxicity, OTC preservatives was evaluated on five western wood species, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii),lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). The active ingredients tested were copper- 8 -quinolinolate, copper naphthenate, <b>zinc</b> <b>naphthenate,</b> 3 -Iodo 2 -propynylbutlycarbamate (IPBC), Bis (tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO), TBTO, TBTO, and TBTO trichloromethylthio-phthalimide (Folpet). Small blocks and stakes of each species were dipped for 3 minutes in one of twelve OTC preservatives to simulate homeowner application. To examine the efficacy of these preservatives, treated blocks were subjected to a modified American Society of Testing and Materials Standards (ASTM) D 2017 - 81 soil-block test to evaluate above ground decay resistance as measured by wood weight loss following exposure to Postia placenta (Fr.) Cooke or Trametes versicolor (L:Fr.) Pilat, a brown and white rot fungus, respectively. Test stakes were placed in soil-beds maintained in an environmentally controlled greenhouse. The stakes were evaluated for the degree of decay at 3 month intervals for the first year, followed by 18 and 24 month ratings. Preservative treatments improved performance of most species except lodgepole pine; improvements were most noticeable in soil-bed trials with redwood and western redcedar. The results suggest that topical application of commercially available preservatives has merit for enhancing the performance of naturally durable woods in soil contact, but their value for less durable woods is questionable. Wood used above-ground will benefit most from such topical treatments, however, for best performance a yearly reapplication might be necessary for the less durable wood species...|$|E
