40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} a <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>System</b> (ZES) was first {{introduced}} to the precast industry in Italy in September 2001. As the name implies, {{the premise of the}} system is to eliminate the need to input mechanical or thermal energy into the process of consolidating and curing precast concrete elements. This is achieved by the use of innovative chemical admixtures and a proper mixture design. The ZES has a number of distinct advantages over the conventional precast manufacturing process, which include economic, quality and safety considerations. Background: The profitable production of good quality precast concrete elements involves overcoming many challenges. Some of these challenges include increasing fuel and material prices, a shrinking pool of skilled labor and a need to improve working conditions. In an attempt to help address these challenges, as well as provide additional benefits, a new approach known as the “Zero Energy System ” has been developed [1 - 3]. The key components of this new system are chemical admixtures that make possible a new level of concrete performance. Many articles have already been published on this topic, so only a brief overview and number of references are given here...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a recent}} technical–economical {{analysis}} {{on the island of}} Pantelleria, a policy feasibility study for a complete upgrading of the energy system of this Mediterranean Island is carried out. Pantelleria, situated between Sicily and Africa, owns a large potential in terms of renewable energy resources, although there are some obstacles in turning it into a Near <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>system.</b> Starting from a deep energy system audit, the study proposes the project for a near zero energy island, through the efficient transformation of the different existing natural energy resources into electrical energy and heat: the solar, the wind-based and the geothermal systems. In this way, the island can be turned into an almost autonomous system. The main difficulties connected to the implementation of the project can be identified in the national energy policies {{as well as in the}} specific local situation, characterized by a strong private monopole on generation and distribution of electrical energy which has no incentive for supporting the costs connected to the energy requalification of the island. On the other hand, the local administrations, involved in the project through bottom-up European policies, do not have the cultural and economic tools to go on with the implementation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} an entangled system, {{which is}} analogous to a composite system {{of a black hole}} and Hawking radiation. If Hawking radiation is well approximated by an outgoing particle generated from a pair creation around the black hole, such a pair creation increases the total number of states. There should be a unitary mechanism {{to reduce the number of}} states inside the horizon for black hole evaporation. Since the infalling antiparticle has negative energy, as long as the infalling antiparticle finds its partner such that two particles form a separable state, one can trace out such a <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> by maintaining unitarity. In this paper, based on some toy model calculations, we show that such a unitary tracing-out process is only possible before the Page time, while it is impossible after the Page time. Hence, after the Page time, if we assume that the process is unitary and the Hawking pair forms a separable state, the internal number of states will monotonically increase, which is supported by the AMPS argument. In addition, the Hawking particles cannot generate randomness of the entire system and hence the entanglement entropy cannot reach its maximum. Based on these results, we modify the correct form of the Page curve for the remnant picture. The most important conclusion is this: if we assume unitarity, semi-classical quantum field theory, and general relativity, then the black hole should violate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound around the Page time at the latest, and hence, the infinite production arguments for remnants might be applied for semi-classical black holes, which seems very problematic.

40|$|Low <b>energy</b> {{building}} and <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> building have attracted increasing attention in both academic and professional fields following the ambitions of many governments in reducing building energy consumption and carbon emission. This paper presents an investigation on the optimal design of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> in {{two types of}} buildings: Low <b>Energy</b> Buildings and <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> Buildings. The first <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> building in Hong Kong, namely Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building (ZCB), is taken as a reference building in this study. The TRNSYS building model is used to generate the annual cooling load profile of the building. Simplified models are developed to simulate the building <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> including the air-conditioning systems and the renewable <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> in Matlab while the building annual cooling load profile is taken as the input.

H 577 P BSE 2015 Luxxvi, 221 pages :color illustrationsNearly/net <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> {{buildings}} (nZEBs) {{have been}} attracted increasing attention particularly when high performance {{is required in}} terms of energy-saving,indoor thermal comfortable, environment-friendly and grid-friendly. Increasing {{attention has been paid}} on how to design nZEBs in a cost/energy efficient and environment-friendly way. However, there is no exact approach at present for the design and control of the buildings to achieve nearly/net <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> targets. This is mainly due to the complex interplay of electricity generation/consumption <b>system</b> and <b>energy</b> storage <b>system,</b> automatically and manually controlled systems/elements in the highly integrated buildings. Effective optimization methods are essentially needed for the optimal design and control of <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> in nZEBs. The aim of this PhD project is to study and develop design optimization methods and optimal scheduling strategies for the <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> in nZEBs. A comprehensive literature review is presented first. Then, a nZEB simulation platform is developed for the test and analysis of system design and control optimization. Validation of system models is {{made on the basis of}} Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building. The performance of nearly/net <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> buildings is largely affected by the renewable <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> design. The sizes of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> for nZEBs are optimized by two optimization methods, including a single objective optimization using Genetic Algorithm and a multi-objectives optimization using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). Building <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> models and renewable <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> models are developed and adopted, allowing the consideration of the interaction between building <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> and renewable <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> in optimization. The performance of the buildings with the optimized renewable <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> is much better than that of the benchmark building in most scenarios. The single objective optimization can provide the "best" solution directly for a given objective while the multi-objective optimization provides rich information for designers to make better compromised decisions. Due to the intermittent and unstable nature of renewable energy resources, the performance of net <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> buildings may suffer a great degree of uncertainty compared to traditional buildings without renewable <b>energy</b> <b>systems.</b> Sensitivity analysis is conducted on an optimized renewable <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> (photovoltaic/wind turbine/bio-diesel generator) to investigate the impacts of the variations of input variables on the building performance. Four important design inputs regarding working conditions are concerned in the study, including wind velocity, other load, cooling load and solar radiation. Results show that, with 20 % variations in the four variables, the maximum change of the combined objective is about 26. 2 %. In addition, wind velocity is the most influential factor on the building performance regarding the total cost and/or CO 2 emissions, while the building loads (other load and cooling load) should be considered with top priority at the design stage concerning the overall building performance. The performance of the <b>energy</b> <b>system,</b> which integrates photovoltaic and bio-diesel generator, has been found not to be the most efficient. But, compared with the other three design options, its performance is the most robust when the working condition changes. The results also indicate that the use of active electricity generation <b>systems</b> in net <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> buildings could increase the performance robustness of the building <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> significantly. The increasing complexity of building <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> integrated with renewable <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> requires essentially more intelligent scheduling strategy. An optimal scheduling using nonlinear programming is proposed for the control of <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> in buildings integrated with electricity generation and thermal energy storage. A case study is conducted to validate the proposed strategy based on the Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building. Two types of grid-connections (i. e., selling electricity to grid is allowed and forbidden respectively) are considered. Results show that significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, primary energy consumption and operation cost are achieved by the proposed optimal scheduling strategy. Considering the discrete working ranges of some <b>energy</b> <b>systems,</b> the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approach is further used to solve the optimal scheduling problems. The enhanced scheduling strategy based on MINLP minimizes the overall operation cost day-ahead, including operation energy cost and cost concerning the plant on/off penalty. Four scenarios are investigated and compared to evaluate the performance of the enhanced scheduling strategy. Results show that the strategy can reduce operation energy cost greatly (about 25 %) compared with a rule-based strategy and the reduction is even increased to about 47 % when a thermal <b>energy</b> storage <b>system</b> is used. The strategy can also reduce the on/off frequency of chillers significantly. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.

50|$|In a supersymmetric theory, each nonzero energy {{eigenvalue}} {{contains an}} equal number of bosonic and fermionic states. Because of this, the Witten index is independent of the temperature and gives the number of <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> bosonic vacuum states minus the number of <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> fermionic vacuum states. In particular, if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken then there are no <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> ground states and so the Witten index is equal to zero.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNearly <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> Building {{will be a}} {{mandatory}} status for all new buildings constructed after 31 st December 2020 for European member states. This implies that, beside energy efficiency {{at the level of}} Low <b>Energy</b> Buildings, <b>systems</b> based on renewable energy sources must be implemented to provide energy savings and environmental benefits for space conditioning and water heating. Focusing on solar heating and cooling renewable-based systems, the paper presents an analysis aiming at identifying an optimal energy mix to reach the Nearly <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> status for Low Energy Buildings, by evaluating and comparing the economic efficiency at current costs. A case study with experimental validation is done for a new R&D Laboratory building. The analysis is done considering functional and economic issues...|$|R

The perspectives presented here are the results from an international work named Task 40 /Annex 52 “Towards Net <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> Solar Buildings” conducted {{within the framework of}} the International Energy Agency (SHC-EBC) and in particular from the sub-group working on Solution Sets and case studies. We will see through case studies in different climates that the design scale to reach the <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> goal is not the building anymore. The design of renewables as well as passive strategies must be extended to the whole neighbourhood...|$|R
