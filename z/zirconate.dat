25|$|An {{important}} {{ferroelectric material}} for applications is lead <b>zirconate</b> titanate (PZT), {{which is part}} of the solid solution formed between ferroelectric lead titanate and anti-ferroelectric lead <b>zirconate.</b> Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{independent}} research {{groups in the}} United States, Russia, and Japan discovered {{a new class of}} synthetic materials, called ferroelectrics, which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials. This led to intense research to develop barium titanate and later lead <b>zirconate</b> titanate materials with specific properties for particular applications.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three {{rare earth}} <b>zirconates</b> (Sm 2 Zr 2 O 7, Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 and Er 2 Zr 2 O 7) were {{prepared}} by solid state reaction. The crystal structure and ionic conductivity of these <b>zirconates</b> {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD) and complex impedance spectroscopy. The results show that Sm 2 Zr 2 O 7 exhibits single-phase pyrochlore structure and Er 2 Zr 2 O 7 exhibits single-phase fluorite structure, while Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 has pyrochlore and fluorite structure. Among three <b>zirconates,</b> the ionic conductivity of Sm 2 Zr 2 O 7 is highest, while that of Er 2 Zr 2 O 7 is lowest...|$|R
30|$|Another dopant, Y 2 O 3, {{can improve}} the O− 2 ionic {{diffusion}} in the ZrO 2 layer that is formed during the absorption. Unfortunately, Y 2 O 3 failed to increase the CO 2 absorption kinetics of Li 2 ZrO 3 [26]. Other findings reveal that solid solutions of lithium and potassium meta <b>zirconates</b> (Li 2 −xK x ZrO 3) increase both the kinetics and CO 2 absorption capacity compared to undoped Li 2 ZrO 3 [27]. In the same line, solid solutions of lithium and sodium <b>zirconates</b> were also explored [28]. It was concluded that the higher the Na content in the samples the faster the absorption kinetics. On the contrary, the higher the Li content in the mixture the faster the regeneration kinetics.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRare-earth <b>zirconates</b> and cerates have {{attracted}} particular interest for {{thermal barrier coating}} (TBC) applications due to their advantageous thermal properties, such as a low conductivity and efficient phase stability at elevated temperatures. This study focuses on synthesising La 2 Zr 2 O 7, Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7, La 2 Ce 2 O 7 −γ and La 2 (Zr 0. 7 Ce 0. 3) O 7 −γ compounds via two soft chemistry processes, alkoxide and citrate synthesis. Thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope observations were used to analyse the powder after calcinations under air. Chemical reactivity tests under a reducing atmosphere were performed at 1400 ◦C and investigated by XRD analysis. It {{was found that the}} lanthanum and gadolinium <b>zirconates</b> are the most stable and interesting materials under an Ar(g) / 3 %H 2 (g) atmosphere...|$|R
25|$|The {{piezoelectric}} effect {{is understood as}} the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and the electrical state in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The {{piezoelectric effect}} is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field). For example, lead <b>zirconate</b> titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field {{is applied to the}} material. The inverse piezoelectric effect is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves.|$|E
500|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{material is}} one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field {{when it is}} distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply by plating electrodes on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as barium titanate had poor temperature stability. [...] This precluded the transducer from functioning {{as one of the}} resonators; {{it had to be a}} separate component. [...] This problem was solved with the introduction of lead <b>zirconate</b> titanate (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is quartz, which has also been used in mechanical filters. [...] However, ceramic materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater electromechanical coupling coefficient.|$|E
2500|$|Considering {{piezoelectric}} effect in thin film lead <b>zirconate</b> titanate [...] PZT, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) power generating device has been developed. During recent improvement in piezoelectric technology, Aqsa Abbasi (also known as Aqsa Aitbar, General secretory at IMS, IEEE MUET Chapter and Director Media at HYD MUN [...] ) diffentiated two modes called [...] and [...] in vibration converters and [...] re-designed to resonate at specific frequencies from an external vibration energy source, thereby creating [...] electrical energy via the {{piezoelectric effect}} using electromechanical damped mass.|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{and electrical}} conductivity of A(2) Zr(2) O(7) ceramic {{have been investigated}} by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED), Raman spectroscopy and Impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the degree of structural order of rare-earth <b>zirconates</b> A(2) Zr(2) O(7) ceramics gradually decreases with reducing ionic radius of rare-earth cations. The Sm 2 Zr 2 O 7 and EuzZr(2) O(7) ceramics exhibit an ordered pyrochlore phase, while Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 and Dy 2 Zr 2 O 7 ceramics have a disordered fluorite phase. Pyrochlore-type Eu 2 Zr 2 O 7 ceramic with a relatively low structural order degree shows the maximum grain conductivity of 1. 03 x 10 (- 2) S. cm(- 1) at 1173 K, as compared with that of other rare-earth <b>zirconates...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe use {{the x-ray}} {{absorption}} fine structure spectroscopy at Nb K edge {{to reveal the}} local atomic structure of KxNa 1 −xNbO 3 (PSN) solid solutions. The study is performed over the temperature range 10 - 1023 K for six different x values. We show that only the combined analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure and preedge fine structure provides complete and reliable information about the local structure of NbO 6 octahedra. Such extensive treatment of the experimental data shows that the local structure of PSN could be described within the spherical model proposed earlier as a hypothesis for perovskite-type ferroelectric <b>zirconates.</b> We reveal that the Nb atoms are localized near their average positions on the sphere surfaces for all temperatures and x values. With regard to previous results we point out the features of microscopic structure common for PSN and perovskite-type <b>zirconates...</b>|$|R

The cermets contained 60 and 50 volume percent of Ni-Cr-Al-Y which formed a matrix with the oxide particles imbedded in it. The cermets containing MgO were superior to cermets based on <b>zirconates</b> {{and to the}} porous Ni-Cr-Al-Y material...|$|R
2500|$|One way to {{directly}} convert waste heat into electricity is by executing the Olsen cycle on pyroelectric materials. The Olsen cycle {{consists of two}} isothermal and two isoelectric field processes in the electric displacement-electric field (D-E) diagram. The principle of the Olsen cycle is to charge a capacitor via cooling under low electric field and to discharge it under heating at higher electric field. Several pyroelectric converters {{have been developed to}} implement the Olsen cycle using conduction, convection, or radiation. It has also been established theoretically that pyroelectric conversion based on heat regeneration using an oscillating working fluid and the Olsen cycle can reach Carnot efficiency between a hot and a cold thermal reservoir. Moreover, recent studies have established polyvinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene [...] polymers and lead lanthanum <b>zirconate</b> titanate (PLZT) ceramics as promising pyroelectric materials to use in energy converters due to their large energy densities generated at low temperatures. Additionally, a pyroelectric scavenging device that does not require time-varying inputs was recently introduced. The energy-harvesting device uses the edge-depolarizing electric field of a heated pyroelectric to convert heat energy into mechanical energy instead of drawing electric current off two plates attached to the crystal-faces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} US Navy scanning sonar {{at the end}} of the World War II operated at 18kHz, {{using an}} array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the beam pattern suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable lead <b>zirconate</b> titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and [...] "expendable modular design", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.|$|E

40|$|Spherical {{particles}} of lanthanide <b>zirconates</b> Ln(2) Zr(2) O(7) (Ln=La,Nd,Dy) were prepared by an aqueous inorganic sol-gel route. Characterisation was by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and complex impedance spectroscopy. Calcination of the gel spheres at 750 degrees C produced fully crystalline fluorite phases. Further calcination above 850 degrees C produced pyrochlore phases with La and Nd. Activation energies and pre-exponential factors were calculated from complex impedance curves {{obtained in the}} temperatures range 570 - 1000 K...|$|R
40|$|Potassium doped barium <b>zirconates</b> {{have been}} {{synthesized}} by solid state reactions. It {{was found that}} the solubility limit of potassium on A-sites is between 5 % and 10 %. Introducing extra potassium leads to the formation of second phase or YSZ impurities. The water uptake of barium <b>zirconates</b> was increased even with 5 % doping of potassium at the A-site. The sintering conditions and conductivity can be improved significantly by adding 1 wt% ZnO during material synthesis. The maximum solubility for yttrium at B-sites is around 15 at% after introducing 1 wt% zinc. The conductivity of Ba 0. 95 K 0. 05 Zr 0. 85 Y 0. 11 Zn 0. 04 O 3 -delta at 600 degrees C is 2. 2 x 10 (- 3) S/cm in wet 5 % H- 2. The activation energies for bulk and grain boundary are 0. 29 (2), 0. 79 (2) eV in wet 5 % H- 2 and 0. 31 (1), 0. 74 (3) eV in dry 5 % H- 2. A power density of 7. 7 mW/cm(2) at 718 degrees C was observed when a 1 mm thick Ba 0. 95 K 0. 05 Zr 0. 85 Y 0. 11 Zn 0. 04 O 3 -delta pellet was used as electrolyte and platinum electrodes...|$|R
50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} typically consist of four layers: the metal substrate, metallic bond coat, thermally-grown oxide (TGO), and ceramic topcoat. The ceramic topcoat is typically composed of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which is desirable for having very low conductivity while remaining stable at nominal operating temperatures typically seen in applications. This ceramic layer creates the largest thermal gradient of the TBC {{and keeps the}} lower layers at a lower temperature than the surface. However, above 1200 °C, YSZ suffers from unfavorable phase transformations, going from t'-tetragonal to tetragonal to cubic to monoclinic. Such phase transformations lead to crack formation within the top coating. Recent advancements in finding an alternative for YSZ ceramic topcoat identified many novel ceramics (rare earth <b>zirconates)</b> having superior performance at temperatures above 1200 °C, however with inferior fracture toughness {{compared to that of}} YSZ. In addition, such <b>zirconates</b> may have a high concentration of oxygen ion vacancies, which may facilitate oxygen transport and exacerbate the formation of the TGO. With a large enough TGO, spalling of the coating may occur, which is a catastrophic mode of failure for TBCs. The use of such coatings would require addition coatings that are more oxidation resistant, such as alumina or mullite.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{ferroelectric material}} for applications is lead <b>zirconate</b> titanate (PZT), {{which is part}} of the solid solution formed between ferroelectric lead titanate and anti-ferroelectric lead <b>zirconate.</b> Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-linked}} {{polyvinyl alcohol}} battery separator is disclosed. A particulate filler, inert to alkaline electrolyte of an alkaline battery, {{is incorporated in}} the separator in an amount of 1 - 20 % by weight, based on {{the weight of the}} polyvinyl alcohol, and is dispersed throughout the product. Incorporation of the filler enhances performance and increases cycle life of alkaline batteries when compared with batteries containing a similar separator not containing filler. Suitable fillers include titanates, silicates, <b>zirconates,</b> aluminates, wood floor, lignin, and titania. Particle size is not greater than about 50 microns...|$|R
30|$|Based on the above-discussed limitations, {{exclusively}} few oxides {{seem to be}} promising {{and thus}} chosen to study for the experimental validation. The two alkaline-earth metal oxides (such as CaO and MgO) draw the tremendous attention because of accessibility and favorable thermodynamics. Recently, lithium-, sodium- and potassium-based silicates or <b>zirconates</b> also gained interest due to their high CO 2 absorption capacity. Moreover, FeO {{can also be seen}} as a promising material for CO 2 capture at both power and non-power sectors (iron and steel industry). In the following sections, we review the experimental studies for the most promising CO 2 sorbent candidates.|$|R
30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of treatment with fillers depends on the nature and amount of the coupling agent, and the composition, size and distribution of the fillers. Although titanates and <b>zirconates</b> {{can be used as}} coupling agent, organosilanes, such as γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (γ-MPS), are those most commonly used. In resin composite systems the organo-functional polymerizable group forms a covalent-bond with the polymerizable monomer groups (vinyl groups or –C=C–) during composite polymerization in the dental office. Furthermore, after activation (hydrolysis), the three chemically labile hydrolyzable alkoxy groups, become intermediate silanols (Si–OH) and condense around the fillers linking to superficial hydroxyls groups and forming covalent bonds (oxane bond formation, Si–O–Si) [7].|$|R

Next to the crystal-field transitions we observed charge-transfer transitions, especially Cr 3 + ??? Ti 4 +. These are not observed for the tetravalent transition metal ions. It is argued that they should be observed for the divalent ions. From these results predictions on the occurrence of charge-transfer spectra of the type Mn+ ??? Ti 4 + are made.

40|$|Uranium-doped {{gadolinium}} <b>zirconates</b> with pyrochlore structure {{were studied}} at ambient and high-pressure conditions up to 40 GPa. The bonding environment of uranium {{in the structure}} was determined by x-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies and x-ray diffraction. The uranium valence for samples prepared in air is mainly U 6 +, but U 4 + is present in pyrochlores fabricated in an argon atmosphere. Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern suggests that uranium ions in pyrochlores are on the 16 d site in 6 -fold coordination with oxygen.

In these highly ionic phases, the O- 17 electric field gradients are small, {{and as a result}} highly resolved NMR spectra that reveal subtle structural inequivalences are observed. For titanates and <b>zirconates</b> the O- 17 chemical shifts fall in distinct, well-defined regions (372 - 564 and 280 - 376 ppm, respectively), The ratio of isotropic O- 17 chemical shifts from isostructural titanates and <b>zirconates</b> with the same A cation is constant, and this ratio is close to the ratio of the polarizing powers of titanium and zirconium. The B cation appears to be the dominant influence in determining the O- 17 chemical shift in these compounds. Additionally the number of oxygen resonances and the shift difference between them increases as the symmetry of the structure decreases. Sn- 119 MAS NMR has been applied to a variety of stannates and shows a large shift difference (68. 2 ppm) between CaSnO 3 phases with the ilmenite and GdFeO 3 perovskite type crystal structures. Al- 27 and O- 17 MAS NMR have been used to study the conversion of lanthanum and aluminum sol-gel precursors to crystalline LaAlO 3 perovskite.
