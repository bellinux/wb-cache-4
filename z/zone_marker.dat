To investigate {{similarities and differences between}} articular and growth plate cartilage and to explore transcriptional changes that occur during the onset of their divergence, we performed manual microdissection of 10 -day-old rat proximal tibias, microarray analysis, bioinformatics, and real-time PCR to compare gene expression profiles in individual cartilage layers. We found that many genes that were spatially upregulated in the intermediate/deep zone of articular cartilage were also spatially upregulated in the resting zone of growth plate cartilage (overlap greater than expected by chance, P, 0. 001). Interestingly, the superficial zone of articular cartilage showed an expression profile with similarities to both the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of growth plate cartilage (P, 0. 001 each).

40|$|AbstractAnterior–posterior {{patterning}} of {{the developing}} limb is largely viewed {{as a function of}} polarizing activity. Recent evidence in polydactylous mutants, however, indicates that development of proper pattern also requires the involvement of inhibitory pathways in the anterior limb that prevent secondary polarizing zone formation, thus limiting the number of digits produced. We report the novel finding that grafts of extracellular matrix from the Mouse Posterior Limb Bud- 4 cell line can induce supernumerary digits, including digits with posterior phenotype, from anterior chick limb mesenchyme. Unlike previously described mechanisms of pattern specification during limb development, it is shown that the extracellular matrix effect is not associated with release of an active signal.

At the presy-napse, ATP is required for loading neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles, for priming syn-aptic vesicles before release, and as a substrate for various kinases and ATPases. Although it is assumed that presynaptic sites usually harbor local mitochondria, which may serve as energy powerhouse to generate ATP as well as a presynaptic calcium depot, a clear role of presynaptic mitochondria in biochemical functioning of the presynapse is not well-defined. Besides a few synaptic subtypes like the mossy fibers and the Calyx of Held, most central presynaptic sites are either en passant or tiny axonal terminals that have little space to accommodate a large mitochondrion.

Samples were collected from seventeen stratigraphic sections spanning the calciturbidities of the Yosunlukbayırı Formation and pelagic micrites of the Soğukçam Limestone. Because of rareness and difficulties for extracting of calcareous nannofossil species particularly <b>zone</b> <b>markers</b> in these type lithologies, nannoconids have particular attention in terms of biostratigraphy. Twenty nine species of nannoconids were recorded in the studied samples. Their taxonomy were revised and their stratigraphic ranges were given. The classification of genus Nannoconus {{is based on the}} gross morphology of the test, presence of central cavity or central canal, proportion of central cavity to thickness of the wall, proportion of height to width. Thickness of calcite elements, degree of horizontal intercept angle, type of apertures and degree of horizontal intercept angle, type of apertures, and degree of angle of apertural elements are also used for description of the species. Fluctuations in nannoconid abundance are related to lithological changes. High abundance of nannoconids in limestones indicates clear surface water palaeoenvironments without terrigenous influx. From the stratigraphical point of view, their importance was clarified by their high abundance peaks. Problematic zonal boundaries of the nannofossil zonation could be determined by major nannoconid bioevents...|$|R
40|$|The SM protein UNC- 18 {{has been}} {{proposed}} to regulate several aspects of secretion, including synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and fusion. Here, we show that UNC- 18 has a chaperone function in neurons, promoting anterograde transport of the plasma membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein Syntaxin- 1. In unc- 18 mutants, UNC- 64 (Caenorhabditis elegans Syntaxin- 1) accumulates in neuronal cell bodies. Colocalization studies and analysis of carbohydrate modifications both suggest that this accumulation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. This trafficking defect is specific for UNC- 64 Syntaxin- 1, because 14 other SNARE proteins and two active <b>zone</b> <b>markers</b> were unaffected. UNC- 18 binds to Syntaxin through at least two mechanisms: binding to closed Syntaxin, or to the N terminus of Syntaxin. It is unclear which of these binding modes mediates UNC- 18 function in neurons. The chaperone function of UNC- 18 was eliminated in double mutants predicted to disrupt both modes of Syntaxin binding, but it was unaffected in single mutants. By contrast, mutations predicted to disrupt UNC- 18 binding to the N terminus of Syntaxin caused significant defects in locomotion behavior and responsiveness to cholinesterase inhibitors. Collectively, these results demonstrate the UNC- 18 acts as a molecular chaperone for Syntaxin transport in neurons and that the two modes of UNC- 18 binding to Syntaxin are involved in different aspects of UNC- 18 function...|$|R

Mutations in the two related YAB 1 genes, FILAMENTOUS FLOWER and YABBY 3 (YAB 3), cause an array of defects, including aberrant phyllotaxis.

This GRAS protein is expressed at the boundary of organ primordia and the SAM central zone, distinct from the YAB 1 expression domain.

Here {{we show that}} the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule Neuroligin 1 regulates key steps of presynaptic maturation. Presynaptic terminals from Neuroligin 1 -knockout mice remain structurally and functionally immature with respect to active zone stability and synaptic vesicle pool size, as analyzed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Conversely, overexpression of Neuroligin 1 in immature neurons, that is within the first 5 days after plating, induced the formation of presynaptic boutons that had hallmarks of mature boutons. In particular, Neuroligin 1 enhanced {{the size of the}} pool of recycling synaptic vesicles, the rate of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, the fraction of boutons responding to depolarization, as well as the responsiveness of the presynaptic release machinery to phorbol ester stimulation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Nodal marginal zone lymphomas were diagnosed according to strict criteria, including the expression {{of at least one}} putative marginal <b>zone</b> <b>marker</b> (MNDA and/or IRTA 1). Cases that showed features of NMZL but did not fulfil all criteria were included as BCL-u. All FLs were required to have a BCL 2 rearrangement. Mutations were found in: nine NMZLs, with recurrent mutations in TNFAIP 3 and CD 79 B; 12 FLs, with recurrent mutations in TNFRSF 14, TNFAIP 3, and CARD 11; and five cases of BCL-u, with recurrent mutations in TNFRSF 14. TNFRSF 14 mutations were present in FL and BCL-u, but not in any of the NMZLs. In the BCL-u group, TNFRSF 14 mutations clustered with a FL immunophenotype.

In hybrid zones, loci that establish a barrier to gene flow between populations remain divergent, whereas neutral unlinked loci become mixed. In those instances, fit allelic combinations across several loci can be maintained through selection, but this is antagonized by gene flow and recombination. Here, I show that particular allelic combinations in a linked cluster of loci responsible for a flower colour polymorphism between two A. majus subspecies are maintained despite recombination in a hybrid zone. I reveal that a known locus that controls the magenta flower colour of the subspecies, ROSEA (ROS), is highly divergent between them, compared {{with most of the}} genome. The divergence region extends downstream of ROS, likely due to selection on another linked, but unidentified, locus that also controls flower colour, ELUTA (EL). Fine-mapping experiments identified an interval containing EL and regions within ROS that control different components of the magenta phenotype. Transcriptome analysis from flower buds suggests that MYB-like transcription factors within the mapped intervals control this trait. ROS and EL interact epistatically, meaning that the phenotype of an individual depends on the particular allelic combination it has for these loci. In the hybrid <b>zone,</b> <b>markers</b> in ROS and EL are in high linkage disequilibrium, but ~ 5 % of recombinant haplotypes were found in the population.

Fecha de lectura: 18 - 10 - 2013 Heart {{development}} {{is the result of}} the tightly regulated spatio-temporally embryonic processes of lineage specification, tissue patterning, cellular proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis that ultimately lead to the adult, fully functional heart. Congenital heart disease (CHD) occurs when normal cardiac {{development is}} impaired and the structure of the heart and great vessels is abnormal. It is very frequent and approximately nine people in 1000 are born with a congenital heart defect. A great research effort is under way to understand the molecular and genetic bases of CHD, as they can be manifested in the neonate but also in the adult individual. In this work, we have used a conditional loss-offunction model of the Notch regulator Mib 1, to show that Notch acting from the endocardium not only regulates early heart development, as it has been described previously, but also plays a crucial later role in the maturation of the cardiac valves and chambers. In the OFT valves, Notch regulates in a non-cell autonomous manner BMP signalling, repressing Bmp 6 and cellular proliferation in the valvular mesenchyme, allowing the valves to undergo the morphogenetic processes required for their maturation. In the ventricles, Notch activity in the endocardium activated from the myocardium sends maturation signals to the myocardium, so that compact and trabecular myocardium are established by the expression of trabecular markers (Anf, Bmp 10 or Cx 40) and compact <b>zone</b> <b>markers</b> (Hey 2, N-myc or Tbx 20), allowing ventricular compaction, and thus the formation of the adult contractile wall of the heart. Absence of these Notch-dependent signals produces LVNC in humans, the third most important cardiomyopathy, with a very poorly understood etiology, characterized by prominent and excessive trabeculations, with deep recesses in the ventricular wall. LVNC manifests as depressed systolic function. Classical complications include systemic embolism, malignant arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden death. The importance of NOTCH in heart development and its impact in cardiomyopathies such as LVNC, opens a new research avenue into the identification of novel diagnostic and eventually, therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWnt {{signaling}} {{is known}} to play crucial roles {{in the development of}} multiple organs as well as in cancer. In particular, constitutive activation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in distinct populations of forebrain or brainstem precursor cells has previously been shown to result in dramatic brain enlargement during embryonic stages of development {{as well as in the}} formation of medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor in childhood. In order to extend this knowledge to postnatal stages of both cerebral and cerebellar cortex development, we conditionally activated Wnt signaling by introducing a dominant active form of β-catenin in hGFAP-positive neural precursors. Such mutant mice survived up to 21 days postnatally. While the mice revealed enlarged ventricles and an initial expansion of the Pax 6 -positive ventricular zone, Pax 6 expression and proliferative activity in the ventricular zone was virtually lost by embryonic day 16. 5. Loss of Pax 6 expression was not followed by expression of the subventricular <b>zone</b> <b>marker</b> Tbr 2, indicating insufficient neuronal differentiation. In support of this finding, cortical thickness was severely diminished in all analyzed stages from embryonic day 14. 5 to postnatal day 12, and appropriate layering was not detectable. Similarly, cerebella of hGFAP-cre::Ctnnb 1 (ex 3) Fl/+ mice were hypoplastic and displayed severe lamination defects. Constitutively active β-Catenin induced inappropriate proliferation of granule neurons and inadequate development of Bergmann glia, thereby preventing regular migration of granule cells and normal cortical layering. We conclude that Wnt signaling has divergent roles in the central nervous system and that Wnt needs to be tightly controlled in a time- and cell type-specific manner...|$|E
40|$|At {{chemical}} synapses synaptic vesicles are functionally segregated into distinct pools {{depending on}} their mobility and release probability in response to action potentials. At most synapses synapsin proteins cluster and immobilize reserve pool vesicles within the cytoskeletal network, distally from the active zones. Activity-dependent phosphorylation of synapsins releases synaptic vesicles from the complex meshwork of the cytoskeletal components and renders them freely mobile and able to undergo vesicle cycling. There are three synapsin genes in mammals and their alternative splicing results in more than ten isoforms whose functional differences in maintaining synaptic transmission are not fully elucidated. In this study we examined the involvement of synapsins in synaptic transmission using two independent approaches. First, we established the structure-function relationship at synapses, overexpressing synapsin I isoforms (synapsin Ia or synapsin Ib). Second, synaptic transmission and structural integrity of synapses in mice, lacking all three synapsin genes (triple knock-out (TKO)) were examined. The calyx of Held, a giant glutamatergic synapse located in the auditory brain stem, was utilized as a model system. Synapsin I isoforms overexpression was accomplished through transduction of globular bushy cells (GBCs), located in the ventral cochlear nucleus, with recombinant adeno- associated viral particles. The GBCs are projection neurons, which give rise to the calyx of Held in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. 10 days after the transduction, overexpression of synapsin I isoforms resulted in a redistribution of SV within the calyx of Held, without changing the size and the overall structure of the perturbed synapses. Ultrastructural analysis, using serial sectioning scanning electron microscopy (S 3 EM) revealed that synapsin Ia overexpression resulted in decreased numbers of SVs at the active zone without altering the total vesicle number. Therefore, we could conclude that synapsin Ia overexpression was followed by vesicle redistribution within the presynaptic terminal. On the functional level, the overexpression of both synapsin I isoforms {{had no effect on}} the properties of spontaneous and evoked EPSCs. However, repeated stimulation at frequencies exceeding 10 Hz led to accelerated short-term depression (STD). Overexpression of either isofroms led also to accelerated recovery from depression after strong stimulation. Brain lysates from synapsin TKO mice revealed a strong reduction in the level of several synaptic vesicle proteins, while proteins of the active zone cytomatrix or of the postsynaptic density remained unaffected. Accordingly, TKO calyces had lower amounts of vGluT 1 immunoreactivity while the level of the active <b>zone</b> <b>marker</b> bassoon was unchanged Summary i as shown via 3 D reconstructions of TKO calyces. The S 3 EM analysis confirmed these results revealing a 50 % {{reduction in the number of}} synaptic vesicles in TKO calyces. The structural alterations resulting in the absence of synapsins led to accelerated and more pronounced STD at stimulation at frequencies above 100 Hz. Synapsin deletion, contrary to synapsin overexpression, slowed down the recovery of depression. This might prove that synapsin- dependent SVs contribute to the faster replenishment of the readily releasable pool, which maintains synaptic transmission under basic conditions. Despite the structural defects and the alterations in the short-term depression, transmission failures were not observed during the high-frequency trains. These results reveal that in wild-type synapses the synapsin-dependent vesicles account only for a small fraction of the SVs that enter the RRP. In conclusion, synapsins maintain of a specific vesicle population at CNS synapses. However, these vesicles are dispensable from normal basal synaptic transmission and are recruited only when the synapse is exposed to long-lasting high-frequency activity. The synapsin-dependent vesicles are fed into the readily releasable pool to counteract the effects of presynaptic depression and aid the faster recovery of the synapse. Although synapsins may be required for normal synaptic vesicle biogenesis, trafficking and immobilization, they are not essential for sustained synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held...|$|E

Incor-poration of 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine in vivo increased in neurogenic areas in adult 1 A-adrenergic receptor transgenic mice or normal mice given the 1 A-adrenergic receptor-selec-tive agonist, cirazoline.

40|$|A rapid immunochromatographic assay was {{developed}} for the control of tetracycline (TC). The assay {{is based on the}} competition between immobilized TC-protein conjugate and TC in a tested sample for binding with polyclonal anti-TC antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold during the flow of the sample along a membrane strip with immobilized reactants. Conjugation of colloidal gold and the total immunoglobulin (IgG) fraction of polyclonal antibodies was used to increase the assay sensitivity to ensure low content of specific antibodies in the conjugate. This allowed effective inhibition of free TC and conjugate binding in the strip test <b>zone.</b> Photometric <b>marker</b> registration allows control of the reduction of binding, thereby enhancing detection sensitivity. The proposed assay allows TC to be detected at concentrations up to 20 [*]ng/mL, exceeding the limit of detection of the known analogues, in a wide working range (more than two orders) of 60 [*]pg/mL to 10 [*]ng/mL, ensured through the use of polyclonal antibodies. The assay time is 10 [*]min. The efficiency of the designed assay is shown to identify TC in milk; the degree of recovery of TC ranges from 90 to 112 %.

40|$|Both the Drauzug (Italy, Austria) and the Transdanubian Mountains (Hungary) show great {{differences}} in facies {{compared to the}} geological units that presently surround them, i. e. proximal facies contrast with distal facies in the Permo-Triassic. Lower Liassic strata in the Drauzug and the Transdanubian Mountains indicate an extensional regime causing typical structural features such as tilted blocks, fault scarps, and drowned carbonate platforms. The Permo-Mesozoic facies <b>zones</b> provide <b>markers</b> for the paleogeographic fitting of the Drauzug and the Transdanubian Mountains with areas today lying some 300 - 400 km to the west: the Drauzug corresponds to the Lombardian basin and the westernmost part of the Northern Calcareous Alps while the Transdanubian Mountains correspond to the westernmost part of the Lombardian basin, the Trento platform, and the Belluno trough. The Drauzug and the Transdanubian Mountains (together with the South Alpine realm) were displaced to the east along strike-slip faults during the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous opening of the Central Atlantic and Ligurian-Piemont oceans and the simultaneous subduction of the Vardar ocean at the eastern margin of Apulia.

40|$|Metabolic zonation in {{the liver}} is {{characterized}} by a heterogeneous distribution of enzymes along the sinusoids of the liver acinus. Periportal hepatocytes are enriched in enzymes associated with gluconeogenesis, amino acid degradation and urea synthesis. Xenobiotic metabolism, lipogenesis and glutamine synthetase activity occur predominantly in the perivenous cells. The localization of proline oxidase activity has been examined to investigate the zonal implications of P 5 C metabolism. [...] Administration of the hepatotoxins, carbon tetrachloride and bromobenzene, was used to induce damage (in vivo) to the perivenous zone. Allyl alcohol administration was used to damage the periportal zone of the acinus. Alternatively, controlled antegrade and retrograde perfusion of rat liver with digitonin was used to selectively permeabilize cells in the periportal or perivenous zone of the acinus. These techniques were combined with the collagenase method for hepatocyte isolation to provide enriched suspensions of specific hepatocyte populations. The activities of perivenous zone-specific marker enzymes, glutamine synthetase and ornithine aminotransferase, as well as the periportal zone-specific ornithine transcarbamylase were used in conjunction with histological analysis to ascertain the extent of damage. [...] Administration of bromobenzene provided strong evidence to suggest a perivenous enrichment of proline oxidase. This result was further substantiated by retrograde digitonin-perfusion. In both instances, cells in the perivenous zone were destroyed and remaining cells demonstrated significantly decreased activities of perivenous <b>zone</b> <b>markers</b> and of proline oxidase. [...] The results of the toxin and digitonin experiments have also demonstrated that the (perivenous) zone of proline oxidase enrichment is not as discrete as glutamine synthetase. The zone of positive proline oxidase activity was similar to the zone of positive ornithine aminotransferase activity. [...] Proline production from P 5 C was used to assess the activity of P 5 C reductase in isolated hepatocytes following either toxin or digitonin treatment. The results indicated that as more of the perivenous region was damaged, proline production increased. Specifically, proline production was highest following bromobenzene intoxication, followed by carbon tetrachloride and allyl alcohol intoxication. These results suggest a periportal enrichment of P 5 C reductase. Retrograde digitonin-perfusion however, resulted in a significant decrease in proline production, indicative of a perivenous enrichment. [...] The utilization of DL-P 5 C as a substrate for amino acid production was compared in hepatocytes from fed and fasted animals. Following a 48 hour fast, P 5 C was converted to proline and glutamate equally. In the fed state, P 5 C was preferentially converted to proline with marginal conversion to glutamate.

40|$|The {{morphological}} reconstruction {{based on}} geodesic operators, {{is a powerful}} tool in mathematical morphology. The general definition of this reconstruction supposes {{the use of a}} marker function f which is not necessarily related to the function g to be built. However, this paper deals with operations where the marker function is defined from given characteristic regions of the initial function f, as it is the case, for instance, for the extrema (maxima or minima) but also for the saddle zones. Firstly, we show that the intuitive definition of a saddle zone is not easy to handle, especially when digitised images are involved. However, some of these saddle zones (regional ones also called overflow zones) can be defined, this definition providing a simple algorithm to extract them. The second part of the paper is devoted to the use of these overflow <b>zones</b> as <b>markers</b> in image reconstruction. This reconstruction provides a new function which exhibits a new hierarchy of extrema. This hierarchy is equivalent to the hierarchy produced by the so-called waterfall algorithm. We explain why the waterfall algorithm can be achieved by performing a watershed transform of the function reconstructed by its initial watershed lines. Finally, some examples of use of this hierarchical segmentation are described...|$|R

40|$|Background—Elderly {{patients}} with reperfused ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction are {{at increased risk}} for left ventricular remodeling. Extracellular matrix damage has been implicated in early remodeling. We hypothesized that aging results in enhanced early reperfusion injury and left ventricular remodeling after reperfused ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction and that early therapy initiated at the time of reperfusion with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker such as candesartan attenuates age-related increases in reperfusion injury and remodeling. Methods and Results—We randomized 3 groups of dogs (age, 1 to 2, 2. 1 to 5, and 5. 1 to 10 years) with reperfused ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (90 minutes of ischemia, 2 hours of reperfusion) to therapy with placebo or candesartan (1 mg/kg CV- 11974) over 30 minutes from the onset of reperfusion. Reperfusion in placebo groups was associated with aging-related changes in the ischemic <b>zones</b> in <b>markers</b> of damage (increased ischemic injury, infarct size [as percent risk], cardiomyocyte apoptosis, blood flow impairment, no reflow), structural remodeling (increased left ventricular dilation and dysfunction), extracellular matrix remodeling (increased expression of secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, osteopontin, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase- 10 and- 17, and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 and- 2), and inflammation (increased inducible nitric oxide synthase, proinflam-matory cytokines interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-, and transforming growth factor- 1; decreased antiinflam-matory cytokine interleukin- 10). Compared with placebo, candesartan attenuated these age-dependent changes. Conclusion—Aging results in age-dependent early increases in markers of damage and adverse structural and matri...|$|R
