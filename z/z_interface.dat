Moreover, our description predicts a valve effect at a certain critical potential strength, U_ 0 cr, when the interface potential works as a valve suppressing the interfacial conductivity. In other words, the interfacial electrons become dispersionless at U_ 0 = U_ 0 cr, and thus cannot propagate. This critical value separates the quasielectron (U_ 0 U_ 0 cr) regimes of the interfacial conductivity. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

An external force field F(z) acts in the x direction parallel to the interface, creating a lateral order parameter current j^x(z) which varies with distance <b>z</b> from the <b>interface.</b> Above the roughening temperature, our data for `shear-like' linear variation of F(z) are {{in agreement with the}} picture wherein shear acts as effective confinement in this system, thus supressing the interfacial capillary-wave fluctuations. We find sharper magnetisation profiles and reduced interfacial width as compared to equilibrium. Pair correlations are more suppressed in the vorticity direction y than in the driving direction; the opposite holds for the structure factor. Lateral transport of capillary waves occurs for those forms of F(z) for which the current j^x(z) is an odd function of z, for example the shear-like drive, and a `step-like' driving field. For a V-shaped driving force no such motion occurs, but capillary waves are suppressed more strongly than for the shear-like drive. These findings are in agreement with our previous simulation studies in two dimensions.

In this paper we make a more complete analytical calculation of all the subsurface elastic constants by using a microscopic model and a more general theoretical procedure.

A wind profile is assumed where the background velocity is constant up to a height z 1 and then decreases linearly, {{and the internal}} gravity-wave solutions are calculated exactly. In flow over a 2 D ridge, the normalized surface drag is given by a closed-form analytical expression, while in flow over an axisymmetric mountain it is given by an expression involving a simple 1 D integral. The drag is found to depend on two dimensionless parameters: a dimensionless height formed with z_ 1, and the Richardson number, Ri, in the shear layer. The drag oscillates as z_ 1 increases, with a period of half the hydrostatic vertical wavelength of the gravity waves. The amplitude of this modulation increases as Ri decreases. This behaviour is due to wave reflection at z_ 1. Drag maxima correspond to constructive interference of the upward- and downward-propagating waves in the region z < z_ 1, while drag minima correspond to destructive interference.

In most cases only a proportion of references will be directly accessible as digital reprints through displayed links. A large number of references, however, have to be verified in library catalogues and, depending on their availability, are accessible as print holdings or by interlibrary loan request. Methods: The problem of verifying local print holdings from an initial retrieval set of citations can be solved using Z 39. 50, an ANSI protocol for interactively querying library information systems. Numerous systems include <b>Z</b> 39. 50 <b>interfaces</b> and therefore can process Z 39. 50 interactive requests. However, the programmed query interaction command structure is non-intuitive and inaccessible to the average biomedical researcher. For the typical user, {{it is necessary to}} implement the protocol within a tool that hides and handles Z 39. 50 syntax, presenting a comfortable user interface.

40|$|Abstract Describing the {{phenomenon}} of total internal reflection {{in terms of a}} reflection coefficient of unit magnitude, we found that, not only can propagating plane waves be total internally reflected at the planar interface of two dissimilar, homogeneous, isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums, but evanescent plane waves can also be. The refracting medium must be the optically denser of the two mediums for total internal reflection of an evanescent plane wave to occur. Key words evanescent plane wave, total reflection Total internal reflection of a propagating plane wave at the planar interface of two dissimilar, homogeneous, isotropic, lossless dielectric mediums is treated in some section of virtually any undergraduate textbook. Suppose a plane wave propagating in one medium encounters the planar interface and the second medium is optically rarer than the first medium; if the angle of incidence of the plane wave is not smaller than the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs [1]. During an investigation of radiation from a dipole source embedded in a dielectric layer [2], the following question arose: Can total internal reflection of an evanescent plane wave occur? Finding no answer to this question in the literature, we decided to report our positive result, as well as the conditions for an evanescent plane wave to be reflected totally. 1 Consider the interface of two dissimilar, homogeneous, isotropic, lossless, dielectric–magnetic mediums, labeled 1 and 2.

The coupling of p modes and sausage tube waves is studied in a model atmosphere composed of a polytropic interior above which lies an isothermal upper atmosphere. The sausage tube waves, excited by p modes, propagate along a magnetic fibril which {{is assumed to be}} a vertically aligned, stratified, thin magnetic flux tube. The deficit of p-mode energy is quantified through the damping rate, Γ, and absorption coefficient, α. The variation of Γ and α as a function of frequency and the tube's plasma properties is studied in detail. Previous similar studies have considered only a subphotospheric layer, modeled as a polytrope that has been truncated at the photosphere. Such studies have found that the resulting energy loss by the p modes is very sensitive to the upper boundary condition, which, {{due to the lack of}} an upper atmosphere, have been imposed in a somewhat ad hoc manner. The model presented here avoids such problems by using an isothermal layer to model the overlying atmosphere (chromosphere, and, consequently, allows us to analyze the propagation of p-mode-driven sausage waves above the photosphere. In this paper, we restrict our attention to frequencies below the acoustic cut off frequency. We demonstrate the importance of coupling all waves (acoustic, magnetic) in the subsurface solar atmosphere with the overlying atmosphere in order to accurately model the interaction of solar f and p modes with sausage tube waves.

40|$|Research Report No. 2010 - 03 Ground motion {{prediction}} equations (GMPEs) for geometric-mean pseudo-spectral acceleration amplitudes from New Zealand (NZ) earthquakes are developed. A {{database of}} 2437 three-component ground motion records is developed by applying stringent quality criteria to the historically recorded events in NZ. Despite {{the large number}} of records, the database is deficient in empirical records from large magnitude events recorded at close distances to the fault rupture plane. As a result, the basis for the NZ-specific GMPE development is to examine the applicability of foreign GMPEs for similar tectonic regions and then modify the most applicable GMPEs based on both theoretical and statistically significant empirically-driven arguments. For active shallow crustal events, five different GMPEs are considered. It was found that the McVerry et al. (2006) model, which is the current model upon which seismic design guidelines and site-specific seismic hazard analyses in NZ are based, provided the worst fit to the NZ database, and that the Chiou et al. (2010) (C 10) modification of the Chiou and Youngs (2008) model was the most applicable. Discrepancies between the C 10 model and the NZ database that were empirically identified and theoretically justified were used to modify the C 10 model for: (i) small magnitude scaling; (ii) scaling of short period ground motion from normal faulting events in volcanic crust; (iii) scaling of ground motions on very hard rock sites; (iv) anelastic attenuation in the NZ crust; and (v) consideration of the increased anelastic attenuation in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). For subduction slab events, initially three models were considered. It was found that all of the models had some significant biases with respect to applicability for NZ. The Zhao et al. (2006) (Z 06) model was selected because of the rigorous database upon which it was developed and modified by: (i) NZ-specific scaling at small magnitudes; (ii) path scaling at large distances; (iii) consideration of the increased TVZ attenuation; and (iv) revision of the standard deviation model. Based on these modifications the developed model showed no bias of the inter- and intra-event residuals as a function of various predictor variables. The standard deviation of the residuals using the revised standard deviation model also indicated that the model has an adequate precision. Three GMPEs were considered for subduction interface events. The Zhao et al. (2006) (Z 06) model was the best performing model with only bias exhibited in the site response model, and possible over-prediction of large magnitude events. The <b>Z</b> 06 <b>interface</b> model was modified to account for site response and magnitude scaling using the same functional forms as those of the developed active shallow crustal and subduction slab models. The developed model showed no bias of the inter- and intra-event residuals as a function of various predictor variables. The developed GMPEs include specific features as evident in the NZ database; consistent scaling for parameters not well constrained by the NZ database; and pseudo-spectral amplitudes for vibration periods from 0. 01 to 10 seconds. Hence, these models represent a significant advance in the state-of-the art for empirical ground motion prediction in NZ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a (1 + 1) -dimensional hydrophobic homopolymer, in interaction with an oil–water <b>interface.</b> In <b>Z</b> 2, the <b>interface</b> is modelled by the x axis, {{the oil is}} above, the water is below, and the polymer configurations are given by a simple random walk (Si) i≥ 0. The hydrophobicity of each monomer tends to delocalize the polymer in the upper half-plane, through a reward h> 0 for each monomer in the oil and a penalty −h< 0 for each monomer in the water. On the other hand, the chain receives a random reward (or penalty) when crossing the interface, depending on a local random charge attached to the interface. At site i this reward is β(1 +sζi), where (ζi) i≥ 1 is a sequence of i. i. d. centered random variables, and s≥ 0, β≥ 0. Since the reward is positive on average, the interface attracts the polymer and a localization effect may arise. We transform the measure of each trajectory with the hamiltonian β∑i= 1 N(1 +sζi) 1 {Si= 0 }+h∑i= 1 Nsign(Si), and study the critical curve hcs(β) that separates the (β,h) -plane into a localized and a delocalized phase for s fixed. It {{is not difficult to}} show that hcs(β) ≥hc 0 (β) for all s≥ 0 with the former explicitly computable. In this article we give a method for improving in a quantitative way this lower bound. To that end, we transform the strategy developed by Bolthausen and den Hollander in [E. Bolthausen, F. den Hollander, Localization for a polymer near an interface, Ann. Probab. 25 (3) (1997) 1334 – 1366], by taking into account the fact that the chain can target the sites where it comes back to the origin. The improved lower bound is interesting even for the case where only the interaction at the interface is active, i. e., for the pure pinning model. Our bound improves an earlier bound of Alexander and Sidoravicius in [K. Alexander, V. Sidoravicius Pinning of polymers and interfaces by random potential, 2005 (preprint).

40|$|Equatorial {{turbulent}} diffusivities {{resulting from}} breaking gravity waves {{may be more}} than a factor of 10 less than those in the midlatitudes. A coupled general circulation model with a layered isopycnal coordinate ocean is used to assess Pacific climate sensitivity to a latitudinally varying background diapycnal diffusivity with extremely low values near the equator. The control experiments have a minimum upper-ocean diffusivity of 10 � 5 m 2 s � 1 and are initialized from present-day conditions. The average depth of the � � � 26. 4 <b>interface</b> (<b>z</b> 26. 4) in the Pacific increases by � 140 m after 500 yr of coupled model integration. This corresponds to a warming trend in the upper ocean. Low equatorial diffusivities reduce the z 26. 4 bias by � 30 %. Isopycnal surfaces are elevated from the eastern boundary up to midlatitudes by cooling in the upper several hundred meters, partially compensated by freshening. Entrainment of intermediate water masses from below � � � 26. 4 decreases by � 1. 5 Sv (1 Sv � 10 6 m 3 s � 1), mainly in the western tropical Pacific. The Pacific heat uptake (30 °S– 30 °N) from the atmosphere reduces by � 0. 1 PW. This is associated with warmer entrainment temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific upwelling region. Equatorward heat transport from the Southern Ocean increases by � 0. 07 PW. Reducing the upper-ocean background diffusivity uniformly to 10 � 6 m 2 s � 1 cools the upper ocean from the tropics, but warms and freshens from the midlatitudes. Enhanced convergence into the Pacific of water lighter than � � � 26. 4 compensates the reduction in upwelling of intermediate waters in the tropics. Basin-averaged z 26. 4 bias increases in the low background case. These results demonstrate basin-scale sensitivity to the observed suppression of equatorial background dissipation. This has clear implications for understanding oceanic heat uptake in the Pacific as well as other important aspects of the climate system. Diapycnal diffusivities due to truncation errors and other numerical artifacts in ocean models may need to be less than 10 � 6 m 2 s � 1 in order to accurately represent this effect in climate models. 1...|$|R
40|$|A market {{research}} {{report commissioned by}} the British Library {{was used as the}} basis of a detailed list of requirements for the provision of digital services to the UK Higher and Further Education sector. The services stemming from these requirements centred, in the first instance, on the British Library's Electronic Table of Contents data (ETOC) that lists the titles of nearly 15 million journal articles and conference papers. A key approach to the development of these services will be the conformance to accepted standards and open systems, thus enabling greater potential for interoperability with developments elsewhere. As a first step towards this the British Library contracted Manchester Computing to develop and mount a Z 39. 50 -compliant version of the ETOC database, a service now live entitled 'zetoc'. The service is free to UK institutions supported by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) of the UK Higher Education Funding Councils. In addition to this operational service, which is based on existing and well-established proprietary database management applications, a separate pilot version is being developed using a subset of the data in XML format which will be conformant with the Dublin Core and exploiting 'Cheshire II' software. As {{well as a number of}} <b>Z</b> 39. 50 <b>interface</b> developments, a current awareness alerting service based on the ETOC data has been implemented. The ultimate aim is to develop the alerting service to enable it to link seamlessly with document ordering systems and integrate with other current awareness mechanisms. The document ordering interface will present the user with the option to select a source of supply. If the item is contained within an electronic journal to which the user's institution subscribes, the intention is to automatically link the user to the electronically-stored journal. If the item is not held 'locally', the user will be presented with an option to either request the document directly from the British Library or via their local library. This functionality will be achieved via integration with other systems, including 'brokering' services, developed within the UK education community as part of the JISC's accurately named 'Join-Up' programme. This paper describes the development process, the systems themselves and the support services created to provide academic and research communities with a valuable resource both in terms of discovery/location and content provision. The British Library is working in partnership with Manchester Computing at the University of Manchester, with the Universities of Liverpool and California-Berkeley as associate partners...|$|R
