40|$|AbstractThe {{direction}} dependency of tool-workpiece compliance {{of machine}} tool {{was investigated in}} three dimensions. The tool-workpiece compliance {{is defined as the}} frequency response of the relative displacement between the tool and the workpiece to the cutting force. The tool-workpiece compliance of a vertical type machining center was measured. The direction dependency of the compliance magnitude was discussed using the polar plot. The compliance in the <b>Z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>direction</b> was smaller than that in the XY (horizontal) directions. The maximum value of the compliance in the X direction was almost twice as large as those in the Y and Z directions. The influence of the frequency on the direction dependency was also discussed. The direction dependency in the XY plane was small in the frequency range higher than 250 Hz. This {{can be explained by the}} symmetry of the spindle about the X and Y directions because the tool-workpiece relative displacement was dominated by the tool displacement in the high frequency range...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} to the measurement of nanofriction, and demonstrate {{the application of the}} method by measurement of the coefficient of friction for diamondlike carbon (DLC) on DLC, Si on DLC, and Si on Si surfaces. The technique employs an atomic force microscope in a mode in which the tip moves only in the <b>z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>direction</b> and the sample surface is sloped. As the tip moves vertically on the sloped surface, lateral tip slipping occurs, allowing the cantilever vertical deflection and the frictional (lateral) force to be monitored as a function of tip vertical deflection. The advantage of the approach is that cantilever calibration to obtain its spring constants is not necessary. Using this method, the authors have measured friction coefficients, for load range 0 < L M 6 mu N, of 0. 047 +/- 0. 002 for Si on Si, 0. 0173 +/- 0. 0009 for Si on DLC, and 0. 0080 +/- 0. 0005 for DLC on DLC. For load range 9 < L < 13 mu N, the DLC on DLC coefficient of friction increased to 0. 051 +/- 0. 003. (C) 2008 American Vacuum Society...|$|E

The code can perform the following common tasks: • Integration of finely-distributed pressure distributions from CFD • Automatic reduction of finely-distributed pressure distributions from CFD to experimentally-measured pressure-tap positions and comparison with the original data • Integration of experimental pressure distributions • Handling of special cases: Pressure distributions without leading edge and trailing edge pressure sensors, scaling and translation of airfoil position, handling of geodesic (reversed) coordinate system. • Two simple sorting algorithms are implemented, which can deal with some simple cases. • A block-data mode is implemented which allows the sorting of large numbers (millions) of pressure distributions in acceptable time...|$|E
40|$|The {{handling}} of mining machine cables in underground coal mines {{has been identified}} as a particularly stressful task and is a likely contributor to low back pain. In this experiment, seven experienced miners performed a cable pulling task while ground reaction forces and cable tension were measured. The independent variables were two levels of cable resistance (low and high) and lifting conditions (kneeling under a 1. 2 meter [48 inch] roof, stooping under a 1. 2 meter [48 inch] roof, stooping under a 1. 5 meter [60 inch] roof, and unrestricted standing). The dependent variables were the peak values of the following: actual tension measured in the cable, ground reaction forces in the X (anterior), Y (lateral), and <b>Z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>directions</b> and the magnitude of the resultant force vector. Work posture significantly affected the peak ground reaction forces in the Y-direction. The Y-forces were highest in the kneeling condition, indicating that there is less postural stability when performing cable pulling tasks in a kneeling posture.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper was to analyse all stages of the CastForm™(CF) {{polystyrene}} pattern fabrication process, identify the reasons leading to poor dimensional accuracy, and outline techniques for its improvement. Rapid manufacturing of patterns for shell or flask investment casting using the laser sintering (LS) technique with CF material involves LS fabrication of a part, cleaning, and wax infiltration. Wax infiltration consists of preheating the part, the application of the liquefied wax in a convection oven, and the cooling of the part to room temperature. To study the dimensional accuracy of the process, a benchmark part was designed {{in such a way that}} its thickness could be modified from 2 mm to 20 mm and fabricated with the optimum processing parameters. The experiments conducted show that different wall thicknesses of the parts shrink differently after wax infiltration, particularly in the <b>Z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>direction,</b> and this was found to be the major factor contributing towards poor dimensional accuracy. Using the Pro/Mechanica software package, transient heat transfer analysis has been conducted as an aid to understanding the effect of time and temperature on different wall thicknesses of a part during wax infiltration. In doing so, the thermal properties of CF material were investigated. The paper reports shrinkage factors for different wall thicknesses; the data can be applied in adjusting the appropriate shrinkage factor for a part with uniform thickness. For a part having non-uniform thickness, it was found that hollowing the part to leave a uniform thickness is an option to improve the final dimensional accuracy of the part...|$|E

In the formulation, a plane-harmonic seismic wave propagates in a medium having random elastic properties in the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>directions.</b> The 2 D random field representation is introduced in the stiffness properties of the medium by assuming it has log-normal probability density functions. The constitutive stress and displacement laws with the momentum balance equation for total stress yield a partial differential equation, which is developed using a perturbation approach by assuming a 2 D random geological medium having material heterogeneity randomly distributed in the horizontal (x) and <b>vertical</b> (<b>z)</b> <b>directions.</b> The method yields a double integral representation of the displacement wave vector based on the Green’s tensor and the Fourier-Stieltjes increments.

Since the Hamiltonian in the z direction is merely assumed confining, without any further specification, the associated spectrum is discrete but arbitrary, and the fast oscillations induced by the nonlinear equation entail countably many frequencies that are arbitrarily distributed. For that reason, averaging cannot rely on small denominator estimates or like. To overcome these difficulties, we prove that the fast oscillations are almost-periodic in time, with values in a Sobolev-like space that we completely identify. We then exploit the existence of long-time averages for almost-periodic functions to perform the necessary averaging procedure in our nonlinear problem...|$|R

The DLP system offers high resolution and accurate manufacture of parts. This ability to process functional materials will be used for developing devices for sensing and actuating applications. In order to identify the feasibility of manufacturing composite of the DLP system, barium titanate (BaTi 03) ceramic was added to the photopolymer. The composites containing up to 19 vol% BaTi 03 as functional material were manufactured by the DLP system. Poling these specimens showed a maximum piezoelectric coefficient of 5 pC/N, measured at 30 MV /m and 90 °C. Measuring ferroelectric properties of these composite specimens showed a maximum remnant and saturation polarisation of ± 0. 041 IlC/cm 2 and ± 0. 359 IlC/cm 2, measured at electric field of 249. 97 kV/cm at room temperature.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{research}} suggests that for many geological CO 2 sequestration reservoirs, up to 60 % of the injected CO 2 will be trapped by capillary forces (irreducible saturation), a mechanism termed residual CO 2 trapping. More specifically, our recent models of ongoing field tests of geological sequestration suggest that residual CO 2  trapping can be maximized if the CO 2 plume rises a greater distance due to buoyancy (i. e., injection at the deepest part of a thick reservoir) and sweeps a larger area before coming in contact with low permeability caprock. Although this strategy maximizes the residual CO 2 trapping in theory because CO 2 plume contacts more pore spaces, it also increases the probability that upwelling- CO 2 may {{come into contact with}} faults or other leakage pathways. Geological heterogeneity seems to play greater role with respect to residual CO 2 trapping potential. To help clarify what processes and properties will maximize residual CO 2 trapping and minimize CO 2 -buoyant flow, we conducted a systematic analysis of permeability (k) fields and its correlation structures. The k fields served as primary parameterization of a numerical model describing CO 2 migration during a 100 -year simulation period. We compared various permutations of two-dimensional conceptual models, including homogeneous, random, homogenous with low-k lens, and anisotropically-correlated k fields. Using a Sequential Gaussian Simulation method, for most of models, we generated 10 realizations in each model permutation. In each simulation, the amount of mobile-, residual-, and aqueous-trapped CO 2 was calculated and the spatial distribution of the CO 2 plume was quantified using the first and second spatial moments. Both homogeneous and random simulation results suggest that the amount of residual trapped CO 2 increases as the effective k increases. These results imply that the overall velocity distribution, which governs the sweeping area of the CO 2 plume, is a critical factor for residual CO 2 trapping. However, as overall velocity (or k field) increases, we observed that the CO 2 plume reaches the caprock more quickly. In simulations of anisotropically correlated k fields with specific correlation length ratios of 25  m× 10  m, 50  m× 10  m, and 100  m× 10  m in x (horizontal) and <b>z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>directions,</b> respectively, the CO 2 migration distance due to buoyancy force is shorter as the horizontal correlation length becomes greater. In addition, as the horizontal correlation length becomes greater, residual trapping increases because the CO 2 plume spreads farther laterally, sweeping a larger area. In sum, results of this analysis suggest that heterogeneous k fields with greater anisotropic correlation ratios tend to maximize residual trapping and minimize buoyancy-driven CO 2 migration. Our findings also suggest that k correlation structures, especially anisotropic media with specific ratios of correlation lengths, can strongly impact CO 2 trapping mechanisms by controlling velocity and tortuosity, which in turn determines the sweeping area of CO 2 plumes...|$|R
5000|$|The {{flow of the}} {{cytoplasm}} in {{the cell}} of Chara corallina is belied by the [...] "barber pole" [...] movement of the chloroplasts. Two sections of chloroplast flow are observed {{with the aid of}} a microscope. These sections are arranged helically along the longitudinal axis of the cell. In one section, the chloroplasts move upward along one band of the helix, while in the other, the chloroplasts move downwardly. The area between these sections are known as indifferent zones. Chloroplasts are never seen to cross these zones, and as a result it was thought that cytoplasmic and vacuolar fluid flow are similarly restricted, but this is not true. First, Kamiya and Kuroda, experimentally determined that cytoplasmic flow rate varies radially within the cell, a phenomenon not clearly depicted by the chloroplast movement. Second, Raymond Goldstein and others developed a mathematical fluid model for the cytoplasmic flow which not only predicts the behavior noted by Kamiya and Kuroda, but predicts the trajectories of cytoplasmic flow through indifferent zones. It should be noted that the Goldstein model ignores the vacuolar membrane, and simply assumes that shear forces are directly translated to the vacuolar fluid from the cytoplasm. The Goldstein model predicts there is net flow toward one of the indifferent zones from the other. This actually is suggested by the flow of the chloroplasts. At one indifferent zone, the section with the chloroplasts moving at a downward angle will be above the chloroplasts moving at an upward angle. This section is known as the minus different zone (IZ-). Here, if each direction is broken into components in the theta (horizontal) and <b>z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>directions,</b> the sum of these components oppose each other in the z direction, and similarly diverges in theta direction. The other indifferent zone has the upwardly angled chloroplast movement on top and is known as the positive indifferent zone (IZ+). Thus, while the z directional components oppose each other again, the theta components now converge. The net effect of the forces is cytoplasmic/vacuolar flow moves from the minus indifferent zone to the positive indifferent zone. As stated, these directional components are suggested by chloroplast movement, but are not obvious. Further, the effect of this cytoplasmic/vacuolar flow from one indifferent zone to the other demonstrates that cytoplasmic particles do cross the indifferent zones even if the chloroplasts at the surface do not. Particles, as they rise in the cell, spiral around in a semicircular manner near the minus indifferent zone, cross one indifferent zone, and end up near a positive indifferent zone. Further experiments on the Characean cells support of the Goldstein model for vacuolar fluid flow. However, due to the vacuolar membrane (which was ignored in the Goldstein model), the cytoplasmic flow follows a different flow pattern. Further, recent experiments have shown that the data collected by Kamiya and Kuroda which suggested a flat velocity profile in the cytoplasm are not fully accurate. Kikuchi worked with Nitella flexillis cells, and found an exponential relationship between fluid flow velocity and distance from cell membrane. Although this work is not on Characean cells, the flows between Nitella flexillis and Chara coralina are visually and structurally similar.|$|R

We have developed a miniaturized, high speed AFM scanner in which the dynamics of the z-scanning stage are made insensitive to its surrounding dynamics via suspension of it on specific dynamically determined points. This resulted in a mechanical bandwidth as high as that of the z-actuator (50 kHz) while remaining insensitive to the dynamics of its base and surroundings.
