CZ had been synthesized since 1930 but only in ceramic form: the growth of single-crystal CZ would require an approach radically different from those used for previous simulants due to zirconium's extremely high melting point (2750nbsp&°C), unsustainable by any crucible.

40|$|Abstract. Three-terminal real-space {{transfer}} (RST) devices employ charge {{injection of}} hot electrons over a potential barrier into an independently contacted second conducting layer. The first conducting layer {{is the usual}} transistor channel, where electrons are heated by the source to drain field. The high RST injection {{is accompanied by a}} strong negative differential resistance (NDR) in the source-drain circuit. Because of the NDR property, RST transistors can be used, e. g., as voltage-controlled oscillators for wireless applications. Efficiency of the RST has been amply demonstrated in III-V heterostructures, where bandwidths in excess of 100 GHz have been demonstrated. Silicon implementations of RST have been so far limited to the Si/GeSi heterosystem. In this paper I discuss possible implementation of RST transistors in Si, using low-barrier dielectrics, such as <b>zirconium</b> <b>silicates,</b> which are currently under intensive investigation {{in the context of the}} high-κ dielectrics program.

On the basis of published data the three-dimensional phase region of NASICON materials is constructed and phase relations to ternary and binary systems {{as well as to}} single oxides are presented. To date, the NASICON region can be described as a compressed tetrahedron within the tetrahedral phase diagram. However, the three-dimensional presentation clearly elucidates that few reported compositions exist outside this compressed tetrahedron indicating that the phase region of NASICON materials may be larger than the solid solutions known so far. The three-dimensional representation also better elucidates the regions connecting the edges of the NASICON tetrahedron with ternary and binary compounds as well as single oxides, i. e. ZrO 2 and ZrSiO 4, Na 3 PO 4, sodium <b>silicates</b> and sodium <b>zirconium</b> <b>silicates</b> and gives a better understanding of phase formations during the processing of the ceramics.

2500|$|Increased gate-oxide leakage: The gate oxide, {{which serves}} as {{insulator}} between the gate and channel, should be made as thin as possible to increase the channel conductivity and performance when the transistor is on and to reduce subthreshold leakage when the transistor is off. However, with current gate oxides with a thickness of around 1.2nm (which in silicon is ~5atoms thick) the quantum mechanical phenomenon of electron tunneling occurs between the gate and channel, leading to increased power consumption. Silicon dioxide has traditionally been used as the gate insulator. [...] Silicon dioxide however has a modest dielectric constant. Increasing the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric allows a thicker layer while maintaining a high capacitance (capacitance is proportional to dielectric constant and inversely proportional to dielectric thickness). All else equal, a higher dielectric thickness reduces the quantum tunneling current through the dielectric between the gate and the channel. Insulators that have a larger dielectric constant than silicon dioxide (referred to as high-κ dielectrics), such as group IVb metal silicates e.g. hafnium and <b>zirconium</b> <b>silicates</b> and oxides {{are being used to}} reduce the gate leakage from the 45 nanometer technology node onwards. On the other hand, the barrier height of the new gate insulator is an important consideration; the difference in conduction band energy between the semiconductor and the dielectric (and the corresponding difference in valence band energy) also affects leakage current level. For the traditional gate oxide, silicon dioxide, the former barrier is approximately 8 eV. For many alternative dielectrics the value is significantly lower, tending to increase the tunneling current, somewhat negating the advantage of higher dielectric constant. The maximum gate-source voltage is determined by the strength of the electric field able to be sustained by the gate dielectric before significant leakage occurs. As the insulating dielectric is made thinner, the electric field strength within it goes up for a fixed voltage. This necessitates using lower voltages with the thinner dielectric.|$|R
40|$|Ilmenite and zircon megacrysts, {{among other}} {{minerals}} representing the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, are exclusively {{delivered to the}} surface by kimberlite magmas. The intimate association of ilmenite and zircon with their transporting kimberlite melts still remains perplexing, as these minerals {{do not belong to}} the kimberlite liquidus assemblage at crustal pressures. The ilmenite and zircon megacrysts from the Monastery kimberlite (South Africa) represent a textbook example of the megacryst suite. The megacrysts show substantial chemical modification along contacts with the host kimberlite. Fine-grained "reaction" assemblages, comprising minerals rich in Zr (baddeleyite and sodium-zirconium silicates) and Ti (Ti-Fe oxides, perovskite, sphene, kassite), are present around zircon and ilmenite, respectively. At the zircon-ilmenite contact, chemical contributions from both minerals are recorded in Zr-Ti-rich phases such as calzirtite and zirkelite. The megacrysts contain crystallised melt pools and secondary melt inclusions in healed fractures; their mineral assemblage is dominated by alkali-bearing phases, including silicates (nepheline, kalsilite, sodalite, phlogopite-tetraferriphlogopite), titanates (priderite, freudenbergite), <b>zirconium</b> <b>silicates</b> (khibinskite, parakeldyshite), carbonates (zemkorite, eitelite), phosphates (apatite, bradleyite, nahpoite), sulfates (aphthitalite) and chlorides (halite, sylvite). These inclusions and melt pools are interpreted to be produced by reaction between the megacrysts and the transporting kimberlite melt, which infiltrated fractures in the megacrysts. Most secondary minerals at contacts with kimberlite require a supply of Ca, which is readily available in the carbonatite component of the kimberlite magma. The enrichment of the encapsulated mineral assemblages in alkali and volatile elements (Na, K, S, Cl) also appears to originate from the kimberlite melt. The similar U-Pb ages and identical Hf-isotope compositions of the megacryst assemblage (89. 2 ± 2. 8 Ma; εHf - 0. 4 to + 1. 3), the reaction assemblage (98 ± 7 Ma) and the host kimberlite (90 ± 4 Ma; εHf - 0. 6 to +. 1. 7), imply their close genetic affinity. Although the megacrysts and kimberlite magma originated from the same source at the same time, the chemical disequilibrium recorded in the alteration of megacrysts precludes a simple "parental melt-cognate crystal" relationships. This apparent paradox can be resolved by considering the unmixing of a protokimberlite melt into silicate-oxide and carbonate liquids at mantle conditions. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. SiC fiber {{reinforced}} SiC matrix (SiC/SiC) composites {{are one of}} {{the most}} promising materials for high temperature structural applications such as power generation and propulsion systems. SiC/SiC composites are, however, susceptible to accelerated attacks in water vapor environments through oxidation and volatilization reaction. For protection from such attacks, Environmental Barrier Coatings (EBCs) are indispensable. We have investigated some oxides and rare-earth silicates as topcoat candidate materials for EBCs. Topcoat materials must be stable in the high-water-vapor pressurized environments at high temperatures. Also, it is important that the thermal expansion coefficient of topcoat materials is similar to that of the SiC/SiC composites.
