40|$|Peri-urban dairy {{producers}} in West Africa face major production constraints including inadequate and poor quality feeds. In {{view of the}} high cost of traditional supplementary feeds such as oilseed cakes, the production of forage, especially legumes, is increasingly being advocated. However, it has not been established whether returns in terms of increased livestock productivity from sown forages will be adequate to encourage smallholder livestock owners to undertake forage production for indigenous livestock. In three trials involving indigenous Bunaji cows biological and economic responses in terms of milk yields to farmer-planted forage legumes and tree legumes from home gardens were evaluated. Synthesis of the resulting data on labour inputs, forage yields, feed intakes, milk yields, value of outputs and cost of inputs such as seeds and fertilizers showed that for the semi-intensive smallholder and <b>zero-grazed</b> models considered in this study, the margin or profit from using home-grown fodder was 5 - 8 times the cost of acquiring the feed. The opportunity cost of using the land for forage production rather than for cultivating sorghum, a highly favoured cereal crop, was only 67 percent of the accrued benefits from milk yields produced by cows supplemented with the forage hays. Thus, there is a real potential for profitable dairy production in peri-urban areas using home-grown fodder...|$|R
40|$|Although grazing {{of dairy}} cows is an {{integral}} part of dairy farming in many European countries, farmers today more often choose for <b>zero-grazing</b> systems, where cows are housed throughout the year. Some studies already compared grazing and <b>zero-grazing</b> systems for specific issues such as labor efficiency, environmental impact, or animal welfare. In our study, we perform a more integrated evaluation, considering relevant ecological, economic, and social aspects. This allows for a balanced and more complete comparison of the sustainability performance of the two production methods. We evaluated ten intensive grazing and ten <b>zero-grazing</b> specialized Flemish dairy farms on the use of nutrients and energy, productivity and profitability, labor input, and animal welfare. In addition, we put special effort in formulating useful management advice for farmers. Therefore, we combined a detailed analysis of the sustainability indicators with an intensive interaction and discussion with farmers and farm advisors. Results show that, on average, the <b>zero-grazing</b> farms performed significantly worse from an ecological and economic point of view. This fact is explained mainly due to a less efficient use of concentrates and byproducts. Social sustainability performance did not differ significantly between the two groups. As a result, the integrated sustainability performance was significantly lower for the <b>zero-grazing</b> group. This finding shows that a further shift from intensive grazing to <b>zero-grazing</b> can move dairy farming in Flanders further away from sustainability.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} stratified {{random sample}} survey of 1755 households in the Kenya highlands was conducted between June 1996 and April 1998 to quantify cattle population dynamics in smallholder herds. The free-, semi-zero- and <b>zero-grazing</b> systems practised represented increasing levels of intensification of the farms. Additional data were collected in a follow-up survey of 50 households from the main survey sample. In the main survey there were 987 cattle-keeping households, of which 44, 33 and 23 % practised zero-, semi-zero- and free-grazing systems, respectively. Compared to free-grazing, <b>zero-grazing</b> farms had {{a higher proportion of}} cows in the herd (0. 62 vs. 0. 51) but lower calving rates (0. 52 vs. 0. 69), higher losses of potential heifer replacements (0. 47 vs. 0. 38), fewer heifer replacements as a proportion of cows disposed (0. 46 vs. 1. 11) and shorter productive life (3. 8 vs. 4. 8 years). Semi-zero-grazing farms had intermediate performance. They and the <b>zero-grazing</b> farms were unable to maintain their herds without acquiring replacements externally. Animal class mortality rates were high (7 - 19 %) regardless of grazing system practised. Diseases accounted for the largest proportion of animal exits: 85 % of heifer-calves, 38 % of heifers and 36 % of cows. According to farmers' ranking, East Coast fever and Anaplasmosis diseases assumed less importance with a shift from free-grazing to <b>zero-grazing</b> system. A household's needs for cash was the second most frequent reason after disease for animal exits: 33 % of heifers and 27 % of cows, indicating the importance of cattle as liquid capital assets. The results showed that many zero-grazed herds required external sources of replacement animals to sustain their populations. Solutions to this constraint will include technical and institutional innovations to serve small-scale farms that may result in greater complementarities between, the small- and large-scale production components of the dairy sub-sector.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of grazing versus <b>zero-grazing</b> on energy expenditure (EE), feeding behaviour and physical activity in dairy cows at different stages of lactation. Fourteen Holstein cows were subjected to two treatments in a repeated crossover design with three experimental series (S 1, S 2, and S 3) reflecting increased days in milk (DIM). At the beginning of each series, cows were on average at 38, 94 and 171 (standard deviation (SD) 10. 8) DIM, respectively. Each series consisted of two periods containing a 7 -d adaptation and a 7 -d collection period each. Cows either grazed on pasture for 16 – 18. 5  h per day or were kept in a freestall barn and had ad libitum access to herbage harvested from the same paddock. Herbage intake was estimated using the double alkane technique. On each day of the collection period, EE of one cow in the barn and of one cow on pasture was determined for 6  h by using the 13 C bicarbonate dilution technique, with blood sample collection done either manually in the barn or using an automatic sampling system on pasture. Furthermore, during each collection period physical activity and feeding behaviour of cows were recorded over 3  d using pedometers and behaviour recorders. Milk yield decreased with increasing DIM (P< 0. 001) but was similar with both treatments. Herbage intake was lower (P< 0. 01) for grazing cows (16. 8  kg dry matter (DM) /d) compared to <b>zero-grazing</b> cows (18. 9  kg DM/d). The lowest (P< 0. 001) intake was observed in S 1 and similar intakes were observed in S 2 and S 3. Within the 6 -h measurement period, grazing cows expended 19 % more (P< 0. 001) energy (319 versus 269  kJ/kg metabolic body size (BW 0. 75)) than <b>zero-grazing</b> cows and differences in EE did not change with increasing DIM. Grazing cows spent proportionally more (P< 0. 001) time walking and less time standing (P< 0. 001) and lying (P< 0. 05) than <b>zero-grazing</b> cows. The proportion of time spent eating was greater (P< 0. 001) and that of time spent ruminating was lower (P< 0. 05) for grazing cows compared to <b>zero-grazing</b> cows. In conclusion, lower feed intake along with the unchanged milk production indicates that grazing cows mobilized body reserves to cover additional energy requirements which were at least partly caused by more physical activity. However, changes in cows׳ behaviour between the considered time points during lactation were too small so that differences in EE remained similar between treatments with increasing DIM...|$|E

Biohydrogenation of 18 : 2 n- 6 and 18 : 3 n- 3 was not different between treatments and averaged 79. 9 and 90. 5 %, respectively. Intestinal absorption as a proportion of duodenal flow of all the fatty acids were high ranging from 0. 70 for 12 : 0 to 0. 96 for 18 : 1 trans.

The overall mean antibody titres were: 10. 8 and 15. 9 in UM 1 zero grazing and open-grazing respectively; 8. 1 in UM 2 and 17. 4 and 30. 4 in UM 4 <b>zero-grazing</b> and opengrazing respectively and these were significantly different (p< 0. 05). Mean calf antibody titres were associated mainly with calf level factors that included, AEZ-grazing strata, maternal antibodies, calf housing, age of calf, AEZ-grazing strata and calf age interaction, calf sickness and occurrence of ECF (p< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Livestock keeping {{has been}} the {{essential}} source of livelihood in Babati District for many hundreds of years. The traditional ecological knowledge about this semi-arid environment has influenced the general view on livestock management. This essay discusses the measures that are, or could be taken in Babati District to prevent overstocking and overgrazing in the woodlands. With the continuing population density increase also the livestock population grows. More houses and roads are built and the grazing lands diminish. To avoid overgrazing forest management programmes restrict grazing in forests. This additionally decreases availability of grazing land. My conclusion is that minimizing number of livestock is necessary to not exceed carrying capacity of pasture during drought. Hence this is not free from problems since it is traditionally rooted to have {{a large number of}} livestock as a buffer of energy and wealth. One solution for both how to prevent overstocking and how to survive with small number of livestock is to practise <b>zero-grazing.</b> <b>Zero-grazing</b> is to keep a small number of healthy big cattle e. g. exotic cows or crossbreeds in stables or tied up. However, when tying cattle on the spot the fact that cattle have four legs is disregarded...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the influence of selected husbandry factors on interval to resumption of post-partum cyclicity among dairy cows in urban and peri-urban Kampala. A prospective study of 85 day post-partum period of 59 dairy cows in open (n = 38) and zero grazing (n = 21) systems was conducted on 24 farms. Cows of parity 1 – 6 were recruited starting 15 – 30 days post-partum. Progesterone (P 4) content in milk taken at 10 – 12 day intervals was analysed using ELISA. The cow P 4 profiles were classified into ‘normal’ (56 days), ‘ceased’ or ‘prolonged’ (if started < 56 days but with abnormal P 4 displays) resumption of luteal activity and tested for association with husbandry and cow factors. Of the 59 cows, luteal activity in 81. 4 % resumed normally and in 18. 6 %, delayed. Only 23. 7 % maintained regular luteal activity, while the others had ceased (10. 2 %), prolonged (37. 3 %) or unclear luteal activity (20. 3 %). There were no differences between open and <b>zero-grazed</b> cows. Milk production was higher (p < 0. 05) in zero than open grazing, in urban than peri-urban and in cows fed on brew waste (p < 0. 001) compared with mill products and banana peels. Results suggest that luteal activity resumes normally in a majority of cows, although only a minority experienced continued normal cyclicity once ovulation had occurred, in the two farming systems irrespective of feed supplements or water, and that supplementing with brew waste is beneficial for milk production...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence and pattern of bovine par atuberculosis occurrence in indigenous and exotic cattle breeds in Wakiso and Masaka districts, Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was carried in these districts with a well-established small-holder commercial dairy system supplying livestock products to major urban centers. Questionnaires were administered to farmers prior to blood sampling. Results revealed farmers operated open herds and were acquiring replacement stock from fellow farmers, cattle traders or donations. Most cattle in Wakiso were <b>zero-grazed</b> with a few grazed on pastures; communally, in paddocks or tethered. In contrast most cattle in Masaka were fed on pastures as opposed to zero grazing. Of 436 adult cattle sero-tested in Wakiso, par atuberculosis was highest in indigenous cattle (15 %), was 8. 3 % in cross-breeds and 5. 8 % in exotic breeds. Individual cow prevalence in Wakiso was 7. 8 % whilst herd prevalence was 36. 23 %. Screening of 384 adult cattle in Masaka revealed prevalence of par atuberculosis of 3. 26, 4. 48 and 4. 9 % in the indigenous breeds, exotic dairy and cross breeds, respectively, with individual cow prevalence of 3. 91 % and herd prevalence of 24. 44 %. The prevalence of par atuberculosis was significantly higher in Wakiso compared to Masaka (p< 0. 05, χ 2 = 5. 5043). The factors associated with increased risk of herd infection included; “where adult cattle were housed”, “adult cattle fed on pasture”, “calves allowed to suckle their mothers” and “calves not separated from their mothers”. This study confirms the presense of par atuberculosis in Ugandan cattle and shows that farmers are unaware of its occurrence or prevention...|$|R
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study of sero-conversion of youngstock to the tick-borne pathogens Theileria parva, T mutans, Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina and B. bovis was conducted over two years on smallholder dairy farms in Tanga region, Tanzania. There was evidence of maternal antibodies to all tick-borne pathogens in animals less than 18 weeks of age. Seroprevalence increased as expected with age in animals older than this but seroprevalence profiles underestimated the force of infection due to waning antibody levels between samplings. By {{the end of the}} 2 -year study, less than 50 % of study animals had seroconverted to each of the tick-borne pathogens investigated, consistent with the low levels of tick attachment observed on the study animals. Some associations between seroconversion to tick-borne pathogens, and counts of their known tick vectors on the animals, were identified as expected. However, some were not, suggesting that counts of some tick species may act as an index of rates of attachment of other vector species. Variation in acaricide treatment frequencies was not associated with variations in tick-borne pathogen seroprevalence suggesting that acaricides may be used more frequently than necessary on many farms. Most animals were <b>zero-grazed,</b> a management system associated with a significantly lower likelihood that animals seroconverted to any tick-borne pathogen exceptA. marginale. Seroprevalence varied locally with farm location (particularly for Babesia spp.) but was not well predicted by indices of ecological conditions. Our findings suggest that attempts to achieve a state of 'endemic stability' for tick-bome pathogens may be unreasonable on the smallholder dairy farms studied but reductions in the frequency of use of acaricides may be possible following prospective studies of effects on mortality and morbidity due to tick-bome pathogens.

Smallholder farmers in Kenya collect manure from confined cattle housing termed <b>zero-grazing</b> units. <b>Zero-grazing</b> designs may include urine collection, though {{the effectiveness of these}} designs in improving manure N content has not been established. The manure-urine mixtures produced in these units were simulated to determine urine effects on manure N composition. Manure and manure-urine mixtures were stored for 120 days during dry and rainy seasons in Kenya. Manure-urine mixtures leached 26 % of their mineral N content during the dry season, but only 12 % during the rainy season. After storage, manure-urine mixtures had less organic-N and fiber-N than manure alone during the dry season (P < 0. 01), but not during the rainy season. Results suggest that the effect of cattle urine on manure N composition is greater during dry seasons than rainy. Manure should not be stored more than 30 days to minimize N loss to leaching. Farmers may take steps to reduce N loss by controlling leaching and protecting manure from rainfall. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study of serum antibody responses of cattle to tick-borne pathogens (Theileria parva, Theileria mutans, Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis) {{was conducted on}} smallholder dairy farms in Tanga and Iringa Regions of Tanzania. Seroprevalence was highest for T. parva (48 % in Iringa and 23 % in Tanga) and B. bigemina (43 % in Iringa and 27 % in Tanga) and lowest for B. bovis (12 % in Iringa and 6 % in Tanga). We use spatial and non-spatial models, fitted using classical and Bayesian methods, to explore risk factors associated with seroprevalence. These include both fixed effects (age, grazing history and breeding status) and random effects (farm and local spatial effects). In both regions, seroprevalence for all tick-borne pathogens increased significantly with age. Animals pasture grazed in the 3 {{months prior to the}} start of the sampling period were significantly more likely to be seropositive for Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. Pasture grazed animals were more likely to be seropositive than <b>zero-grazed</b> animals for A. marginale, but the relationship was weaker than that observed for the other four pathogens. This study did not detect any significant differences in seroprevalence associated with other management-related variables, including the method or frequency of acaricide application. After adjusting for age, there was weak evidence of localised (< 5 km) spatial correlation in exposure to some of the tick borne diseases. However, this was small compared with the 'farm-effect', suggesting that risk factors specific to the farm were more important than those common to the local neighbourhood. Many animals were seropositive for more than one pathogen and the correlation between exposure to the different pathogens remained after adjusting for the identified risk factors. Identifying the determinants of exposure to multiple tick-borne pathogens and characterizing local variation in risk will assist in the development of more effective control strategies for smallholder dairy farms.

Profiling of plasma and faeces by FT-IR to {{differentiate}} between heathland plant diets offered to <b>zero-grazed</b> sheep. Animal Feed Science and Technology, 144 (1 - 2), 65 - 81. On file IMPF: 01. 88 RONO: 1930 3009; 1930 5995 To investigate the relationships between plant composition in a complex diet mixture and intake by sheep, blood and faeces were analysed by Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Each of four mature Welsh Mountain ewes was maintained, {{for a period of}} 9 days, on one of three diets comprising a mixture of heathland plants containing either 100 g/kg (H 100), 200 g/kg (H 200) or 300 g/kg (H 300) heather (Calluna vulgaris) in the fresh matter. Spectra of blood and faeces from each animal were acquired and the data analysed using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). We also investigated multinomial regression as an extension beyond the pattern recognition state. Animals offered the H 300 diet could be consistently separated from animals fed on the H 100 and H 200 diets by PCA and HCA of plasma data, and these results were consistent with animals on the H 300 diet consuming greater quantities of heather. Using faecal spectra, PCA and HCA discriminated between animals on the H 200 diet and those on the H 100 and H 300 diets. Analysis of the plasma and faecal data by the multinomial model indicated that when PCs 4, 5 and 6 of the plasma data and PCs 3 and 4 of the faecal data were selected as covariates, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) achieved an accurate dietary classification for 9 out of the 11 animals. In the present study, we have shown the ability to discriminate animals offered closely related diets on the basis of metabolic fingerprints of plasma and faeces. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Eight Hereford X Friesian steers {{were used}} to {{investigate}} the effect of feeding Lolium perenne W forage containing elevated levels of water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) on rumen metabolism and nitrogen (N) absorption from the small intestine. The steers were offered ad libitum access {{to one of two}} varieties with matched heading dates (Ba 11353, high WSC, HS; AberElan, intermediate WSC, control) cut at different times of the day to accentuate WSC differentials, <b>zero-grazed</b> for 21 days. This was followed by a 14 -day period where the animals were on grass silage to provide a covariate intake. Although the total N concentration was similar for the two grasses, all other measured values were significantly different. The dry matter (DM) concentration of HS was greater than that of the control (202 v. 167 g DM per kg; P < 0. 01). WSC and in-vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were 243 and 161 g/kg DM, and 0. 61 and 0. 56 for HS and control, respectively. In contrast, acid- and neutral-detergent fibre were 251 and 296 g/kg DM and 480 and 563 g/kg DM for HS compared with control, respectively. DM intake was increased (9. 3 v. 6. 7 kg/day; P < 0. 001) for HS animals and this contributed significantly towards higher flows of non-ammonia N to the duodenum as well as increased absorption of amino acids from the small intestine. This DM intake response was partly due to the elevation in DM concentration of HS. However fresh weight intake was increased proportionately by ca. 0. 15 (P < 0. 05) in animals on HS compared with control. Rumen ammonia levels were lower (14. 0 and 26. 4 mg N per l; P < 0. 001) and concentrations of rumen propionate higher (P < 0. 01) and acetate lower (P < 0. 01; increasing the glucogenic: lipogenic volatile fatty acid ratio) in animals on HS compared with control. However, the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (15. 9 and 17. 8 g microbial nitrogen per kg organic matter apparently digested) and flow of N to the duodenum per unit N intake (0. 84 and 0. 93) for HS and control, respectively, were similar across both diets.
