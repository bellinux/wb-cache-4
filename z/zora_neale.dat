5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} on black migrant workers were dramatized in African-American writer <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston's 1937 seminal novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, her best known work and a selection on TIME magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.|$|E
5|$|Her {{next film}} {{appearance}} {{was in the}} Oprah Winfrey-produced ABC television movie Their Eyes Were Watching God (2005), an adaptation of <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston's novel, in which Berry portrayed Janie Crawford, a free-spirited woman whose unconventional sexual mores upset her 1920s contemporaries in a small community. She was nominated for another Primetime Emmy Award for this TV film. Meanwhile, she voiced the character of Cappy, {{one of the many}} mechanical beings in the animated feature Robots (2005).|$|E
5|$|The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s {{established}} the African-American literary canon in the United States and introduced writers Langston Hughes and <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston. Manhattan's vibrant visual art {{scene in the}} 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American pop art movement, which gave birth to such giants as Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. The downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s included artist Andy Warhol and clubs like Serendipity 3 and Studio 54, where he socialized.|$|E
5|$|The Heart of a Woman is {{the first}} time Angelou {{identifies}} with another female African-American writer. Her early literary influences were men, including James Weldon Johnson, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and William Shakespeare. Angelou has stated that she always admired women writers like Anne Spencer, Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, and <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston. Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as a Black woman writer.|$|E
5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} several decades, the mass African American burial site in West Palm Beach was largely {{forgotten}} by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a private individual when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by the local media. Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of West Palm Beach, established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December2000, the city of West Palm Beach purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.|$|E

25|$|<b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston (January 7, 1891 – January 28, 1960) was an American novelist, {{short story}} writer, folklorist, and {{anthropologist}} {{known for her}} contributions to African-American literature, her portrayal of racial struggles in the American South, and works documenting her research on Haitian voodoo. Of Hurston's four novels and more than 50 published short stories, plays, and essays, she {{is best known for}} her 1937 novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Dunham {{was awarded}} travel fellowships from the Julius Rosenwald and Guggenheim {{foundations}} to conduct ethnographic {{study of the}} dance forms of the Caribbean, especially as manifested in the Vodun of Haiti, a path also followed by fellow anthropology student <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston. She also received a grant to work with Professor Melville Herskovits of Northwestern University, whose ideas of African retention {{would serve as a}} platform for her research in the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Writers' Project {{operated}} in every state, where {{it created a}} famous guide book; it also catalogued local archives and hired many writers, including Margaret Walker, <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston, and Anzia Yezierska, to document folklore. Other writers interviewed elderly ex-slaves and recorded their stories. Under the Federal Theater Project, headed by charismatic Hallie Flanagan, actresses and actors, technicians, writers, and directors put on stage productions. The tickets were inexpensive or sometimes free, making theater available to audiences unaccustomed to attending plays.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} public {{recognition}} of African-American culture {{occurred during the}} Harlem Renaissance pioneered by Alain Locke. In the 1920s and 1930s, African-American music, literature, and art gained wide notice. Authors such as <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston and Nella Larsen and poets such as Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, and Countee Cullen wrote works describing the African-American experience. Jazz, swing, blues and other musical forms entered American popular music. African-American artists such as William H. Johnson and Palmer Hayden created unique works of art featuring African Americans.|$|E
25|$|Misotheistic and/or dystheistic {{expression}} has a {{long history}} in the arts and in literature. Bernard Schweizer’s book Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism is devoted to this topic. He traces the history of ideas behind misotheism from the Book of Job, via Epicureanism and the twilight of Roman paganism, to deism, anarchism, Nietzschean philosophy, feminism, and radical humanism. The main literary figures in his study are Percy Bysshe Shelley, Algernon Swinburne, <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston, Rebecca West, Elie Wiesel, Peter Shaffer, and Philip Pullman. Schweizer argues that literature is the preferred medium for the expression of God-hatred because the creative possibilities of literature allow writers to simultaneously unburden themselves of their misotheism, while ingeneously veiling their blasphemy.|$|E
25|$|Modernity and {{migration}} of black communities to the North {{has had a}} history of placing strain on the retention of black cultural practices and traditions. The urban and radically different spaces in which black culture was being produced raised fears in anthropologists and sociologists that the southern black folk aspect of black popular culture were at risk of being lost in history. The study over the fear of losing black popular cultural roots from the South have a topic of interest to many anthropologists, who among them include <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston. Through her extensive studies of Southern folklore and cultural practices,Hustron has claimed that the popular Southern folklore traditions and practices are not dying off. Instead they are evolving, developing, and re-creating themselves in different regions.|$|E
25|$|Studying in Germany, Boas {{was awarded}} a {{doctorate}} in 1881 in physics while also studying geography. He then participated in a geographical expedition to northern Canada, where he became fascinated with the culture and language of the Baffin Island Inuit. He went on to do field work with the indigenous cultures and languages of the Pacific Northwest. In 1887 he emigrated to the United States, where he first worked as a museum curator at the Smithsonian, and in 1899 became {{professor of anthropology at}} Columbia University, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} career. Through his students, many of whom went on to found anthropology departments and research programmes inspired by their mentor, Boas profoundly influenced the development of American anthropology. Among his most significant students were Manuel Gamio, A. L. Kroeber, Ruth Benedict, Edward Sapir, Margaret Mead, Melville Herskovits, Anita Brenner, and <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston.|$|E
25|$|Alan Lomax married Elizabeth Harold Goodman, then {{a student}} at the University of Texas, in February 1937. They were married for 12 years and had a daughter, Anne (later known as Anna). Elizabeth {{assisted}} him in recording in Haiti, Alabama, Appalachia, and Mississippi. Elizabeth also wrote radio scripts of folk operas featuring American music that were broadcast over the BBC Home Service as part of the war effort. During the fifties, after she and Lomax divorced, she conducted lengthy interviews for Lomax with folk music personalities, including Vera Ward Hall and the Reverend Gary Davis. Lomax also did important field work with Elizabeth Barnicle and <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> Hurston in Florida and the Bahamas (1935); with John Wesley Work III and Lewis Jones in Mississippi (1941 and 42); with folksingers Robin Roberts and Jean Ritchie in Ireland (1950); with his second wife Antoinette Marchand in the Caribbean (1961); with Shirley Collins in Great Britain and the Southeastern US (1959); with Joan Halifax in Morocco; and with his daughter. All those who assisted and worked with him were accurately credited on the resultant Library of Congress and other recordings, as well as in his many books, films, and publications.|$|E
