Experimental study of electron correlation is hindered by the long <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> (the time within which {{no more than two}} electrons can be detected) of electron detection system. We developed a new three‐dimensional (3 D) particle coincidence imaging system to remove this restriction. The detection system employs a new strategy: It uses a fast‐frame camera to record positional information on 2 D MCPs/phosphor detector (so the particle velocities in two dimensions can be measured); It utilizes a high‐speed digitizer to pick up the signal from MCP lead, off‐line analysis is performed on the waveform recorded by the digitizer to get time information (so the velocity in third dimension is measured) with best resolution and accuracy. This particle coincidence imaging system has three major breakthroughs: It achieved 0. 64 ns <b>dead</b> <b>time</b> for electron detection; It’s also possible to have true <b>zero</b> <b>dead</b> with less than 1 ns TOF uncertainty; The best TOF resolution reaches 32 ps.

40|$|Human motion {{detection}} is {{of fundamental}} importance {{for control of}} human–robot coupled systems such as exoskeletal robots. Inertial measurement units {{have been widely used}} for this purpose, although delay is a major challenge for inertial measurement unit-based motion capture systems. In this paper, we use previous and current inertial measurement unit readings to predict human locomotion based on their kinematic properties. Human locomotion is a synergetic process of the musculoskeletal system characterized by smoothness, high nonlinearity, and quasi-periodicity. Takens’ reconstruction method can well characterize quasi-periodicity and nonlinear systems. With Takens’ reconstruction framework, we developed improving methods, including Gaussian coefficient weighting and offset correction (which is based on the smoothness of human locomotion), Kalman fusion with complementary joint data prediction and united source of historical embedding generation (which is synergy-inspired), and Kalman fusion with the Newton-based method with a velocity and acceleration high-gain observer (also based on smoothness). After thorough analysis of the parameters and the effect of these improving techniques, we propose a novel prediction method that possesses the combined advantages of parameter robustness, high accuracy, trajectory smoothness, <b>zero</b> <b>dead</b> <b>time,</b> and adaptability to irregularities.

In Phase I, we upgraded one of our existing spectrometer designs to demonstrate the key principle of fast waveform capture using a 500 MSPS, 12 bit ADC and a Xilinx Virtex- 4 FPGA. This upgraded spectrometer, named P 500, performed well in initial tests of energy resolution, pulse shape analysis, and timing measurements, thus achieving item (a) above. In Phase II, we are revising the P 500 to build a commercial prototype with the improvements listed in items (b) -(d). As described in the previous report, two devices were built to pursue this goal, named the Pixie- 500 and the Pixie- 500 Express. The Pixie- 500 has only minor improvements from the Phase I prototype and is intended as an early commercial product (its production and part of its development were funded outside the SBIR). It also allows testing of the ADC performance in real applications. The Pixie- 500 Express (or Pixie- 500 e) includes all of the improvements (b) -(d). At the end of Phase II of the project, we have tested and debugged the hardware, firmware and software of the Pixie- 500 Express prototype boards delivered 12 / 3 / 2010. This proved substantially more complex than anticipated. At the time of writing, all hardware bugs have been fixed, the PCI Express interface is working, the SDRAM has been successfully tested and the SHARC DSP has been booted with preliminary code. All new ICs and circuitry on the prototype are working properly, however some of the planned firmware and software functions have not yet been completely implemented and debugged.
