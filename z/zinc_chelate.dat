500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until hatching. Eggs are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup of the outer shell, called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its <b>zinc</b> <b>chelate,</b> which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable bird egg (as opposed to a non-viable egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the albumen (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The albumen protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E

40|$|Zinc from <b>zinc</b> <b>chelate</b> of {{amino acids}} hydrate would not exert {{additional}} or different adverse effects in target species than those observed for zinc from authorised inorganic sources. Consequently it is concluded that the <b>zinc</b> <b>chelate</b> of {{amino acids hydrate}} is a safe source of zinc for all animal species, considering the maximum authorised contents for total zinc in feedingstuffs. The use of <b>zinc</b> <b>chelate</b> of amino acids hydrate as feed additive {{is not expected to}} modify the current consumer exposure to zinc. Therefore, no concerns for consumer safety are expected from the use of <b>zinc</b> <b>chelate</b> of amino acids hydrate in animal nutrition up to the maximum authorised levels of total zinc in feedingstuffs. The additive should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and, due to its amino acid/peptide component, as a skin sensitiser. The risk of exposure by inhalation would be low. The use of zinc as a feed additive does not pose a direct concern for the soil compartment. However, there is a potential environmental concern related to drainage and run-off of zinc to surface water. Most vulnerable for these processes are acid sandy soils. In order to draw a final conclusion, some further refinement to the assessment of zinc-based feed additives in livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required.

40|$|Racemic- 2, 3 -dimercaptosuccinic acid (rac-DMSA) ¹ was {{synthesized}} and {{its structure}} in the solid state was studied by single crystal X-ray analysis. The three-dimensional structure of rac-DMSA solid is stabilized by van der Waals forces, whereas the meso-DMSA solid is stabilized by hydrogen bonding. This accounts for the drastic difference in the solubilities of DMSA stereoisomers. The behavior of DMSA stereoisomers in aqueous solution were studied by potentiometric titration, IR and ¹H NMR. Rac-DMSA irreversibly converts to the meso form at an elevated temperature under acidic conditions. Two mechanisms were proposed to explain the conversion. At high pH rac-DMSA tends to form ion-paired complexes with alkaline counter ions via two carboxylate groups. At physiological pH DMSA stereoisomers form two intramolecular six-membered rings. The formation constants and the structures of lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>chelates</b> of DMSA stereoisomers formed in aqueous solution were determined by potentiometric titration, IR and ¹H NMR. Lead and zinc complex with rac-DMSA {{to a greater extent}} than with meso-DMSA. DMSA stereoisomers tend to form dimeric chelates with Zn²⁺, but monomeric chelates with Pb²⁺. In the <b>zinc</b> <b>chelates</b> of rac-DMSA two bulky carboxylate groups of the ligand have a staggered anti-relation, whereas in the <b>zinc</b> <b>chelates</b> of meso-DMSA two carboxylate groups assumes a staggered gauche-relation. This accounts for that the formation constants of <b>zinc</b> <b>chelates</b> of rac-DMSA are invariably larger than those of the corresponding chelates of meso-DMSA. The binding sites in PbL of DMSA stereoisomers are two thiolate groups and one carboxylate group of the ligands. In the lead chelates of the stereoisomers of DMSA, rac-DMSA exists in a staggered anti-conformation, but meso-DMSA favors a staggered gauche-conformation with respect to the bulky carboxylate groups. This accounts for that the formation constants of the lead chelates of rac-DMSA are invariably larger than those of the corresponding chelates of meso-DMSA. On the basis of our studies ZnL₂ chelate of rac-DMSA has been proposed to be a more effective lead chelator than meso-DMSA for therapeutical use...|$|R

40|$|The human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) trans activator, TAX 1, interacts {{indirectly}} with a TAX 1 -responsive element, TRE- 2, {{located at}} positions - 117 to - 163 in the viral long terminal repeat. This report describes {{the characterization of}} a 36 -kilodalton (kDa) protein identified in HeLa nuclear extract which mediates the interaction of TAX 1 with TRE- 2. Purification of the protein was achieved by <b>zinc</b> <b>chelate</b> chromatography and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The renatured 36 -kDa protein bound specifically to a TRE- 2 oligonucleotide but not to nonfunctional base substitution mutant probes in a gel retardation assay. Renatured proteins of differing molecular weights were unable to form this complex. In addition, the 36 -kDa protein specifically activated transcription from the HTLV-I promoter in vitro. Purified TAX 1 protein formed a complex with the TRE- 2 oligonucleotide {{in the presence of}} the 36 -kDa protein, suggesting that indirect interaction of TAX 1 with the viral long terminal repeat may be one of the mechanisms by which HTLV-I transcription is regulated...|$|E
40|$|The IR {{spectra of}} twenty-one {{transition}} metal complexes of 8 -hydroxyquinoline {{over the range}} 700 - 50 cm⁻¹ are discussed {{in relation to their}} known or inferred structures. The complexes are of three types: (a) the bis(aquo) complexes of the first row transition metal(II) ions, [M(ox) ₂(H₂O) ₂] (M =Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn); (b) the corresponding anhydrous complexes, [M(ox) ₂]n (M=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and (c) the complexes of the metal(III) ions, [M(ox) ₃] (M = Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ga, Rh and In). Deuterated 8 -hydroxyquinoline was. synthesized by the Skraup synthesis and has been used to assist in the assignment of the metal-ligand modes. The assignment of these bands was further based on ⁶⁴,⁶⁸Zn labellihg of the bis(aquo) <b>zinc</b> <b>chelate</b> and on the effects of metal ion substitution in relation to structural considerations based on crystal field theory. An investigation of the IR spectra of a series of -tris, bis and mono(8 -aminoquinoline) complexes of the first transition row metal(II) perchlorates and halides is reported...|$|E

The transformation of NIH- 3 T 3 fibroblasts by ras oncogenes has recently been demonstrated to result in tumour cells releasing a haemolytic factor. The purpose of this study has been to purify and further characterise the soluble tumour haemolytic factor (sTHF) produced by mouse fibroblasts transformed by T 24 human bladder cancer DNA and by the cloned Harvey murine sarcoma viral oncogene. To this end, transformed fibroblasts were cultivated in serum-free medium. The cell-free supernatant was treated with ammonium sulphate and the precipitate achieved at 60 - 100 % saturation was dialysed and applied to a gel filtration column. A haemolytic factor was eluted with an Mr between 65, 000 and 75, 000. <b>Zinc</b> <b>chelate</b> and strong anion exchange column chromatography resulted in greater than 3, 000 -fold enrichment of sTHF. SDS-PAGE of sTHF resulted in a single protein band of 66, 000 Da. Soluble THF had no immunological cross-reactivity with known cytokines produced by lymphocytes and macrophages. The pathophysiological role of sTHF in cancer remains to be determined...|$|E

40|$|AbstractZinc {{has been}} proven to be {{anticonvulsant}} in several studies which indicate that diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone) and diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC), <b>zinc</b> <b>chelating</b> agents, enhance seizure activities. There is also evidence that nitric oxide (NO) generators increase zinc concentration in the brain. On the other hand, the increased level of NO in the nervous system and the consequently increased seizure threshold in cholestatic mice have been well studied. Thus, it could be hypothesized {{that one of the}} reasons for the increased seizure threshold in cholestasis is partly the enhanced endogenous zinc concentration, at least in part, due to the overproduction of NO. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that <b>zinc</b> <b>chelating</b> agents might decrease seizure activity to its pre-cholestatic level in bile duct-ligated (BDL) mice. Mice were intra-peritoneally injected with dithizone and diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC) before the induction of seizure by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and then the seizure activity was recorded. Dose response (dithizone: 5, 30, 100 and 200 mg/kg; DEDTC: 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) and time course (only for dithizone: 15, 30, 60 and 120 min) studies were performed first. Then, the effects of cholestasis, with and without dithizone injection, on seizure activity were assessed. Proconvulsant effect of dithizone and DEDTC was proved to be dose dependent although time interval between dithizone and PTZ injections did not play any significant role in the seizure activity. Cholestasis decreased seizure activity and increased lag phase before seizure and both effects were decreased by dithizone injection. It is elicited that zinc may mediate the cholestasis-induced decrement in seizure activity...|$|R
