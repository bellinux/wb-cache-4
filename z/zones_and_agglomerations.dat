Where measurements are the sole source of information used to assess ambient air quality for ozone, the third daughter directive requires that under regime 1, data is to be obtained from 31 sampling points, divided between sites in urban areas (3), suburban areas (12) and rural (regional) areas (16).

Here we present an alternative production method, based on the oxide and nitride formation during liquid-metal-deposition procedures in oxygen and/or nitrogen containing atmospheres. Rapid solidification of the small liquid <b>zone</b> suppresses floatation <b>and</b> <b>agglomeration</b> of particles, while subsequent thermo-mechanical treatments densify the material and aids particle dispersion. The in-situ particle formation coupled to the high deposition rates ensures a drastically shortened production chain.

Even without substantial optimisation of processes and material, > 2 vol. % of hard and stable Cr 2 N particles with sizes down to 80 nm could be evenly dispersed, resulting in pronounced strengthening at both room temperature and 700 Â°C without significant loss in ductility.

40|$|In 2013, the UK {{exceeded}} the EU limit value for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) annual mean at 31 of its 43 <b>zones</b> <b>and</b> <b>agglomerations.</b> Current government predictions are that full compliance {{will not be}} achieved until after 2030, with 65 % zones still expected to be exceeding in 2020. In February 2014, the European Commission launched legal proceedings against the UK for its failure to cut excessive levels of NO 2. However, there is an increasing onus on local authorities to manage air pollution locally and a legal threat in the Localism Act 2011 that may make them liable for any EU fines. This research has examined Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) reports and monitored concentrations of NO 2 over the last 14 years for all local authorities with exceedances due to road traffic and, as previously reported to this conference series, found that there is insufficient appropriate data available to evaluate the LAQM process as a whole on this basis. Instead, six case study local authorities, for which sufficient data were available, were individually evaluated to determine whether any action plan measures could be associated with changes in local NO 2 concentrations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intensification}} {{of the human}} activity in urban areas {{as a result of}} the increasing population has contributed to the air pollution worsening in cities. To reverse this trend, the European Commission established a legal framework to improve the air quality. Thereby the Member States need to develop air quality plans (AQP) for <b>zones</b> <b>and</b> <b>agglomerations</b> where air quality limit values are exceeded, in order to implement pollution control strategies and meet the legal requirements. Understanding the reasons for the levels of air quality nonâcompliance as well as evaluating available and commonly used tools to predict the air quality and their effects, is crucial for the decisionâmaking process on air quality management policies. Based on a compilation of regional and local AQP, a review of assessment capabilities and used modeling tools to evaluate the effects of emission abatement measures on the air quality and health was performed. In most cases, models are applied to estimate emissions and to assess the resulting air quality from both reference and emission abatement scenarios. Air qualityâs impacts on the health and environment are rarely quantified. Regarding the air quality assessment, beyond the modeling, monitored data for validation of simulations are also used. Some studies, however, do not include the use of air quality models, considering the monitoring network as spatially representative of the study domain (e. g. Lisbon Region, Riga, Malta). In order to overcome methodological limitations for quantifying the impacts of emission abatement measures, economic evaluation techniques or even Integrated Assessment Methodologies (IAM) have been developed.

40|$|Air quality {{assessment}} regarding metals and metalloids using experimental measurements is expensive and time consuming {{due to the}} cost and time required for the analytical determination of the levels of these pollutants. According to the European Union (EU) Air Quality Framework Directive (Directive 2008 / 50 /EC), other alternatives, such as objective estimation techniques, {{can be considered for}} ambient air {{quality assessment}} in <b>zones</b> <b>and</b> <b>agglomerations</b> where the level of pollutants is below a certain concentration value known as the lower assessment threshold. These conditions occur in urban areas in Cantabria (northern Spain). This work aims to estimate the levels of As, Cd, Ni and Pb in airborne PM 10 at two urban sites in the Cantabria region (Castro Urdiales and Reinosa) using statistical models as objective estimation techniques. These models were developed based on three different approaches: partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and an alternative approach consisting of principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with ANNs (PCA-ANN). Additionally, these models were externally validated using previously unseen data. The results show that the models developed in this work based on PLSR and ANNs fulfil the EU uncertainty requirements for objective estimation techniques and provide an acceptable estimation of the mean values. As a consequence, they could be considered as an alternative to experimental measurements for air quality assessment regarding the aforementioned pollutants in the study areas while saving time and resources.

The work adopts an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach which ensures that individual particle behaviour is accounted for by solving the particle equation of motion for each individual particle in a four-way coupled system. The hard-sphere collision model is used to detect particle-particle interactions and, on detection of a collision, particle agglomeration is tested based on the pre-collision kinetic energy, restitution coefficient and the van der Waals interactions. Particle collision <b>and</b> <b>agglomeration</b> are considered in a shear Reynolds number 300 flow of water containing spherical particles of 75 and 250 Î¼m diameter at a volume fraction of O(10 - 3). For the particle sizes considered, {{the overall number of}} collisions <b>and</b> <b>agglomerations</b> increases with time, although not all collisions result in agglomeration. The rate of collision <b>and</b> <b>agglomeration</b> is considerably higher for the lower particle size, leading to the formation of much larger agglomerates.
