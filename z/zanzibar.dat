5|$|The <b>Zanzibar</b> Archipelago, {{now part}} of the Southeast African {{republic}} of Tanzania, is a group of islands lying in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Tanganyika. It comprises the main southern island of Unguja (also known as <b>Zanzibar),</b> the smaller northern island of Pemba, and numerous surrounding islets. With a long history of Arab rule dating back to 1698, <b>Zanzibar</b> was an overseas territory of Oman until it achieved independence in 1858 under its own Sultanate. In 1890 during Ali ibn Sa'id's reign, <b>Zanzibar</b> became a British protectorate, and although never formally under direct rule was considered part of the British Empire.|$|E

5|$|In 1698, <b>Zanzibar</b> {{became part}} of the {{overseas}} holdings of Oman, falling {{under the control of the}} Sultan of Oman. In 1832, or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin Sultan moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island's slave labour. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said, struggled over the succession, so <b>Zanzibar</b> and Oman were divided into two separate principalities; Thuwaini became the Sultan of Oman while Majid became the first Sultan of <b>Zanzibar.</b> During his 14-year reign as Sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin Said, helped abolish the slave trade in <b>Zanzibar</b> and largely developed the country's infrastructure. The third Sultan, Khalifa bin Said, also furthered the country's progress toward abolishing slavery.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} impacts of the {{revolution}} in <b>Zanzibar</b> was to break {{the power of the}} Arab/Asian ruling class, who had held it for around 200 years. Despite the merger with Tanganyika, <b>Zanzibar</b> retained a Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives which was, until 1992, run on a one-party system and has power over domestic matters. The domestic government is led by the President of <b>Zanzibar,</b> Karume being the first holder of this office. This government used the success of the revolution to implement reforms across the island. Many of these involved the removal of power from Arabs. The <b>Zanzibar</b> civil service, for example, became an almost entirely African organisation, and land was redistributed from Arabs to Africans. The revolutionary government also instituted social reforms such as free healthcare and opening up the education system to African students (who had occupied only 12% of secondary school places before the revolution).|$|E

5|$|The British protagonists {{were highly}} {{regarded}} by the governments in London and <b>Zanzibar</b> {{for their actions}} leading up to and during the war, and many were rewarded with appointments and honours. General Raikes, leader of the askaris, was appointed a First Class (Second Grade) member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of <b>Zanzibar</b> on 24 September 1896, a First Class member of the Zanzibari Order of Hamondieh on 25 August 1897 and later promoted to Commander of the <b>Zanzibar</b> armies. General Mathews, the Zanzibari army commander, was appointed {{a member of the}} Grand Order of Hamondieh on 25 August 1897 and became First Minister and Treasurer to the Zanzibari government. Basil Cave, the consul, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1897 and promoted to consul-general on 9 July 1903. Harry Rawson was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his work in <b>Zanzibar</b> and would later be Governor of New South Wales in Australia and receive promotion to admiral. Rawson was also appointed a first class member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of <b>Zanzibar</b> on 8 February 1897 and the Order of Hamondieh on 18 June 1898.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Zanzibar</b> Revolution {{occurred}} in 1964 {{and led to}} the overthrow of the Sultan of <b>Zanzibar</b> and his mainly Arab government by local African revolutionaries. <b>Zanzibar</b> was an ethnically diverse state consisting of a number of islands off the east coast of Tanganyika which had been granted independence by Britain in 1963. In a series of parliamentary elections preceding independence, the Arab minority succeeded in retaining the hold on power it had inherited from Zanzibar's former existence as an overseas territory of Oman. Frustrated by under-representation in Parliament despite winning 54% of the vote in the July 1963 election, the mainly African Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) allied itself with the left-wing Umma Party, and early on the morning of 12 January 1964 ASP member John Okello mobilised around 600–800 revolutionaries on the main island of Unguja (<b>Zanzibar</b> Island). Having overrun the country's police force and appropriated their weaponry, the insurgents proceeded to <b>Zanzibar</b> Town where they overthrew the Sultan and his government. Reprisals against Arab and South Asian civilians on the island followed; the resulting death toll is disputed, with estimates ranging from several hundred to 20,000. The moderate ASP leader Abeid Karume became the country's new president and head of state, and positions of power were granted to Umma party members.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{sought help}} from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and P. R. China for funding for several projects and military advice. The failure of several GDR-led projects including the New <b>Zanzibar</b> Project, a 1968 urban redevelopment scheme to provide new apartments for all Zanzibaris, led to <b>Zanzibar</b> focussing on Chinese aid. The post-revolution <b>Zanzibar</b> government was accused of draconian controls on personal freedoms and travel and exercised nepotism in appointments to political and industrial offices, the new Tanzanian government being powerless to intervene. Dissatisfaction with the government {{came to a head}} with the assassination of Karume on 7 April 1972, which was followed by weeks of fighting between pro and anti-government forces. A multi-party system was eventually established in 1992, but <b>Zanzibar</b> remains dogged by allegations of corruption and vote-rigging, though the 2010 general election was seen to be a considerable improvement.|$|E

40|$|Power-sharing {{has become}} a common {{strategy}} to resolve political conflicts in Africa. However, it has rarely survived for very long, {{and much of the}} scholarship on power-sharing remains largely negative. Yet <b>Zanzibar's</b> power-sharing approach, adopted in 2010, points to a more positive democratic possibility. We explore the background to this development, note some of the issues behind the move to power-sharing, and look briefly at its implementation following the 2010 elections. We argue that <b>Zanzibar's</b> power-sharing strategy appears to have ended the zero-sum nature of Zanzibari politics, ushering in a more consensus-based approach reminiscent of Julius Nyerere's concept of ujamaa. For Nyerere ujamaa was a specifically African alternative to the institutionalised oppositional politics of western liberal democracy. We conclude that <b>Zanzibar's</b> experiment in power-sharing demonstrates that a multi-party political system need not be structured according to a two-party oppositional model in order to achieve stable and functional democratic government...|$|R
5|$|The {{importance}} of Lamu in the Lamu Archipelago grew {{at the expense}} of Pate {{in the years that followed}} the fort's construction. The Sultan used Lamu Fort as a base for defeating the Mazrui rebels in Mombasa, and for establishing control over the East African coast. He moved the capital of his sultanate to <b>Zanzibar.</b> With its strategic importance lost, Lamu soon declined in economic importance in comparison to Mombasa and <b>Zanzibar.</b>|$|E
5|$|The new government's {{apparent}} communist ties concerned Western governments. As <b>Zanzibar</b> lay {{within the}} British sphere of influence, the British government {{drew up a}} number of intervention plans. However, the feared communist government never materialised, and because British and United States citizens were successfully evacuated these plans were not put into effect. Meanwhile, the communist bloc powers of China, East Germany and the Soviet Union established friendly relations with the new government by recognising the country and sending advisors. Karume succeeded in negotiating a merger of <b>Zanzibar</b> with Tanganyika to form the new nation of Tanzania, an act judged by contemporary media to {{be an attempt to}} prevent communist subversion of <b>Zanzibar.</b> The revolution ended 200 years of Arab dominance in <b>Zanzibar,</b> and is commemorated on the island each year with anniversary celebrations and a public holiday.|$|E
5|$|The year of Ali's {{ascension}} {{also saw}} {{the signing of the}} Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between Britain and Germany.

5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Mercury and {{his family}} fled from <b>Zanzibar</b> for safety reasons due to the 1964 <b>Zanzibar</b> Revolution, in which {{thousands}} of Arabs and Indians were killed. The family moved into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue, Feltham, Middlesex, England. Mercury enrolled at Isleworth Polytechnic (now West Thames College) in West London where he studied art. He ultimately earned a diploma in Art and Graphic Design at Ealing Art College (now the Ealing campus of University of West London), later using these skills to design the Queen heraldic arms. A British citizen at birth, Mercury remained so {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|By 1892, Mogadishu {{was under}} the joint control of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi and the Omani Sultanate of <b>Zanzibar.</b> The Geledi Sultans were {{at the height of}} their power. They {{dominated}} the southern ivory trade, and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the hinterland. The Omani Sultans' authority in Mogadishu, however, was largely nominal. When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city, he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf of Geledi. This Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in 1870. The Sultan of <b>Zanzibar</b> later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians, but not the land itself, which was Somali owned.|$|E
5|$|In April the {{government}} formed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and completed the disarmament of Okello's remaining FMF militia. On 26 April Karume {{announced that a}} union had been negotiated with Tanganyika to form the new country of Tanzania. The merger was seen by contemporary media {{as a means of}} preventing communist subversion of Zanzibar; at least one historian states that it may have been an attempt by Karume, a moderate socialist, to limit the influence of the radically left-wing Umma Party. Babu had become close to Chinese diplomats who had arranged for several shipments of arms to be sent to <b>Zanzibar</b> to allow the Umma Party to have a paramilitary wing. Both Karume and President Nyerere of Tanganyika were concerned that <b>Zanzibar</b> was starting to become a hot-spot of Cold War tensions as American and British diplomats competed for influence with Soviet, Chinese and East German diplomats, and having a union with the non-aligned Tanganyika was considered the best way of removing <b>Zanzibar</b> from the world spotlight. However, many of the Umma Party's socialist policies on health, education and social welfare were adopted by {{the government}}.|$|E
