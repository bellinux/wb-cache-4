5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every <b>zero</b> <b>crossing,</b> has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Three simple, {{accurate}} and economical {{methods have been}} developed for the estimation of Norfloxacin and Ornidazole in tablet dosage form. First method is based on the simultaneous equations, wavelengths selected for analysis were 273. 0 nm (λmax of Norfloxacin) and 318. 5 nm (λmax of Ornidazole) respectively, in 0. 1 N NaOH. Second method is Q-analysis method, based on absorbance ratio at two selected wavelengths 297. 0 nm (iso-absorptive point) and 318. 5 nm (λmax of Ornidazole). Third method is first order derivative spectroscopy using 297. 5 nm (<b>zero</b> <b>cross</b> for Norfloxacin) and 264. 0 nm (<b>zero</b> <b>cross</b> for Ornidazole). The linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 4 - 20 µg/ml and 5 - 25 µg/ml for Norfloxacin and Ornidazole, respectively.
