40|$|Abstract: Based on hydro-acoustic and {{geophysical}} observations, {{this paper}} presents an analysis of geomorphological and geological settings of gas methane occurrence on the NW shelf and upper continental slope, in the Sorokin trough and on the Kerch-Taman offshore, in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> Gases are associated with seeps, mud volcanoes and gas hydrates. Evidence is given for the thermogenic nature of methane. The gas methane is of mostly abiogenic origin. Small gas releases may be produced by the decomposition of Quaternary organic material near the sea floor through the action of bacteria or biodegradation of redeposited thermogenic hydrocarbons. The origin of carbonate formations is related to degassing sedimentary layers. There is a possible role for deep faults in transporting gas to the sea floor. The gas hydrate stability <b>zone</b> in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> lies at minimum water depth of 600 – 650 m with its thickness up to 500 m. In the northern <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> intensive outbursts of methane into the atmosphere were first recorded in the scientific literature as early as 1928, one year {{after a series of}} destructive Crimean earthquakes (Popov 1928).

40|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Cariaco Basin {{are both}} large, euxinic marine basins in which methane {{concentrations}} {{are high and}} where anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) {{is an important part}} of the carbon cycle. AOM can be recognized by lipid biomarkers that are specific to methanotrophic archaea involved and by strongly 13 C-depleted isotope compositions consistent with uptake of 13 C-depleted methane-derived carbon. The working hypothesis for our investigation was that AOM in both the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> and Cariaco Basin would generate measurable diagnostic biomarkers and isotope depletions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed particulate matter and surface sediments for intact glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetreaethers (GDGTs), components of archaeal membrane lipids, and measured stable carbon isotope compositions of their constituent biphytanes. Several GDGTs and strongly 13 C-depleted biphytanes indicative of AOM were present in the deep anoxic region of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> (> 700 m). Unexpectedly, this biomarker signal was not detected in the upper anoxic <b>zone</b> of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> or in the entire water column of the Cariaco Basin, even though previous studies had shown high rates of AOM to occur in both basins. It is possible that the AOM-derived biomarker signal is masked by archaeal lipids derived from non-methanotrophic archaea which utilize 13 C-enriched carbon substrates. Alternately we speculate that the methanotrophic community may be highly diverse in euxinic basins, possibly producing another suite of biomarkers that we did not measure. This conclusion will require further testing by coordinated organic geochemical 9 ̆ 6 microbial ecology studies...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern about the}} {{transfer}} of methane originating from water bodies to the atmosphere. Methane from sediments can reach the atmosphere directly via bubbles or indirectly via vertical turbulent transport. This work quantifies methane gas bubble dissolution {{using a combination of}} bubble modeling and acoustic observations of rising bubbles to determine what fraction of the methane transported by bubbles will reach the atmosphere. The bubble model predicts the evolving bubble size, gas composition, and rise distance and is suitable for almost all aquatic environments. The model was validated using methane and argon bubble dissolution measurements obtained from the literature for deep, oxic, saline water with excellent results. Methane bubbles from within the hydrate stability zone (typically below _ 500 m water depth in the ocean) are believed to form an outer hydrate rim. To explain the subsequent slow dissolution, a model calibration was performed using bubble dissolution data from the literature measured within the hydrate stability zone. The calibrated model explains the impressively tall flares (> 1300 m) observed in the hydrate stability <b>zone</b> of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> This study suggests that only a small amount of methane reaches the surface at active seep sites in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> and this only from very shallow water areas (< 100 m).

With anthropogenic activities altering terrestrial and aquatic systems (e. g. fertilizer runoff changing {{the chemistry of}} coastal marine waters), knowledge about the tolerances of microbes to changing environmental conditions is critical. While having been extensively studied in saline and marine systems (e. g. oxygen minimum <b>zones,</b> the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> and Mono Lake), microbes are not well understood in marine lakes, especially those located in Palau. The marine lakes of Palau are ideal for microbial ecology because these unique habitats act like oceanic mesocosms – making studies of microbes found in other saline systems (e. g. the ocean) much more feasible. Using Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) and a next generation sequencing technique, 454 pyrosequencing, the richness, diversity, and composition of microbial communities in the marine lakes was analyzed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effects of}} growing {{concentrations}} of dissoluble fractions of Chevron oil upon some chemical {{indicators of the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> water in the Ajarian littoral zone have been studied. Oil and dissoluble oil products {{have been found to}} cause an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2), a reduction in the content of pH and significant growth of the seawater oxidizability at the expense of accumulation of organic matters and their active oxidation. As a result, the seawater’s oxygenation is affected and its buffer capacity and chemical composition stability are disrupted. At present, there is no universal method of cleaning seawater from oil pollution; therefore, every oil spill requires an individual approach. © 2008 Bull. Georg. Natl. Acad. Sci. Key words: <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> dissoluble oil products, pH (active reaction), oxidizability, carbon dioxide, Ajarian offshore strip. From the standpoint of oil pollution, the south-east-ern littoral <b>zone</b> of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> shelf represents an especially vulnerable region. In particular, Batumi, Supsa, Poti, Tuapse and Novorossiisk offshore strip. The chemical composition of the seawater is char-acterized by significant stability resulting from its high calorific capacity, large volume and great buffer ca-pacity. Notwithstanding this, mankind armed with up-to-date technology might cause an irreparable damage to the sea. A graphic example of the above is its pollu-tion with oil and dissoluble oil products which are char-acterized by particular carcinogenicity, cause oncogenic diseases and pollute the offshore strip.

40|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> {{contains}} the World’s largest body of anoxic water. Based on new and published data, we describe trends among selected protozoan and metazoan meiofaunal taxa at water depths of 120 – 240 m {{in the northwestern}} part of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> near the submarine Dnieper Canyon. This transect spans the transition between increasingly hypoxic but non-sulfidic bottom water and the deeper anoxic/sulfidic zone, the boundary between these two domains being located at approximately 150 – 180 m depth. This transition zone supports a rich rose-Bengal-stained fauna. Among the protozoans, gromiids are common only at 120 and 130 m. All other groups exhibit more or less distinct abundance maxima near {{the base of the}} hypoxic zone. Foraminifera peak sharply at ? 160 m while ciliates are most abundant at 120, 160 – 190, and 240 m, where they are possibly associated with concentrations of bacterial cells. The three most abundant metazoan taxa also exhibit maxima in the hypoxic zone, the nematodes and polychaetes at 160 m, and the harpacticoid copepods at 150 m. Most of the polychaetes belong to two species, Protodrilus sp. and Vigtorniella zaikai, the larvae of which are widely distributed in severely hypoxic water just above the anoxic/sulfidic <b>zone</b> of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> Both protozoans and metazoans are usually concentrated in the 0 – 1 cm layer of the sediment, except at the shallowest (120 – 130 m) site where deeper layers may yield a substantial proportion of the assemblage. The concentration of nematodes in the 3 – 5 cm layer at 120 m is particularly notable. Our data suggest that some benthic species can tolerate anoxic/sulfidic conditions in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> An important caveat is that anoxia or severe hypoxia may lead to the corpses of nonindigenous organisms being preserved in our samples. However, we argue that the morphological integrity of specimens, the high population densities (associated with high bacterial concentrations in the case of ciliates), the presence of taxa often found in hypoxic settings, and the presence of all life stages (including gravid females) among nematodes and harpacticoids, suggests {{that at least some of}} the organisms are indigenous.

The approach uses an adaptation of the RIVERSTRAHLER model, which is based on a schematic representation of the drainage network deduced from geomorphological analysis by stream orders. The whole catchment was divided into 10 sub-basins and one branch, to provide a description satisfying both the need {{to take into account the}} heterogeneity of the system and the availability of constraints and validation data. On the basis of this description, a hydrological model was developed, which adequately simulated the seasonal variations of the discharge measured at the outlet of the basin. The model itself resulted from the coupling of the hydrological model with a biogeochemical model (RIVE), which takes into account the main ecological processes. It established a link between microscopic processes, their controlling factors and their macroscopic manifestations in terms of nutrient cycling and ecological functioning at the scale of the whole drainage network. The model was validated for the period from 1988 to 1991 on the basis of available observations of the major water-quality variables involved in the eutrophication processes (inorganic nutrients, phytoplankton biomass, dissolved oxygen, etc.). A reasonable agreement was found between the simulations of the model and the observations. Nutrient fluxes to the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> calculated for our reference period, are in the same range as those obtained via other approaches. Si/P and N/P ratios suggest silicon, rather than phosphorus, limitation for diatoms and phosphorus, rather than nitrogen, limitation for overall phytoplankton in the coastal <b>zone</b> of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> The sharp drop in N and P delivery to the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> observed since 1991, was simulated with a scenario constructed to reproduce new constraints based on documented modifications of human activity in the watershed.

Both seem able to survive in waters of raised salinity of the lower reaches of these fluvial systems; but neither has been recorded in full salinity marine environments. The only non-marine tanaidacean thus far known lives in a slightly brackish inland spring in Northern Australia. The genus includes a second species, from a brackish-water lake at the Bismarck Archipelago, tentatively included here as non-marine also. Two additional species of tanaidaceans have been reported from non-marine habitats but both also occur in the sea. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B. V.

40|$|Mixing {{experiments}} were performed during Leg 5 of the 1988 <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> Expedition {{in order to}} learn more about the mechanism and kinetics of rare earth element (REE) scavenging at the oxic-anoxic interface of anoxic basins and, more specifically, in the suboxic <b>zone</b> of the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> Water from the depth of the dissolved REE maxima (300 dbar) was mixed in a thermostated reaction vessel with water from the depth of the particle maximum (PM) that had previously been equilibrated with the atmosphere. Subsamples were taken from the reaction vessel over a period of 24 h and analyzed for dissolved Ce (a redox reactive REE) and Nd (a non-redox reactive REE). During the first 2. 5 h both Ce and Nd were removed from solution at a high rate, presumably as a result of adsorption onto fresh Mn and/or Fe oxides that formed during equilibration of the PM end-member with the atmosphere. The rates of Ce and Nd removal were approximately the same, suggesting that oxidative scavenging of Ce was of minor importance. After 2. 5 h both Ce and Nd were released again at a rate much lower than that of the initial removal, presumably as a result of reductive dissolution of the Mn and/or Fe oxides onto which they were adsorbed. While this reductive dissolution may have been caused by sulfide that was introduced with the 300 dbar end-member, the results of a separate mixing experiment in the presence of a bio-inhibitor (formaldehyde) suggest that Mn and Fe reducing bacteria also played a significant role. The initial removal as well as the subsequent release of Ce and Nd were found to obey pseudo first-order kinetics. ...|$|R
