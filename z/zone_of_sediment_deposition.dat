40|$|Sedimentation in {{the main}} pool of a deep (maximum depth: 50 m), 227 km 2 {{hydropower}} reservoir was modeled using a three-dimensional numerical model of hydrodynamics and sedimentation for different wind, inflow, and outflow conditions. Short-term velocity measurements made in the reservoir were used to validate {{some aspects of the}} hydrodynamic model. The effects of thermal stratification on sedimentation patterns were investigated, since the reservoir is periodically strongly stratified. Stratification alters velocity profiles and thus affects sedimentation in the reservoir. Sedimentation of reservoirs is often modeled considering only the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> delivered by tributaries. However, the sediments eroding from the shorelines can contribute significantly to sedimentation if the shorelines of the reservoir erode at sufficiently high rates or if sediment delivery via tributary inflow is small. Thus, shoreline erosion rates for a reservoir were quantified based on measured fetch, parameterized beach profile shape, and measured wind vectors, and the eroded sediments treated as a source within the sedimentation modeling scheme. The methodology for the prediction of shoreline erosion was calibrated and validated using digital aerial photos of the reservoir taken in different years and indicated approximately 1 m/year of shoreline retreat for several locations. This study revealed likely <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>deposition</b> in a thermally stratified reservoir and presented a methodology for integration of shoreline erosion into sedimentation studies {{that can be used in}} any reservoir.

The exposed west—facing coast has a steeper offshore gradient, is a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> bypassing, and has a complex sequence of three nearshore bars. Wave energy levels are lower on the sheltered east coast, and this is a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> redistribution and <b>deposition</b> with a single, linear nearshore bar. The different morphological characteristics of the two barriers are attrib-uted to the spatial variation in energy levels and to the differences in offshore gradients on the two coasts.

40|$|Understanding and {{defining}} the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> deposited in reservoirs is essential {{not only at}} the design stage but also during the operation.

Long-term silting measurements of three small reservoirs were used to evaluate the method described by Rahmanian and Banihashemi for predicting sediment distributions in small reservoirs.

50|$|The {{formation}} of the Mississippi River Delta {{can be traced back}} to the late Cretaceous Period, approximately 100 million years ago, with the creation of the Mississippi embayment. The embayment began focusing sediment into the Gulf of Mexico, which facilitated the deltaic land-building processes for the future. During the Paleogene Period (approx. 65.5 to 23 million years ago), a series of smaller scale, regional rivers entered present-day southern Louisiana allowing an increase in dispersion <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>deposition</b> into the delta region. The Mississippi embayment then became a primary focus <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>deposition</b> during the Miocene Epoch (approx. 23 to 5.3 million years ago), which built the foundation of the modern delta region. The modern day Mississippi River Delta plain began to evolve during the Holocene Epoch (around 7,500 to 8,000 years ago) due to the deceleration of sea level rise and the natural shifting of the river’s course every 1,000 - 1,500 years.|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of large woody debris (LWD) {{has important implications}} for the physical and ecological behaviour of rivers, and these aspects have been researched extensively in recent years. However, this research has so far focused primarily on interactions between LWD and in-channel processes, and the role of LWD in flood-plain genesis is still poorly understood. Established conceptual models of flood-plain evolution are, therefore, lacking because they neglect the complex interaction between water, sediment, and vegetation in systems with accumulations of LWD. This study examines the effect of LWD on patterns <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>deposition</b> within a small area of forest flood plain along the Highland Water, S. England. In-channel debris dams locally increase the frequency and extent of overbank flows, and the impact of such dam on flood-plain sedimentation was observed. Nine separate flood events were monitored through the exceptionally wet winter of 2000 – 2001. During each of these, water and sediment fluxes were quantified and correlated with general rates of overbank sedimentation. Flood-plain topography, vegetation, and LWD were surveyed and related to micro- and mesoscale patterns <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> accretion. The amount <b>of</b> overbank <b>sediment</b> <b>deposition</b> was correlated most closely with flood hydrology and sediment input. The amounts (0 – 28 kg m? 2) and patterns <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>deposition</b> were both greater and more variable than have been observed on nonforest flood plains.

40|$|Abstract Sediment {{particles}} {{originating from}} erosion {{processes in the}} catchment are propagated along with the river flow. When the flow of a river is stored in a reservoir, the sediment settles in the reservoir and reduces its capacity. Reduction in the storage capacity of a reservoir beyond a limit hampers the purpose {{for which it was}} designed. Thus assessment <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>deposition</b> becomes very important for the management and operation of such reservoirs. Some conventional methods, such as hydrographie survey and inflow-outflow approaches, are used for estimation <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>deposition</b> in a reservoir, but these methods are cumbersome, time consuming and expensive. There is a need for developing simple methods, which require less time and are cost effective. In this study, a remote-sensing approach has been attempted for assessment of sedimentation in Bhakra Reservoir, located on the Satluj River {{in the foothills of the}} Himalayas. Multi date remote sensing data (1 RS- 1 B, L 1 SS II) provided the information on the water-spread area of the reservoir, which was used for computing the sedimentation rate.
