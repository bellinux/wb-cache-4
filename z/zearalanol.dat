5000|$|Mycoestrogens are estrogens {{produced}} by fungi. Among important mycoestrogens are zearalenone, zearalenol and <b>zearalanol</b> [...] Although {{all of these}} can be {{produced by}} various Fusarium species, [...] zearalenol and <b>zearalanol</b> may also be produced endogenously in ruminants that have ingested zearalenone. Alpha-zearalanol is also produced semisynthetically, for veterinary use; such use is prohibited in the European Union.|$|E
50|$|Zeranol (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand names Frideron, Ralabol, Ralgro, Ralone, Zerano; {{developmental}} code names MK-188, P-1496), or zearanol, {{also known}} as α-zearalanol or simply <b>zearalanol,</b> is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen of the resorcylic acid lactone group related to mycoestrogens found in fungi in the Fusarium genus and is used mainly as an anabolic agent in veterinary medicine.|$|E
40|$|To produce antigens {{susceptible}} to raise antibodies for resorcylic acid lactones, the 6 ′-carboxymethyloxime derivatives of zearalenone and zearalanone {{were bound to}} bovine serum albumin. Pigs could be immunized by using these antigens, the best titer in antibodies being obtained with the zearalenone antigen. The porcine antibodies were specific for the resorcylic acid lactones of structural resemblance with zearalenone. This specificity made the antibodies usable for a radioimmunoassay of zearalenone and <b>zearalanol,</b> which {{may be found in}} human and animal sera. The range of the assay was between 0. 25 and 10 ng. The limit of detection was 5 ppb (5 ng/ml) in human serum...|$|E
40|$|HPLC {{analysis}} of zearalenone (ZEA), zearalenols (-ZOL and ß-ZOL) and <b>zearalanols</b> (-ZAL and ß-ZAL) was developed, {{in order to}} obtain a sensitive and reproducible method to quantify ZEA and its reduced metabolites in subcellular fractions of animal livers (S 9 samples). Optimal in vitro metabolism was observed by incubating 5 mg S 9 proteins with 0. 016 μmol. ZEA. Acetonitrile and diethylether/chloroform mixture were compared for extraction, as well as different mobile phases and two detection modes in HPLC analysis. Extracted samples were eluted with water/acetonitrile (55 : 45, v/v) at a flow-rate of 1. 0 ml/min- 1, resulting in well separated peaks between ZEA and the metabolites. The limits of detection ranged from 0. 5 to 2 ng/mg S 9 proteins using UV, and from 0. 04 to 4 ng/mg S 9 proteins, using fluorescence detection. Fluorescence showed a ten-fold higher sensitivity than UV detection for ZEA and -ZOL. Repeatability (10 assays) was 2. 7...|$|R

A series of experiments was conducted to assess the effects of trenbolone acetate, dihydrotestosterone, 170 -estradiol, zeranol, zearalanone, <b>zearalanol,</b> dexamethasone and IGF-I on amino acid transport in L- 6 myoblasts. Incubation with 10 % FBS for 30 minutes or 2 h did not increase the transport of MeAEB. After 4 th of incubation a. 03 %(P<. 05) and. 08 % increase(P<. OOI) was observed after 15 minutes and 30 minutes of incubation respectively. After 8 h of incubation, transport was increased. 05 % or. 15 % (P<. 001) after 10 or 30 minutes of incubation. There {{was no significant difference in}} the responses of cells grown in charcoal filtered serum versus normal serum. The addition of IGF-I (2011 g/ml) increased (P<. 001) transport by. 025 %,. 046 % and. 05 % at 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation. Dexamethasone also increased (P<. 001) transport by. 013 %,. 018 % and. 023 % above the control at 1, 2 and 4 h of incubation. An increase (P<. 00 1) of. 0 1 7 %,. 03 2 %,. 048 % and. 027 % was observed at 1, 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation with zeranol. 0 <b>zearalanol</b> increased transport (P<. 00 1). 0 1 9 %,. 03 2 %,. 045 % and. 0 1 8 % at 1, 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation. Zearalanone increased (P<. 001) transport by. 016 %,. 025 % and. 014 % at 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation. Dihydrotestosterone increased (P<. 001) transport by. 0 14 %,. 019 %,. 027 %,. 03 5 % and. 020 % at. 5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation. The incubation of 170 -estradiol increased (P<. 00 1) transport by. 022 %,. 03 3 % and. 0 1 7 % at 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation. Trenbolone acetate increased (P<. 001) transport by. 012 %,. 019 %,. 028 % and. 032 % at 1, 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation. There was no change in transport of melba with IGF-I at 1. 56, 3. 12, 6. 25 or 12. 5 ng/ml IGF- 1. There was no decrease in the transport of melba as dexamethasone concentration increased from 10 - 12 to 10 - 8 M, but transport decreased (P<. 001) by. 023 % as the concentration was increased from 10 - 8 to 10 - 7 M.
