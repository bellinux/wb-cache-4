50|$|The {{sunflower}} beetle {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most damaging defoliators of cultivated sunflowers in North America. Advice published by Kansas State University in 2016 recommends the use of insecticide treatment of sunflower crops if any of the following conditions are met: one adult beetle is present per seedling, larvae reach numbers of 10-15 per plant on upper leaves, or 25 percent defoliation occurs and pupation has not begun. Given the short larval and adult lifecycle, delayed planting of sunflower crops is effective in preventing yield reductions caused by sunflower beetle. Recommended insecticides for infested crops include: Beta-cyfluthrin, Carbaryl, Deltamethrin, Esfenvalerate, Gamma-cyhalothrin, Lambda-cyhalothrin, and <b>Zeta-cypermethrin.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> pour-on to control cattle lice. Design Five field trials in south-eastern Australia. Procedure <b>Zeta-cypermethrin</b> pour-on, deltamethrin pour-on and pour-on vehicle were applied to groups of 10 cattle. Lice were counted before treatment and 14, 28, 42 and 56 days after treatment. Results <b>Zeta-cypermethrin</b> pour-on given at 2. 5 mg/kg was equivalent to, or marginally more effective than a deltamethrin pour-on at 0. 75 mg/kg. It eliminated B bovis and H eurysternus and gave good control of L vituli and S capillatus. <b>Zeta-cypermethrin</b> at 1 mg/kg gave good control of B bovis and H eurysternus but was not satisfactory against L vituli and S capillatus. Conclusion <b>Zeta-cypermethrin</b> pour-on, given at 2. 5 mg/kg, is an effective treatment for cattle lice control. <b>Zeta-cypermethrin,</b> and other synthetic pyrethroid pour-ons, are the treatment of choice to control B bovis...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> in controlling buffalo fly (Haematobia irritans exigua). Design Five field trials in northern and central Queensland. Procedure <b>Zeta-cypermethrin</b> pour-on at 2. 5 mg/kg, spray at 62. 5 ppm, deltamethrin pour-on and pour-on vehicle were applied to groups of 20 cattle. Buffalo fly counts were conducted three times before treatment and 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days after treatment. Results In central Queensland where synthetic pyrethroid resistance in buffalo fly populations was rare, 2. 5 mg/kg of <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> pour-on gave good control of buffalo fly for 4 weeks and was better than a deltamethrin product. A <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> spray used at 62. 5 ppm gave 14 days control. In far-north Queensland where resistance to synthetic pyrethroids and heavy rain was common, the maximum period of efficacy of <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> pour-on was reduced to 2 weeks. Conclusion In areas where there is low resistance to synthetic pyrethroids among buffalo flies, <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> pour-on {{can be expected to}} give good control for 4 weeks...|$|E

Beef cattle were treated three times at 3 -week intervals with 1 ml 10 kg(- 1) body {{weight of a}} 25 g litre(- 1) or 50 g litre(- 1) pour-on formulation (2. 5 and 5. 0 mg <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> kg(- 1) body weight) or 100 mg kg(- 1) spray to simulate a likely worst-case treatment regime. Friesian and Jersey dairy cows were treated once with 2. 5 mg <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> kg(- 1) in a pour-on formulation. Muscle, liver and kidney residue concentrations were generally less than the limit of detection (LOD = 0. 01 mg kg(- 1)). Residues in renal-fat and back-fat samples from animals treated with 2. 5 mg kg(- 1) all exceeded the limit of quantitation (LOQ = 0. 05 mg kg(- 1)), peaking at 10 days after treatment. Only two of five kidney fat samples were above the LOQ after 34 days, {{but none of the}} back-fat samples exceeded the LOQ at 28 days after treatment. Following spray treatments, fat residues were detectable in some animals but were below the LOQ at all sampling intervals. <b>Zeta-cypermethrin</b> was quantifiable (LOQ = 0. 01 mg kg(- 1)) in only one whole-milk sample from the Friesian cows (0. 015 mg kg(- 1), 2 days after treatment). In whole milk from Jersey cows, the mean concentration of <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> peaked 1 day after treatment, at 0. 015 mg kg(- 1), and the highest individual sample concentration was 0. 025 mg kg(- 1) at 3 days after treatment. Residues in milk were not quantifiable beginning 4 days after treatment. The mean concentrations of <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> in milk fat from Friesian and Jersey cows peaked two days after treatment at 0. 197 mg kg(- 1) and 0. 377 mg kg(- 1), respectively, and the highest individual sample concentrations were 2 days after treatment at 0. 47 mg kg(- 1) and 0. 98 mg kg(- 1), respectively.

40|$|The use of synergists is {{important}} to minimize the amount of chemical insecticide required for insect control. Their use may contribute to reducing environmental contamination and preserving beneficial insects. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the synergy and uniformity of the response of Spodoptera frugiperda (Noctuidae) larvae to doses of an essential oil of an Amazon chemotype, Piper aduncum (Piperaceae), when combinationed with the following commercial insecticides: cypermethrin, <b>zeta-cypermethrin,</b> permethrin and esfenvarelate, compared to piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Through the relationship between CL 50 and DL 50 of insecticides taken separately and their synergistic combinations with the essential oil and PBO, synergism factors (SF) were obtained for comparison with each other. With residual contact, there was a significant enhancement of commercial insecticides formulated with cypermethrin (SF = 73. 03), <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> (SF = 16. 51) and permethrin (SF = 8. 46 - 17. 22), when combined with the P. aduncum essential oil; in turn, with topical application, there was only an observed significant enhancement for <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> (SF = 0. 40 - 4. 26), permethrin (SF = 2. 10 - 4. 79) and esfenvarelate (SF = 3. 80) insecticides when combined with the essential oil.

40|$|Trials were {{conducted}} in 2011 and 2012 at the Institute of Forage Crops, Pleven, Bulgaria, in order to study the imaginal and possible ovicidal effect of some insecticides against Bruchus pisorum under field conditions. Treatments with insecticides were started after {{the appearance of the}} first pea weevils eggs on pods located on the bottom two nodes. It was found that treatment with acetamiprid; thiacloprid; thiacloprid+deltamethrin; 50 g cypermethrin+ 480 g chlorpyrifosethyl, 50 g cypermethrin+ 500 g chlorpyrifosethyl and <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> resulted in the cessation of additional oviposition on the lower nodes by Bruchus pisorum, due to the toxic effect of the insecticides on the pea weevil. It was found that spraying with acetamiprid and <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> was the most effective. These insecticides significantly reduced the proportion of infected pods in comparison with the proportion of pods with eggs before the treatment by 30. 2 and 27. 4 % and by 15. 8 and 24. 0 % in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The use of acetamiprid and <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> was also associated with the lowest percentage of infected seeds (21. 7 and 23. 6 %, respectively), with the lowest percentage of infected seed in infected pods (40. 5 and 42. 5 %, respectively) and the highest weight of 1000 infected seeds (161. 94 and 182. 04 g, respectively). It was concluded that the management of pea weevils in the crop with acetamiprid and zetacypermethrin can lead to satisfactory results when spray timing is chosen when the first eggs are visible. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The use of synergists is {{important}} in minimizing the amount of chemical insecticide required for insect control. Their use can contribute to reducing environmental contamination and preserving beneficial insects. To further investigate a promising alternative to the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), we compared the synergistic effects of PBO and Piper aduncum L. essential oil (PAEO) when combined with several insecticides (cypermethrin, <b>zeta-cypermethrin,</b> permethrin, and esfenvalerate) on the larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith, 1797). Initially, we determined the lethal doses and concentrations (LD 50 and LC 50) for S. frugiperda larvae subjected to separate treatments with PAEO and with each commercial insecticide. Subsequently, in order to evaluate the synergistic effect, combinations of sublethal doses or sublethal concentrations of the essential oil (½ and ¼ of the LD 50 or LC 50, respectively) were prepared with sublethal doses or sublethal concentrations of the insecticides (below the LD 40 or LC 40). To confirm {{the evidence of the}} synergistic efficacy of the PAEO, the same reduced concentrations and doses of the insecticides that were previously used in combinations with the oil were also combined with PBO at a ratio of 10 : 1 (PBO:Insecticide). Through the relationship between the CL 50 and DL 50 of the insecticides taken separately and in their synergistic combinations with the PAEO and PBO, synergism factors (SF) were calculated for the various combinations. With residual contact, there was a significant enhancement of the commercial insecticides formulated with cypermethrin (SF = 73. 03), <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> (SF = 16. 51), and permethrin (SF = 8. 46 - 17. 22) when combined with the PAEO; by contrast, with topical application there was a significant enhancement only for <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> (SF = 0. 40 - 4. 26), permethrin (SF = 2. 10 - 4. 79), and esfenvalerate (SF = 3. 80) when combined with the essential oil. With the exception of esfenvalerate, the other synergistic combinations showed homogeneous responses for topical application and residual contact for at least one synergistic combination with PAEO. The significance of the SF values from combining PAEO with cypermethrin, <b>zeta-cypermethrin,</b> permethrin, and esfenvalerate insecticides may indicate that this essential oil is an effective alternative to PBO. 201...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{compounds}} representing four major pesticide groups were tested for toxicity to beneficial insects representing four different insect orders: Coleoptera (Coccinellidae), Hemiptera (Anthocoridae), Hymenoptera (Aphelinidae), and Neuroptera (Chrysopidae). These materials included organophosphates (methidathion, esfenvalerate and phosmet), carbamates (carbofuran, methomyl and carbaryl), pyrethroids (bifenthrin, fenpropathrin, <b>zeta-cypermethrin,</b> cyfluthrin and permethrin) and the oxadiazine indoxacarb. Toxicity to coccinellid and lacewing species {{was assessed by}} treating 1 st instar larvae with the recommended field rate of commercial products, and two 10 fold dilutions of these materials, in topical spray applications. Adult Aphytis melinus Debach and 2 nd instar Orius insidiosus (Say) were exposed to leaf residues of the same concentrations for 24 h. ANOVA performed on composite survival indices derived from these data resolved significant differences among materials {{with respect to their}} overall toxicity to beneficial insects. Cyfluthrin, fenpropathrin and <b>zeta-cypermethrin</b> all increased the developmental time of the lacewing and one or more coccinellid species for larvae that survived topical applications. Bifenthrin increased developmental time for two coccinellid species and decreased it in a third. Indoxacarb (Avaunt® WG, DuPont Corp.) ranked highest overall for safety to beneficial insects, largely because of its low dermal toxicity to all species tested. <b>Zeta-cypermethrin</b> (Super Fury®, FMC Corporation) received the second best safety rating, largely because of its low toxicity as a leaf residue to A. melinus and O. insidiosus. Phosmet (Imidan® 70 W, Gowan Co.) and methidathion (Supracide® 25 W, Gowan Co.) ranked high for safety to coccinellid species, but compounds currently recommended for use in citrus such as fenpropathrin (Danitol® 2. 4 EC, Sumimoto Chem. Co.) and carbaryl (Sevin® XLR EC, Rhone Poulenc Ag. Co.) ranked very low for IPM-compatibility based on their relatively high toxicity to all species tested...|$|E

However, information related to termiticide persistence is lacking. In 2 field trials, soil residues analysis were carried out to determine degradation among existing and candidate termiticides in 3 different chemical classes. Plots were established to simulate industry standards {{for the application of}} termiticides. Study 1 termiticides tested were Dragnet FT (permethrin, 0. 5 % and 0. 25 %;), Prevail FT (cypermethrin, 0. 25 %;), Biflex FT (bifenthrin, 0. 06 %;), Fury TC (<b>zeta-cypermethrin,</b> 0. 125 %;) Premise 75 (imidacloprid, 0. 05 %,), Dursban TC (chlorpyrifos, 1 % and 0. 75 %) and the untreated check. In Study 2 termiticides tested were DeltaGard SC (deltamethrin 0. 075 %, 0. 125 % and 0. 25 %); Dragnet FT (permethrin 0. 5 %;) and the untreated checks. In study 1, in general, all termiticides showed more degradation in the exposed plots than those covered by the concrete slab. In the exposed plots, specifically in the 4 th year, four of the eight treatments had no residues In comparison, the covered plots had only 1 treatment, with no residues.

40|$|Abstract Background The U. S. imports a {{substantial}} and increasing {{portion of its}} fruits and vegetables. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration currently inspects {{less than one percent}} of import shipments. While countries exporting to the U. S. are expected to comply with U. S. tolerances, including allowable pesticide residue levels, there is a low rate of import inspections and few other incentives for compliance. Methods This analysis estimates the quantity of excess pesticide residue that could enter the U. S. if exporters followed originating country requirements but not U. S. pesticide tolerances, for the top 20 imported produce items based on quantities imported and U. S. consumption levels. Pesticide health effects data are also shown. Results The model estimates that for the identified items, 120 439 kg of pesticides in excess of U. S. tolerances could potentially be imported to the U. S., in cases where U. S. regulations are more protective than those of originating countries. This figure is in addition to residues allowed on domestic produce. In the modeling, the top produce item, market, and pesticide of concern were oranges, Chile, and <b>Zeta-Cypermethrin.</b> Pesticides in this review are associated with health effects on 13 body systems, and some are associated with carcinogenic effects. Conclusions There is a critical information gap regarding pesticide residues on produce imported to the U. S. Without a more thorough sampling program, it is not possible accurately to characterize risks introduced by produce importation. The scenario presented herein relies on assumptions, and should be considered illustrative. The analysis highlights the need for additional investigation and resources for monitoring, enforcement, and other interventions, to improve import food safety and reduce pesticide exposures in originating countries. </p...|$|E
