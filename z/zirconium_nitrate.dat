Regardless of the structural differences in the starting salts, thermal decomposition products crystallized to t-ZrO 2 which remained stable up to 1200 degrees C. This result indicated that the structural nature of the starting materials was not the most important factor of metastable t-ZrO 2 formation. The thermodynamically stable m-ZrO 2 appeared after the cooling of the samples to room temperature. If the cooling was performed at low air pressure, the m-ZrO 2 content was small.

The final titania/zirconia and metal oxide/nitrate mole ratios were 16. 0 and 10. 0, respectively. The results of SANS contrast variation experiments are described. The minimum-contrast points for the homogeneous and heterogeneous colloids, determined using either the known analytic form of the scattering at q = 0 or the scattering invariant, gave similar results, which differed significantly from the expected value.

In both cases, the scattering at minimum contrast was consistent with a fractal network of uni-dimensional zirconia, with a typical diameter of ∼ 1. 5 nm.

In the following step, hafnium or zirconium tetrachloride was refluxed over dinitrogen pentoxide at 30 to 35 oC for half-hour. The product was purified by sublimation. High yield, above 95 %, was obtained. The cost for the hafnium nitrate precursor synthesis was estimated.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) has {{recently}} {{become the focus}} of global attention because of the position of CO 2 as the primary greenhouse gas and the implication of its emissions on the problem of climate change. Fossil fuels emit CO 2 in vast quantities and efforts are required to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas to prevent catastrophic climate change. Utilisation of renewable, non-toxic and inexpensive raw material such as CO 2 to synthesise valuable chemicals, e. g. organic carbonates is a prerequisite for sustainable environment and greener chemical process. Organic carbonates, such as propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), 1, 2 -butylene carbonate (BC) have widely been used as intermediates in the synthesis of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuel additives. The conventional method of PC synthesis employs homogeneous catalysts and toxic raw materials including phosgene and iso-cyanates. Hence, {{there is a need for}} an environmentally benign greener process for the synthesis of PC from CO 2. DMC has excellent chemical properties, which make it a very good precursor material for the production of polycarbonates and a potential gasoline additive due to its high oxygen content. DMC can be synthesised at industrial scale via methanolysis of phosgene and oxidative carbonylation of methanol (MeOH). However, both routes have their shortcomings; the methanolysis route uses phosgene, which is a very toxic chemical and produces hydrochloric acid as a by-product and the oxidative carbonylation route uses hazardous carbon monoxide. Therefore, considerable efforts have gone into the development of an environmentally benign process for the production of DMC. Direct synthesis of DMC from MeOH and CO 2 using heterogeneous catalyst is the most attractive route due to the inexpensive raw materials and the avoidance of corrosive reagents. Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) has been employed as a rapid and cleaner route for the synthesis of highly efficient and novel graphene based inorganic heterogeneous catalyst, e. g. Ce–Zr oxide/graphene and Ce–Zr–La oxide/graphene nanocomposites. Ce–Zr–La oxide/graphene nanocomposite was synthesized from pre-mixed aqueous solution of cerium, lanthanum, <b>zirconium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and graphene oxide (synthesized via conventional Hummers method) under alkaline conditions using the CHFS reactor. The resulting nanocomposite catalyst was heat-treated at various temperatures (e. g. 773, 973 and 1173 K) and their catalytic properties were assessed. The as-prepared and the corresponding heat treated catalysts have been extensively characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The presentation will discuss detailed synthesis and application of graphene based nanocomposite materials as heterogeneous catalysts for organic carbonates syntheses. The experimental findings indicate that graphene based nanocomposite materials have a huge potential as heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of organic carbonates...|$|E
