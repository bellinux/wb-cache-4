25|$|In November 2006, free service {{ended on}} the line's Sandoval section, and {{ridership}} fell to 1,000 passengers per day. When the Los Lunas and Belen stations opened with free service, ridership rose to around 1,800 passengers per day. Free {{service on the}} Belen section of the line ended April 1, 2007, and a new <b>zone</b> <b>fare</b> structure went into effect. During the summer of 2007, ridership averaged 2,500 passengers per day. By April 2008, weekly ridership was 9,600. On June 26, 2008, the Rail Runner passed 1,000,000 passengers.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Metro Council {{insisted that}} the <b>zone</b> <b>fare</b> system be removed to allow {{residents}} of the suburbs to travel anywhere with a single fare. Prior to this, stations west of [...] and east of [...] were geographically part of the zone 2 fare zone, but the subway used a flat fare system, so they were treated as being part of zone 1. This created problems when transferring from the subway to the buses, which were in different zones at the same location. The solution was a change in political thinking, where the subway {{was seen as a}} subsidized public service, instead of a utility which needed to balance its books.|$|E
2500|$|Seabus is a [...] "Fare Paid Zone" [...] {{similar to}} SkyTrain and buses, meaning {{passengers}} {{are required to}} possess a valid fare (transfer/transit pass) in the Fare Paid <b>Zone.</b> <b>Fare</b> inspections are done by Transit Security Officers and on occasion {{by members of the}} South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service. Seabus attendants may check fares, but do not conduct enforcement. Seabus attendants can call Transit Security to deal with non-compliant passengers. Failure to pay the correct fare or retain a valid fare may result in being removed from the terminal and/or fined $173. Traditionally, like all public transit in Vancouver, the SeaBus offers free rides on New Year's Eve to discourage drinking and driving.|$|E

50|$|Rail service fares in Greater London and the {{surrounding}} area are calculated in accordance with the London <b>fare</b> <b>zones</b> system managed by Transport for London. Within London, all London Underground, National Rail, London Overground, TfL Rail and Docklands Light Railway stations are assigned to nine <b>fare</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>Fare</b> <b>zone</b> 1 covers the central area and <b>fare</b> <b>zones</b> 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 form concentric rings around it. Some National Rail stations and all Transport for London served stations outside Greater London in the counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey are either included in <b>fare</b> <b>zones</b> 4,5 or 6 or in extended zones beyond these. Transport for London <b>fare</b> <b>zones</b> are also known simply as zones or travelcard zones, referring to their use in calculating prices for the travelcard product. Before flat fares were introduced in 2004, <b>fare</b> <b>zones</b> were used on the London Buses network. London <b>fare</b> <b>zones</b> are also used for calculating the cost of single and return paper tickets, Oyster card pay-as-you-go fares and season tickets.|$|R

5000|$|YRT {{also offers}} the [...] "GTA Weekly Pass", which {{acts as a}} pass for the TTC, YRT, MiWay, and Brampton Transit; the pass is good for single-zone travel in York Region. Passengers wishing to cross zone {{boundaries}} must pay any <b>zone</b> <b>fare</b> supplements in cash.|$|E
5000|$|Until fare gate {{installation}} {{is complete}} in 2014, Canada Line operates on a [...] "Fare Paid Zone" [...] system. This means that passengers {{are required by}} law to possess a valid fare when they enter the Fare Paid <b>Zone.</b> <b>Fare</b> Paid Zones are clearly marked, and fares can be bought from ticket vending machines prior to entering the Fare Paid <b>Zone.</b> <b>Fare</b> inspections are mostly conducted by the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service. Passengers who fail to pay the fare or do not have a valid fare may be fined $173 and/or removed from the station or train. Transit Security officers occasionally inspect fares at Canada Line Stations as part of TransLink's fare audit. Transit Security officers mostly focus their efforts on the bus system, bus loops, and SeaBus.|$|E

50|$|Switzerland {{operates}} a similar system to Germany. Long-distance trains have a ticket inspector on board who checks all tickets, but ticket-selling on board had withdrawn from 11 December 2011. Local trains within a Tarifverbunde (local <b>zone</b> <b>fare</b> systems) use penalty fares with random checks. For example, in North-West Switzerland the penalty fare is CHF 100, but the monthly season costs CHF 75. Even with relatively infrequent ticket checks {{there is a}} financial incentive to remain legal.|$|E
5000|$|October 31, 2010: NFTA-Metro embarks on a {{sweeping}} change to its service network, following a multi-year study by TMI, Inc.

Passengers experienced these changes {{during a time when}} it normally is not adjusted, due to the scope of the changes made.|$|E

A single-zone ticket costs NOK 33 if bought in advance, and NOK 50 if bought on a bus or tram. Day passes cost NOK 90 while a month pass costs NOK 708. Children and seniors pay half price. Prices increase if multiple zones are traveled. The Flexus ticket system is in 2011 almost completely introduced.|$|E

50|$|Effective July 1, 2009, MTS {{eliminated}} the downtown <b>zone</b> <b>fare</b> category for the San Diego Trolley. As a result, the regular passenger fare for all one-way trips on the trolley became $2.50 regardless of origin or destination point; seniors, people with disabilities, and Medicare cardholders pay just $1.25 each. MTS also increased the passenger fare for shuttle bus routes to $2.25 ($1.10 senior/disabled/Medicare). All other single-ride cash fares remain unchanged. The {{cost of an}} ordinary 1-day pass also remained at $5, {{but the cost of}} a 1-day RegionPlus pass increased from $11 to $14. MTS also increased the prices of all monthly passes (e.g. from $68 to $72 for a regular 30-day adult pass) and began selling 14-day passes, which replace the half-month passes.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} full tap-in/tap-out design, a multi-zone bus trip could be completed {{for a single}} <b>zone</b> <b>fare</b> by tapping out within the first zone of travel but remaining on the bus. This fault was not publicly acknowledged by the administration until system testing in September 2013. Regardless of the loophole, Transit police or designated transit security fare enforcement officers may issue a fine if they catch riders without adequate fare in a Fare Paid Zone. Furthermore, the tapping out process on buses {{was reported to be}} slow, and failure to record a passenger's tapping out may have resulted in the passenger being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they only travelled through one or two zones.|$|E
