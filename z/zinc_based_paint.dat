30|$|The basic mixing {{scheme that}} we used was to have {{mixtures}} with <b>zinc</b> white <b>base</b> <b>paint</b> in 90 : 10 and 50 : 50 ratios, and with bone black paint in 99 : 1 and 90 : 10 ratios. However, depending on the pigment in some cases other ratios {{were found to be}} more suitable. For example, for deeply colored paints the amount of black pigment needed to be reduced to prevent mixtures to become completely black, which would eliminate any added value to the determination of optical parameters. For the intense colored Prussian blue, which is very dark blue—almost black—in oil paint, we found that mixing with black was not meaningful at all. On the other hand, for all white pigments and fillers in this study, a different scheme of mixtures had to be used. These were mixed in 90 : 10 ratios with cochineal, viridian and cobalt blue paints, and with bone black in several ratios (Fig.  3 b). All mixtures were applied on a standardized black–white chart from BYK-Gardner, using a block operator to create a relatively uniform layer of 100  µm thickness. We let the paints dry in air. Finally, we measured the reflectance spectrum for each mixture on both black and white substrate using a Konica-Minolta 2600 D diffuse sphere (d/ 8) spectrophotometer. We used this instrument in Specular Component Included mode, to ensure good alignment with other d/ 8 spectrophotometers. To avoid problems with fluorescence, illumination was cut off below 400  nm.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePaints {{based on}} white {{pigments}} {{are the basic}} materials found in ground layers of ready-made canvases {{as well as in}} painting layers mixed with other colours. It is surprising that Vincent Van Gogh, whose unique style is world famous, resorted to not one but two types of white paints. Indeed, Van Gogh often used both lead white and zinc white in the very same painting, contrasting then with the majority of his contemporaries who have only used the traditional lead white. To trace the evolution of his painting technique and to respond to the issues of authentication, dating and preservation raised by his artwork, it is essential to have a good knowledge of the painting materials he used and how he used them. This paper describes the reconstructions of 19 th century white paint formulations and their rheological characterization in order to compare their flow properties: by adjusting them, different paint finishes from smooth surfaces to high impastos can be produced. We define a general procedure for paint rheology characterization, useful for old recipes reconstructions in the field of conservation science. Both lead white and <b>zinc</b> white <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> exhibit a similar rheological behaviour, with a fluid to solid transition, and variations of their properties such as yield stress and elastic moduli, depending on their formulation (oil nature, content, and treatment). An explanation on the specific use of zinc white can be proposed as it allows higher impastos than a lead white paint containing the same oil content...|$|R
40|$|Water <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> contain organic {{solvents}} {{and many}} additives, such as biocides, surfactants, pigments, binders, amines, and monomers. The chemical complexity may introduce new potential health hazards to house painters, in particular irritative and allergic disorders. This study {{was performed to}} compare how house painters experience work with water <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> or solvent <b>based</b> <b>paints,</b> and to evaluate whether exposure to water <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> increases mucous membrane and dermal symptoms among house painters. 255 male house painters aged 20 to 65 {{were invited to participate}} in the study. Controls were two industrial populations, in total 302 men, without exposure to water <b>based</b> <b>paints.</b> Self administered questionnaires were used to assess the painter's experiences of working with different types of paints and the occurrence of symptoms in the exposed and unexposed groups. Hygiene measurements were performed during normal working days when only water <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> and no solvent <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> were used. The painters were exposed to low concentrations of dust, metals, ammonia, formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds. The work environment was considered better when working with water <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> than with solvent <b>based</b> <b>paints.</b> There were more complaints of frequent urination when working with water <b>based</b> <b>paint.</b> Taste or olfactory disturbances were less common. General as well as work related eye and skin irritation was more common among the exposed workers. For other symptoms no significant differences were found. The study indicates that the introduction of water <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> has improved the work environment for house painters. Water <b>based</b> <b>paints</b> cause less discomfort and airway irritation than the earlier solvent <b>based</b> <b>paints.</b> Adverse general health effects seem low.
