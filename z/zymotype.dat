40|$|The {{relationship}} between capsular polysaccharide types 5 and 8 and esterase electrophoretic types (zymotypes) in 160 French clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus was studied. Methicillin-susceptible strains of capsular types 5 and 8 were represented by 11 zymotypes, indicating a high polymorphism. Methicillin-resistant strains were mainly distributed {{in only two}} distinct populations. The predominant population was represented by strains of <b>zymotype</b> 6 and capsular type 5, and the second population was represented by strains of <b>zymotype</b> 14 and capsular type 8...|$|E
40|$|A new {{epidemiologic}} typing method {{based on}} electrophoresis of esterases {{had been developed}} for differentiating between clinical isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis. Twenty-two epidemiologically significant strains obtained from three Chest Units, a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit and a Paediatric Unit were compared with 54 randomly selected strains and 4 reference strains, including the species type strain, ATCC 25238. Thirty-four distinct zymotypes were characterized by polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis of the 80 strains. One infrequent <b>zymotype</b> was found in 2 neonates and another in 2 adults with nosocomial bronchopulmonary infections, suggesting the nosocomial spread of 2 outbreak strains of B. catarrhalis. A more frequent <b>zymotype</b> was isolated from 3 neonates with nosocomial bronchopulmonary infection and from 2 children with nosocomial rhinopharyngitis. The remaining 12 epidemiologically significant strains were of varied zymotypes. This work demonstrates that esterase electrophoresis is a suitable, readily reproducible, stable typing system applicable to {{the wide range of}} strains found in B. catarrhalis nosocomial infections...|$|E

The F hybrids were intermediate to the parental lines for the morphological spikelet characters. The high esterase <b>zymotype</b> affinity made difficult the diagnostic of the hybrid condition. The hybrids presented more meiotic irregularities than the parental lines,. However, predominant bivalent formation {{should result in}} the recombination of characters of the two species. 199...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant {{strains of}} Staphylococcus aureus from diverse {{geographic}} origins were analysed by polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis for esterase polymorphism. Three kinds of esterase bands, designated A, B and C, were defined by their ranges of activity toward five synthetic substrates and their resistance to di-isopropyl fluorophosphate. There were five allozymes of esterase A, four of esterase B {{and four of}} esterase C. Eighteen distinct combinations of allozymes (<b>zymotypes)</b> were distinguished amongst 105 strains analysed. Two major <b>zymotypes</b> were represented by 35 and 19 strains respectively, whereas other <b>zymotypes</b> were represented by one or, at most, seven strains. The coefficient of genetic diversity was lower for methicillin-resistant strains than for methicillin-sensitive strains. Most of the methicillin-resistant strains are represented by the two major <b>zymotypes</b> which differed from each other by the electrophoretic behaviour of the three esterases. These results indicate that, {{on the basis of}} esterase electrophoretic polymorphism, methicillin resistance is expressed in genetically different strains...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 32 strains of Salmonella Dublin {{recovered}} from cattle were differentiated by electrophoretic typing of their esterases (<b>zymotyping),</b> {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} of ribosomal DNA (ribotyping), arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) using five primers, PCR based on repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences (REP-PCR) and PCR based on enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences (ERIC-PCR). ERIC-PCR and REP-PCR each gave one type, <b>zymotyping</b> gave three, AP-PCR gave five and ribotyping gave seven types. Combination of ribotyping and AP-PCR produced {{a total of}} 11 types, whereas 14 different types were obtained by all five methods. Thus a combination of several methods enhanced the discrimination of cattle-adapted strains among the genotypically homogeneous serovar Salmonella Dublin...|$|R
40|$|Esterases of 53 {{strains of}} Yersinia enterocolitica sensu stricto, {{including}} five previously defined biotypes, and 30 strains of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were analysed by horizontal poly-acrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis and by isoelectrofocusing in thin-layer polyacrylamide gel. Esterase bands were defined by their range of activity towards several synthetic substrates, their {{resistance to heat}} and to di-isopropyl fluorophosphate. The two species were characterized by distinct electrophoretic patterns of their esterases. The apparent molecular weights of the heat-resistant esterase of Y. enterocolitica and of the major heat-resistant esterase of Y. pseudotuberculosis, as determined by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, were estimated to be 52000 and 250000, respectively. On the basis of electrophoretic mobilities and isoelectric points of esterases produced by strains of Y. enterocolitica, five principal <b>zymotypes</b> were observed: two for strains of biotype 1, two for strains of biotypes 2 and 3, respectively, and only one for strains of both biotypes 4 and 5. The <b>zymotypes</b> of strains of biotypes 2, 3, 4 and 5 appeared to be {{more closely related to}} one another than to <b>zymotypes</b> of strains of biotype 1. Variations in number or mobility of bands observed within each biotype of Y. enterocolitica and within some serotypes of Y. pseudotuberculosis could represent an additional marker for epidemiological analysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{epidemiology}} {{analysis of}} a series of 12 Aeromonas hydrophila infections, including six of septicaemia, which occurred on several wards of one hospital during the summer of 1982 is presented. The hypothesis that the hospital water could be the source of these infections was supported by the isolation of 1 - 10 motile aeromonads per ml in most of the water samples collected from various points on the hospital water system. Electrophoretic esterase typing was used as an epidemiological screening method to determine the relationship between bacterial strains isolated from the patients and those from water samples. The epidemiology of A. hydrophila infection in the hospital was found to be complex. Amongst the 15 strains of A. hydrophila isolated from patients were 8 zymotypes, while amongst the 126 strains from the water samples there were 37. In some cases, several zymotypes were isolated simultaneously from the same tap water. On one ward, the same <b>zymotype</b> was found in 2 patients and in 2 water samples. The prophylactic measures taken in 1982 - 5 to avoid oral contamination of immuno-compromised patients with infected hospital water have significantly reduced the number of cases of septicaemia. This success has constituted additional retrospective evidence for the water-borne origin of these infections...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-nine Staphylococcus aureus {{isolates}} {{from two}} epidemiologically unrelated sources were typed by {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} after SmaI digestion of chromosomal DNA (genome typing), {{and the results were}} compared with those obtained by other typing methods: phage typing with the international set of phages, capsular serotyping with monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharides type 5 and 8, and <b>zymotyping</b> by polyacrylamide agarose electrophoresis for esterase polymorphism. A good correlation of S. aureus types was found by these four typing methods. Differentiation increased in the order capsular typing < <b>zymotyping</b> < phage typing < genome typing, yielding 2, 10, 20, and 26 different S. aureus types, respectively. Five of the 26 genome types were further divided into several subtypes revealing clonal relationships. When 36 French S. aureus isolates were compared with 33 German S. aureus isolates, 3 strains representing clonal populations were identical in both groups. S. aureus isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis were also typed at {{the beginning and the end}} of a 4 -week summer camp for these patients. The results suggested a possible strain transmission during the summer camp. We conclude that genome typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is a powerful tool not only for strain identification but also for the resolution of the clonal relationships of S. aureus strains...|$|R
40|$|Sixty-nine Staphylococcus aureus strains, 39 {{of which}} {{produced}} staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB+) and 14 {{of which were}} associated with toxic shock (TS+), were studied using the following markers: serotyping, phage typing, antibiotyping, ribotyping, <b>zymotyping</b> and pulsed-field electrophoresis typing. Analysis of {{the results showed that}} the enterotoxin B producing strains were derived from at least three clones: the first two consisted of methicillin-susceptible strains, while the third included the methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains. TS+ strains of nongenital origin appeared to be distributed between the three clones, with no specific characters...|$|R
40|$|Esterase electrophoretic typing and {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism of ribosomal DNA regions (ribotyping) {{were used to}} differentiate 102 Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates obtained from chronic lung infection in 23 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and two reference strains (including the type strain ATCC 10145). Twenty-five <b>zymotypes</b> were obtained with the former method and 16 ribotypes with the latter. Combination of the two typing systems led to the finding of 30 different types. Our data highlights the physiopathological complexity of P. aeruginosa infection in CF as, in six individual cases, several types were found among isolates from a given patient. On the other hand, two unique types were found in two and three patients respectively, raising the possibility of cross-infections...|$|R
40|$|Fifty {{nosocomial}} isolates of Serratia marcescens, {{collected in}} six Belgian hospitals between 1986 and 1990, {{were characterized by}} using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with XbaI. The results were compared with those previously obtained by three other methods: biotyping, esterase electrophoresis typing and ribotyping with EcoRI and HindIII. Macrorestriction analysis (42 PFGE groups) and esterase typing (42 <b>zymotypes)</b> {{proved to be the}} most discriminating, followed by ribotyping (28 ribotypes) and biotyping (10 biochemical profiles). Biotyping would serve as a screen to identify isolates, due to its accessibility. Esterase typing provided a reliable tool to make subdivisions within biotypes because of congruence between biochemical groups and esterase patterns. Additional discrimination was still achieved by ribotyping and PFGE. It is concluded that the combined results of these four markers were useful for distinguishing all epidemic and sporadic isolates.

40|$|Morphological {{characterisation}} of 2, 298 accessions {{collected in}} Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu {{was conducted with}} 23 standardised descriptors and data bases were developed. More than 2, 000 cultivars were electrophoresed on starch gels and six enzyme systems were revealed successfully (MDH, PGI, ICD, PGD, ME, SKDH). Each country selected a core sample for sharing composed of elite cultivars representing approximately 10 % {{of the total number}} of accessions. Ploidy levels were determined using flow cytometry. AFLP fingerprinting was conducted on all cultivars included in the core sample. Meristems were excised and these genotypes were tissue cultured, indexed for DMV and distributed to participating countries. In Vanuatu, 378 cultivars were grown in a common plot, planted and harvested the same day, and their corms were boiled and submitted to a blind panel test composed of ten participants. Their eating quality was scored on a scale from 1 to 6 (excellent). The physico-chemical characteristics of 31 cultivars, representing different morphotypes and including excellent and poor cultivars, were analysed to assess the extent of variation existing for traits related to corm quality (dry matter content, minerals, lipids, proteins, gelatinisation temperature, amylose, glucose, fructose, saccharose, maltose and starch content). The results of these studies indicate that the genetic base of the cultivars is narrow. Only six <b>zymotypes</b> represent more than 51 % {{of the total number of}} accessions electrophoresed and only 21 <b>zymotypes</b> represent more than the two thirds (70 %) of the total number of accessions. AFLP analysis confirm the isozymes results and two distinct genepools are revealed, one in S. E. Asia and the other in the Pacific. It implies that crosses between accessions originating from only one country are not desirable and it is appropriate to cross cultivars from both genepools. Except for the temperature of gelatinisation, all physicochemical characteristics are variable. Good taste is correlated with high dry matter, starch and amylose contents...|$|R
40|$|Isozyme {{variation}} was {{studied in}} 87 plants from 32 cultivated and wild accessions of banana passion fruit (P. tripartita var. mollissima, P. tripartita var. tripartita, P. tarminiana, and P. mixta), rosy passion fruit (P. cumbalensis), tin-tin (P. pinnatistipula), gulián (P. ampullacea), P. antioquensis, P. bracteosa, and P. manicata, from the Andes of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. Six polymorphic enzyme systems (IDH, PGDH, PGM, DIA, PRX, and ACP) revealed 31 <b>zymotypes</b> {{characterized by the}} presence or absence of 31 electromorphs. Cluster analysis separated clearly the accessions of P. tarminiana, P. tripartita, P. mixta, and P. cumbalensis from the less typical species of subgenus Tacsonia, which is consistent with morphological evidence. P. mixta showed the highest intraspecific variation and the closest affinity with P. tripartita. The accessions of these two species formed two clusters, one dominated by Colombian genotypes and the other dominated by Ecuadorian genotypes. One of the P. tripartita var. mollissima accessions clustered close to P. tarminiana accessions. The affinity between these three species is particularly interesting for conservation and use of banana passion fruit genetic resources. All the other species formed monospecific clusters.
