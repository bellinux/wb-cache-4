40|$|Background {{potassium}} channels {{control the}} resting membrane potential of neurones and regulate their excitability. Two-pore-domain potassium (2 -PK) channels {{have been shown}} to underlie a number of such neuronal background currents. Currents through human TASK- 1, TASK- 2 and TASK- 3 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes were inhibited by extracellular acidification. For TASK- 3, mutation of histidine 98 to aspartate or alanine considerably reduced this effect of pH. Zinc was found to be a selective blocker of TASK- 3 with virtually no effect on TASK- 1 or TASK- 2. Zinc had an IC 50 of 19. 8 μm for TASK- 3, at + 80 mV, with little voltage dependence associated with this inhibition. TASK- 3 H 98 A had a much reduced sensitivity to zinc suggesting this site is important for <b>zinc</b> <b>block.</b> Surprisingly, TASK- 1 also has histidine in position 98 but is insensitive to <b>zinc</b> <b>block.</b> TASK- 3 and TASK- 1 differ at position 70 with glutamate for TASK- 3 and lysine for TASK- 1. TASK- 3 E 70 K also had a much reduced sensitivity to zinc while the corresponding reverse mutation in TASK- 1, K 70 E, induced zinc sensitivity. A TASK- 3 –TASK- 1 concatamer channel was comparatively zinc insensitive. For TASK- 3, it is concluded that positions E 70 and H 98 are both critical for <b>zinc</b> <b>block.</b> The native cerebellar granule neurone (CGN) leak current, IKSO, is sensitive to block by zinc, with current reduced to 0. 58 of control values in the presence of 100 μm zinc. This suggests that TASK- 3 channels underlie a major component of IKSO. It has recently been suggested that zinc is released from inhibitory synapses onto CGNs. Therefore it is possible that inhibition of IKSO in cerebellar granule cells by synaptically released zinc may have important physiological consequences...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince phospholipases {{exist within}} a {{membrane}} lipid environment, {{it is not}} unreasonable to assume that cholesterol capable of changing the lipid environment can effect the coupling relationship among the signal transducing components. Our previous study showed that the ‘molecular switch’ through which membrane cholesterol modulates cyclic nucleotide levels and Na+/H+ exchange within human platelets is phospholipase A 2. We demonstrate here that membrane cholesterol initiates the activation of phosphatidyl choline phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid thus generated promotes the activation of its phospholipase A 2 in the presence of extraplatelet calcium. More important, inhibition of phospholipase D by <b>zinc</b> <b>blocks</b> the activation of phosphatidic acid phospholipase A 2 in platelets upon cholesterol incorporation.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that central administration of zinc in minute amounts induces a significant antidipsogenic action in dehydrated rats {{as well as in}} rats under central cholinergic and angiotensinergic stimulation. Here we show that acute third ventricle injections of <b>zinc</b> also <b>block</b> water intake induced by central ß-adrenergic stimulation in Wistar rats (190 - 250 g). Central inhibition of opioid pathways by naloxone reverses the zinc-induced antidipsogenic effect in dehydrated rats. After 120 min, rats receiving third ventricle injections of isoproterenol (160 nmol/rat) exhibited a significant increase in water intake (5. 78 ± 0. 54 ml/ 100 g body weight) compared to saline-treated controls (0. 15 ± 0. 07 ml/ 100 g body weight). Pretreatment with zinc (3. 0, 30. 0 and 300. 0 pmol/rat, 45 min before isoproterenol injection) blocked water intake in a dose-dependent way. At the highest dose employed a complete blockade was demonstrable (0. 54 ± 0. 2 ml/ 100 g body weight). After 120 min, control (NaAc-treated) dehydrated rats, as expected, exhibited a high water intake (7. 36 ± 0. 39 ml/ 100 g body weight). Central administration of <b>zinc</b> <b>blocked</b> this response (2. 5 ± 0. 77 ml/ 100 g body weight). Naloxone pretreatment (82. 5 nmol/rat, 30 min before zinc administration) reverted the water intake to the high levels observed in zinc-free dehydrated animals (7. 04 ± 0. 56 ml/ 100 g body weight). These data indicate that zinc is able to block water intake induced by central ß-adrenergic stimulation and that zinc-induced blockade of water intake in dehydrated rats may be, at least in part, due to stimulation of central opioid peptides...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} cell death caused by {{influenza}} virus infection in cultured MDCK and HeLa cells was analysed. This infection {{gave rise to}} nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation accompanied by chromosomal DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomes. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation progressed concomitantly with cell lysis of MDCK cells and HeLa cells, producing high and low yields of virus particles, respectively, indicating that the extent of cell lysis was not proportional to the virus production. The endonuclease inhibitor <b>zinc</b> <b>blocked</b> DNA fragmentation in MDCK cells. Cycloheximide inhibited DNA fragmentation as well as cell lysis. Inhibition occurred when the drug {{was added to the}} medium within 2 h after infection but not efficiently at 4 h or later. Infection induced the Fas Ag gene, which encodes a possible apoptosis-mediating molecule, in the early infectious stage followed by the expression of Fas Ag on the cell surface.

40|$|The swelling-activated {{chloride}} current, {{commonly referred}} to as ICl,swell, is an outwardly-rectifying anion current that {{plays an important role in}} cell volume regulation, among other capacities. Despite several decades of research, the molecular identity of the channel responsible for this chloride current remains controversial. Recent indications that key endogenous sulfhydryl groups are capable of modifying the current led us to assess the effects of several divalent cations, including zinc, on ICl,swell. Zinc is known to tightly associate with sulfhydryl groups such as in zinc finger proteins. We found that extracellular zinc irreversibly inhibited ICl,swell at a site downstream in the signaling cascade. Moreover, <b>zinc</b> <b>blocking</b> kinetics were voltage dependent, suggesting interaction with a site within the electric field, across the pore of the channel responsible for ICl,swell. The importance of sulfhydryl groups was confirmed by demonstrating irreversible block by N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl alkylating reagent. In contrast, nickel failed to block ICl,swell, and as noted in previous studies, cadmium preferentially blocked the time-dependent component of ICl,swell. These data confirm the importance of sulfhydryl groups in the function of ICl,swell. Moreover, by demonstrating the voltage-dependence of block, the data strongly suggest the critical sulfhydryl group is within the channel pore. These biophysical characteristics of native ICl,swell are markers that should be recapitulated in expressed proteins claimed to be responsible for ICl,swell...|$|R

The specific excitatory signaling is based upon glutamatergic signaling, and {{is dependent on the}} nature of the sensory information being processed. Recurrent oscillations in thalamocortical circuits also provide large-scale regulatory feedback inputs to the thalamus via GABAergic neurons that synapse in the TRN.In a study done by Gibbs, Zhang, Shumate, and Coulter (1998) it was found that endogenously released <b>zinc</b> <b>blocked</b> GABA responses within the TC system specifically by interrupting communication between the thalamus and the connected TRN. [...] Computational neuroscientists are particularly interested in thalamocortical loops because they represent a structure that is disproportionally larger and more complex in humans than other mammals (when body size is taken into account), which may contribute to humans' special cognitive abilities. Evidence from one study (Arcelli et al. 1996) offers partial support to this claim by suggesting that thalamic GABAergic local circuit neurons in mammalian brains relate more to processing ability compared to sensorimotor ability, as they reflect an increasing complexity of local information processing in the thalamus.

40|$|Abstract Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) {{triggers}} a large release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from host intestinal cells and the extracellular ATP is broken down to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), AMP, and adenosine. Adenosine {{is a potent}} secretagogue in the small and large intestine. We suspected that ecto- 5 ′-nucleotidase (CD 73, an intestinal enzyme) was a critical enzyme involved in the conversion of AMP to adenosine and in the pathogenesis of EPEC diarrhea. We developed a nonradioactive method for measuring ecto- 5 ′-nucleotidase in cultured T 84 cell monolayers based on the detection of phosphate release from 5 ′-AMP. EPEC infection triggered a release of ecto- 5 ′-nucleotidase from the cell surface into the supernatant medium. EPEC-induced 5 ′-nucleotidase release was not correlated with host cell death but instead with activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Ecto- 5 ′-nucleotidase was susceptible to inhibition by zinc acetate and by α,β-methylene-adenosine diphosphate (α,β-methylene-ADP). In the Ussing chamber, these inhibitors could reverse the chloride secretory responses triggered by 5 ′-AMP. In addition, α,β-methylene-ADP and <b>zinc</b> <b>blocked</b> the ability of 5 ′-AMP to stimulate EPEC growth under nutrient-limited conditions in vitro. Ecto- 5 ′nucleotidase {{appears to be the}} major enzyme responsible for generation of adenosine from adenine nucleotides in the T 84 cell line, and inhibitors of ecto- 5 ′-nucleotidase, such as α,β-methylene-ADP and zinc, might be useful for treatment of the watery diarrhea produced by EPEC infection...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Sections of human and rat bladders were cut from paraffin blocks and stained by immunohistochemistry {{for the expression of}} T 1 R 2 / 3 sweet taste receptors. Bladder homogenates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting for T 1 R 2 / 3 receptor expression. Rat bladder strips with and without urothelium were suspended in organ baths. The contractile response to 10 Hz electrical field stimulation was determined in the absence and presence of saccharin (Sigma-Aldrich®) (10 − 8 to 10 − 3 M). Responses to KCl in the absence and presence of saccharin, and saccharin plus zinc were also determined. Results: T 1 R 2 / 3 sweet taste receptors were expressed in human and rat bladder urothelium. Immunostaining was evident in the plasma membrane of the 3 urothelial cell types, particularly umbrella cells. Immunoblotting revealed bands at expected molecular weights in human and rat bladder homogenates.

Aspirin and its major metabolite sodium salicylate induced apoptosis and decreased colon cancer cell growth and the sodium salt of aspirin also inhibited tumor growth in an athymic nude mouse xenograft model. Colon cancer cell growth inhibition was accompanied by downregulation of Sp 1, Sp 3 and Sp 4 proteins and decreased expression of Sp-regulated gene products including bcl- 2, survivin, VEGF, VEGFR 1, cyclin D 1, c-MET and p 65 (NFkB). Moreover, we also showed by RNA interference that b-catenin, an important target of aspirin in some studies, is an Sp-regulated gene. Aspirin induced nuclear caspase-dependent cleavage of Sp 1, Sp 3 and Sp 4 proteins and this response was related to sequestration of zinc ions since addition of <b>zinc</b> sulfate <b>blocked</b> aspirin-mediated apoptosis and repression of Sp proteins.

After chronic ethanol feeding, LPS-stimulated expression of IFN-β and CXCL 10 mRNA was increased in primary cultures of Kupffer cells compared with pair-fed control mice. Treatment of Kupffer cells with globular adiponectin (gAcrp) normalized this response. LPS-stimulated IFN-β/CXCL 10 mRNA and CXCL 10 protein was also reduced in RAW 264. 7 macrophages treated with gAcrp or full-length adiponectin. gAcrp and full-length adiponectin acted via adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, respectively. gAcrp decreased TLR 4 expression in both Kupffer cells and RAW 264. 7 macrophages.

We expressed recombinant Ca 2 + channel isoforms in Xenopus oocytes and attempted to record zinc currents from them using a two-electrode voltage clamp method. We found that, in an extracellular zinc solution, inward currents arising from zinc permeation could be recorded from Xenopus oocytes expressing L-type Cav 1. 2 or Cav 1. 3 isoforms, but not from oocytes expressing Cav 2. 2, Cav 2. 3, Cav 3. 1, or Cav 3. 2. Zinc currents through Cav 1. 2 and Cav 1. 3 were blocked by nimodipine, but enhanced by (±) Bay K 8644, supporting the finding that zinc can permeate both L-type Cav 1. 2 and Cav 1. 3 channel isoforms. We also examined the blocking effects of low concentrations of zinc on Ca 2 + currents through the L-type channel isoforms.

In control, only currents evoked by low concentrations of GABA were significantly reduced in amplitude by furosemide, the alpha 6 subunit-containing receptor antagonist. However, {{in the presence of}} competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonists, the furosemide block of currents evoked by higher GABA concentrations was markedly increased. <b>Zinc,</b> which preferentially <b>blocks</b> alpha 6 subunit-containing receptors, also produced an increased block in the presence of bicuculline. To investigate whether similar effects occurred at synaptic receptors, inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded. In most cells, furosemide produced little or no reduction in evoked IPSC amplitude. However in the presence of SR 95531, a competitive antagonist, furosemide markedly reduced IPSC amplitude. One hypothesis, which could account for these observations, is that competitive antagonists prevent the continual activation of alpha 6 beta 2 / 3 gamma 2 receptors by endogenous GABA and thus prevent their desensitisation. This hypothesis appears feasible as prolonged applications of low concentrations of GABA to recombinant alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 s receptors resulted in their desensitisation.

Extravesicular calcium {{was found to have}} complex actions on zinc uptake. At a low zinc concentration of 1 μM, calcium (0. 1 – 2 mM) significantly stimulated zinc uptake.

The potassium channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride inhibited zinc uptake at this relatively high zinc concentration, suggesting the presence of a low affinity zinc uptake pathway linked to potassium efflux.

In vitro, SXN 101742 targeted the GHRH receptor and depleted a SNARE protein involved in GH exocytosis, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP 2). In vivo, administering SXN 101742 to growing rats produced a dose-dependent inhibition of GH synthesis, storage, and secretion. Consequently, hepatic IGF 1 production and resultant circulating IGF 1 levels were reduced. Accordingly, body weight, body length, organ weight, and bone mass acquisition were all decreased, reflecting the biological impact of SXN 101742 on the GH/IGF 1 axis. An inactivating 2 -amino acid substitution within the zinc coordination site of the endopeptidase domain completely abolished SXN 101742 inhibitory actions on GH and IGF 1. Thus, genetically reengineered BoNTs can be targeted to nonneural cells to selectively inhibit hormone secretion, representing {{a new approach to}} treating hormonal excess...|$|R
40|$|Peroxynitrite {{toxicity}} is a {{major cause}} of neuronal injury in stroke and neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity induced by peroxynitrite are still unclear. In this study, we observed that TPEN [N,N,N�,N�-tetrakis (2 -pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine], a zinc chelator, protected against neurotoxicity induced by exogenous as well as endogenous (coadministration of NMDA and a nitric oxide donor, diethylenetriamine NONOate) peroxynitrite. Two different approaches to detecting intracellular zinc release demonstrated the liberation of zinc from intracellular stores by peroxynitrite. In addition, we found that peroxynitrite toxicity was blocked by inhibitors of 12 -lipoxygenase (12 -LOX), p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and caspase- 3 and was associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Inhibition of 12 -LOX blocked the activation of p 38 MAPK and caspase- 3. Zinc itself induced the activation of 12 -LOX, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of p 38 MAPK and caspase- 3. These data suggest a cell death pathway triggered by peroxynitrite in which intracellular zinc release leads to activation of 12 -LOX, ROS accumulation, p 38 activation, and caspase- 3 activation. Therefore, therapies aimed at maintaining intracellular <b>zinc</b> homeostasis or <b>blocking</b> activation of 12 -LOX may provide a novel avenue for the treatment of inflammation, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases in which the formation of peroxynitrite is thought {{to be one of the}} important causes of cell death.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of fluid shear stress on metallothionein (MT) gene and protein expression and intracellular free zinc in mouse aorta and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Immunostaining of the endothelial surface of mouse aorta revealed increased expression of MT protein in the lesser curvature of the aorta relative to the descending thoracic aorta. HUVECs were exposed to high steady shear stress (15 dyn/cm 2), low steady shear stress (1 dyn/cm 2), or reversing shear stress (mean of 1 dyn/cm 2, 1 Hz) for 24 h. Gene expression of three MT- 1 isoforms, MT- 2 A, and zinc transporter- 1 was upregulated by low steady shear stress and reversing shear stress. HUVECs exposed to 15 dyn/cm 2 had increased levels of free zinc compared with cells under other shear stress regimes and static conditions. The increase in free <b>zinc</b> was partially <b>blocked</b> with an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, suggesting a role for shear stress-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity. Cells subjected to reversing shear stress in zinc-supplemented media (50 μM ZnSO 4) had increased intracellular free zinc, reduced surface intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression, and reduced monocyte adhesion compared with cells exposed to reversing shear stress in normal media. The sensitivity of intracellular free zinc to differences in shear stress suggests that intracellular zinc levels are important in the regulation of the endothelium and in the progression of vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevention}} of cerebral palsy and neuroprotection of the immature brain {{continue to be}} health care priorities. The pathophysiology of perinatal brain lesions associated with cerebral palsy seems to be multifactorial and includes pre- and perinatal factors such as preconceptional events, hormone and growth factors deficiencies, maternal infections with production of cytokines, and hypoxic/ischemic perfusion failures. Excitotoxic cascade could represent a common pathway that leads to neural cell death and subsequent brain damage. Brain injuries induced by ibotenate, a glutamatergic analog, which are essentially mediated through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, mimic {{some aspects of the}} white matter cysts and transcortical necrosis observed in human perinatal brain damage. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the protective role of several pharmacological agents, administered in conjunction with ibotenate, against induced excitotoxic lesions. We injected ibotenate in the developing mouse brain 5 d postnatally, after the full settlement of neuronal layers. Co-treatment with kynurenic acid, an antagonist of the facilitating glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, or with N(G) -nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, induced a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect. Conversely, <b>zinc</b> gluconate, a <b>blocking</b> agent of the channel linked to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, and a free radical scavenger (U 74389 F), were unable to protect the developing brain against excitotoxic attack. These data help to clarify some molecular mechanisms involved in excitotoxic lesions of the developing mouse brain and permit us to envision new strategies in the {{prevention of}} cerebral palsy...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{pathogenic}} microorganisms to assimilate essential nutrients from their hosts {{is critical for}} pathogenesis. Here we report endothelial zinc sequestration by the major human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. We hypothesised that, analogous to siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, C. albicans utilises an extracellular zinc scavenger for acquiring this essential metal. We postulated that such a "zincophore" system would consist of a secreted factor with zinc-binding properties, which can specifically reassociate with the fungal cell surface. In silico analysis of the C. albicans secretome for proteins with zinc binding motifs identified the pH-regulated antigen 1 (Pra 1). Three-dimensional modelling of Pra 1 indicated the presence {{of at least two}} zinc coordination sites. Indeed, recombinantly expressed Pra 1 exhibited zinc binding properties in vitro. Deletion of PRA 1 in C. albicans prevented fungal sequestration and utilisation of host <b>zinc,</b> and specifically <b>blocked</b> host cell damage in the absence of exogenous zinc. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PRA 1 arose in an ancient fungal lineage and developed synteny with ZRT 1 (encoding a zinc transporter) before divergence of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Structural modelling indicated physical interaction between Pra 1 and Zrt 1 and we confirmed this experimentally by demonstrating that Zrt 1 was essential for binding of soluble Pra 1 to the cell surface of C. albicans. Therefore, we have identified a novel metal acquisition system consisting of a secreted zinc scavenger ("zincophore"), which reassociates with the fungal cell. Furthermore, functional similarities with phylogenetically unrelated prokaryotic systems indicate that syntenic zinc acquisition loci have been independently selected during evolution...|$|R
5000|$|The Sojourner rover had an Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), {{which was}} {{used to analyze the}} {{components}} of the rocks and soil. The rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one. These instruments could investigate the geology of the Martian surface from just a few millimeters to many hundreds of meters, the geochemistry and evolutionary history of the rocks and surface, the magnetic and mechanical properties of the land, as well as the magnetic properties of the dust, atmosphere and the rotational and orbital dynamics of the planet.Three navigation cameras were on board the rover: Two black and white 0.3-megapixel cameras were located on the front (768 horizontal pixels × 484 vertical pixels configured in 4×4+100 pixel blocks), coupled with five laser stripe projectors, which enabled stereoscopic images to be taken along with measurements for hazard detection on the rover's path. A third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back, near the APXS, and rotated by 90°. It provided images of the APXS's target area and the rover's tracks on the ground. The pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way, that out of the 16 pixel of a 4×4 pixel block, 12 pixel were sensitive to green, 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue. As all cameras had lenses made out of <b>zinc</b> selenide, which <b>blocks</b> light below a wavelength of 500 nm, no blue light actually reached these [...] "blue/infrared" [...] pixels, which therefore recorded only infrared.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{inhibitory}} {{actions of}} picrotoxin (PTX) and zinc on the GABA receptor in acutely isolated catfish cone horizontal cells were studied and compared using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. PTX blocked the GABAcurrent elicited by 30 μM GABA with IC 50 = 0. 64 μM. Over a PTX concentration range of 1 – 100 μ,M, simultaneous application of PTX with GABA (30 uM) produced current transients {{at both the}} onset and offset of the drug pulse. When the PTX concentration was maintained before, during, and after GABA application, the current transients at the onset and offset of GABA application disappeared. Thus, these transients seem to reflect a slower initial action of PTX at, and faster washout of PTX from, the GABA receptor than GABA when they were co-applied. The full recovery from PTX inhibition required a second GABA application. Recovery could not be achieved by a prolonged wash {{in the absence of}} GABA. These results suggest that PTX effect its use-dependent. <b>Zinc</b> also potently <b>blocked</b> the GABA current elicited by 30 μM GABA with an IC 50 about an order of magnitude higher than that of PTX (IC 50 = 8. 2 uM). However, only the onset, but not the offset current transient was observed when zinc was simultaneously applied with GABA. The full recovery of the GABA current from zinc inhibition was obtained after washing for 20 sec and did not require a subsequent GABA application. This indicates that the zinc effect is use-independent. Our findings suggest that: (1) the zinc binding site is {{on the surface of the}} GABA receptor molecule; (2) there is a PTX binding site that is probably inside the receptor and its access requires GABA binding to the receptor...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{overload}} {{has been}} implicated {{as a critical}} event in glutamate excitotoxicity associated neurodegeneration. Recently, zinc accumulation and its neurotoxic role similar to calcium has been proposed. Earlier, we reported that free chelatable zinc released during hypobaric hypoxia mediates neuronal damage and memory impairment. The molecular mechanism behind hypobaric hypoxia mediated neuronal damage is obscure. The role of free zinc in such neuropathological condition has not been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the underlying role of free chelatable zinc in hypobaric hypoxia-induced neuronal inflammation and apoptosis resulting in hippocampal damage. Adult male Balb/c mice were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia and treated with saline or Ca 2 EDTA (1. 25 mM/kg i. p) daily for four days. The effects of Ca 2 EDTA on apoptosis (caspases activity and DNA fragmentation), pro-inflammatory markers (iNOS, TNF-α and COX- 2), NADPH oxidase activity, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity and expressions of Bax, Bcl- 2, HIF- 1 α, metallothionein- 3, ZnT- 1 and ZIP- 6 were examined in the hippocampal region of brain. Hypobaric hypoxia resulted in increased expression of metallothionein- 3 and zinc transporters (ZnT- 1 and ZIP- 6). Hypobaric hypoxia elicited an oxidative stress and inflammatory response characterized by elevated NADPH oxidase activity and up-regulation of iNOS, COX- 2 and TNF-α. Furthermore, hypobaric hypoxia induced HIF- 1 α protein expression, PARP activation and apoptosis in the hippocampus. Administration of Ca 2 EDTA significantly attenuated the hypobaric hypoxia induced oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus. We propose that hypobaric hypoxia/reperfusion instigates free chelatable zinc imbalance in brain associated with neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, zinc chelating strategies which <b>block</b> <b>zinc</b> mediated neuronal damage linked with cerebral hypoxia and other neurodegenerative conditions can be designed in future...|$|R
