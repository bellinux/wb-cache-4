5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the <b>Zeeman</b> <b>Effect,</b> or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field.

Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the <b>Zeeman</b> <b>effect.</b> Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons.

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the <b>Zeeman</b> <b>effect.</b> This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
