25|$|Homoscedasticity: , {{which means}} that the error term has the same {{variance}} σ2 in each observation. When this requirement is violated this is called heteroscedasticity, in such case a more efficient estimator would be weighted least squares. If the errors have infinite variance then the OLS estimates will also have infinite variance (although by the law of large numbers they will nonetheless tend toward the true values so long as the errors have <b>zero</b> <b>mean).</b> In this case, robust estimation techniques are recommended.|$|E

However, supposing we manage to reject the <b>zero</b> <b>mean</b> hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.|$|E
