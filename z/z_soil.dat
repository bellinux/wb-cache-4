The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of different application rates of natural zeolite (clinoptilolite) and nitrogen on rice yield, yield components, soil nitrogen, water use, water productivity in a silty clay soil in 2004 and 2005. Zeolite was only applied in the first year. In order to study the long-term and continuous effect of zeolite on the objectives of the study, no zeolite was applied in the second year and the study was conducted on the same land as the first year. Zeolite and N were applied at rates of 0, 2, 4, and 8 Â tÂ ha- 1 and 0, 20, 40, and 80 Â kgÂ ha- 1, respectively in 2004. In 2005, each plot received the same amount of N as received in 2004. It is concluded that by decreasing N application rates, higher Z application rate is needed to improve grain yield. Highest grain yield was obtained at N application rate of 80 Â kgÂ ha- 1 and Z application rate of 4 Â tÂ ha- 1. Higher grain yield was mostly attributed to lower unfilled grain percentage and higher 1000 -grain weight that were a result of higher N application rate and N retention in <b>soil</b> due to <b>Z</b> application. Nitrogen and Z applications resulted in higher grain protein contents and nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE). Based on these results and due to higher N retention in <b>soil</b> under <b>Z</b> application, improved grain yield quality, nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), and nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE) could be obtained at Z application rate of 8 Â tÂ ha- 1 and N application rate of 80 Â kgÂ ha- 1 or more.

The high sediment yield reflects severe soil erosion due to cultivation aligned with slope on steep slopes, which is very common throughout Sichuan Basin and particularly in the TGP area. The total sediment delivered to the Yangtze from the TGP area has been estimated, using small reservoir data and sediment load measured at hydrological stations.

A generalized soil-adjusted vegetation index (GESAVI), theoretically based on a simple vegetation canopy model, is introduced. It is {{defined in terms of}} the soil line parameters (A and B) as: GESAVI=(NIRBRA) /(R+ Z), where Z is related to the red reflectance at the cross point between the soil line and vegetation isolines. As <b>Z</b> is a <b>soil</b> adjustment coefficient, this new index can be considered as belonging to the SAVI family. In order to analyze the GESAVI sensitivity to soil brightness and soil color, both high resolution reflectance data from two laboratory experiments and data obtained by applying a radiosity model to simulate heterogeneous vegetation canopy scenes were used. VIs (including GESAVI, NDVI, PVI and SAVI family indices) were computed and their correlation with LAI for the different soil backgrounds was analyzed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{structural}} strength of soils {{has been extensively}} described by physical and mechanical properties evaluated on the mesoscale for different soils and management conditions. However, changes {{in the organization of}} the soil matrix at the microstructural level, which can be obtained by rheometry, are still seldom used in soil mechanics. Our aim was to use the amplitude sweep test, a rheometry technique, to investigate the micro{{structural strength}} of four subtropical soils (two Oxisols, an Ultisol and a Vertisol) and to discuss difficulties with respect to the samples, water content, soil density and vertical force. The various rheological properties which reveal the soil microstructural strength were determined: deformation {{at the end of the}} linear viscoelastic range, LVE range (γLVE), shear stress at the end of the LVE range (τLVE), deformation at yield point, YP (γYP), storage and loss moduli at YP (G′G″YP), maximum shear stress (τmax), and integral <b>z.</b> In general, <b>soil</b> elasticity (γLVE and γYP) and microstructural strength (τLVE and τmax) were greater in the Oxisols and the Vertisol, which both possess high clay content, while the latter also contains expansive clay minerals. The lowest structural strength was observed in the Ultisol which had a high sand content. As rheological properties are related to soil properties such as particle size distribution and carbon content, they can be applied in the evaluation of the microstructural strength of clayey and sandy soils and allows for inferences regarding inter-particle shear strength. However, the test is not applicable to very dry soil samples and sample preparations can affect the results. We suggest a number of approaches to find solutions for these difficulties/problems...|$|R

In the present study, the results of Hg speciation and mobility of Hg in soils affected by Hg emissions from three chlor-alkali plants are compared. Solid phase mercury speciation analyses was Ž. carried out using a mercurythermo-desorption technique with the aim of distinguishing elemental Hg Hg 0 from Ž. Hg II-binding forms. Mercury species in soil leachates were distinguished using an operationally defined method, Ž. which is based on the reactivity of soluble Hg compounds. Results show that the Hg 0 emitted from the plants could not be detected in any of the investigated soils. This indicates quantitative re-emission or oxidation of this Hg species in the atmosphere or soils. In most soils Hg was predominately bound to organic matter. Only in sandy soils deficient in organic matter was Hg, to a larger extent, sorbed onto mineral soil components. Leachable Hg in most soils occurred as non-reactive, soluble organic Hg complexes such as fulvic acid-bound Hg, and reach their highest values Ž 1. 90 g kg in soils rich in organic matter.

While direct observation of Al-x (SO 4) (y) (OH) (<b>z)</b> precipitate in <b>soil</b> has been reported only recently, sorption isotherms experiments have been rarely performed to distinguish between adsorption and precipitation processes. Traditionally, SO 42 - sorption experiments have involved relatively low SO 42 - concentrations in the range 0 - 5 mM. However, for SO 42 - precipitation to occur, higher concentrations may be needed. Here, we evaluated SO 42 - sorption in four contrasting Andosols samples by measuring sorption isotherms with SO 42 - concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 15 mM and under low pH conditions (pH 4). A 1 h sorption lowest equilibration time was precipitation at high dissolvedallowed. A sorption isotherms showed a distinct biphasic shape. In the lowest SO 42 - concentration range (6 mM), SO 42 - sorption could be described by a linear isotherm. The transition between a Langmuir-type and a linear-type isotherm also corresponded to the transition point where the solution was oversaturated with respect to Al-x(OH) (y) (SO 4) (z) minerals, according to thermodynamic calculations.

40|$|Irrigated spring {{cropping}} systems on sloping soils require conservation agriculture (CA) to minimise soil erosion. In southern Spain, management of residues in the commonly-practiced maize-cotton rotation {{is a major}} hurdle against adoption of CA. Recently, a minimal-cultivation, irrigated permanent bed system has been developed in which, two weeks before sowing, maize or cotton residues are relocated from the seed rows {{on the top of}} beds into the furrows. This allows solar heating of the beds which accelerates seedling emergence. This paper presents the effects that the introduction of this system had on soil properties along a variably-sloping landscape in which six homogeneous zones were identified. It also discusses the system's potential for carbon sequestration and shows that a similar quantity of carbon is stored after 4 years under irrigated permanent beds to that after 11 - 21 years in rainfed no-tillage systems. The relocation of residues resulted on average in lower soil organic carbon concentration (SOCc) in the beds than in the furrows (1. 40 and 1. 51 % respectively in the top 5 cm of soil). Under this system SOCc also varied among the landscape zones particularly in the top layers. SOCc was highest in the most eroded shoulder-backslope zone (<b>Z</b> 2) though <b>soil</b> organic carbon storage (SOCs) there was the lowest because of the zone's high > 2 -mm soil fraction. The SOCs (0 - 30 cm) global average during the study was 35. 2 MgCha- 1 and ranged from 22. 4 MgCha- 1 in the shoulder Z 2 zone to 41. 4 MgCha- 1 in the Z 5 footslope zone.

After two years of fertilizer application, we observed an increase in net aboveground plant production (about 9 – 12 kg ha- 1 year-) connected {{with an increase in}} shoot:root ratio in fertilized plots of both sites, with more pronounced changes in oligotrophic sedge meadow. Total CO 2 efflux from the ecosystem measured in situ was significantly higher at fertilized plots as well as increase in total soil respiration in case of sedge meadow, but we found no significant effect of fertilization on CO 2 efflux from the system at mesotrophic site. Surprisingly, other parameters, like soil microbial biomass C and N content, the rates of respiration, denitrification, nitrification, nitrogen mineralization and nitrogen assimilation were not affected by fertilization. In conclusion, an interesting finding is that despite non significant impact on aboveground component there were significant responses in belowground part which suggest that belowground processes may be suitable early warning signals.

40|$|The {{proposed}} Soil Framework Directive COM(2006) 232 requires Member States {{to identify}} areas {{at risk of}} erosion, decline in organic matter, salinisation, compaction, sealing and landslides, {{as well as to}} set up an inventory of contaminated sites. The present project aims to identify the susceptibility to compaction of soils of the Walloon Region (Belgium) and to recommend good farming practices avoiding soil compaction as far as possible. Within this scope, the concept of precompression stress (Pc) (Horn and Fleige, 2003) was used. Pc is defined as the maximum major principal stress that a soil horizon can withstand against any applied external vertical stress. If applied stress is higher than Pc, the soil enters in a plastic state, not easily reversible. For a given soil, the intensity of soil compaction is mainly due to the applied load which depends on vehicle characteristics (axle load, tyre dimensions, tyre inflation pressure, and vehicle velocity). To determine soil precompression stress, pedotransfert functions of Lebert and Horn (1991) defined at two water suctions (pF 1. 8 and 2. 5) were used. Parameters required by these functions were found within several databases (Aardewerk and Digital Map of Walloon Soils) and literature. The validation of Pc was performed by measuring stress-strain relationships using automatic oedometers. Stresses of 15. 6, 31, 3, 62. 5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 kPa were applied for 10 min each. In this study, the compaction due to beet harvesters was considered because the axle load can exceed 10 tons and these machines are often used during wet conditions. The compaction at two depth levels was considered: 30 and 50 cm. Compaction of topsoil was not taken into account because, under conventional tillage, the plough depth is lower than 25 cm. Before and after the passage of the machines, following measurements were performed: granulometry, density, soil moisture, pF curve, Atterberg limits, [...] . The software Soilflex (Keller et al., 2007) was used to estimate the distribution of the vertical stresses sigma <b>z</b> in the <b>soil.</b> Comparison was performed between sigma z and Pc. The following data simulated the passage of a beet harvester machine (mass: 23 580 kg; load: 18 000 kg) in a silty soil located in Hesbaye and classified as Aba (Sirjacobs et al., 2000). The passage of the machine would create a Pc of around 100 kPa at 30 cm depth, while the stress induced by the machine would reach 240 kPa. In the field borders, where more vehicle traffic was usually observed and where the soil was over consolidated, Pc would reach 180 kPa, while sigma z would be 220 kPa. In both cases, the risk of compaction created by the passage of the machine would be high...|$|R

Saline-alkaline mudflat and different vegetations acted as N 2 O source in the Yellow River Delta and the N 2 O emission of different ecosystems followed the order: Saline-alkaline mudflat > T. chinensis >S. salsa >P. australis. Therefore restoration of saline land through revegetation was necessary to reduce the N 2 O emission of saline soils. The effects of air and soil temperature on N 2 O fluxes were significant in salt-affected soils except P. australis. Soil water content and electrical conductivity correlated positively or negatively with N 2 O emissions in mudflat and P. australis community. While relationships between N 2 O production and other soil properties (TC, TN, C:N ratio, NH 4 +-N and NO 3 [...] N) were only significant in mudflat and T. chinensis community. Temporal variations of N 2 O emission were related to the interactions of abiotic factors (air and soil temperature, soil water content and electrical conductivity) and the variations of other soil properties, while spatial variations were mainly affected by the vegetation composition at spatial scale.

The effects of air and soil temperature on N 2 O fluxes were significant in salt-affected soils except P. australis. Soil water content and electrical conductivity correlated positively or negatively with N 2 O emissions in mudflat and P. australis community. While relationships between N 2 O production and other soil properties (TC, TN, C:N ratio, NH 4 +-N and NO 3 [...] N) were only significant in mudflat and T. chinensis community. Temporal variations of N 2 O emission were related to the interactions of abiotic factors (air and soil temperature, soil water content and electrical conductivity) and the variations of other soil properties, while spatial variations were mainly affected by the vegetation composition at spatial scale.

40|$|Integration {{of diverse}} {{datasets}} on the Moon may render some paradigms of lunar science either better-defended or vulnerable. We will consider three paradigms commonly used {{for understanding the}} processes of lunar regolith evolution in light of new and accumulated data. Our premise is that all data-sets should converge to a single interpretation if a concept or model is to be accepted as a paradigm. If a convergence is lacking, the paradigm needs fresh scrutiny. SteadyState: Lunar regolith evolution is currently {{understood in terms of}} comminution, agglutination, and replenishment as described by McKay and coworkers). Briefly, the model envisages continued micrometeoritic bombardment to comminute exposed soil particles to finer sizes while continued agglutination consumes finer sizes to produce larger constructional particles. Eventually, a balance between these two opposing processes achieves a steady state; soils at steady state maintain their mean grain size (M(sub z)). Episodic higher-energy impacts excavate fresh coarse material from below the soil cover, disturb the steady state, and restart the process to achieve a new steady state. It follows that the thickness of the regolith at any site would control the frequency of replenishment; indeed, the thickness of the regolith at Apollo landing sites was predicted by McKay et al. from the average M(sub <b>z)</b> of local <b>soils.</b> However, replenishment may come also from disintegrating boulders and cobbles at the lunar surface, and rates of comminution and agglutination may depend on the properties of target material. Regression between M(sub z) and I(sub s) /Fe(sup 0) (a measure of maturity or total surface exposure) of Apollo soils at different sites shows the following relations and estimated M(sub z) at a high maturity of I(sub s) /Fe(sup 0) = 100. It is possible that Apollo 12 and 15 sites have the thickest regolith and the Apollo 16 site has the thinnest. It is also possible that Apollo 12 and 15 basalts are comminuted faster than Apollo 16 highland rocks and Apollo 14 and 17 soils are products of mixed parentage. If a soil becomes continually finer as it matures until agglutination catches up, and if comminution is differential-dependent on the physical properties of the constituents, then the composition of the bulk soil has to match the composition of some "fulcrum" grain size fraction, say X Grain size fractions >X and <X will complement each other; their mass balance is the bulk soil. It appears that the 10 - 20 -micron size fraction may be the fulcrum. In general, trace-element chemistry and IR reflectance spectra of this size fraction are closest to that of the bulk soil, regardless of maturity that is surprising. Disaggregated products of regolith breccias may also show similar relationships. If the 10 - 20 gm is the fulcrum (i. e., X as above) for many soil properties (e. g., major element composition, FMR, solar-wind-implanted elements), then this may be the ultimate mean grain size of lunar soils at steady state. However, different properties of soils may find steady states at different grain size fractions. The steady state of solar-wind-implanted elements, on the other hand, will climb up the grain-size scale as agglutinates transfer surface-correlated components into volume correlated components until a saturation level is reached or the rates of replenishment and implantation become equal. The same will be the case with vapor-deposited reduced metals as they too are incorporated inside constructional particles. Properties that are directly affected by soil-maturation processes will thus have different pathways of achieving steady states. Maturity, i. e., cumulative surface exposure, of lunar soils is best quantified by the amount of nanophase superparamagnetic Fe(sup 0) (np-Fe(sup 0)) normalized to Fe content (=I(sub s) /Fe(sup 0). The majority consensus (paradigm?) for the production of np-Fe(sup 0) is associated with the production of agglutinates. Because large doses of solar-wind H are implanted in all lunar soils upon exposure, any melting (e. g., during agglutinate production) triggers a chemical reduction of Fe-bearing minerals resulting in np-Fe(sup 0) production. The quantity of np-Fe(sup 0) is thus dependent on melting events, (i. e., exposure), and limited by the Fe content of the soil. All freshly produced np-Fe(sup 0) resides in agglutinitic glass, as new TEM images show. Apparently, the correction procedure developed by Lucey et al. to estimate the Fe content of the lunar surface from IR-reflectance spectra depends on accepting the above. However, the process of producing np-Fe(sup 0) may be physical rather than chemical. All np-Fe(sup 0) could be deposits from a vapor produced by micrometeoritic impact on lunar soils. If metal-O bonds in target phases are broken, O being "most volatile" will escape leaving an O-deficient vapor to facilitate the production of np-Fe(sup 0). If so, the quantity of np-Fe(sup 0) is dependent on the vaporizing events, (i. e., exposure), and limited by the efficiency of breaking metal-O bonds and the escape of 0. To the extent that strengths of metal-O bonds are dependent on the local crystal field, production of np-Fe(sup 0) may be limited by the mineral composition of target soils and not by their total Fe content. According to this model, vapor-deposited np-Fe(sup 0) should be found at any retentive sites on lunar soil grains. Indeed, TEM images show np-Fe(sup 0) on plagioclase and ilmenite. Incorporation of such pre-irradiated np-Fe(sup 0) -bearing grains into agglutinates may account for eventual increased emplacement of np-Fe(sup 0) in agglutinates. Such a paradigm shift in understanding the origin of np-Fe(sup 0) will raise questions ranging from the unquestionable use of Is/FeO as the universal maturity parameter of lunar soils to global elemental maps of the Moon from remote-sensing data.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Bu tez kapsamında 1994 yılında California, Amerika’da yaşanan Northridge depremi sonrasında çelik yapılarda gözlemlenen beklenmeyen hasarların nedenlerinin anlaşılması amacı ile oluşturulan SAC organizasyonunun yürüttüğü çalışmalar kapsamında tasarlanan 3 katlı Seattle yapısının deprem performansının belirlenmesi ve sönümleyiciler ile güçlendirilmesi çalışması yürütülmüştür. Sönüyleyiciler kullanılarak ülkemizde henüz bir bina tasarımı veya güçlendirme uygulaması gerçekleştirilmemiş olsa da, özellikle Amerika ve Japonya’da uzun yıllardır birçok uygulama yapılmış ve ilgili yönetmeliklerce (ASCE 7 - 10, FEMA 356, BSLJ vb.) tasarım kuralları tanımlanmıştır. Sönümleyiciler genel olarak deplasman ve hız bağımlı olarak ikiye ayrılmaktadırlar. Ancak deplasman ve hız bazlı sönümleyicilerin her ikisinin özelliklerini de birlikte içeren sönümleyiciler de (viskoelastik sönümleyiciler) mevcuttur. Deplasman bağımlı sönümleyicilerde sönümlenen enerji miktarı yapılan göreli deplasman ile, hız bağımlı sönümleyicilerde ise göreli hız farkı ile orantılı olmaktadır. Deplasman bazlı sönümleyicilerde yapıya ilave rijitlik ilavesi söz konusu olurken, hız bazlı lineer sönümleyiciler ile yapılan testlerde söz konusu aygıtların efektif rijitliklerinin ihmal edilebilir seviyelerde olduğu belirtilmektedir. Maksimum hız ve maksimum deplasman durumunda ortaya çıkan kuvvetlerin ise ters fazlı olması, hız bağımlı sönümleyicilerin en önemli avantajı olarak öne çıkmaktadır. Yürürlükte olan Deprem Bölgelerinde Yapılacak Yapılar Hakkında Yönetmelik 2007 ’ye (DBYBHY 2007) göre mevcut çelik yapıların deprem performansının belirlenmesinde,  DBYBHY 2007 Bölüm 4 ’te verilen tasarım kriterlerine göre değerlendirme yapılması gerekmektedir. Söz konusu durumda mevcut çelik yapılar için değerlendirme, tasarım esaslarına dayanmakta ve lineer yöntemler ile yapılmaktadır. Değerlendirme sonucunda ise çelik yapılar için betonarme yapılar için tanımlandığı şekilde bir performans seviyesi (Hemen Kullanım, Can Güvenliği, Göçme Öncesi, Göçme Durumu) tanımı yapmak mümkün olamamaktadır. Bu nedenle yürütülen çalışmalarda ASCE 41 - 06 ve Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 356 yönetmeliklerince çelik yapılar için verilen kriterler doğrultusunda değerlendirme yapılmıştır. Yapının değerlendirilmesinde DBYBHY 2007 ’de tanımlanan 475 yıl dönüş periyotlu (50 yılda aşılma olasılığı % 10) deprem senaryosu için itme analizi ve benzeştirilmiş deprem kayıtları kullanılarak zaman tanım alanında doğrusal olmayan analizler yürütülmüş ve sonuçlar özetlenmiştir. Güçlendirme aşamasında belirlenen güçlendirme hedefi gözetilerek seçilen sönümleyiciler yapının matematiksel modeline adapte edilmiş ve öngörülen sönümleyici özelliklerinin ve performans hedefinin doğrulanmasına yönelik, 475 yıl (50 yılda aşılma olasılığı % 10) deprem senaryosu gözetilerek seçilen benzeştirilmiş deprem kayıtları ile zaman tanım alanında doğrusal olmayan analizler yürütülmüştür. Analizler neticesinde edinilen sonuçlar tablolar ve grafikler ile özetlenmiştir. After Northridge {{earthquake}} in California extensive damages at steel building connections were observed unexpectedly. SAC joint venture, funded by FEMA, was established after the Northridge earthquake to further investigate the possible causes of those unexpected damages. For the structures {{that have not}} been collapsed during the earthquake, it can be assumed that they have fulfilled their mission. However, after a very detailed investigation of the damages on steel structures, it was revealed that most of the welded beam-column connections were damaged beyond expected. The inspectors and engineers were very surprised after these findings as steel structures were believed to be invincible by the engineers before the earthquake. SAC joint venture hired different independent design firms to design three, nine and twenty story buildings according to the pre-Northridge and local codes in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Boston. After the designs were complete, extensive linear and nonlinear analysis were conducted to better understand the deficiencies of the damaged steel structures during the Northridge earthquake. Also about 120 full scale connections were tested to improve the steel moment connections and their load bearing capacities in the scope of that study. Three story Seattle structure designed in the scope of SAC studies is mainly investigated in this thesis. The performance of this structure is evaluated by using nonlinear pushover and nonlinear time history analysis on a 3 D model. After the evaluation phase, the structure is retrofitted with using fluid viscous dampers. Up to date there is no application of the fluid viscous dampers in buildings’ design or their retrofitting design in Turkey. But this technology is being widely used especially in United States of America and Japan and their design procedures are well defined in design codes. Dampers can mainly be categorized as displacement dependent devices or velocity dependent devices. However dampers that include the properties of both displacement and velocity dependent devices are also available (visco-elastic dampers). All damper types has their own advantages and disadvantages but the primary advantage of fluid viscous dampers over conventional retrofit methods is, as these devices are velocity dependent, their reaction forces are out-of-phase with displacement. Performance concept for structures are defined firstly with 2007 Turkish Seismic Code in Turkey. However, performance evaluation procedures and performance acceptance criterias are only defined for reinforced concrete structures. As performance evaluation procedures and performance target concepts form an important part of this study, performance concepts and definitions given in FEMA 356 and DBYBHY 2007 codes are also briefly explained. Procedures defined in ASCE 41 - 06 and FEMA 356 are mainly followed for performance evaluation of the investigated structure as no definitions exist for performance evaluation of steel structures in 2007 Turkish Seismic Code. When compared, it is seen that the definitions for different performance levels (Life Safety, Immediate Occupation etc.) are similar for investigated codes, however structure performance cannot be defined without the performance of nonstructural items in a structure for the ASCE 41 and FEMA 356 codes.   As fluid viscous dampers will be used in the retrofit design of the building, a summary about fluid viscous dampers and damping on structures is also included. Damping can be described as decay with time in amplitude of a free vibration. The energy of a vibrating system is dissipated by various damping sources (opening and closing of micro cracks for concrete structures, interaction with nonstructural elements, friction in steel connections etc.). Contrary to conventional retrofit methods, fluid viscous dampers do not have a stiffening affect on the structure. Therefore, as the natural vibration period do not decrease, the earthquake forces acting on the structure do not change. Fluid viscous dampers introduce supplementary damping to the structure, which allows a serious amount of the {{earthquake in}}put energy to be dissipated by added dampers. Viscous dampers can be defined by their damping coefficient and damping exponent. Dampers with damping coefficient equal to unity are named as linear dampers. Force output of linear dampers is proportional to velocity. If the damping exponent is not equal to unity, dampers are defined as nonlinear. Force output of nonlinear dampers are dependent on damping exponent and are not linearly proportional to velocity. In practice, it is possible to produce dampers with damping exponent ranging from 0. 2 to 2. However, dampers with damping exponent between 0. 3 and 1 are generally preferred for structures. The most important advantage of viscous dampers is, for linear dampers, the output forces of those devices are always out of phase with inertia forces of the structure. The maximum internal forces on the sections forming the structure are expected to occur at maximum drift for the investigated location, as linear viscous dampers provide their maximum output force at maximum relative velocity, those forces do not occur {{at the same time and}} therefore the possibility of additional retrofit (i. e. retrofit of foundations) on the structure is greatly reduced. In the scope of this study, the investigated structure is explained in detail including the analysis assumptions made. The studies carried out by Gupta and Krawinkler as well as FEMA 355 are mainly followed in this thesis as those studies are widely adopted for performance evaluation of steel structures in the current practice. Definitions given in ASCE 41 - 06 and FEMA 356 are used for steel column, beam and panel zone hinges for the nonlinear pushover and time history analysis. The possible affect of connections are not taken into account and were considered as fully restrained. A summary of pushover analysis and nonlinear time history analysis is also given including the steps and methods followed in this thesis. After the evaluation of the results obtained for the investigated structure, steps for determination of damper properties (damping constant, damping exponent etc.) are also summarized. The structure is assumed to be located at 1 st degree earthquake zone with <b>Z</b> 3 class <b>soil</b> according to 2007 Turkish Seismic Code. The performance of the structure is first evaluated with nonlinear pushover analysis and than the obtained results are compared with the results of three nonlinear time history analysis, where used acceleration records were matched to target spectrum. The obtained results for two different evaluation methods were mostly compatible with each other. The analysis results showed that the existing structure satisfies Life Safety performance level criterias for both directions considering the plastic rotation limitations given in ASCE 41 - 06 and FEMA 356. Even if there is no defined restrictions for structural performance taking into account of the drift ratios of the structures, analysis results showed that the drift ratios for the inspected structure  exceed 0. 03 for both principal directions it is decided that the existing structure should be retrofitted. When residual drift ratios are investigated from the results obtained from nonlinear time history analysis, it is seen that about % 0. 7 residual drift occurs at the structure. Decreasing the drift ratios of the structure below 0. 02 is selected as the retrofit target. For preliminary analysis, as it is needed to decrease the structure’s drift ratio by roughly 0. 01, a damping ratio which will decrease the forces acting on the structure accordingly (about % 20 of critical damping) is selected. After, damper properties and layout is selected considering the retrofit target. Four dampers is placed for each direction at each story of the structure to limit the maximum output forces of the dampers. The assumptions made at the preliminary design stage is than verified by nonlinear time history analysis. Time history analysis is carried out only for DBE level earthquake using three spectrum-matched records, therefore the maximum values obtained from the analysis are used. After the addition of the dampers, it is seen that the structure satisfies “Immediate Occupancy” performance level criterias for hinge rotations in both directions. It is also observed that the drift ratios of the structure are below 0. 016. It has been seen that viscous dampers can be a very effective retrofit solution. With increased damping, the forces that the structure is expected to carry decreases and as the maximum damper output force is out of phase with inertia forces, no additional forces are introduced to the structural elements compared to the existing situation. This retrofit method can also be considered for reinforced concrete structures. The usage of steel structures in Turkey is increasing everyday, but the required parameters for performance evaluation of steel structures are not defined in DBYBHY 2007. It is seen from the carried out studies that, steel structures with low axial loads can go through extreme deformations without strength-degradation and can still satisfy Life Safety requirements in means of hinge rotations defined at ASCE 41 and FEMA.
