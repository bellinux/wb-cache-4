The first UV spectrophotometric method was a determination using the simultaneous equation method at 245 nm and 227 nm. The second UV spectrophotometric method is the Q – analysis (absorption ratio) method, which involves {{the formation of}} absorbance equation at 237. 5 nm (isobestic point) and at 227 nm the maximum absorption of <b>Zaltoprofen.</b> The linearity ranges for Paracetamol and <b>Zaltoprofen</b> were 2 – 18 μg/ml and 2 – 18 μg/ml respectively. The accuracy of the methods was assessed by recovery studies {{was found to be}} 100. 02 ± 0. 467 and 99. 87 ± 0. 532 for simultaneous equation method and 99. 82 ± 0. 483 and 99. 84 ± 0. 512 for Q analysis (absorption ratio) method for Paracetamol and <b>Zaltoprofen</b> respectively. These methods are simple, accurate and rapid; those require no preliminary separation and can therefore b...|$|E

40|$|<b>Zaltoprofen</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAIDs) and has powerful inhibitory {{effects on}} acute and chronic inflammation with less adverse reactions on the gastrointestinal tract than other NSAIDs. The main objective {{of this study was}} to formulate and evaluate fast disintegrating tablets of <b>zaltoprofen</b> (ZPF) prepared by direct compression method using super-disintegrants with a view to enhance patient compliance. Two different super-disintegrants, such as crospovidone and sodium starch glycolate were used in different ratio (2 - 8 % w/w). FTIR study reveals that there is no drug-excipients interaction between ZPF and excipients. The DSC/PXRD study revealed that the crystallinity of <b>zaltoprofen</b> was significantly reduced to amorphous. The dissolution study was carried out in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer solution. It was observed that the tablets with 8 % of crospovidone showed satisfactory results with disintegration time of 24 sec, wetting time of 10 sec and highest dissolution rate (100. 89 %) in 15 min. It can be concluded that superdisintegrant, crospovidone showed better disintegrating time, wetting time and dissolution property than the sodium starch glycolate in the formulation of fast disintegrating tablets...|$|E

40|$|<b>Zaltoprofen</b> is a non steroidal anti {{inflammatory}} {{class of}} drug which has excellent effect on post-surgeryor post trauma chronic {{inflammation of the}} drug. So, <b>Zaltoprofen</b> {{may serve as a}} potent and superioranalgesic for the treatment of pain. <b>Zaltoprofen</b> has the dose of 80 mg three times a day which reducepatient compliance. For that in this present study, an attempt has been made to prepare the controlledrelease CPOP tablet twice a day. An inclusion complex was prepared by kneading method using HP-β-CD in order to increase solubility of the poorly water soluble drug. Then, this complex is used forpreparing the tablet with accessorial material. CPOP tablet containing <b>Zaltoprofen</b> were prepared bydirect compression method by using various osmotic agent like sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride,mannitol and potassium carbonate. Cellulose acetate, Sorbitol and Poly Ethylene Glycol 400 wereselected for coating materials, and acetone: methanol (65 : 35) co-solvent was employed as the coatingmedium with 3 % and 5 % weight gain. Initially compatibility study was carried out using DSC and FTIRSpectrometric method. The blend was examined for pre-compression parameters like angle of repose,density, compressibility index and Hausner’s ratio. Formulated tablet also passes the various tabletparameters like hardness, friability, drug content, weight variation. From the result of in-vitro drugrelease study it was observed that as the amount of osmotic agent increased, amount of drug releaseincreased. Also increased in % weight gain decreased the % drug release. Batch Z 4 containing sodiumbicarbonate as osmotic agent has shown 98. 08 % drug release compare to other batches so, accepted asoptimized batch. The above optimized batch Z 4 was also evaluated by different pharmacokinetic modelslike Zero order, First order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer Peppas, and Hixson Crowell model.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} work was to {{investigate}} the inclusion complexation of <b>zaltoprofen</b> (ZPF), a water insoluble drug, with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) in order to improve solubility and dissolution rate of the drug in an attempt to enhance its bioavailability. The complex of ZPF/ β-CD (1 : 1) was characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, solubility and dissolution studies. According to the DSC/PXRD data, no endothermic and characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to ZPF were observed for the inclusion complex, suggesting that, crystallinity of <b>zaltoprofen</b> was reduced. FTIR study revealed that there was no drug-polymer interaction between ZPF and β-CD. The complex ZPF/β-CD (1 : 1) exhibited higher dissolution rate than that of pure drug and physical mixture in both pH 6. 8 and pH 7. 4 buffer solutions. The aqueous solubility of the complex increased to about 150 and 145 folds in pH 6. 8 and pH 7. 4 buffer, respectively with that of pure ZPF. In conclusion, complexation method proved to be the better alternative for the solubility enhancement of poorly water soluble drugs...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{spectrophotometric}} {{methods are}} presented for the simultaneous estimation of <b>Zaltoprofen</b> (ZLT) and Paracetamol (PAR) in laboratory prepared mixture and {{pharmaceutical dosage form}} without prior separation. Method (1) is simultaneous equation method (Vierodt’s method); which depends {{on the fact that}} absorbance of a mixture is the sum of the individual absorbance of the components. Method (2) is Q-Absorbance ratio method, which depends upon the fact that, the ratio of absorbance at any two wavelengths is a constant value independent of concentration or path length. Absorbances are measured at two wavelengths one being the λ max of ZLT (227. 5 nm) and other being a wavelength of equal absorptivity of the two components (236 nm). Calibration curve of the two methods are linear over the concentration ranges of 4 - 9 μg/ml and 8 - 13 μg/ml for PAR (247. 5 nm) and ZLT respectively. The two methods proved to be simple specific, accurate and precise. Solvent used is HPLC grade methanol.

40|$|Purpose: In {{the present}} study, we have {{formulated}} <b>zaltoprofen</b> loaded, surface decorated, biodegradable gelatin nanogel and evaluated its texture characterization. Methods: The method used to prepare gelatin nanoparticles (GNP) was ‘two step desolvation’ and its surface decoration was performed with oleic acid (OA). The GNP was optimized by DOE software. Nanogels were evaluated for particle size entrapment efficiency, texture properties, SEM, in-vitro, ex-vivo drug release studies, in-vitro characterization, stability and in vivo evaluation of nanogel for anti-inflammatory activity {{was carried out}} by carrageenan induced rat paw edema method as an anti-inflammatory experimental model. Results: The formulated GNP with particle size and entrapment efficiency of optimized batch was found to be 247. 1 nm and 76. 21 % respectively. The SEM of GNP shows smooth and spherical shape. In-vitro and Ex-vivo drug release shows that there was 69. 47 % and 78. 59 % drug released within 48 hrs. It follows Ritger peppas model, which indicates sustained drug release. The good texture properties of nanogel were observed from texture analysis graphs. In vivo studies of our formulation give significant results compared to the marketed nanogel. Stability data revealed stability of nanogel formulation up to 3 months. Conclusion: The present approach can provide us promising results of the sustained analgesic activity and the stability of drug within the GNP...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, mixed-solvency {{approach}} has been applied for the enhancement of aqueous solubility of a poorly water- soluble drug, <b>zaltoprofen</b> (selected as a model drug), by making blends (keeping total concentrations 40 % w/v, constant) of selected water-soluble substances from among the hydrotropes (urea, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate, nicotinamide); water-soluble solids (PEG- 4000, PEG- 6000); and co-solvents (propylene glycol, glycerine, PEG- 200, PEG- 400, PEG- 600). Aqueous solubility of drug in case of selected blends (12 blends) ranged from 9. 091 ± 0. 011 [*]mg/ml– 43. 055 ± 0. 14 [*]mg/ml (as compared to the solubility in distilled water 0. 072 ± 0. 012 [*]mg/ml). The enhancement in the solubility of drug in a mixed solvent containing 10 % sodium citrate, 5 % sodium benzoate and 25 % S cosolvent (25 % S cosolvent contains PEG 200, PEG 400, PEG 600, Glycerine and Propylene glycol) was more than 600 fold. This proved a synergistic enhancement in solubility of a poorly water-soluble drug due to mixed cosolvent effect. Each solubilized product was characterized by ultraviolet and infrared techniques. Various properties of solution such as pH, viscosity, specific gravity and surface tension were studied. The developed formulation was studied for physical and chemical stability.
