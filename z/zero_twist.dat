40|$|A {{measure for}} the twist of Gaussian light is {{expressed}} in terms of the second-order moments of the Wigner distribution function. The propagation law for these second-order moments between the input plane and the output plane of a first-order optical system is used to express the twist in one plane in terms of moments in the other plane. Although in general the twist in one plane is determined not only by the twist in the other plane, but also by other combinations of the moments, several special cases are considered for which a direct relationship between the twists can be formulated. In particular it is shown under what conditions <b>zero</b> <b>twist</b> is preserved in a first-order optical system. ...|$|E

These equations are linearized about an equilibrium condition to study the flap-lag stability characteristics of hingeless helicopter rotor blades with <b>zero</b> <b>twist</b> and uniform mass and stiffness in the hovering flight condition. The results indicate that these configurations are stable because the effect of elastic coupling more than compensates for the destabilizing flap-lag Coriolis and aerodynamic coupling. The effect of higher bending modes on the lead-lag damping {{was found to be}} small and the common, centrally hinged, spring restrained, rigid blade approximation for elastic rotor blades was shown to be resonably satisfactory for determining flap-lag stability. The effect of pre-cone was generally stabilizing and the effects of rotary inertia were negligible...|$|E
40|$|Chiral {{polymers}} are {{ubiquitous in}} nature and in the cellular context they are often found in association with membranes. Here we show that surface bound polymers with an intrinsic twist and anisotropic bending stiffness can exhibit a sharp continuous phase transition between states with very different effective persistence lengths as the binding affinity is increased. Above a critical value for the binding strength, determined solely by the torsional modulus and intrinsic twist rate, the filament can exist in a <b>zero</b> <b>twist,</b> surface bound state with a homogeneous stiffness. Below the critical binding strength, twist walls proliferate and function as weak or floppy joints that sharply reduce the effective persistence length that is measurable on long lengthscales. The existence of such dramatically different conformational states has implications for both biopolymer function in vivo and for experimental observations of such filaments in vitro.

40|$|Beam {{parameters}} of the free-electron laser FLASH @ 13. 5 nm in two different operation modes were determined from beam profile measurements and subsequent reconstruction of the Wigner distribution function behind the ellipsoidal focusing mirror at beamline BL 2. 40 two-dimensional single pulse intensity distributions were recorded at each of 65 axial positions around the waist of the FEL beam with a magnifying EUV sensitized CCD camera. From these beam profile data the Wigner distribution function based on different levels of averaging could be reconstructed by an inverse Radon transform. For separable beams this yields the complete Wigner distribution, and for beams with <b>zero</b> <b>twist</b> the information is still sufficient for wavefront determination and beam propagation through stigmatic systems.

40|$|We {{consider}} the phase diagram of twisted mass Wilson fermions of two-flavor QCD in the parameter {{space of the}} quark mass, the isospin chemical potential, the twist angle and the lattice spacing. This work extends earlier studies in the continuum and those at zero chemical potential. We evaluate the phase diagram {{as well as the}} spectrum of the (pseudo-) Goldstone bosons using the chiral Lagrangian for twisted mass Wilson fermions at non-zero isospin chemical potential. The phases are obtained from a mean field analysis. At <b>zero</b> <b>twist</b> angle we find that already an infinitesimal isospin chemical potential destroys the Aoki phase. The reason is that in this phase we have massless Goldstone bosons with a non-zero isospin charge. At finite twist angle only two different phases are present, one phase which is continuously connected to the Bose condensed phase at non-zero chemical potential and another phase which is continuously connected to the normal phase. For either zero or maximal twist the phase diagram is more complicated as the saddle point equations allow for more solutions. Comment: 39 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} studies of helical Bacillus subtilis macrofibers reveal that a {{spectrum}} of twisted states exists ranging from tight left-handed structures with twist equal to approximately equal to 40 left turns per mm to tight right-handed structures with twist equal to 57 right turns per mm. In the lytic-deficient strain FJ 7, twist varies {{as a function of}} growth temperature above or below 39 degrees C, where there is <b>zero</b> <b>twist.</b> The relationship between the temperature (below 39 degrees C) at which right-hand structures are produced to the time it takes for them to begin the inversion process in which they become left-handed following transfer to 48 degrees C reveals that structures with less twist are more rapidly converted to left-handedness than are those with higher values of twist. The initial response of live macrofibers to digestion by lysozyme consists of "relaxation" motions in which the twist of both left- and right-handed structures changes towards the right-hand end of the spectrum. The rate of relaxation is approximately equal to 5 -fold higher at the left-hand end than at the right-hand end. These findings suggest that cell wall polymers can assume a range of structural states during helical growth and that these determine the quantitative aspects of macrofiber shape as well as the sensitivity of walls to attack by lysozyme...|$|E

40|$|The exact {{shape of}} the {{deformed}} internal oblique crack in an infinite elastic plate under conditions of plane stress was studied. The Muskhelishvili potential function yielded the exact stress and displacement field around the crack. While in previous papers by the author the study was mainly concerned with {{the definition of the}} in-plane {{shape of the}} deformed crack and important properties were disclosed concerning especially the contribution of the shear loading of the crack, in this paper the out-of-plane component of displacements is determined and its influence on the exact shape of the deformed crack in space is presented. It is shown that, as soon as shear displacements appear in the cracked plate under plane stress, out-of-plane shear displacements are a compulsory consequence for plane-stress conditions of the plate. The elliptic form of the deformed internal crack was twisted out of the plane of the plate with its <b>zero</b> <b>twisting</b> displacement near the new crack tip of its deformed shape corresponding to the vertex of the ellipse. The points of maximum and minimum out-of-plane displacements were placed close to the vertices of the ellipse at polar angles, θ, depending only on the eccentricity of the ellipse and displaced always {{on both sides of the}} vertices. The compulsory coexistence of mode II and mode III deformations makes the internal crack in plane stress to present a complicated pattern of deformation at its deformed crack tips. All of these results are amply supported by experimental evidence with caustics, which always show either a simple mode I pattern or a complex mode II and III pattern as soon as shear interferes in the mode of deformation of the plate. © 1987 Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc...|$|R

The morphing blade {{is designed to}} actively twist {{as a means of}} alleviating the gust loads which reduce the fatigue life of wind turbine blades. The morphing structure exploits an elastic strain energy balance within the blade to enable large twisting deformations with modest actuation requirements. While twist is introduced using the warping of the blade skin, internal pre-stressed members ensure that a constant strain energy balance is achieved throughout the deformation, resulting in a zero torsional stiffness structure. The torsional stability of the morphing blade is characterized by analysing the elastic strain energy in the device. Analytical models of the skin, the pre-stressed components and the complete blade are compared to their respective finite element models as well as experimental results.
