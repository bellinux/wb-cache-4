50|$|<b>Zitting</b> <b>cisticolas</b> {{are very}} small insectivorous birds, {{sometimes}} found in small groups. The breeding season {{is associated with the}} rains. Two broods a year occur in many regions. Males are polygynous but some are monogamous the male builds the initial nest structure deep in the grasses, and invites females using a special display. Females that accept the male complete the nest. The nest is made by binding living leaves into the soft fabric of felted plant-down, cobwebs, and grass. The <b>zitting</b> <b>cisticola's</b> nest is a cup shape with a canopy of tied-together leaves or grasses overhead for camouflage; 3-6 eggs are laid. The female incubates the egg. The eggs hatch after about 10 days. More than one brood may be raised. Females change their mates frequently and rarely stay within the same territory, while males are less mobile. Females can sometimes breed in their first year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{seasonal}} wetlands on {{the floodplain}} regularly support {{large numbers of}} waterbirds. Numerically important duck species include hardhead, grey teal and plumed whistling duck. The lagoons are also an important site for shorebirds: several thousand little curlews and Oriental pratincoles, and hundreds of wood sandpipers have been counted. The Parry Lagoons {{are probably the most}} important site in Australia for both wood and marsh sandpipers. When local rainfall is high the lagoons and other seasonal wetlands are major breeding areas for waterbirds in the Kimberley, with up to 77 species recorded in habitats associated with Parry Creek. The grasslands are the only place in Western Australia where <b>zitting</b> <b>cisticolas</b> occur naturally. [...] The mangroves contain 12 of the 13 species of terrestrial bird restricted to such habitat, or to rainforest, in Western Australia, including the black butcherbird. About 200 bird species have been recorded from the site.|$|R
50|$|This family {{probably}} {{originated in}} Africa, {{which has the}} majority of species, but there are representatives of the family across tropical Asia into Australasia, and one species, the <b>zitting</b> <b>cisticola,</b> even breeds in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{very similar}} in {{appearance}} to the <b>zitting</b> <b>cisticola</b> [...] - [...] however, in the breeding season males acquire a breeding plumage in which their head, throat and breast are a bright golden-orange colour, and their tails become shorter than in winter-plumage.|$|E

50|$|Male cisticolas are polygamous. The female {{builds a}} {{discreet}} nest {{deep in the}} grasses, often binding living leaves into the soft fabric of felted plant down, cobweb, and grass: a cup shape for the <b>zitting</b> <b>cisticola</b> with a canopy of tied-together leaves or grasses overhead for camouflage, a full dome for the golden-headed cisticola. The average clutch is about 4 eggs, which take about 2 weeks to hatch. The parasitic weaver is a specialist parasite of cisticolas and prinias.|$|E
50|$|The <b>zitting</b> <b>cisticola</b> is brown above, heavily {{streaked}} with black markings. The underparts are whitish, and the tail is broad, white-tipped and flicked frequently, {{giving rise to}} the alternative name for the species. The adult males have less crown streaking and more back marking than the females, {{but there are no}} great difference between the sexes or the eighteen geographical races. The absence of a nuchal collar separate it from Cisticola exilis. In the non-breeding season, they tend to skulk within the grass and can be hard to spot.|$|E
50|$|The Madagascan cisticola (Cisticola cherina) is {{a species}} of bird in the cisticola family (Cisticolidae). It forms a {{superspecies}} with the closely related <b>zitting</b> <b>cisticola</b> and the Socotra cisticola.It is found across the whole of Madagascar and the islands of Astove and Cosmoledo in the Seychelles. The Seychelles birds are suspected to be recent arrivals, {{although there are some}} early records of the species there. Within its range it occupies a range of open habitats, including savannah, grasslands, marshes, pastures, scrublands and forest edges and clearings. It is also found in a variety of human modified habitats, including paddy fields and croplands. The species is sedentary.|$|E

A small bird found mainly in grasslands, it is best identified by its rufous rump; as well, it lacks any gold on the collar and the brownish tail is tipped with white. During the breeding season, males have a zigzagging flight display accompanied by regular [...] "zitting" [...] calls that have been likened to repeated snips of a scissor. They build their pouch nest suspended within a clump of grass.|$|E
