50|$|The cell {{was set up}} in a long-necked {{glass bottle}} with a <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> located between two carbon plates. The {{electrolyte}} and depolarizer were mixed. The mixture would dissolve the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> even when the cell was not in use, so there was a mechanism for lifting the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> out of the liquid and storing it in the neck of the bottle.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} and innovation {{of this process}} over lithography {{was the use of}} <b>zinc</b> <b>plates</b> rather than stone ones. <b>Zinc</b> <b>plates</b> were lighter and easier to transport, could produce more prints, and were far less brittle than the stone plates originally used.

It is also the only one not to use electric arc furnaces, instead relying on iron ore and coal to produce a special type of steel that welds more easily and is thus suitable for making sheet metal. There are two processing plants; five furnaces, including two that run constantly; two steelworks, one of which always runs; three lines for constant casting; a hot rolling machine and a cold roll one; two sheet metal rollers; and a <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> line.|$|E
50|$|Zinc-Nickel plating {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{corrosion}} resistant finishes available offering over 5 times the protection of conventional <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> and up to 1,500 hours of Neutral Salt Spray test performance. This plating is a combination of a High Nickel Zinc-Nickel alloy (10% - 15% nickel) and some variation of chromate. The most common mixed chromates include Hexavalent Iridescent, Trivalent or Black Trivalent Chromate. Used to protect steel, cast iron, brass, copper, and other materials, this acidic plating is an environmentally safe option. Hexavalent Chromate has been classified as a human carcinogen by the EPA and OSHA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>plating</b> was {{developed}} and continues to evolve, to meet the most challenging corrosion protection, temperature and wear resistance requirements. Electroplating of zinc was invented in 1800 but the first bright deposits were not obtained until the early 1930s with the alkaline cyanide electrolyte. Much later, in 1966, the use of acid chloride baths improved the brightness even greater. The latest modern development occurred in the 1980s, with {{the new generation of}} alkaline, cyanide-free zinc. Recent European Union directives (ELV/RoHS/WEEE) prohibit automotive, other original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and electrical and electronic equipment manufacturers from using hexavalent chromium (CrVI). These directives combined with increased performance requirements by the OEM, has led to an increase in the use of alkaline zinc, zinc alloys and high performance trivalent passionate conversion coatings.|$|E

5000|$|The Gleaner {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} in {{self-propelled}} combines. They were often considered the [...] "Cadillac" [...] of the industry because of this feature and because of their sound engineering. Buescher (1991) credited the design principally to one of the brothers, Curt Baldwin, and explained that it focused on the needs of custom cutters like the Baldwin brothers themselves—contractors who move north with the harvest season, selling harvesting services to farmers. It resulted in machines that were extraordinarily reliable and useful, which benefited not only custom cutters but anyone who bought a Gleaner. The short wheelbase and axle track allowed the combine to fit on a truck. The grain header {{did not need to be}} detached for transit, because it fit over the cab of the truck. Buescher said, [...] "Since custom cutters didn't know where their next parts supply source would be, Baldwin designed his combine so that it wouldn't need parts." [...] (Buescher's tongue-in-cheek point is that the machines were designed and built well so that need for repairs would be minimal.) The frame was [...] "like a bridge" [...] in its strength. The bearings were chosen with service in mind—large and good quality (to obviate service) and of common sizes (so that the operator could carry merely a small stock of spares in his truck and yet be certain to have the size he needed when a replacement did become necessary). The Gleaner's exterior sheet metal was galvanized (zinc plated), giving it weather resistance superior to that of typical farm equipment, which was painted but not plated. As Buescher said, [...] "Baldwin reasoned that most of his combines would sit outdoors. Texas and Oklahoma dust storms have a way of peeling paint off of machinery." [...] As a result of the silver color of the <b>zinc</b> <b>plating,</b> the Gleaner brand ended up having a distinctive color (just as Allis had Persian Orange, IH had red, and John Deere had green), despite the sheet metal not even having any paint.|$|E
