50|$|<b>Zuclomifene</b> (INN), or zuclomiphene (USAN), is a nonsteroidal {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene {{group that}} was never marketed. It {{is one of the}} two stereoisomers of clomifene, which itself is a non-racemic mixture of 38% <b>zuclomifene</b> and 62% enclomifene. <b>Zuclomifene</b> is the (Z)-enantiomer of clomifene, while enclomifene is the (E)-enantiomer. Whereas <b>zuclomifene</b> is described as mildly estrogenic, enclomifene is described as antiestrogenic. In accordance, unlike enclomifene, <b>zuclomifene</b> is antigonadotropic due to activation of the estrogen receptor and is able to reduce testosterone levels in men to near-castrate levels. It is also about 5 times more potent than enclomifene in inducing ovulation.|$|E
50|$|Enclomifene acts by antagonizing the {{estrogen}} receptor in the pituitary gland, {{which reduces}} negative feedback by estrogen on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, thereby increasing gonadotropin secretion and hence gonadal production of testosterone. It {{is one of}} the two stereoisomers of clomifene, which itself is a non-racemic mixture of 38% <b>zuclomifene</b> and 62% enclomifene. Enclomifene is the (E)-enantiomer of clomifene, while <b>zuclomifene</b> is the (Z)-enantiomer. Whereas <b>zuclomifene</b> is more estrogenic, enclomifene is more antiestrogenic. In accordance, unlike enclomifene, <b>zuclomifene</b> is antigonadotropic due to activation of the estrogen receptor and is able to reduce testosterone levels in men to near-castrate levels. As such, enantiopure enclomifene is more favorable than clomifene as a progonadotropin for the treatment of male hypogonadism.|$|E

50|$|Clomifene is a triphenylethylene derivative. It is {{a mixture}} of two {{geometric}} isomers, enclomifene ((E)-clomifene) and <b>zuclomifene</b> ((Z)-clomifene). These two isomers have been found to contribute to the mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties of clomifene.|$|E
50|$|Clomifene is a nonsteroidal SERM that {{inhibits}} estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, inhibiting {{negative feedback}} of estrogen on gonadotropin release, leading to up-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. <b>Zuclomifene,</b> {{a more active}} isomer, stays bound {{for longer periods of}} time.|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of estrogen}} (E) modulation of retinol-binding protein (RBP) {{production in the}} liver of immature chicks were compared with those governing de novo induction of riboflavin carrier protein (RCP) in the same tissue. A single dose of E markedly enhanced the plasma levels of RBP without any detectable lag period to reach peak value by 24 h and {{this was followed by}} a decline to attain the baseline by 4 days. There was no amplification of the response during secondary stimulation unlike the case with RCP induction. With multiple E administration, the 4 -fold increased plasma RBP concentrations were sustained at a steady state during both primary and secondary stimulations, whereas concomitant RCP concentration progressively increased with each hormone administration and this response was further amplified during secondary stimulation. Unlike RCP induction, enhanced RBP accumulation was not strictly E dose dependent although a minimal threshold level of the steroid was required to elicit measurable response. Progesterone (P) could neither modulate nor substitute for E in enhancing plasma levels of either of the 2 proteins while the anti-estrogens, en- and <b>zuclomifene</b> citrate severely suppressed the production of both the proteins. RCP induction was completely inhibited by both α-amanitin and cycloheximide for prolonged periods while E-stimulated RBP production was affected only partially by α-amanitin. Likewise, cycloheximide inhibition of RBP accumulation followed a pattern similar to that of hepatic general protein synthesis...|$|E
