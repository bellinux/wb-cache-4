5|$|In July 2017, Square Enix {{released}} Final Fantasy XII: The <b>Zodiac</b> Age, a high-definition remaster of the Japanese-only International <b>Zodiac</b> Job System for the PlayStation 4. The <b>Zodiac</b> Age adds trophy support, a remastered soundtrack {{with a few}} new tracks, {{and improved}} technical performance.|$|E
5|$|Within Final Fantasy Tactics, legends {{revolve around}} the <b>Zodiac</b> Brave Story, which deals with twelve knights who used the power of <b>Zodiac</b> Stones—magical stones {{engraved}} with symbols of the twelve <b>Zodiac</b> constellations—to fight against a demon summoned by an ambitious king to control Ivalice. This myth was twisted by the Glabados Church, as explained in the game's backstory, by including St. Ajora {{as the leader of}} the <b>Zodiac</b> Braves.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury <b>Zodiac,</b> a purported astrological <b>zodiac</b> of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the <b>zodiac</b> was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the <b>zodiac</b> was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Downey {{appeared}} in David Fincher's mystery thriller <b>Zodiac,</b> {{which was based}} on a true story. He played the role of San Francisco Chronicle journalist Paul Avery, who was reporting the <b>Zodiac</b> Killer case.|$|E
5|$|Ramza is chased {{throughout}} the story by the Shrine Knights, {{the soldiers of}} the Church who are hunting the <b>Zodiac</b> Stones, although he gains allies, either by saving their lives, or by showing them the truth. Some individuals {{with knowledge of the}} <b>Zodiac</b> Stones attempt to conspire with the Shrine Knights for its power, though most fail. Ramza also acquires proof of the Church's lies about Saint Ajora, a central figure in the religion, and attempts to use it along with the <b>Zodiac</b> Stone to reveal the organization's plot.|$|E
5|$|The Korean <b>zodiac</b> is {{identical}} to the Chinese one. The Vietnamese <b>zodiac</b> is almost identical to Chinese <b>zodiac</b> except the second animal is the Water Buffalo instead of the Ox, and the fourth animal is the Cat instead of the Rabbit. The Japanese have since 1873 celebrated the beginning of the new year on 1 January as per the Gregorian Calendar. The Thai <b>zodiac</b> begins, not at Chinese New Year, but either {{on the first day of}} fifth month in the Thai lunar calendar, or during the Songkran festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.|$|E

5|$|Designed by Burges for himself, the <b>Zodiac</b> settle was {{originally}} placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on The Strand in London, and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878, when Burges first occupied the house. The Tower House {{was designed by}} Burges by himself. Burges continued to work on Tower House {{until his death in}} 1881, and the <b>Zodiac</b> settle was placed opposite the drawing room windows in Tower House. The decoration of the drawing room remained unfinished upon Burges's death. The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges's brother-in-law, Pullan, and then by Colonel T.H. Minshall in the 1920s. Minshall offered the <b>Zodiac</b> settle and other items from Tower House for sale in 1933, but the settle remained unsold.|$|E

5|$|Graysmith {{first met}} Fischer and Vanderbilt at {{the premiere of}} Paul Schrader's film, Auto Focus, {{which was based on}} Graysmith's 1991 book about {{the life and death of}} actor Bob Crane. A deal was made and they optioned the rights to <b>Zodiac</b> and <b>Zodiac</b> Unmasked when they became {{available}} after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. David Fincher was their first choice to direct based on his work on Seven. Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia (later filmed by Brian De Palma), and envisioned a five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars. When that fell through, Fincher left that project and moved on to <b>Zodiac.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax {{question}} Arthur Leigh Allen, {{a suspect}} in the Vallejo case. Allen behaves suspiciously during the interview. They ask to see his watch and notice that he wears a <b>Zodiac</b> brand wristwatch which has the same logo used by the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write the <b>Zodiac</b> letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming increasingly paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares information with the Riverside Police Department, angering both Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is bothered when Graysmith shows up at the theater where Toschi is watching a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on the <b>Zodiac</b> case, with his wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the <b>Zodiac</b> murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where <b>Zodiac</b> murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a <b>Zodiac</b> letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the <b>Zodiac,</b> and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E

5|$|James Vanderbilt {{had read}} Robert Graysmith's book <b>Zodiac</b> in 1986 while in high school. Years later, after {{becoming}} a screenwriter, {{he got the}} opportunity to meet Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the <b>Zodiac</b> Killer. He then decided to try to translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt had endured bad experiences in the past, in which the endings of his scripts had been changed, and wanted to have more control over the material this time. He pitched his adaptation of <b>Zodiac</b> to Mike Medavoy and Bradley J. Fischer from Phoenix Pictures, by agreeing to write a spec script if he could have more creative control over it.|$|E

In an audio transmission sent shortly before the MV Samoud was intercepted, he said:"At 4.20(am local time) (11.20am Sydney time) we realised all communications on the boat were jammed, 4.22 (am) - we see two <b>zodiacs</b> moving in, pressing through.
