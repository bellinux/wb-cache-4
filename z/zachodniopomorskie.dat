50|$|Reportedly, Poland's well-off {{cities are}} Warsaw, Kraków, Wrocław, and Poznań, {{and the ones}} {{struggling}} with less investment are in the northeast: Rzeszów, Lublin, Olsztyn and Białystok. However, current unemployment statistics for Poland in general fail to show that distinction but indicate an opposite trend in recent years, with the northwest reporting rates of unemployment higher than east-central Poland. In 2014, {{among the highest in}} the nation were the Kujawsko-Pomorskie and <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> (compare the historic railroad map and the administrative map, right, with the 2014 unemployment map, from business portal eGospodarka.pl); while among the lowest in the country was the east-central Mazowieckie.|$|E

Some of Polish administrative units include area of internal waters (8 communes in voivodeship <b>zachodniopomorskie,</b> 2 communes in Pomerania Voivodeship and 3 communes in Warmia-Mazuria Voivodeship). In Poland, there are 2005 km2 of internal waters, but only 791 km2 of it are included in administrative units according to the coast line definition. That is why the administrative area of Poland isn’t {{the same as the}} area of Poland. By common convention 312679 km2 is called the (total) area of Poland in encyclopedias and other sources.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, {{after the}} GDR {{communist}} system was overthrown, {{the state of}} Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was recreated, with Vorpommern being a non-administrative region. The districts Vorpommern-Rügen and Vorpommern-Greifswald constitute most of the German part of former Pomerania, but these districts also contain some former Mecklenburgian territory, and {{a small part of}} former Pomerania is now part of Brandenburg. Due to this, the old Pomeranian border disappeared from the map and today is only prevailed by the border of the Pomeranian Evangelical Church. The part of the province of Pomerania which had become Polish was re-organized as Szczecin Voivodeship after the war, from which the eastern part was split off as Koszalin Voivodeship in 1950. Słupsk Voivodeship was split off from this voivodeship in 1975, there were also territorial exchanges with neighboring voivodeships. Since 1999, the area of the former province of Pomerania is included in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship (<b>Zachodniopomorskie,</b> bulk) and Pomeranian Voivodeship (western part around Słupsk, formerly Stolp).|$|E

40|$|The area of <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> {{voivodship}} {{is characterized}} by specific features, resulting from its position in space. The location of the regional capital Szczecin {{at the mouth of}} the River Odra and near the Polish-German border, in the close vicinity of well-developed Nordic countries, and on the outskirts of the region creates special conditions for development. At the same time, the considerable remoteness of most small towns from the capital region and the inadequate network of connections in a natural North-South direction make it difficult to work with the assets of larger centres of development like Szczecin and Koszalin. The present approach is based on Webb’s typology for the gminas of <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> voivodship compared with the analysis of the characteristics of the transportation network. Traffic volume of real transportation network was simulated by using a model based on the idea of intervening opportunities. Two categories of movements were analysed: movements to work and, due to the specificity of the region, tourists’ movements...|$|E

40|$|The study {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} determinants of agricultural development. Based on a survey conducted among farm owners in the <b>zachodniopomorskie</b> voivodeship, {{it was confirmed that}} the development of the farm is, to a large extent, conditioned by external factors. It depends in particular on the agricultural policy run by the state. Internal factors related to the attitudes of farmers to changes in the structure of farms have relatively little importance. ...|$|E

Demographic processes argue for the necessity of systematic research on population changes and their consequences, especially for labour resources, as well as formulation of new regional policies that give proper weight to human factors. Heterogeneity of demographic processes in Poland throughout the postwar period has led to interregional differences in the demographic situation. The area marked by the population phenomena as not having a precedent in the demographic phenomenology was an area of so-called reclaimed lands, which includes four voivodships: opolskie, dolno l skie, lubuskie and <b>zachodniopomorskie...</b>|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to analyse and asses spatial {{diversity}} and seasonality of unemployment rate on labour market in selected seaside districts (rural, urban and rural-urban) in the <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> voivodeship in Poland. The following thesis was formulated: the location of the examined districts in the coastal zone determines their nature tourism and similar behaviour in the observed seasonal unemployment changes. Seasonal changes of the monthly unemployment rate were studied in the period 2001 [...] 2012. Data from the Central Statistical Office, Regional Data Bank and the Regional Labour Office in Szczecin were used in research process. The results confirm the authors’ assumptions about a relatively high sensitivity of the surveyed markets to seasonal changes, which is determined by the tourist nature of the area of the surveyed districts. There is no reason to assess that all the coastal districts react in a similar way. It has been observed that rural markets are more sensitive to seasonal unemployment changes in relation to the urban markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{is based on}} the materials published by the Statistical Office in Szczecin for 2000 - 14, presented on a monthly basis, concerning the total number of tourists (including foreign tourists) and the overnight stays. The distribution of the number of tourists and their accommodation per month and season was correlated with mean monthly values for air temperature, cloudiness and wind speed. Meteorological data for the period 2000 - 14, as averaged for the whole voivodeship, was obtained from four IMGW stations (Świnoujście, Koszalin, Szczecin and Szczecinek). Statistical analysis was conducted and time trends of the number of tourists and overnight stays were identified for individual months with the use of linear and polynomial regression. The seasonal nature of tourist flows was assessed by the number of tourists and accommodation provided for tourists in summer compared to winter, and spring to autumn. Air temperature and cloudiness were found to have the greatest effect on the uneven distribution of tourist numbers across a year. Each year, approximately 1. 7 million tourists visit <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> Voivodeship, 1. 1 million of which (i. e. 66 %) stay on the coast...|$|E
40|$|In Poland, farmers rely {{primarily}} on cooperative banks for agricultural credit. Therefore, the paper attempt {{is to examine}} the impact of agricultural credits disbursed by the cooperative banks on regional development of agricultural sector in Poland over 1997 - 2006. Sources of data include financial statements of the banks (1373 observations) providing credit-related information and sectoral background data for agriculture from Central Statistical Office of Poland. The levels of agricultural development were assessed using a nation-level and regional-level composite indicators constructed by the author by the use of factor analysis. Additionally, one-factor ANOVA, Pearson correlations and linear regression were applied. There was found, that the most prosperous agricultural regions include wielkopolskie, <b>zachodniopomorskie</b> and warminsko-mazurskie, the least prosperous malopolskie, podkarpackie, slaskie and swietokrzyskie voivodships. Results of econometric analysis suggest also that region of bank’s activity has statistically significant impact both on agricultural credit and agricultural development levels. In Poland as a whole, farm credits provided by cooperative banks stimulate development of agriculture but only in two of sixteen regions (voivodships) their impact was positive and statistically significant. The average farm size and agricultural employment were found to be strongest in influencing agricultural development. cooperative banks, agriculture, regional development, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) specific antibodies in ruminants from 13 Polish provinces, sampled between January 2010 and August 2013. A total number of 1813 serum samples from cattle, sheep, goats, mouflon, wild and farmed cervids, and European bison were tested by ELISA for viral nucleoprotein antibodies. First SBV seropositive animals were identified in August 2012 (1. 6 %), and the percentage increased gradually, reaching 57. 1 % in December of this year. The proportion of seropositive animals in 2013 at the level of 34. 2 % increased tenfold in comparison to 2012 (3. 4 %), which was particularly significant at the level of individual provinces. In 2013, the highest percentages of SBV seropositive animals were found in Dolnoslaskie (92. 3 %), Podlaskie (82. 3 %), and <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> (80. 9 %) provinces. Significant associations between the seroprevalence and province of origin, month, ruminant species, and insect vector activity were found, while no dependence of animal age on seropositivity was observed. The differences between SBV seropositive large and small ruminants suggested the involvement of some vector exposure factors, which needs to be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Poland and Belarus are {{bordering}} {{countries that}} participate in two divergent integration processes: Poland joins the European Union, while Belarus integrates with the Russian Federation. These integration processes have had varied {{impacts on the}} development of the regions in the two countries. Polish regions differ a lot in their inner potential, internal and external factors that have been facilitating or impeding the adjustment to new circumstances. Accession to the EU would bring further challenges to regional economic performance. The impacts of the EU enlargement and the integration with Russia have not been even in Belarusian regions as well. This study presents the comparative analysis of the impact of the broader integration process {{on the development of}} regions in Poland and Belarus. Regional development in Poland Poland has 16 regions that correspond to the EU NUTS II level. In terms of territory the largest are Mazowieckie, Wielkopolskie and <b>Zachodniopomorskie.</b> First in terms of population are Mazowieckie (the capital region, 5. 1 million inhabitants) and Slaskie (Poland’s biggest concentration of old industries, 4. 9 million inhabitants). The smallest in terms of population is the western region, Lubuskie (1 mln. inhabitants). Decentralization reform in 1999 gave regional self-governments full responsibility for economic development of the regions. ...|$|E
40|$|Using the RHOMOLO model, {{the present}} paper {{presents}} first simulation results of analysing the potential impacts of TEN-T projects in five EU Member States: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, Poland and Slovakia for the programming period of ECP (2007 - 2013). Transport infrastructure is incorporated in the model via intra- and inter-regional transport costs, which are sector specific. TEN-T projects improve transport infrastructure, leading {{to a reduction in}} transport costs. Our simulation results suggest that the impact of investments in the TEN-T network in the five countries spread out over time. In the first place, these investments lead to significant reductions in transport costs in the areas where they take place but also in others given the general improvement of the transport network. In the medium and long term however, GDP gains progressively build up, because these investment need time to reach their full impact. Moreover, due to inter-regional spillovers, the positive impact on GDP slowly spreads in space to other neighbouring regions, even to regions where no investment took place (like for instance <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> in north-western Poland). In the end, taking all direct and indirect effects into account, Polish and Hungarian regions gain most from these investments in the TEN-T network.

40|$|A {{total of}} 2668 swabs from poultry (n = 2166), pig (n = 311), and cattle (n = 191) {{carcasses}} {{were collected in}} slaughterhouses all over Poland and tested {{for the presence of}} Campylobacter. It was found that 1319 (49. 4 %) of them were contaminated with these bacteria. The percentages of the positive samples were different in each year of the study and the highest proportion of Campylobacter contaminated samples occurred in 2009, when 64. 1 % of investigated carcasses were positive. On the other hand, the lowest prevalence of Campylobacter was observed in 2013, {{in the last year of}} the survey. In all kind of carcass samples both C. jejuni and C. coli were identified, although the pork meat was more contaminated with C. coli (75. 3 % of positive samples) than with C. jejuni (24. 7 %), whereas poultry was nearly equally positive for C. jejuni and C. coli (50. 6 % and 49. 4 % respectively). The analysis of seasonal contamination of the carcasses revealed that more positive results were found during the second half of year than between January and June. The prevalence of Campylobacter showed that in all provinces, except one (Pomorskie), the mean percentage of the positive samples was above 40 %. The most contaminated samples were identified in Lubelskie (69. 3 %) and <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> (66. 3 %) regions. The obtained results showed that slaughtered animals in Poland, especially broilers, were often contaminated with Campylobacter, either C. jejuni or C. coli...|$|E

Żołnierska 48, 71 - 210 Szczecin, e-mail: mgebska@pum. edu. pl Summary Introduction: The subject of the work is the evaluation of the occupational satisfaction level of physiotherapist. In the available literature, there are few scientific reports assessing the degree of satisfaction of persons performing this profession. The results of the study show what factors affect the level of occupational satisfaction among physiotherapists. Thanks to the analysis it is possible to eliminate negative factors, which contribute to the increase of dissatisfaction with the work performed. Aim: The main aim was to evaluate the professional satisfaction of physiotherapists in the <b>Zachodniopomorskie</b> voivodship. In addition, the relationship between: the physiotherapist's workplace, their remuneration and the ability to perform new rehabilitation techniques and the level of job satisfaction, and whether or not there are factors influencing the level of job satisfaction. Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 100 people (74 women, 26 men) aged 22 to 47 years. The respondents are physically active physiotherapists, inhabitants of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. The study was conducted using the diagnostic survey method and the MSQ Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) was used. Results:The level of professional satisfaction was at a satisfactory level. The main determinants of work were self-fulfillment, self-reliance, ambition and pay. Respondents were less satisfied with working conditions (lack of opportunity for senior management positions and lack of promotion opportunities). The respondents said they were very happy to help others. Conclusions: Professional satisfaction is a key element in the development of a person's attitude towards work. Satisfaction with business and life can only be increased by pointing out and then resolving negative factors. Key words: job satisfaction, physiotherapy, medical staff, work stress, satisfaction, professional burnout...|$|E
