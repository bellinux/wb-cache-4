50|$|Vrata Tunnel (Tunel Vrata) {{is one of}} the {{shortest}} tunnels on the Croatian A6 motorway route. It is only 257 m long and consists of two tunnel tubes. It is located between Oštrovica and Vrata interchanges. The tunnel is tolled within the A6 motorway closed toll collection system. There are no other toll plazas related to use of the tunnel. The tunnel was excavated by Viadukt using New Austrian Tunneling method. The tunnel was originally designed to be 325 m long, but it was shortened due to the landslide on the western portal in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between Paleozoic and carbonate layers.

50|$|The St. Lawrence Estuary is {{characterized}} by a saline front at the eastern tip of Île d'Orléans. The <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between fresh and salt water corresponds to a region of high concentrations of suspended matter causing a zone of maximum turbidity (MTZ) of a length that can vary from 70 to 120 km, depending on the flow of the river. This zone of maximum turbidity is located between Île d'Orléans (salinity greater than 0 PSU) and Île aux Coudres (salinity below 10 PSU). The mechanisms of estuarine circulation associated with this environment make it a privileged site of primary and secondary production which shelters many fish nurseries. High environmental turbidity provides shelter against predators while larvae are maintained under optimum temperature and salinity conditions. Large variations in salinity and turbidity result {{in a wide variety of}} physicochemical conditions and planktonic communities on the river.|$|E

40|$|Background: Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, a {{riverine}} {{species of}} tsetse, {{is the main}} vector of both human and animal trypanosomiasis in Uganda. Successful implementation of vector control will require establishing an appropriate geographical scale for these activities. Population genetics can help {{to resolve this issue}} by characterizing the extent of linkage among apparently isolated groups of tsetse. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted genetic analyses on mitochondrial and microsatellite data accumulated from approximately 1000 individual tsetse captured in Uganda and neighboring regions of Kenya and Sudan. Phylogeographic analyses suggested that the largest scale genetic structure in G. f. fuscipes arose from an historical event that divided two divergent mitochondrial lineages. These lineages are currently partitioned to northern and southern Uganda and co-occur only in a narrow <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> extending across central Uganda. Bayesian assignment tests, which provided evidence for admixture between northern and southern flies at the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and evidence for northerly gene flow across the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> indicated that this structure may be impermanent. On the other hand, microsatellite structure within the southern lineage indicated that gene flow is currently limited between populations in western and southeastern Uganda. Within regions, the average FST between populations separated by less than 100 km was less than, 0. 1. Significant tests of isolation by distance suggested that gene flow is ongoing between neighboring populations an...|$|E

40|$|Allograft {{rejection}} {{processes of}} two taxonomically related sponge species, Polymastia robusta and Polymastia mamillaris, {{have been studied}} at the cellular level. Grafts in parabiosis {{have been made by}} pairing papillae. They were investigated using histology and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. In Polymatia robusta, allografts undergo progressive rejection with adhesion. A few days after grafting, archaeocytes and collencytes migrate toward the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and fall into line on either side of this zone. The narrow space which separates the grafted papillae is progressively filled up with collagen fibers thanks to which the parabionts are firmly held together. Allografts of Polymastia mamillaris never fuse to each other; the specimens are completely and directly rejected. In this species, the cell migration to the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> is not followed by their alignment nor by deposition of a collagen layer. Autografts made in similar conditions succeed in all cases in both species.

Most of the mtDNA diversity of these species was found in populations next to or into the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> where some individuals bore rare mitotypes intermediate between the common mitotypes observed in the allopatric areas of each species. Sequence analysis and tests for mtDNA recombination point to this phenomenon, rather than to recurrent mutation, as the most tenable hypothesis for the origin of these rare mitotypes. From the 10 mitotypes observed, at least 4 would be the product of recombination between 4 of the 5 putative ancestral mitotypes. Tests for cytonuclear disequilibrium and geographical structure of the putative recombinant mitotypes suggest that mtDNA recombination is not frequent and relatively recent on the geological time scale. mtDNA recombination would have been promoted by transient heteroplasmy due to leakage of paternal mtDNA since the Holocene secondary contact between the two species...|$|E

Cluster analysis of distance matrix readily separated reference samples of the phena as well as test samples from near the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> A three-dimensional projection of the specimens onto their first three principal components, together with a discriminant function analysis, served further to elucidate the degree of differentiation among the phena and to confirm that their characteristic differences are maintained even where they occur sympatrically.

We have evaluated proteolysis of the surface-bound protein in the presence and absence of proteinase inhibitors. Our results were: (a) In the presence (but not in the absence) of proteinase inhibitors, proteolysis was confined to sharply marginated zones subjacent to the cells; (b) opsonization of the surface enhanced spreading of the PMN, (c) opsonization diminished the effectiveness of alpha- 1 -proteinase inhibitor (alpha- 1 -PI) and alpha- 2 -macroglobulin as inhibitors of proteolysis of surface-bound protein; (d) anti-oxidants did not alter the effectiveness of alpha- 1 -PI in inhibiting proteolysis of opsonized substrate by PMN; and (e) PMN could restrict entry of alpha- 1 -PI into <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with opsonized surfaces. We conclude that: (a) In the presence of proteinase inhibitors, PMN can express sharply marginated and exclusively pericellular proteolytic activity; (b) locally high proteinase concentrations and/or exclusion of proteinase inhibitors from pericellular microenvironments may be important mechanisms for pericellular matrix degradation by PMN; and (c) these observations may have general relevance to extracellular matrix remodeling by a variety of inflammatory and other cell types...|$|R
