Treatment was offered to 479 moderately dependent smokers (smoking 15 or more cigarettes per day) who had never used <b>Zyban,</b> and who had taken part in a previous NRT trial (the PATCH study). Main outcome measures were point prevalence and continuous abstinence from smoking at 6 and at 12 months. Two hundred and forty were excluded because of medical reasons or prescribing contraindication. Of the remainder (n= 239) only 54 (23 %) made an active quit attempt. Thirty percent (16 / 54) were abstinent at six months, and 22 % (12 / 54) at 12 months (biochemically validated point prevalence rates). Age, socio-economic status, nicotine dependence, and genetic profile appeared to have little impact on success rates, but male quit-attempters were significantly more successful than female (40 % vs. 10 % at 12 months, p< 0. 05).

40|$|Stem or Fusarium wilt {{of sweet}} potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. is an {{important}} disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. batatas in cool temperate regions. Sweet potato farmers in Rockhampton have experienced tuber rots and stem wilts {{in the last two}} years. Laboratory procedures were followed to isolate causal pathogens from affected sweet potato tuber samples taken from Rockhampton, wilted stems from tissue cultured plants and wilted stem in glass house raised planst and test whether these rots and wilts were due to the infection by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. batatas or other pathogens. Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria alternata and Gibberella moniliformis (Fusarium verticillioides) were consistently isolated from affected tubers supplied by farmers, wilted tissue cultured plants and wilted plants grown in the glass house in Gatton. The Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria alternata isolates were from sweet potato tubers and the Gibberella moniliformis (Fusarium verticillioides) isolates were from wilted stems from tissue cultered plants and plants raised in glass house. They were identified and given BRIP accession numbers. Fusarium oxysporium (BRIP 52431) denoted Foxy, Alternaria alternate (BRIP 52557) denoted Aa,. F. verticillioides isolates from tissue culture (BRIP 52428),denoted Fv 1 and F. verticillioide from wilted stems in glass house (BRIP 52430) denoated as Fv 2. The two F. verticillioides isolates Fv 1 and Fv 2 were more virulent in causing stem wilt than Fusarium oxysporium (Foxy) and Alternaria alternate (Aa) isolated from tubers. Inoculation with these isolates and pathogenicity studies on sweet potato cv. NG 7570 in the glass house showed that inoculation of injured stems with agar culture blocks was the most effective method that incited wilt. A. alternata did not cause wilt so was excluded from further tests. Twelve (12) commercial cvs. of sweet potato showed varying degrees of tolerance when screened against the three Fusarium isolates under glasshouse conditions. The cultivars WSPF, Beauregard, L 18 and NG 7570 were the most susceptible while cv. L 117 was highly tolerant, and the rest were moderately tolerant. Four fungicides (Chlorothalonil 720 g/L a. i, carbendazim 500 g/L a. i, mancozeb 750 g/L a. i and <b>zyban</b> (Thiophanate-methyl and Mancozeb = 156 g/kg-thiophanate –methyl a. i & 640 g/kg mancozeb a. i) were compared for efficacy in total inhibition of fungal growth (EC 100) in vitro against the three Fusarium isolates. These fungicide concentrations were then used as pre- and post-inoculation applications for control of wilt on sweet potato plants under glasshouse conditions. Carbendazim and <b>zyban</b> were effective both as curative and protectant fungicides whilst Chlorothalonil and mancozeb performed well as protectant fungicides.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Smoking {{cessation}} {{of patients with}} cancer can improve treatment efficacy and survival. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a motivational interviewing intervention increased successful smoking cessation attempts of patients with cancer attending a South Australian public hospital, as compared with usual care. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was used to study 137 patients with mixed cancer sites, including 74 intervention patients and 63 control patients. The motivational interviewing intervention was delivered over a 3 -month period. The intervention included a visit with a smoking cessation counselor, provision of smoking cessation booklets, nicotine replacement therapy, family advice to quit, and an in-person or telephone follow-up conversation. RESULTS: At the 6 -month follow-up visit, an intention-to-treat analysis found no difference in biochemically confirmed 3 -month prevalence quit rates between the intervention (5 %) and control (6 %) groups. A sensitivity analysis using more lenient criteria indicated quit rates of 29 % for the intervention group and 18 % {{for the control group}} (p =. 32).

40|$|Bupropion is a {{clinically}} available drug product, {{marketed as}} Wellbutrin and <b>Zyban.</b> Bupropion is a norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor used for major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and smoking cessation. A single dose bioequivalence (BE) study was performed for generic versions of bupropion {{and the name}} brand product, Wellbutrin. Due to dose related seizures associated with the 300 mg dose, BE studies with the 150 mg dose was extrapolated to the 300 mg dose. However, after complaints of lack of efficacy and adverse effects, the FDA conducted a pilot study on one generic (Budeprion 300 XL) with Wellbutrin 300 XL where {{it was found that}} some of the 300 mg generic formulations were bioinequivalent.

We compared the relative contribution of the two metabolic pathways of bupropion (by cytochrome P 450 2 B 6 and carbonyl reductase) in the subcellular fractions of liver and intestine, investigated the difference of bupropion’s metabolism in both liver and intestines, and identified which carbonyl reductases might be responsible for bupropion’s metabolism.

40|$|Background: During recent years, {{there have}} been many {{advances}} in different types of pharmacological and non-pharmacological tobacco control treatments. In this study, we aimed to identify the most effective smoking cessation methods used in quit based upon a review of the literature. Methods: We did a search of PubMed, limited to English publications from 2000 to 2012. Two trained reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts and full texts of articles after a pilot inter-rater reliability assessment which was conducted by the author (GH). The total number of papers and their conclusions including recommendation of that method (positive) or not supporting (negative) was computed for each method. The number of negative papers was subtracted from the number of positive ones for each method. In cases of inconsistency between the two reviewers, these were adjudicated by author. Results: Of the 932 articles that were critically assessed, 780 studies supported quit smoking methods. In 90 studies, the methods were not supported or rejected and in 62 cases the methods were not supported. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), Champix and <b>Zyban</b> with 352, 117 and 71 studies respectively were the most supported methods and e-cigarettes and non-Nicotine medications with one case were the least supported methods.

40|$|Abstract Smoking {{has been}} {{associated}} with several concerns in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm delivery and stillbirth. Unfortunately, approximately 12 % of the pregnant population continue to smoke cigarettes, suggesting a need for additional therapy beyond behavioural change. This paper reviews the literature on the use of nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion (<b>Zyban</b> ®) in the pregnant human population, the pharmacokinetics of nicotine in the pregnant woman, and current guidelines for smoking cessation for pregnant patients. There are currently four studies that have investigated the use of nicotine patch, three for nicotine gum, and registry and preliminary reports for bupropion. These studies did not show any adverse pregnancy outcomes with the use of pharmacological aid for smoking cessation. All the nicotine replacement therapy studies, {{with the exception of one}} randomized-controlled nicotine patch trial had small sample sizes and looked at short-term use of drug in the third trimester. Two studies have examined the pharmacokinetics of nicotine in the pregnant woman. The results from these studies reveal greater nicotine metabolism in pregnant individuals who continue to smoke during pregnancy. Current guidelines from several organizations uniformly recommend that Nicotine Replacement Therapy should be considered if non-pharmacological therapies have been unsuccessful. Bupropion is recommended in pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks. There is a need for further studies on the safety and effectiveness of Nicotine Replacement therapy and bupropion in pregnancy. However, considering the current research and guidelines, pharmacological cessation aids should be considered if non-pharmacological therapies have not been effective. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine smoking {{cessation}} rates among smokers with AMI to determine whether bupropion, started in-hospital, is safe and can improve cessation rates at 1 year. BackgroundBupropion doubles quit rates in otherwise healthy smokers and patients with stable cardiovascular disease. Although 2 previous trials examined the use of bupropion in patients hospitalized with acute cardiovascular disease, these studies have been inconclusive with respect to its safety and efficacy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). MethodsWe conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in smokers hospitalized with AMI. Participants received bupropion or placebo for 9 weeks and were followed for 12 months. Both groups received low-intensity counseling. Point prevalence abstinence was assessed by 7 -day recall and biochemical validation of expired carbon monoxide. ResultsA total of 392 patients were randomized (mean age 53. 9 ± 10. 3 years); 83. 5 % were male; 64. 9 % had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). Patients smoked a mean of 23. 2 ± 10. 6 cigarettes/day for a mean of 32. 9 ± 12. 4 years. At 12 months, point prevalence abstinence rates were 37. 2 % in the bupropion group and 32. 0 % in the placebo group (p = 0. 33; % difference after adjusting for between center differences 3. 9 %). Continuous abstinence rates were 26. 8 % and 22. 2 %, respectively (p = 0. 34). Major adverse cardiac event rates were similar (13. 0 % vs. 11. 0 %, respectively; p = 0. 64). ConclusionsTwo-thirds of patients return to smoking by 12 months after AMI. Bupropion is well tolerated and seems to be safe to use in the immediate post-AMI period. However, bupropion is not effective for smoking cessation in patients post-AMI.

40|$|Background: Tobacco {{smoking is}} the leading {{preventable}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in Australia and other developed countries. Of the pharmacological aids that are available for smoking cessation, bupropion (<b>Zyban</b> SR) is eligible for public reimbursement on the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), whereas nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is not. Information on the cost-effectiveness and financial impact of public reimbursement of these strategies can better inform debate about their inclusion or exclusion in public reimbursement schemes. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of bupropion and NRT, and the potential financial impact of public reimbursement of NRT in Australia. Design: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a deterministic Markov model, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted over a lifetime as the outcome measure. Population: Current smokers, motivated to quit, in Australia in 2000. Interventions: (1) NRT; (2) bupropion; and (3) a combined strategy using bupropion as the first-line treatment and NRT in those who fail to quit smoking or have adverse reactions to bupropion. Results: Quitting smoking can increase life expectancy of current smokers by 1 - 7. 6 years depending on age at cessation and sex. Providing bupropion to current smokers who are motivated to quit would cost A$ 7900 (95 % uncertainty interval A$ 6000 to A$ 10 500) for each DALY averted; NRT patches would cost A$ 17 000 (A$ 9000 to A$ 28 000) for each DALY averted, with similar results even if used as a second-line treatment following initial failure to quit using bupropion. If 6 % of current smokers were to use NRT following inclusion on the PBS, this would result in an annual cost of A$ 40 - 110 million to the PBS depending on the listed price. Conclusions: Compared with other drugs included on the PBS, bupropion and NRT are both highly costeffective smoking cessation interventions, and including NRT on the PBS would have a moderate financial impact. Given the sizeable health burden of smoking, and the large individual benefits of quitting smoking, increasing the availability of alternative aids and uptake of these strategies through public reimbursement would be a positive and rational step towards further reducing tobacco-related disease burden in Australia and other countries where NRT is currently not subsidised...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{bupropion}} hydrochloride sustained release (<b>Zyban)</b> has heralded {{a major change}} in the options available for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. Bupropion is a selective re-uptake inhibitor of dopamine and noradrenalin which prevents or reduces cravings and other features of nicotine withdrawal. Bupropion is a useful oral and non-nicotine form of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. For this review a total of 221 papers were reviewed plus poster presentations. This review examines in detail original clinical trials on efficacy, categorised according to whether they were acute treatment trials in healthy smokers; studies in specific populations such as people with depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cardiovascular disease; or relapse prevention studies. Overall, these studies in varying populations comprising over four thousand subjects, showed bupropion consistently produces a positive effect on smoking cessation outcomes. The evidence highlights the major public health role that bupropion has in smoking cessation. The methodological issues of published clinical trials reporting one year outcomes were examined in detail including: completeness of follow-up; loss to follow-up; intention to treat analysis; blindness of assessment; and validation of smoking status. The review discusses contraindications, adverse effects, dose and overdose, addictive potential, and the role of bupropion in reducing cessation-related weight gain. Bupropion combined with or compared to other pharmacotherapies (nicotine patch; nortriptyline) is considered. Impressive evidence exists for the use of bupropion in smoking cessation among difficult patients who are hard-core smokers such as those with cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and depression. Bupropion reduces withdrawal symptoms as well as weight gain and is effective for smoking cessation for people with and without a history of depression or alcoholism. Serious side effects of bupropion use are rare. The major safety issue with bupropion is risk of seizures (estimated at approximately 0. 1 %) and it should not be prescribed to patients with a current seizure disorder or any history of seizures. In clinical trials of bupropion for smoking cessation no seizures were reported. Allergic reactions occur at a rate of approximately 3 % and minor adverse effects are common including dry mouth and insomnia...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Bupropion is a {{norepinephrine}} and dopamine reuptake inhibitor that {{is currently}} indicated for use as an antidepressant (Wellbutrin), a smoking cessation aid (<b>Zyban)</b> and a weight loss therapy in combination with naltrexone (Contrave). Bupropion is also the preferred sensitive in vivo CYP 2 B 6 substrate recommended by the FDA (U. S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), 2012). Efavirenz, the only other CYP 2 B 6 sensitive substrate, is a time dependent inhibitor (Bumpus et al., 2006) and inducer (Kharasch et al., 2012) of CYP 2 B 6, both of which limit its usefulness. Yet, despite its numerous clinical and research applications, there are many gaps in our knowledge of bupropion pharmacokinetics. First of all, bupropion elimination pathways {{have yet to be}} fully characterized. Secondly, bupropion causes strong in vivo CYP 2 D 6 inhibition, yet the source of the interaction has not been identified. The goal of this project was to characterize the metabolism of bupropion and elucidate the quantitative aspects of CYP 2 D 6 interaction. Finally, using our knowledge of bupropion metabolism, changes in CYP 2 B 6 and CYP 2 C 19 activity during pregnancy were assessed by evaluating the changes in bupropion PK during pregnancy. Because less than 30 % of the bupropion dose is reportedly recovered as bupropion, OH-bupropion, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion and their conjugates (Welch et al., 1987), additional metabolites were isolated from human urine and characterized via MS/MS, NMR and UV to allow for full characterization of bupropion elimination. Three novel metabolites 4 -OH-bupropion, erythro- 4 -OH-hydrobupropion, and threo- 4 ’-OH-hydrobupropion were isolated and identified. The relative contribution of each elimination pathway was assessed through in vitro incubations in human liver S 9 fractions or recombinant P 450. CYP 2 B 6 and CYP 2 C 19 were found to be quantitatively minor elimination pathways, contributing to only 23 and 5 % of total bupropion clearance. The majority of bupropion is cleared via reduction to threohydrobupropion (66 %) and erythrohydrobupropion (6 %). To elucidate the cause of the bupropion-CYP 2 D 6 interaction, the inhibition potential the individual stereoisomers of bupropion and OH-bupropion was investigated but these stereoisomers were not predicted to account for the observed magnitude of the in vivo interaction. However, bupropion and all of its metabolites were found to significantly downregulate CYP 2 D 6 on the basis of activity and mRNA levels. Inclusion of downregulation into static predictions resulted in accurate predictions of the observed drug interaction. To evaulate the effects of pregnancy on bupropion pharmacokinetics, plasma concentrations and urine amounts of bupropion and its metabolites were measured both during pregnancy and post partum in 5 subjects. While plasma levels of bupropion and its metabolites remained steady, a significant two-fold change in OH-bupropion formation clearance was observed in the third trimester, when compared to postpartum. This result suggested that CYP 2 B 6 is substantially induced in pregnancy and thus caution should be exercised when prescribing CYP 2 B 6 substrates to pregnant women...|$|E
