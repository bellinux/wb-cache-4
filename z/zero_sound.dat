5000|$|In {{underwater}} acoustics, {{speed of}} sound depends on pressure (hence depth), temperature, and salinity of seawater, thus leading to vertical speed gradients {{similar to those that}} exist in atmospheric acoustics. However, when there is a <b>zero</b> <b>sound</b> speed gradient, values of sound speed have the same [...] "isospeed" [...] in all parts of a given water column (there is no change in sound speed with depth).

50|$|In {{order to}} {{reconcile}} quantum mechanics with black holes, Chapline theorized that a phase transition in {{the phase of}} space occurs at the event horizon. He based his ideas on the physics of superfluids. As a column of superfluid grows taller, at some point, density increases, slowing down the speed of sound, so that it approaches zero. However, at that point, quantum physics makes sound waves dissipate their energy into the superfluid, so that the <b>zero</b> <b>sound</b> speed condition is never encountered.|$|E

In the normal phase, we obtain <b>zero</b> <b>sound</b> as a low-lying collective mode in the particle-hole (vector) channel.

[...] The first radio transmitters, called spark gap transmitters, transmitted information by wireless telegraphy, using different length pulses of carrier wave to spell out text messages in Morse code.

For sufficiently high temperatures, the <b>zero</b> <b>sound</b> completely disappears, and the low energy physics is dominated by an emergent diffusive mode.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present results}} {{of a series of}} {{experiments}} performed on LiBr, 6 H 20 from room temperature down to 172 K ≈ 1. 2 Tg. These ultrasound, Brillouin and depolarized light scattering, and transient grating experiments show that, above 215 K, this solution behaves like supercooled water: its <b>zero</b> frequency <b>sound</b> velocity C 0 continuously decreases with decreasing temperature, and the reorientational dynamics of the water molecules can be directly detected at some temperatures of this domain. Conversely, below 215 K, a new regime sets in, where the apparent C 0 is practically temperature independent and where a β, Arrenhius like, relaxation process coexists with the usual, Vogel-Fulcher like, α relaxation process of the supercooled liquid. These results are similar to those recently obtained in LiCl, 6 H 2 O. The onset of the new regime is possibly due to an increase of the interaction of the water molecules with a neighboring Li+ ion when lowering the temperature. We also compare our results with published dielectric data on water solutions of glass forming polyalcohols.
