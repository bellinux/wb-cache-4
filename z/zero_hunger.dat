Para isso, procurou realizar uma discussão prévio sobre fome, política social e cidadania, que subsidia, posteriormente, um estudo das principais políticas de combate à fome implementadas no país. Este estudo buscou apontar as principais características dessas políticas, identificando, preliminarmente, que concepções de cidadania – “cidadania regulada”, “cidadania invertida” e “cidadania universal” – essas políticas estão associadas, além de apresentar, especificamente, alguns aspectos do Programa Fome Zero, referentes ao seu arranjo institucional, às suas ações estruturais, específicas e locais e aos seus canais institucionais de participação e de controle social, durante os seus dois primeiros anos de implementação.

Safe drinking water and hygienic toilets protect people from disease and enable societies to be productive.

A study from 2016 showed how sanitation, when done with a resource recovery and reuse focus can contribute towards achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs, especially in an urban context. Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater like nutrients, water and energy contributes towards achieving Goal 12 (sustainable consumption and production) and Goal 2 (<b>zero</b> <b>hunger)</b> while ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities), Goal 1 (no poverty) and Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth).|$|E
50|$|Rousseff {{proposed}} {{to accelerate the}} goals of universalizing the access to electricity, which had a deadline of 2015, suggesting that 1.4 million rural households would get electricity access by 2006. She {{argued that it was}} a social inclusion goal that should be a part of Fome Zero, (<b>Zero</b> <b>Hunger)</b> and that {{it was not possible to}} assume that such a program would provide a financial return. During the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, a similar program, called Luz no Campo (Rural Electrification), was created to encourage agribusiness providing the funding by the recipient. The goal of the program was to provide electricity to over a million households, but as of early 2003 only half of them had been electrified. According to Rousseff, the results of this program were higher in states where local governments subsidized it for the population. She defended, then, a program heavily subsidized by the federal government, which should not only subsidize, but cover the costs for the universalization of electricity. The subsidy, however, should be for the consumer, and not for the electric companies.|$|E
5000|$|Brazil is {{the largest}} country in South America, and {{is known to have}} a low to {{moderate}} poverty rate. Poverty in Brazil is more focused in the north-eastern region of the country: 60% of poor people live there, and the majority of them are of Afro-Brazilian heritage. Over 8.9 million Brazilians live on less than $2 a day. After the macroeconomic stabilization {{in the second half of}} the 1990s, different Brazilian administrations have increasingly addressed the issue of poverty. The Fome Zero (<b>Zero</b> <b>Hunger)</b> and Brasil Sem Miséria (Brazil without Poverty) programmes have lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty. The former served as an umbrella programme for multiple conditional cash transfer initiative Bolsa Familia. All three programmes were established under the Workers Party governments. The latter was instrumental in achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) of reducing extreme poverty in Brazil, with Brazil surpassing the target The poverty headcount in 2012 stood at 9%, down from 21% in 2005 and 34% in 1996. The rate of extreme poverty was 3.6% in 2012 compared to 13.4% in 1990. In 2014 Brazil managed to exit FAO's world map of malnutrition. http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/brazil ...|$|E
5000|$|The Fome Zero Program is {{a federal}} program aimed {{increasing}} food and nutrition security in rural and urban poor communities. Its main strategy was to connect local food producers with local markets, especially in rural areas, through inter-setorrialidade (inter-agency cooperation). It was instituted in 2001 {{against the backdrop of}} increasing recognition for family farmers in Brazilian agrarian policies, and a consequence of 20 years of mobilizing by actors at different levels of society for policy change. The Program is built on four axes: food access, strengthening family farming, income generation and articulation, mobilization and social control. Family farmers play a large role in the Program's food security goals: the Family Farming Food Acquisition Program (PAA), the National School Meal Program (Pnae) and the Bolsa Família Program (Family Grant Cash Transfer [...] ) were implementations that aimed to encourage family farm production of staple foods through cash and program incentives, facilitate distribution of food to families and schools, and also provide conditional health care and social assistance to 42 million vulnerable Brazilians. Despite praise for the <b>Zero</b> <b>Hunger</b> Program, federal evaluation of the impact of measures such as the National School Meal Program on family farmer production and nutrition of schoolchildren have been limited, given the challenges of assessing decentralized implementation of the policy even at municipal levels. Furthermore, the Brazilian government has been cautious and controlled public and international access to the assessment reports of a number of programs, including the report for the Bolsa Família'''' program.|$|E
5000|$|Purchase for Progress (P4P) is a [...] {{initiative}} of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), involving over 500 partnerships, including Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, FAO, ACDI/VOCA, TechnoServe and others. Launched in September 2008 as a five-year pilot, P4P sought to explore programming and procurement modalities with the greatest potential to stimulate agricultural and market development in ways that maximized benefits to smallholder farmers. The program, largely developed by the eleventh Executive Director of the WFP, Josette Sheeran, arose as the WFP desired to purchase food {{in a way that}} was part of the “solution to hunger.” These efforts are aligned with recommendations issued by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that call for an establishment of programs in support of socially vulnerable groups. and to the <b>Zero</b> <b>Hunger</b> Challenge launched by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Special UN Reporter 2012-2014, Olivier De Schutter, claimed that public procurement systems favour economically-strong bidders, thus excluding smallholder farmers. His conclusion was that public procurement schemes supportive of smallholders could have [...] "powerful impacts on the reduction of rural poverty." [...] P4P is built upon this very principle as it enables low-income farmers to supply food to the WFP's operations. Eventually the transaction can be regulated by a forward contract, with the farmer agreeing in selling in the future (up to three years) a certain amount of output at a fixed price. Essentially, the P4P program aims to create a wide and sophisticate market for commodities in developing countries.|$|E
