Laser interferometer is used to test X, Y, <b>Z</b> <b>axis's</b> positioning accuracy, repeat positioning accuracy and reverse gap. The test is done taking 80 days as the period. The accuracy test results is analyzed.

25|$|Rotations {{around the}} x, y and z axes are called {{principal}} rotations. Rotation around any axis {{can be performed}} by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the y axis, and followed by a rotation around the <b>z</b> <b>axis.</b> That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.|$|E

25|$|Given a curve {{contained}} on the x-y plane, its {{tangent vector}} T is also contained on that plane. Its binormal vector B can be naturally postulated {{to coincide with}} the normal to the plane (along the <b>z</b> <b>axis).</b> Finally, the curve normal can be found completing the right-handed system, N = B × T. This form is well-defined even when the curvature is zero; for example, the normal to a straight line on a plane will be perpendicular to the tangent, all co-planar.|$|E
25|$|A {{material}} is termed uniaxial {{when it has}} a single direction of symmetry in its optical behavior, which we term the optic axis. It {{also happens to be}} the axis of symmetry of the index ellipsoid (a spheroid in this case). The index ellipsoid could still be described according to the refractive indices, nα, nβ and nγ, along three coordinate axes, however in this case two are equal. So if nα = nβ corresponding to the x and y axes, then the extraordinary index is nγ corresponding to the <b>z</b> <b>axis,</b> which is also called the optic axis in this case.|$|E
25|$|Focusing {{the light}} beam {{to a point}} {{on the surface of}} the sample under test, and {{recombining}} the reflected light with the reference will yield an interferogram with sample information corresponding to a single A-scan (<b>Z</b> <b>axis</b> only). Scanning of the sample can be accomplished by either scanning the light on the sample, or by moving the sample under test. A linear scan will yield a two-dimensional data set corresponding to a cross-sectional image (X-Z axes scan), whereas an area scan achieves a three-dimensional data set corresponding to a volumetric image (X-Y-Z axes scan), also called full-field OCT.|$|E

25|$|So far {{all points}} in the 3D world have been {{represented}} in a camera centered coordinate system, that is, a coordinate system which has its origin at the camera center (the location of the pinhole of a pinhole camera). In practice however, the 3D points may be represented in terms of coordinates relative to an arbitrary coordinate system (X1',X2',X3'). Assuming that the camera coordinate axes (X1,X2,X3) and the axes (X1',X2',X3') are of Euclidean type (orthogonal and isotropic), there is a unique Euclidean 3D transformation (rotation and translation) between the two coordinate systems. In other words, the camera is not necessarily at the origin looking along the <b>z</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|For various formulaic purposes, {{physicists}} divide rotation {{into three}} components, assigning portions to x, y and <b>z</b> <b>axis</b> that are mutually perpendicular. For bowling, the x-axis {{can be assigned}} to a line that {{is parallel to the}} foul line, the y-axis to the line parallel to the boards, and the z-axis to the vertical. Forward-roll is rotation about the x-axis, side-roll is rotation about the y-axis and mid-roll (or spin) is rotation about the z-axis. The pure full-roller delivery is a combination of forward- and side-roll only. Semi-rollers include spin. Spinners may have very little side roll. In a very strict physics sense, a ball may be delivered with rotation, but usually not in a roll, because that would imply complete traction. The technique of the great majority of bowlers involves a delivery that starts the ball in a skid that evolves into a roll that hooks into the pins.|$|E
500|$|Spin can be {{represented}} by a vector whose length is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant ħ (pronounced [...] "h bar"). For quarks, a measurement of the spin vector component along any axis can only yield the values +ħ/2 or −ħ/2; for this reason quarks are classified as spin- particles. The component of spin along a given axis – by convention the <b>z</b> <b>axis</b> – is often denoted by an up arrow ↑ for the value + and down arrow ↓ for the value −, placed after the symbol for flavor. For example, an up quark with a spin of + along the <b>z</b> <b>axis</b> is denoted by u↑.|$|E

Four test orbits of a trans-Plutonian planet have been integrated forward for four million years {{in order to determine the}} effects of such a body on {{the stability of}} the Neptune–Pluto 3:2 resonance. Planets beyond Pluto with masses of 0.1 and 1.0 Earth masses in orbits at 48.3 and 75.5 AU, respectively, do not disturb the 3:2 resonance.

30|$|However, {{it could}} {{be seen from the}} above {{analysis}} that, owning to the influence of the included angle α between the radar sight and target axis, the actually extracted position information of scattering point was not authentic position information, but the compression of real position, namely, the position coordinate extracted along the axis direction (namely along <b>axis</b> <b>z)</b> was about cosα times of the real position coordinate, while the position coordinate which was vertical to spin axis (namely along axes x and y) was about sinα times of the real position coordinate. Therefore, the smaller α was, the closer the coordinate along <b>axis</b> <b>z</b> would be.
