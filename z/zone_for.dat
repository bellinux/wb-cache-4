5|$|After World War I, Puerto Ricans {{fought on}} foreign shores {{as members of}} the United States Marine Corps. Civil war broke out in Nicaragua during the first months of 1926, and upon the request of the Nicaraguan government, 3,000 U.S. Marines were sent ashore to {{establish}} a neutral <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> the protection of American citizens.

On the second {{play of the}} drive, Noel {{completed}} a 55-yard pass to Andre Davis, who ran into the end <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech regained the lead, 1713, with 40seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's punt {{rolled into}} the end <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> a touchback, and with 1:28 {{remaining}} in the game, Virginia Tech began the final drive on its own 20-yard line. Any tension was soon defused by the Georgia defense, which forced threeincompletions and a sack. Glennon's attempt at a Hail Mary pass fell short, giving Georgia the win with a final score of 31–24.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the occupation, the Allies {{controlled}} traffic between the zones to manage the flow of refugees and prevent the escape of former Nazi officials and intelligence officers. These controls were gradually lifted in the Western zones, but were tightened between Western and Soviet zones in 1946 to stem a flow of economic and political refugees from the Soviet zone. Between October 1945 and June 1946, 1.6million Germans left the Soviet <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> the west.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} opener against the Chicago Bears, Johnson caught a pass with 31seconds left in {{regulation}} in the end <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> {{what looked like a}} game-winning touchdown. However, referee Gene Steratore ruled the catch incomplete, saying that Johnson had not maintained possession of the ball through the entire process of the catch. The Lions lost the game by a score of 1914.|$|E
5|$|Much like Week1 in Chicago {{five years}} back, in Week4 at Seattle, Johnson was {{involved}} in another controversial play. This time, late in the fourth quarter, Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor punched {{the ball out of}} Johnson's hands while he was trying to score a late go-ahead touchdown. Linebacker K. J. Wright then batted the ball out of the end <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> a touchback. The NFL later admitted the referees should have penalized Wright for illegal batting. The Seahawks won the game by a score of 1310.|$|E

Three {{consecutive}} incomplete passes later, Boston College punted, ending their sixth three {{and out of the}} game. Following the kick, Tech started at its 27-yard line. On first down, the Hokies ran an end-around for five yards, then the quarter came to an end. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech led, 24–7.|$|E
5|$|The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a {{grouping}} of conservation and environmental bodies, divide {{the coast and}} its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes. Blakeney Point, along with Holme Dunes and Holkham dunes, {{is considered to be}} a sensitive habitat already suffering from visitor pressure, and therefore designated as a red-zone area with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. The rest of the reserve is placed in the orange <b>zone,</b> <b>for</b> locations with fragile habitats but less tourism pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Florida State in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down and five yards. On the first play of the quarter, Rix {{was hit by a}} Virginia Tech defender, but not before he released a 77-yard pass to Walker, who ran into the end <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown. The extra point try was good, and Florida State regained the lead, 2017, with 14:48 remaining in the game.|$|E

Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.|$|E
5|$|The kick bounced out {{of bounds}} at the Clemson 44-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense {{returned}} to the field. On the first play, Vick attempted a pass into the end zone. The throw was intercepted by Clemson defender Robert Carswell, who downed {{the ball in the}} end <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> a touchback. The interception was the final play of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech in the lead, 3413.|$|E
5|$|Trailing by 11, {{and with}} time running down, Texas needed to score quickly. Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. During the sack, Brown fumbled, {{and the ball}} {{was picked up by}} Virginia Tech's Jim Baron who returned it into the end <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech expanded its lead to 2810 with 5:06 remaining in the game.|$|E
