This transition zone plays {{a pivotal role}} in relaxing load transfer between tendon and bone, and serves as a boundary between otherwise structurally and functionally distinct tissue types. Calcium and zinc are believed to play important roles in the normal growth, mineralization, and repair <b>of</b> the fibrocartilage <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> bone–tendon junction (BTJ). However, spatial distributions of calcium and zinc at the fibrocartilage <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> BTJ and their distribution–function relationship are not totally understood. Thus, synchrotron radiation-based micro X-ray fluorescence analysis (SR-μXRF) in combination with backscattered electron imaging (BEI) was employed to characterize the distributions of calcium and zinc at the fibrocartilage <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> rabbit patella–patellar tendon complex (PPTC). For the first time, the unique distributions of calcium and zinc at the fibrocartilage <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> the PPTC were clearly mapped by this method. The distributions of calcium and zinc at the fibrocartilage <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> the PPTC were inhomogeneous. A significant accumulation of zinc was exhibited in the transition region between UF and CF.

The highest calcium content (43. 14 times of that of patellar tendon) was in the transitional <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> calcified fibrocartilage region and the patella, approximately 69 μm from the location with the highest zinc content. This study indicated, for the first time, that there is a differential distribution of calcium and zinc at the fibrocartilage <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> PPTC.

Slow earthquakes, mainly recorded in 1997 and occasionally later, have probably been caused by the activity of a shallow fault system located near the interferometers. Until now only one tremor episode characterized by low frequency content and duration of several hours has been detected in January 2004, without any correlations with the occurrence of slow or regular earthquakes.

Classification is carried out on small cluster of 14 field samples. Ground truth is verified and classified by comparing with Hyperion data. REP is different for different stressed condition of crops and shows healthy and diseased crop condition. Nutritional stresses, diseases, drought of plants are detected using REP. Stressed and healthy field of mulberry are estimated by calculating REP using maximum first derivative, linear interpolation, linear extrapolation method. Finally REP is compared using above methods.

The average K_s-band seeing and sky background for the survey are 1. 38 arcsec and 20. 1 mag, respectively. The detection rate as a function of stellar density and dust extinction is found to depend mainly on the HI mass of the HI detected galaxies, which in principal correlates with the NIR brightness of the spiral galaxies. The measured isophotal magnitudes are of sufficient accuracy (errors ∼ 0. 02 mag) to be used in a Tully-Fisher analysis. In the final NIR catalogue, 285 galaxies have both IRSF and 2 MASS photometry (180 HIZOA plus 105 bright 2 MASX galaxies). The K_s-band isophotal magnitudes presented in this paper agree, within the uncertainties, with those reported in the 2 MASX catalogue.

RESULTS: Seventy-eight adults Aedes albopictus {{were collected}} in Bangui and Bayanga. Mosquito biting rate and abundance were, respectively, 0. 33 - 1. 70 bites/human/hour and 14. 6 % in Bangui and 0. 04 - 0. 16 and 0. 4 % in Bayanga. Larval sampling revealed a large diversity of water container harbouring the species in Bangui, Bayanga, Nola and Salo including unused containers, old tires, vehicle carcasses, buckets, barrels and stem of bamboo.

We developed a simple assay to investigate nematode response to chemical gradients that uses Pluronic F- 127, a synthetic block copolymer that, as a 23 % aqueous solution, forms a liquid at low temperature and a gel at room temperature. Test chemicals are put into a modified pipette tip, or ‘chemical dispenser,’ and dispensers are inserted into the gel in which nematodes have been dispersed. Meloidogyne hapla is attracted to pH gradients formed by acetic acid and several other Brønsted acids and aggregates between pH 4. 5 and 5. 4. While this pH range was attractive to all tested root-knot nematode strains and species, the level of aggregation depended on the species/strain assessed. For actively growing roots, the pH at the root surface is most acidic at the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> elongation. This <b>observation</b> is consistent with the idea that low pH is an attractant for nematodes. Root-knot nematodes have been reported to be attracted to carbon dioxide, but our experiments suggest that the observed attraction may be due to acidification of solutions by dissolved CO 2 rather than to CO 2 itself.

Using {{different}} {{thickness of}} pure nickel as interlayer, {{hot isostatic pressing}} (HIP) diffusion bonding between TC 4 prealloyed powders and GCr 15 bearing steel have been performed at the temperature of 850 ℃, under pressure of 150 MPa for 2 hrs. The diffusion bonding joints gained have been observed and analyzed by optical microscopy, electron microprobe and X-ray diffraction. The result <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> by optical microcopy indicates that, at the interface of TC 4 and interlayer, many connecting arcs have been formed, and these arcs gradually disappear with thickness of pure nickel increasing. The result <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> by electron microprobe reveals that, {{during the process of}} HIP diffusion bonding, nickel atoms have a short diffusion distance in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> GCr 15, whereas they diffuse a comparatively long distance in <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> TC 4.

Another method is to establish the phase relationships of these rocks and their possible sources under various conditions of pressure, temperature, volatile content, etc., and apply the results to a petrogenetic model that is also consistent with isotope and trace-element geochemistry. This technique has been applied to the relationship between planetary mantles and basalts, and the formation of andesites and more siliceous rocks in subduction <b>zones.</b> <b>Observations</b> <b>of</b> rocks from Archean terranes on Earth reveal that the most prominent types are komatiites, tholeiites, tonalites and trondhjemites (grey gneisses), potassic granites (pink gneisses), and rare syenites. Early magmatic activity was dominated by the production of basalts which were subsequently followed, and intruded by, large volumes of the tonalite-trondhjemite series magmas. Approximately 80...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{and approach}} for identifying "statistically stable" central tendencies {{in the frequency}} distributions of time series <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> background atmospheric pollutants. The data were collected as daily mean values of concentrations of sulfur dioxide and suspended particulate matter at five monitoring stations [...] three in the USSR, one in Norway, and one in Sweden. The approach uses statistical techniques and methods for constructing multimodal distributions. The problem {{is divided into two}} parts: first, a decomposition <b>of</b> the <b>observations</b> in order to obtain a description of each season separately and second, an investigation of this description in order to derive statistically stable characteristics of the entire data set. The main hypothesis of the investigation is that dispersion processes interact {{in such a way that}} in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> influence of one process (near its mode) the "tails" of the other process are not observed. This permits illumination of interrelations between the physics and the chemistry of the atmosphere...|$|R
