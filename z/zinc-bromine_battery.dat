During charging zinc is electroplated onto conductive electrodes, {{while at the same time}} bromine is formed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Wind {{energy is}} a {{promising}} {{alternative energy source}} due to its environmental, economic, and social benefits and, as such, has garnered public support and government incentives for its development and implementation. With {{the growing number of}} wind parks in Oregon, a life cycle assessment (LCA) study for a representative new wind park is needed to investigate the potential impacts on the environment. One of the major drawbacks of wind energy generation is its variability due to the stochastic nature of wind. To make wind energy a more reliable source, wind energy generation should be supplemented with controllable energy generation or storage. Thus, the aim of this research is to improve the understanding of the effects of supplemental energy systems on the environmental impacts of wind energy systems. First, the environmental impact of a single wind turbine is examined from raw material extraction to the end of life stage. Research needs are identified to support the assessment of the environmental impacts of wind energy and supplemental energy systems from a life cycle perspective. Next, supplemental electricity generation systems investigated are biomass, hydro, and natural gas electricity generation, and <b>zinc-bromine</b> <b>battery</b> storage. Finally, the results for each system are compared to coal energy generation. It appears that the wind park has lower environmental impact than coal energy generation when paired with any of the complimentary systems investigated. Overall, hydropower appears to be the best option to supplement wind power from an environmental perspective for a potential wind park site in northern Oregon...|$|E
40|$|Battery-powered {{electric}} vehicles (BEVs) are a promising {{part of the}} solutions to urban pollution and global warming. Existing problems of BEVs are short drive range and high cost. Energy and power control strategies in EV propulsion remain a substantial research topic which require further investigation and power electronics {{plays a key role}} in EV development. This thesis studies the control strategies and power electronics for a short range, low cost EV employing high efficiency permanent magnet axial flux brushless dc motor (BDCM). Many of the technologies presented can be used in more general applications. Based on the drive cycle data obtained from an ICE vehicle and its analysis, a novel energy and power management scheme has been proposed. The proposed energy and power management scheme employs the newly developed non-flowing <b>zinc-bromine</b> <b>battery</b> (NFZBB) and ultracapacitors (UCs). NFZBBs are optimized for specific energy, low cost and long life. Ultracapacitors featuring high power density and long life are used to complement the NFZBB to achieve good acceleration performance at low speeds. The thesis shows how combining the two different types of energy storage can optimize the EV propulsion system to achieve high energy for drive range, high power for good acceleration performance, long lifetime, and low cost. A novel multifunctional dc-dc converter topology has been proposed for the overall energy and power control. This single, simple dc-dc converter is used for both the control of the energy which is drawn out of and placed into the ultracapacitors and the speed extension of the BDCM. Several advanced control technologies of BDCM are studied. Zero Voltage Transition (ZVT) soft-switching techniques are utilized in the multifunctional dc-dc converter to achieve high efficiency, reduction of volume and weight, and lower electromagnetic interference (EMI) level.

Bromine itself, {{as well as}} some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. silver bromide for photography). <b>Zinc–bromine</b> <b>batteries</b> are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household scale to industrial scale.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zinc-bromine</b> <b>batteries</b> use {{a liquid}} to {{transport}} the changed particles, which makes them unsuitable for mobile use. A new development, by Thomas Maschmeyer, from the University of Sydney, replaces the liquid with a gel. Gel is neither a liquid nor a solid, but has the advantages of both. Ions can move quicker, decreasing charging time. It is also more efficient, longer lasting, and cheaper than lithium, and the gel is fire retardant. Gelion, which is the spin-off company of Sydney University, is currently developing the battery for commercial use. The company was boosted recently by an $11 million investment from UK renewables group Armstrong Energy. As the batteries are also flexible, they {{can be incorporated into}} the fabric of buildings.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of bromine in a two-phase lectrolyte, consisting of Br 2 dissolved {{in an aqueous}} electrolyte, 2 M ZnBrJ IM ZnC 1 J 3 M KC 1, and Br 2 complexed with (CHD 3 C 2 H~NBr in a polybromide oil, was investigated. An enhancement i the re-duction current at a horizontal electrode (facing upward) in quiescent aqueous electrolyte was observed when small drops (less than 0. 2 cm high) of the bromine-rich polybromide oil {{were placed on the}} electrode surface. An enhancement was also observed when a vertical electrode was gradually immersed through the aqueous electrolyte into the polybromide oil so that part of the electrode was in each of the two phases. The results of a mathematical analysis of the drop profile and the results of the electrochemical study suggested that the bromine-rich polybromide oil provided the high bromine concentration necessary to enhance the reduction current.

40|$|<b>Zinc-bromine</b> <b>batteries</b> {{have long}} been {{considered}} one of the most suitable storage technologies due to their potential long life, deep discharge characteristics and potential low manufacturing cost, as well as very high theoretical specific energy density (~ 440 Wh/kg). However, there are still a number of challenges to their commercial success, including electrode lifetime, electrochemical efficiency and cost. The major purpose of this study is to investigate the property of both zinc and bromine electrodes in zinc bromine flow batteries, and to develop new materials for zinc bromine flow battery electrodes, suitable for utility scale use. Different carbon materials and high density polyethylene-carbon composites have been evaluated through physical and electrochemical methods. Calgon activated carbon, carbon cloth, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and cryogel carbon have been investigated as the electrocatalysts for the bromine/bromide redox couple reaction in the positive half-cell of the zinc bromine redox flow batteries. As for the zinc electrodes, high density polyethylene (HDPE) -carbon black (CB) and HDPE-multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composites have been studied with macroscopic and microscopic techniques. The MWCNTs shows the best performance of the five carbon candidates. The HDPE-CB composite electrode exhibits better zinc deposition than the HDPE-CNT composite electrode due to a lower nucleation overpotential and higher exchange current density. In addition, the interfacial structure of the electrode/electrolyte on the bromine electrode and zinc electrode in zinc bromine electrolyte has been illustrated for the first time using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

40|$|The free {{energies}} of transfer of Hal−, Hal 2 and Hal− 3 from water to acetonitrile—water and propionitrile—water mixtures are reported.

Nitrile-rich compositions strongly favour the formation of Br− 3.

40|$|Future {{sustainable}} energy generation {{technologies such as}} photovoltaic and wind farms require advanced energy storage systems {{on a massive scale}} to make the alternate (green) energy options practical. The daunting requirements of such large-scale energy systems such as long operating and cycle life, safety, and low cost are not adequately met by state-of-the-art energy storage technologies such as vanadium flow cells, lead-acid, and <b>zinc-bromine</b> <b>batteries.</b> Much attention is being paid to redox batteries specifically to the vanadium redox battery (VRB) due to their simplicity, low cost, and good life characteristics compared to other related battery technologies. NASA is currently seeking high-specific- energy and long-cycle-life rechargeable batteries in the 10 -to- 100 -kW range to support future human exploration missions, such as planetary habitats, human rovers, etc. The flow batteries described above are excellent candidates for these applications, as well as other applications that propose to use regenerative fuel cells. A new flow cell technology is proposed based on coupling two novel electrodes in the form of solvated electron systems (SES) between an alkali (or alkaline earth) metal and poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), separated by an ionically conducting separator. The cell reaction involves the formation of such SES with a PAH of high voltage in the cathode, while the alkali (or alkaline earth metal) is reduced from such an MPAH complex in the anode half-cell. During recharge, the reactions are reversed in both electrodes. In other words, the alkali (alkaline earth) metal ion simply shuttles from one M-PAH complex (SES) to another, which are separated by a metal-ion conducting solid or polymer electrolyte separator. As an example, the concept was demonstrated with Li-naphthalene//Li DDQ (DDQ is 2, 3 -Dichloro- 5, 6 -dicyano- 1, 4 -benzoquinone) separated by lithium super ion conductor, either ceramic or polymer (solid polymer or gel polymer) electrolytes. The reactants are Li-naphthalene dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a lithium salt of 1 M LiBF 4 (lithium tetra fluoroborate) in the anode compartment, and DDQ again dissolved in THF and also containing 1 M LiBF 4 salt in the cathode half-cell. The solid electrolyte separator used in the first set of experiments is a ceramic solid electrolyte, available from a commercial source. The open circuit voltage of the cells is close to 3. 0 V, as expected from the individual half-cell voltages of Li-naphthalene and Li-DDQ. Upon discharge, the cell shows steady discharge voltage of 2. 7 V, which confirms that the electrochemical processes do involve lithium ion shuttling from the anodic compartment to the cathode half-cell. The reversibility or rechargeability is demonstrated by charging the partially discharged cells (i. e., with lithium present in the DDQ half). Once again, a steady voltage close to 3. 0 V was observed during charge, indicating that the system is quite reversible. In the subsequent concept-demonstration studies, the ceramic electrolyte has been replaced with a gel polymer electrolyte, e. g., PVDF-HFP (poly vinylene difluoride hexafluoropropene) gel, which has several advantages such as high ionic conductivity (almost comparable to liquid electrolyte and about 2 orders of magnitude better than the ceramic equivalent), lower cost, and possibly higher chemical stability at the anode. In addition, it can be bonded to the electrode by thermal fusion to form membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), as is done in fuel cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of emerging grid scale energy storage technologies offers great potential {{to improve the}} architecture and operation of the electrical grid. This is especially important {{in the face of}} increased reliance on clean, dependable electricity and with the influx of renewable generation and smart grid technology. However, at the present, grid scale energy storage is still in an early, developing stage. This document brings together a broad overview of the sector, including rough revenue estimates for each individually possible application for energy storage, a high level overview including rough cost estimates of each technology and supplier, a more focused look at the actual or possible implementations in the market with rough estimates of the systems' economics in each implementation. Following this is a discussion of notable dynamics and potentially effective strategies, based on current industry conditions and existing academic management frameworks. The investigation was accomplished by leveraging prior research in existing literature, and extending it with first hand discussions with industry leaders and market analysis. It was found that the economics of wholesale load shifting are unattractive for any of the emerging energy storage technologies, but that all of the other higher value implementations considered could be reasonably expected to at least break even financially given proper circumstances and the use of an energy storage technology which suits the implementation well. It was found that lithium ion and <b>zinc-bromine</b> flow <b>batteries</b> are well positioned for near term economically beneficial deployment on the grid. (cont.)

40|$|The <b>zinc-bromine</b> {{redox flow}} <b>battery</b> (RFB) {{is one of}} a very few commercially viable RFB energy storage system capable of {{integration}} with intermittent renewable energy sources to deliver improved energy management. However, due to the volatility of the electrogenerated bromine and potential for its crossover from positive to negative electrolytes, this system requires the use of quaternary ammonium complexes (N-methyl-N-ethylpyrrolidinium, (MEP)) to capture this bromine. This produces an immiscible phase with the Br 2 which requires a complex network of pipes, pumps and automated controls to ensure access to the electroactive material during discharge. In this work, the use of novel quaternary ammonium complexes to capture the electrogenerated bromine but to keep it in the aqueous phase is examined. Three compounds, 1 -(carboxymethyl) pyridine- 1 -ium, 1 -(2 -carboxymethyl) - 1 -methylmorpholin- 1 -ium and 1 -(2 -carboxymethyl) - 1 -methylpyrrolidin- 1 -ium, were found to successfully reduce the volume of the immiscible phase formed on complexing with the polybromide (Brx-) whilst displaying similar enthalpy of vaporisation values as that of MEP. Electrochemical analysis also revealed that these compounds did not impact on the electrode kinetics of the Br-/Brx- reaction indicating that the resulting surface film formed with these compounds behaved as a chemically modified electrode, in contrast to the surface film formed with MEP...|$|R
